<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer him to the statement this morning by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories in which she confirmed that Cabinet reached a conclusion last night about the States' proposed tax sharing arrangement, that there was not much right with the proposal, and that the Prime Minister would be making an announcement today on that matter.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell you what: she gets it correct more often than the mob opposite does, at any rate. It is correct that the Cabinet considered this matter, amongst a number of other matters, until about 1.30 this morning. Where the Minister did not have it correct is that there was no intention on my part or on the Treasurer's to make any detailed comment about the Cabinet decisions last night. But I will say this for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition: it needs to be clearly understood that this issue is to be the subject of discussion between the Commonwealth and the States at the Perth Special Premiers Conference. Let me make it clear that the proposal put to me by Premiers Bannon and Greiner last week was intended to help prepare for those discussions; it was not intended as a substitute for them. They stated clearly to me that the States' present proposal is negotiable. We in the Commonwealth are also finalising the elements of the position that we will take to Perth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, let me say that the Cabinet has considered the paper put to me last Friday by the States, and we have concluded that the present proposal for a `shared national personal income tax' is, for all practical purposes, a State income tax. As such, it is not something which this Government could support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Government is conscious of the States' understandable concern to achieve a greater degree of certainty in the financial resources available to them&mdash;that is an entirely understandable concern&mdash;and we are considering means by which more certainty in Commonwealth disbursements might be achieved.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Resources and relates to petrol pricing and the Government's fuel excise. What taxes are presently raised by the Federal Government from excise on petrol and diesel? Are these taxes high by international standards? How do Australian petrol prices compare with those of our major trading partners? What would be the impact on Australian Government revenues of a substantial reduction in petroleum excise?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2712" SPEAKER="Griffiths The Hon A.G." NAMEID="0H4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="MARIBYRNONG" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable members would be aware, there is currently no sales tax applying to petrol. However, there is a petrol excise which is levied on volume. The excise rate on petrol is currently 25.7c per litre. The excise on petroleum products is expected this financial year to raise in excess of $7.5 billion in revenue&mdash;around $4.3 billion for petrol and $2.5 billion for diesel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Petrol taxation in Australia is very low by international standards; in fact, Australia currently has the second lowest level of petrol taxes and the second lowest petrol prices of the 20 International Energy Agency countries. Only the United States has lower petrol taxes than Australia. Petrol prices in Australia at the moment are about 68c per litre, of which the petrol excise accounts for about 37 per cent. But what are they overseas? In New Zealand petrol prices are close to 80c per litre; in Britain and in Germany they are over 100c per litre; and in Japan they are around 125c per litre. Petrol prices are even higher in countries such as France, Denmark, Ireland, Finland, Portugal, Norway and Sweden. In Italy they are over 170c per litre. Although we would all like to pay less for our petrol, Australia is doing very well relative to our trading partners and the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final part of the honourable member for Fisher's question was: what would be the impact on Government revenues of a substantial reduction in petroleum excise? It depends on the extent of the reduction, of course. As an illustration, last Thursday a report run on Sydney radio 2UE by rural reporter Linda Allen quoted National Party sources as indicating that under the coalition's consumption tax proposals there could be a drop in the price of petrol to as low as 45c per litre. Another 2UE report referred to a drop to less than 50c per litre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of these reports, the Liberal's consumption tax proposals would mean the equivalent of about a 20c per litre reduction in petrol excise. The revenue cost of a 20c in the litre reduction in the excise rate for both petrol and diesel would be around $5.2 billion.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a matter of logic, not a matter of interjection, that means the consumption tax must be set quite high merely to accommodate this proposed action on the petrol front. That in turn leads to a fundamental question: what is the consumption tax rate going to be? It is quite clear that, whatever rate members opposite start with, it will only be the start of an inevitable upward slope as the consumption tax rate goes higher and higher. That is, in the words of the former Leader of the Opposition, as sure as night follows day. But history shows that one cannot trust the Opposition on these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do remind the House that when we discuss these matters of credibility in relation to tax matters&mdash;and the honourable member for Bennelong obviously is very alive to this&mdash;we should remember, `Lies, lies, lies'. When members opposite went to the election all those years ago, they of course made their promises; shortly after the election, they of course broke them all. I suspect that there will be many more headlines just like this one, if the Australian people have to put up with the sorry circumstance of having them in Government. In conclusion, lest the assertions of, in particular, the National Party Leader in the bush are taken at face value, I table the comparative petrol prices and taxes in International Energy Agency countries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are witnessing in this country a campaign now being waged by the Opposition which has as its philosophical core the concept of incentive. So let me define for the House the perfect computer-driven world of the concept of `incentive'. If one is well off, if one has property and privileges, then incentive means a reduced taxation burden and the provision of a capital gains tax rort. In short, incentive is spelt: c-a-r-r-o-t. If, however, one is on a low income, then incentive means a new tax on food, clothing and necessities; an emasculation of essential services; the elimination of programs targeted to benefit those least well off; and the abolition of unemployment benefits. So if one is not a Liberal Party high roller, incentive is spelt s-t-i-c-k or, alternatively, for the National Party people, c-l-u-b.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians well understand that the choice at the next election is not between a pro- or anti-consumption tax party. The choice that Australians face will be between the narrow group of individuals now in control of the Federal Liberal Party, who believe that culture, history, scale, location and individuals can be assumed away, and the Australian Labor Party, committed to further ensuring that reform is advanced in a way which protects those least able to protect themselves.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I get to the stage of having to rely on Professor Geoffrey Blainey as an accurate analyst of what is happening in Australian politics, then I will think that a very sorry state has been reached.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, the suggestions made in the honourable member's question are far from fanciful. I welcome&mdash;and I think most people who understand the tourism industry would welcome&mdash;and certainly agree with the predictions that Korea will be a very significant inbound tourism market for this country. There are a number of reasons why I can make those predictions. First, we have had the introduction of the direct inbound services by Qantas from Korea, coupled with the very successful marketing effort by the Australian Tourist Commission. The direct services and that effort by the Commission will see record numbers of Korean tourists coming to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already we are seeing an increase in arrivals of up to 100 per cent on the figures that we saw last year. Between January and July 1991, 13,200 tourists from Korea came to this country. That figure is up from about 7,800 for the same seven months of 1990. Our growth has been assisted by a number of very significant steps. First, the Australian Tourist Commission was the first national tourism organisation allowed to advertise on Korean television. In May of this year the Australian Tourist Commission began a new campaign on television called `Make Friends with Australia'. That promotion featured Greg Norman and a very successful local television star. The campaign attracted some 52,000 responses to an associated competition that resulted in seven Korean tourists visiting Australia for the very first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total Korean campaign is costing of the order of $1.8m, and that is being assisted by a cooperative marketing effort with Korean Airlines and Qantas to the tune of $200,000. It is important to note that tourism growth in those key markets and those growing markets, such as Korea, is not accidental. It is very much planned and is planned on the basis of detailed research. It is planned also through a coordination of effort between the Australian Tourist Commission and, in this case, the two carriers, Qantas and Korean Airlines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My Department has also recently contributed a tourism perspective to recent air service negotiations&mdash;the Minister for Transport and Communications alluded to that last week&mdash;where we concluded a very successful round of negotiations between Australia and Hong Kong. I hope that that process, which included tourism interests for the first time in the negotiations, will be a continuing process between my Department and the Department of Transport and Communications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall in this period, for the first seven months that we have figures available, given the very slow start we had this year because of the conflict in the Middle East, the inbound tourism numbers to this country are extraordinarily strong. I predict that 1991 will surpass our record year of 1988. For the last three months that we had figures, we had growth of 8 per cent in May, 9 per in June and a 12 per increase in July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the record numbers of visas issued out of those major source countries, there is every indication that we will surpass the figure of 1990, so that this year will continue to be a magnificent year for inbound tourism growth to Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity to confirm the advice that Australia Post has announced. As the honourable member for Prospect indicates, during the last financial year it made a record profit in excess of $144m. That represents an increase of about 100 per cent on the profit that Australia Post made last year. One of the interesting things about this is that it was not brought about as a result of any substantial increase in charges; it was brought about largely as a result of a reduction in costs. Many of those costs were associated with the reduction in employment within Australia Post of about 1,000. That was able to be achieved in the context of the lowest level of industrial disputation within Australia Post since Australia Post was first established in 1975. There was also a significant increase in the quality of customer service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post, under the corporate objectives which this Government has given to it since it became a corporation two years ago, has been increasingly customer oriented. For the sixth successive year, Australia Post has increased the charge of a standard letter by something less than the CPI. That represents a very substantial improvement for Australia Post customers. People on both sides of the Parliament should be able to receive this information with a great deal of enthusiasm and should welcome the information. It really has been an outstanding result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have worked with Australia Post in the development of its corporate strategy. In connection with the performance last year, on every one of those major targets that Australia Post set for itself, it either equalled it or surpassed it. When we are thinking of the sorts of benefits that public sector corporations of this kind can bring to government, the public sector and the national community, we might compare the dividends that Australia Post paid to the Government in the previous financial year of $1m with that paid in the most recent financial year of $25m. The implications and the benefits of that are immediately apparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The return on assets by Australia Post increased from 7.4 per cent in the previous year to 10.7 per cent, if we take into account community service obligations. That is a level which the Government would consider generally to be approaching an appropriate commercial return on investments. I think everyone recognises that Australia Post represents an investment by the total national community, and the national community&mdash;17 million Australians&mdash;are entitled to expect that the return on their investment will be a commercial return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post, under the chairmanship of Maurice Williams and the managing director, Rae Taylor, together with all of the members of the board, from the top management through to all of its employees, has given the type of support we would expect to its commercial responsibilities. Australia Post has a total of something like 40,000 employees over the whole of Australia. It is a very labour-intensive operation. All of those people associated with Australia Post, in any capacity at all, should take a great deal of pride, as we do, in its achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the other highlights that I would like to mention briefly include a productivity improvement of 1.6 per cent; the establishment of a Postal Services Consultative Council, being chaired by the Deputy Chairman of Australia Post, which indicates the seriousness with which that task is being approached; the announcement of an independent monitoring of letter delivery service performance; a decrease of the basic postage rate, as I have said, in real terms for the sixth consecutive year; the commissioning of 14 high-speed electronic mail-sorting machines; the opening of 30 new-look retail post facilities; and the completion of a new network of parcel centres to improve delivery performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that, as a result of this very serious approach which Australia Post has brought to its responsibilities, this level of achievement will continue, and that will confirm the capacity of government business enterprises to undertake commercial exercises of this kind and to measure up well with the type of standards that we often see in the private sector. The Australian people have cause to believe that their investment in Australia Post will continue to be a very substantial one and continue to be a very successful one.</PARA>

Here we have a wholly new form of service which is being aimed at a relatively narrow and highly competitive section of the population, namely, young, fit, intelligent men and women, and it is being presented to them at a time when most of them are focusing on their exams. Yet we have an inquiry rate which is running close to 1,000 a day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of those who have inquired about the Army ready reserves&mdash;this is perhaps in response to the question by the Leader of the National Party&mdash;5,468 have indicated they would want to get full time jobs at the end of their initial one year of training, while 5,956, which is more than half, have indicated that they want to go on to university. So the ready reserves are drawing the interest of a section of the community which is distinctly different from those who traditionally apply for conventional military service&mdash;and I regard that as a very healthy development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that a disproportionately high level of inquiries&mdash;almost 7,000&mdash;have come from the home State of the honourable member for Brisbane, but then Queensland has always been one of our best recruiting grounds. While Queenslanders will not have to move interstate to complete their full time training, the fact is that for many young people being able to leave home is part of the attraction of joining the Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already 114 people have been through the entire enlistment process and have been approved for entry to the ready reserves. That is already about 10 per cent of the number we are looking for for this year. The calibre of the new candidates is such that we will not have any difficulty filling all the positions from those who have already applied, but obviously we are still taking applications so that we are able to pick the very best recruits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Ready Reserve scheme was tailored specifically to appeal to the very people who are now applying in large numbers to join it. The Government went to a lot of trouble to ensure that it was a carefully designed scheme with appropriate incentives and we knew it would be a success. Above all, our confidence in the youth of Australia has been rewarded and the Opposition's cries that the Ready Reserve scheme would never work now have a very hollow ring.</PARA>

If one imagines Australia as a car, it has about 12 years worth of juice in the tank. As it goes into the next century, unless it continues to encourage the exploration and development effort, quite simply it will run out of juice. It is very important that all Australians understand the central importance of this exploration and production effort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The backdrop to the recent announcement of further acreage releases offshore is that in 1990 Australia had a record, both in terms of exploration and production. As a corollary, it is important to point out that most of Australia's gas discoveries of current and prospectively enormous importance to this country have been as a by-product of oil exploration. One need reflect only on the enormous contribution of gas sales from our North West Shelf project, in particular, to repairing our current account position to understand the enormous importance of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recently announced release is part of the Government's 25-year program. It looks not to the next few months, or even years, but well into the next century. It provides an internationally accepted framework for proper exploration and production. It forms part of a raft of government initiatives lauded in various international forums. For example, there have been comments from the East-West Centre reflecting upon the important reforms to petroleum, oil and gas taxation, the resource rent tax proposals. In addition, there has been kind comment by internationally regarded experts in relation to our whole raft of reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is worth pointing out that, although there has been some dropping off in the holes being drilled, this year the level of seismic activity has been a record. It augurs well for this Government's continued efforts to ensure that Australia's vast and largely underexplored&mdash;that is, highly prospective&mdash;offshore areas are explored and produced in a timely way that encourages certainty. That certainty has been the message from all the players, including those coming to Australia for the first time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I address a question to you on the matter of the guillotine. It is particularly significant at this time, given the number of Bills under the guillotine and the number of Bills listed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for guillotining. My question to you is this: will you please examine the record of proceedings in the House of last Thursday night as indicated at pages 2669 to 2670 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>? They suggest that several breaches of the Standing Orders and practices of the House occurred. The record clearly shows that the honourable member for Macquarie was not given the call in between items of business to move for a suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders to enable greater committee consideration of the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2). The Chair extended the call to the Minister twice and also to a Government backbencher instead of calling the Opposition for the resumption of debate on the grounds that the Opposition had spoken last on the previous matter considered by the House and the points of order concerning the events were dismissed. If your examination indicates that a breach has in fact occurred, would you please advise the Chairman of Committees and his deputies of the appropriate course to follow in circumstances where there is an incorrect allocation of the call when time is already limited under guillotine procedures and subsequent rectifying of procedures can consume the time available, as occurred last Thursday evening. Mr Speaker, can you also report back to the House so that the events of last Thursday are not allowed to stand as a precedent in this chamber?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My recollection&mdash;and I am sure that of all honourable members&mdash;is that there was quite considerable confusion in the House last Thursday. On reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on Friday, I recall that the honourable member for Deakin took a point of order and that his point of order was correct in that an honourable member can rise at any time during a break in the business of the House and propose that Standing Orders be suspended. To my recollection, at the time the honourable member took that point of order the Deputy Speaker said that he was in fact correct but that the Clerk had been called on to announce the next item of business. In fact, the Deputy Speaker ruled that way. That was a correct ruling because that was his interpretation of events.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that was raised by the honourable member for Deakin was a quite proper point of order, and one which was, in fact, correct; if there is a break in the business, a member can move the suspension of Standing Orders. I do not think that there is any need to reiterate that that is where we are at, because that is what the Standing Orders and the practice of the House propose. But it would be pointless for us to go over that issue now, because the process for members to take issue with some matter that they feel has not worked out right in the House, in accordance with standing order 100, is that they should take issue with whoever is in the chair at the time. The fact is that that caravan has passed, in a sense.</PARA>

<PARA>Mr Speaker, this is a particularly serious matter to come before the House for debate. It embraces an issue that would not normally be the subject of contention or dispute&mdash;the construction of a long awaited and very necessary part of our transport infrastructure. However, the alarm bells should have begun ringing for every Australian concerned for this country's development when the troglodytes from the extremes of the Australian Labor Party started weighing in against the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My attention was drawn to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 8 October this year. There for all to see was the unholy alliance of the New South Wales Labor Right and the Left&mdash;a picture of the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) and the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) grimly perusing the environmental impact study into Sydney Airport along with the champions of the Left, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) and the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh). I never believed that I would see the Minister in the fraternal embrace of the New South Wales Right. Yet it is obvious that recent events within the ALP have thrown together some very strange alliances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming in the wake of the Government's Medicare fiasco, it is little wonder that there is concern building within the community that the Government will lack the fortitude to make a decision in the long term interests of the nation on this matter. Over the years the Government has established an appalling record of caving in when the pressure is applied&mdash;whether it be from outside interest groups or from within the Government's own factions. Despite the fact that there are strong advocates for the third runway within the Ministry&mdash;such as the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins)&mdash;there is growing disquiet that this decision will become another victim of factional politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine the record. In 1982 the then Minister for Aviation, the present honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), announced plans to proceed with a new runway at Sydney Airport. Opposed by the New South Wales Labor Government, the proposal was scrapped by the incoming Labor Government in 1983. Six years passed before the Government was able to summon up the courage to announce its intention to proceed with a parallel runway at Sydney Airport. That announcement was accompanied by a commitment to undertake an extensive environmental impact study into all aspects of the project.

In speaking to the motion to suspend Standing Orders, the member for Fadden should be saying why it is important to suspend Standing Orders and not necessarily running the arguments that he may run if that motion succeeds. I draw the member's attention to that, so that he does not continue the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MH4">Mr JULL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is precisely why I want to suspend Standing Orders, Mr Speaker. We have a situation where you and a number of members from New South Wales are undertaking, even on this very day, to put up obstacles to the third runway project. In the House we received a notice this morning that we will have an exhibition tomorrow by one of the groups against the third runway, and they will use this facility to keep pushing their objections to the proposal. We would like to know from whom the approval came.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, Mr Speaker, we are very concerned indeed that we will not get a clear cut decision on this project and get it under way as a matter of urgency. There are 40,000 jobs involved in the third runway extension for Sydney Airport. It is one of the most important pieces of micro-economic reform that we have in Australia, and it is quite obvious, I would think, to the meanest intelligence that the Government is in trouble on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one of the most important pieces of micro-economic reform, and we have got to a stage where we can undertake the whole thing, get it on the public record and find out what the objections are all about. Let us clear the thing once and for all. The Opposition recognises the importance of this project. We want to get it under way, and, if the Government makes the decision to get it under way, it will have our support 100 per cent. In the meantime, we have the difficulty of members of the Government, including members of the back bench, running around putting up every possible obstacle. It is about time that they all came clean. That is why we are raising this issue today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that the honourable member for Barton was unable to accept the decision of the majority. He resigned from the Ministry, thus laying the foundations for a continuing campaign against the proposal. Opposition from within the Government to the parallel runway has been evident for years and years. It involves senior members of the Government. Three years ago, Senator Gareth Evans, the then Minister for Transport and Communications, stated his very clear opposition to the parallel runway at Sydney Airport. Speaking before a Senate Estimates committee hearing on 13 October 1988 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have made it very clear that a further runway is not a credible, viable or financially, environmentally or politically acceptable option.</PARA>
<PARA>There could not be any clearer indication of what he thought about the parallel runway. Something quite dramatic must have happened in the six months after that to induce a change of mind within the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The release of the EIS just a few weeks ago was preceded by very sound advice from within the Labor movement. Martin Ferguson, the President of the ACTU, said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on 15 September:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Political parties have to stop playing football and face up to their responsibilities on all sides of the political argument.</PARA>
<PARA>I trust that the Cabinet will take Mr Ferguson's advice. The problem was that Mr Ferguson was then openly criticised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services for having the temerity to support the third runway proposal as a means for reducing unemployment. It seems that, if one wants to take a step back into the Dark Ages, one can always rely on the Labor Left to lead the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was at this time that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, was publicly calling for the fast tracking for approval of the major project. These sentiments were echoed by the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) just last month when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it would be very important psychologically to get a few of the projects that people allege are being delayed off the ground.</PARA>
<PARA>However, forces are certainly mustering within the ALP to reject the EIS's finding and to further embarrass members of the Cabinet. On 2 October, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services made clear his opposition to the proposal. He stated in unequivocal terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view the EIS fails to provide a basis for the proposal to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA>My suggestion to the Minister is that, should he be unsuccessful in his scheme to halt this project, he should take a leaf from the book of his colleague the honourable member for Barton: he should resign from the Ministry, and he should do so straightaway.

The motion for the suspension of Standing Orders has to be considered today and the Prime Minister has to be given a chance to peruse this proposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that the construction of the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport will mean a massive 59 per cent reduction in the number of people affected by aircraft noise. So the first and most significant product, and the reason the Government ought to include it in its jobs program, is that there will be a reduction in aircraft noise. The second is that the third runway project will be funded entirely by the self-funding Federal Airports Corporation. There will be a significant job creation of between 26,000 and 40,000 jobs. The third runway will mean less noise and more jobs. It will be in the interests of rural and regional commuters, in the interests of Australia and the preservation of what is today Australia's principal international access. We deserve to debate this issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. On behalf of all members of the House I seek your guidance as to what the decision of the Leader of the House means. The Leader of the House has just indicated that the Government proposes not to grant suspension of Standing Orders. Will that preclude the Speaker from entering into this debate and stating clearly his position in relation to the third runway?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Ronald Edwards)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;The Manager of Opposition Business has asked two questions. The first one goes to the arguments of the Leader of the House. He, of course, is at liberty in this debate to put those arguments sequentially, as have the colleagues of the Manager of Opposition Business&mdash;that is, the honourable member for Fadden and the right honourable member for New England&mdash;and he is doing that. The Chair cannot pre-empt what that decision would be, but I understand why the Manager of Opposition Business raises that. The second question, as to whether or not the Speaker would enter the debate, of course is a matter for the Speaker. Customarily that would not be the case, I would have thought, but that is a matter for the Speaker and not for the Chair at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, further on a point of order: with respect, sir, you misunderstood my question. My question is whether, if the Leader of the House does not permit this debate to proceed, that will preclude the Speaker from having the opportunity to speak. I am not asking you to indicate whether the Speaker will or will not enter the debate. I am concerned that the Government might take action, by weight of numbers, to preclude the Speaker from taking part in the debate&mdash;and that would be undemocratic.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Chair understands the substance of the point the Manager of Opposition Business makes. However, what he is really making in fact is a debating point which in relation to the discussion before the Chair is: how would this argument proceed in a way that the Speaker's speaking would be facilitated, or not facilitated? Of course the answer to that is to be provided by the Leader of the House rather than by the Chair because it is a matter of how he would treat the substantive matter before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last occasion on which I recollect being advised of Speakers being involved in discussions in these ways was by my father&mdash;and it at least goes back to when he was a very junior member of the House, when Mr Speaker Rosevear was in the chair. My father discovered that Mr Speaker Rosevear had a tendency to sit on the Government front bench and my father, as a new aspiring member of parliament, felt it necessary to raise with Mr Speaker Rosevear the question of the objectivity of the Speaker. He went to him and said, `Mr Speaker, why are you sitting on the Government front bench?', expecting of course some answer such as, `Well, I like to come in and listen to the debate and I like to hear what is going on in the Parliament even when I am not in the chair'. What he got was the answer, `Mr Beazley, I am a member of the Government; that is why I sit on the Government front bench'. At the time my father thought this was a less than adequate explanation of the Speaker's role, but Mr Speaker Rosevear persisted with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, that is not the attitude of the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay), who is a most objective Speaker in this House, who does not regard himself as part of the Government and who refuses to participate in partisan debate or debate of any kind&mdash;and that is, of course, a completely appropriate role for Mr Speaker. So, though this proposition is meant with a degree of good humour and obviously in the best interests of ensuring&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Goodwill, and any other particularly friendly epithet that the Opposition likes to attach to the proposition&mdash;one of the many reasons why we would not support a suspension of Standing Orders in order to discuss this particular matter is that we on this side of the House do not feel that we ought to so breach convention and have the Speaker actively engaged in debate on matters of Government policy or otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second reason why the proposition ought to be opposed is that the processes are proceeding correctly. We have had an environmental impact study in accordance with the laws related to environmental impact studies. We have had an appropriate period for public comment. We have had a subsequent report on that comment. We have had that report go to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and that Minister, I think, has another couple of days within which to report to the relevant Minister concerned, who will then take the matter to Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In case it has escaped the attention of honourable members opposite&mdash;it certainly has not escaped the notice of people on this side of the House&mdash;there is a whole new field of litigation opening up in this country in relation to administrative law. It goes on along the lines in these sorts of propositions that, if we as Ministers breach any of the duties that are imposed on us by law, we can quite often be quite successfully injuncted for any particular course of action that we intend to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To attempt to move the Government outside of the framework of a proper consideration of the legislative requirements resting upon it in this regard would be an act of pure madness if one's objective is to get the third runway in place because, in case it has escaped the attention of honourable members opposite, there is a strong view amongst the neighbouring suburbs&mdash;in my view, erroneously based&mdash;that they are going to experience substantial difficulty as a result of the implementation of the third runway. There is no question that, of the population of this country who are in some way affected by aircraft noise to a substantial degree, 85 per cent actually reside around Sydney Airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this is not a view that we can just dismiss lightly and give a flick pass to, particularly when we know they are likely to march up and present themselves to us in serried ranks in court and are capable, if we have done anything untoward in the way in which we have conducted that process, of disrupting us. In my view, most of them would be benefited by the establishment of a third runway in terms of noise, but they have to be convinced of that&mdash;and they will not be convinced of that if we are playing fast and loose with the legal processes at any point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has resolved probably the most difficult question in regard to Sydney's future aviation needs that governments have confronted in the past; that is, the successful identification and beginnings of the development of a second airport at Sydney, at Badgerys Creek. Governments have risen and fallen on these sorts of issues in the past, but we have done that. We have also pursued through the proper processes what is the interim to medium term fix&mdash;that is, the third runway proposal. We are handling both those issues sensibly and with sensitivity and, I would say, on time in terms of meeting the aviation needs of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this Government does not actually need to get a hurry up on any of these particular matters. We do not need to be told of the significance of these issues to the aviation industry generally in Australia or Sydney in particular. We are the ones who have been addressing these issues and arriving at the relevant conclusions&mdash;not the irrelevant ones that honourable members opposite were managing to arrive at some time ago. When we finally get all these things in place, as we will, there will be no requirement for motions of these sorts. The problem will be solved. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1991 and cognate Bills give the public of Australia a clear demonstration of a government in disarray, panic and incompetence over the leadership issue. Here we have a series of major and important pieces of legislation in the taxation area being introduced and the guillotine being applied without proper and full debate. These legislative matters will affect many people throughout Australia. It is a disgrace that they are to be debated in this manner, and that follows on from the disgraceful performance of the Government since the commencement of this Parliament in May 1990. In a little over a year since May 1990, 114 separate Bills were guillotined through the Parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>What we are seeing is a follow-on from that&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am putting forward the view that these matters are of such importance that it is a disgrace that the Government has chosen to guillotine all of these Bills. I draw to the attention of the House the fact that 48 of the Bills guillotined since May 1990 were guillotined through the Parliament during two sitting weeks. We have a similar situation with these Bills. Apparently, the guillotine will apply right to the end of this session. The Government's attention is focused on other issues and it continues to treat this House with contempt through its handling of very important matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments before the House at the moment are contained in the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1991, the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), the Income Tax (Deferred Interest Securities) (Tax File Number Withholding Tax) Bill 1991 and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1991. The Government has chosen to provide only an hour and a half for debate on these important pieces of legislation. They comprise many amendments relating to the ending of the tax concessions in relation to service in the Gulf, the treatment of certain social security benefits and allowances, the continuation of the special tax deduction for research and development expenditure, the method of listing organisations to whom gifts are tax deductible, the deductibility of expenses for environmental impact statements, the deductions for payment of the life insurance levy, the timing of franking credits, the capital gains tax cost base, the tax file number withholding tax, new rules for objections to taxation decisions and the deferral of certain company tax payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has a number of concerns about these pieces of legislation, including the amendment to the living away from home allowances section of the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill which will change the fringe benefits tax law to ensure that living away from home allowances paid to offshore oil and gas rig workers are treated as fringe benefits. I understand&mdash;it has caused some concern amongst the coalition&mdash;that some companies have overpaid tax prior to this fringe benefits tax amendment being introduced. The coalition is concerned about whether these companies that have overpaid tax will ever get it back. I ask the Minister at the table, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), to take that on notice. There are a number of issues that I will be raising. We propose to move amendments in the Senate. We will not be moving the amendments in this House at this stage, but I want to flag the concerns of the coalition on a number of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further matter I want to raise relates to the exemption of the pay and allowances of members of the Defence Force who served in Iraq and Kuwait. The proposed amendments will exempt from income tax the pay and allowances of members of the Australian Defence Force allotted for duty in Iraq and Kuwait in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. I understand that the Government intends that the amendments will cease that exemption after 9 June 1991. We have no concern with the matter of pensions, benefits and allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason underlying the amendment put forward by the Government in relation to investment related lottery winnings is that it minimises the risk of loan providers substituting non-assessable amounts&mdash;in other words, prizes&mdash;for assessable amounts, interest, to be paid to the recipients. The amendment does not affect ordinary lottos, caskets, art unions, raffles or any of those sorts of things, nor do the amendments apply if either the prize won or the right to participate in a lottery arrangement is already taxable. We are concerned that the legislation applies to prizes paid after the date on which the legislation receives royal assent and therefore applies potentially to arrangements entered into prior to the date of legislation. Therefore, it is potentially retrospective and will impact upon UK premium bonds currently held by Australian residents and equivalent investments offered by the New Zealand Government. These investments were obtained prior to the date of royal assent and we believe they should continue to be exempt. We also have a concern&mdash;maybe it can be clarified by the Minister at the table&mdash;about whether the provisions will exclude government bodies, bearing in mind the situation in the United Kingdom with its premium bond arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two important aspects to the section dealing with deductions for petroleum resource rent tax payments: firstly, to allow instalments of the petroleum resource rent tax to be deductible in the year in which the payments are made; and, secondly, to include refunds or credits of PRRT instalments for which a deduction has been allowed or is allowable in assessable income in the year in which the amount is received, credited, paid or applied. Basically, those two new provisions will ensure that deductions for the PRRT instalments are consistent with general income tax principles. The amendment will apply to all of those instalments made on or after 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next area that the coalition has some concern about relates to gifts to gift funds of cultural organisations. This amendment will allow deductions for gifts made directly to a gift fund of a cultural organisation admitted to the Register of Cultural Organisations. As a consequence, the names of seven cultural organisations that are presently listed in the gift provisions will be removed from the Act, including the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust. Honourable members would know the history of this organisation and the financial difficulties that it found itself in. A number of other organisations were caught up in the financial problems of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust as well. The other cultural organisations included are the Sydney Opera House Appeal Fund, the Sidney Myer Music Bowl Trust, the Art Gallery Society of New South Wales, the Victorian Arts Centre Trust, the Queensland Cultural Centre Trust and the Australian National Gallery Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment will allow gift funds of cultural organisations to receive tax deductible donations by entry on the register. To be listed on the register, a fund must be approved by the Treasurer and the Minister responsible for the arts. I wonder how much public input will take place because the main input into that register and the control of it, after its establishment by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, will be from the Department itself. I wonder whether the Government has considered that this is an opportunity to allow for more public input into deciding which organisations appear on that register and how they are selected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next item that I want to move on to is the deduction of environmental impact studies expenditure. Under the existing law, the cost of studies undertaken to determine the impact that a project may have on the environment may not qualify for deduction. The amendment put forward by the Government will allow a deduction for cost of such studies where the cost is incurred on or after 12 March 1991. In most cases, the cost of the environmental impact study will be deducted over 10 years. However, if the study relates to a project which has a life of less than 10 years, the cost of the study will be deducted over that lesser period. This deduction will not apply to expenditure on environmental impact studies; that is deductible under some other provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of any plant used in an environmental impact study will be depreciable, like other plant, rather than deductible on the basis of other environmental impact study expenditure. The coalition is concerned that the tax treatment of the rectification of existing plant should be as follows. We believe that, where repairs do not add value to a plant, an outright deduction should be allowed or, in all other cases, a write-off over a three-year period should be allowed. We put that forward, flagging up that further consideration should be given to that between the debate in this House and the appearance of this legislation in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The life insurance protection levy has a rather long and chequered history. It relates to arrangements which will provide a measure of financial protection for policyholders of Occidental Life Insurance Co. of Australia Ltd and Regal Life Insurance Ltd. The proposed amendments put forward by the Government establish the taxation treatment of various payments associated with the legislative framework introduced to enable the imposition of one-off levy arrangements on registered life insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The protection levy payments will be tax deductible to life insurance companies and will be taken to relate exclusively to non-fund assessable income. Grants paid from the life insurance policyholders' protection fund to Occidental Life and Regal Life will be exempt from income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any winding-up advance payments or final winding-up payments from the protection fund to life insurance companies will be treated as non-fund assessable income. If there is a remission or a refund of an overpayment of protection levy, an assessment may be amended to reflect the proper liability of a company with no time limit impediment. As I indicated to the House, these provisions are to provide a measure of financial protection for the policyholders of Occidental Life and Regal Life Insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's flagged proposed amendments under subsections 116DC and 116DF of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), which will be put forward in another place, suggest that it may be more appropriate for these subsections to state that the deductions allowable are taken to relate exclusively to the non-funded class of assessable income of the taxpayer. We put that forward for consideration by the Government and flag our view that this would be a more appropriate action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next clause deals with general mining, exploration and prospecting expenditure. I have a particular interest in this matter because I believe it may be of assistance to goldmining in the north-central Victorian area, where there is still a vast quantity of gold that we would like to get out of the ground at some time. This provision, combined with the long-awaited changes to the mining legislation in Victoria, may well bring about a renewal of the goldmining industry in north-central Victoria&mdash;and perhaps in Western Australia, Mr Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general mining exploration or prospecting provision will be amended to remove the requirement that mineral exploration or prospecting expenditure need be incurred on a mining tenement to qualify for immediate deductibility. That change will allow expenditure incurred in exploring broad areas not covered by a mining tenement to be deductible. It treats all exploration or prospecting expenditure the same, whether that expenditure be incurred on quarrying, petroleum, petroleum operations or mining, whatever class of mining it may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next provisions in this legislation that I want to make some comment about are the proposed changes regarding the capital gains tax cost base. The Bill will amend the capital gains tax cost base provisions to allow costs such as interest rates and land taxes, repairs and insurance premiums to be taken into account in working out the taxable capital gain made on disposal of an asset. Section 160ZH is being amended to include in the cost base of certain assets holding costs incurred by a taxpayer which are not themselves deductible under other provisions of the Act. However, this inclusion only related to expenditure incurred on assets acquired subsequent to 21 August 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has some concerns about that. It feels that a fair proposal would be to extend that concession back to 19 September 1985, which was the date on which capital gains tax was introduced. I see the Minister taking notes on that proposal. I think that it is a matter that the Government should look at because there may well be people disadvantaged by what the Government is proposing to do there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisional tax amendments, by which the Government proposes to amend the provisional tax requirements for 1990-91 and subsequent years, mean that taxpayers will be liable for provisional taxes on salary or wages if they satisfy both parts of a simple test. The two conditions are if the balance to pay on assessment was $3,000 or more and the pay as you earn deductions made from that salary or wages income were underdeducted by $3,000 or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When calculating the balance to pay on assessment, the whole of the previous year's provisional tax amount is currently allowed as a credit. Only the provisional tax on income other than salary or wages will be allowed as a credit when calculating the balance to pay on assessment. This splitting will occur only for the purposes of determining whether or not the balance to pay on assessment is $3,000 or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amended test operates by splitting the provisional tax credit into two components. The first component is provisional tax raised on income other than salaries or wages. This component will be allowed as a credit in determining whether a taxpayer has a balance to pay on assessment of $3,000 or more. The second component of the credit will be provisional tax raised on salary or wages income of the preceding year as a result of a shortfall in PAYE deductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not have any major concerns with that. However, I certainly do have some concerns about the next piece of legislation which is included in this package, and that is the Income Tax (Deferred Interest Securities) (Tax File Number Withholding Tax) Bill 1991, which will impose the tax file number withholding tax. What we are seeing with this is more and more influence of Big Brother taking over in everything that we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about this particular piece of legislation because, from time to time, constituents, particularly the elderly, complain to me about their tax situation. They believe they have paid their tax; they have made their contribution to society. All they want to do is carry on with their lives without interference. Some were even threatened by the Department of Social Security, which said that if they did not make their tax file number available to the Department they may lose their pension. If ever Big Brother were alive and well, it would be here. This aspect of the tax file number causes a great deal of heartache, particularly for elderly people when they have to make their tax file number available at the threat, if they do not, of possibly losing their pension. I get concerned about that and I know that many residents within my electorate&mdash;particularly the elderly&mdash;are also concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that my colleague the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Lowe, (Dr Bob Woods) will be making some comments in relation to the Medicare levy exemption. The only thing I question is how much this measure saves. There is no costing in the explanatory memorandum as to what the Government hopes to save on this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The further amendments relating to garnishee notices attracted my attention. Regrettably, I have not the time to canvass in great detail all of the implications of the legislation, but I indicate that the coalition has some concerns about the rapid speed with which the Government has presented this legislation and the limited time for debate. Part 10 of the Bill will amend various taxation laws so that, in relation to shares in building societies, the Commissioner may garnishee only those shares known as withdrawable shares. This will prevent the Commissioner from garnisheeing permanent or fixed shares in building societies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is very appropriate. I am not sure whether it was the Pyramid Building Society which attracted the Minister's attention when he raised this matter, but apparently the Pyramid Building Society had some arrangement about withdrawable shares that may have attracted his attention. Certainly one of Victoria's biggest building societies&mdash;the Bendigo Building Society which operates in my own electorate and throughout Victoria&mdash;has an asset base of over $700m, has 85 per cent of its lending in residential housing and is one of the most successful building societies in Australia. It is in very good shape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to refer to section 19, which relates to the direct lodgment of appeals and applications for review. Under the existing law, if a taxpayer is dissatisfied with the Commissioner's decision on an objection, the taxpayer may lodge with the Commissioner of Taxation a request to refer the decision to either the AAT or the Federal Court of Australia. We have some concerns about this, because the proposed new legislation&mdash;section 14ZY&mdash;does not place a time limit for the Commissioner of Taxation to make a decision allowing or disallowing an objection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old legislation did not do this either. However, under the current section 189A, if a taxpayer, having received an objection decision from the Commissioner, advises the Commissioner to refer it to either the Tribunal or the Court, and 60 days have lapsed and the Commissioner has not complied with the request, the taxpayer may give notice in writing to the Commissioner requiring the Commissioner to see that the referral is made and the Commissioner shall, within 60 days after receiving the notice, comply with the request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the proposed system, the Commissioner can take as long as he likes to make a decision on an objection, with no time limit at all.

The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2) is quite a significant Bill in its own right. I am disappointed that there is not sufficient time for all of the relevant issues to be canvassed, because that Bill provides legislative backing for agreements for the prevention of double taxation and tax avoidance with India and Poland. I have recently returned from India; it was encouraging to see just how India is emerging as a nation and moving into higher technology fields. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that these international agreements with India and Poland receive attention from the Government. I am pleased to see this Bill going through the House. I hope that the Government has it right because it is important to future trading arrangements with both of those countries. I for one would certainly like to see Australia in a strong position to continue its trading with India and Poland and to accelerate its trading with India, which is rapidly emerging as a country where Australian products can be traded, particularly in the primary industries area and in the field of high technology. I am sure those hold many opportunities for Australia and I would have liked further time to discuss this legislation. As I say, the Government has treated the Parliament with contempt by debating all these Bills in such a short time. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we have quite a raft of Bills for consideration in this cognate debate. I want to speak specifically on two of those: the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991 and the Income Tax (Deferred Interest Securities) (Tax File Number Withholding Tax) Bill 1991. As has been suggested by the Opposition spokesman who has just contributed to this debate, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), these Bills range fairly widely. To do justice to a consideration of each and every minor detail, one would need more than the time that has been allocated this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are one or two important points that need to be made in relation to these Bills. In particular, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) gives effect to the announcements of the March industry statement that tax concessions for research and development will be retained as a permanent feature. We also have a Bill which will exempt from tax the pay and allowance of members of the Australian defence forces allotted duty in Iraq and Kuwait&mdash;something which I am sure is of particular concern to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table. Other amendments contained in this legislation support the existing tax file number arrangements. Relief for small businesses will be provided for in this legislation by way of the deferment of the initial payment of company tax in respect of the 1990-91 income year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of other matters are contained within this legislation but, as I have indicated, the two particular areas that I wish to talk about in my contribution are those areas which are relevant to the tax file number arrangements. As honourable members will recall from debate in this place and elsewhere about appropriate measures designed to combat the rorting of the tax system&mdash;rorting that has gone on for quite some time, under whatever government is in control in this country&mdash;there have been efforts to combat the level of tax avoidance. For example, we had discussion about putting an Australia Card in place. For various reasons we saw that proposal hit the fence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we did see emerge from all of that discussion was the putting in place of a tax file number system. I am pleased to say that certainly in examining that issue the Parliament played a very real role in putting forward a number of suggestions as to how that particular proposal might be implemented and improved. After all, it was through the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which has inquired into a number of aspects of the Australian taxation system over the last three or four years, that certain suggestions have been made to government and picked up. I also say that the tax file number proposal was unanimously supported by all honourable members on that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) will amend the income tax law to provide for the assessment and collection of a tax file number withholding tax where an investor has not quoted a tax file number for certain deferred interest investments. This is picking up a potential loophole in legislation, again aimed at making much fairer and more simple the collection of tax which is due and payable to the Australian Government. It comes back to the philosophy of why taxes are collected&mdash;to pay for the services demanded of governments, whether they be Federal, State or whatever, by people living in this country. Of course, in that respect we need to ensure that the appropriate levels of tax are paid. The people who want the services should be prepared to pay their contribution towards them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Income Tax (Deferred Interest Securities) (Tax File Number Withholding Tax) Bill 1991 seeks to impose a tax file number withholding tax arrangement. These new arrangements, which certainly will not necessarily impact on the revenue, will provide that where a tax file number is not quoted by the investor for certain deferred interest investments, the tax file number withholding tax will be payable jointly and severally by the investor and the investment body. It is specifically geared to ensure that tax avoidance, tax evasion or simply tax deferment&mdash;which is a clever way of doing things&mdash;is not deferred indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investment bodies which pay the tax file number withholding tax for a deferred interest investment will be able to recover such payment from the investor. As a result of industry consultation which is, of course, a hallmark of this Government, we have decided that the new rules will apply only to investments made on or after 1 February 1992. This will give investment bodies sufficient time to make any necessary changes to their existing practices to give effect to these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the new withholding tax will not represent a new source of revenue to the Government. I think that needs to be clearly understood. It is not a new source of revenue; it is not a replacement tax in any way. Rather, the measure will, in conjunction with the amendments proposed in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), support the existing tax file number legislation and ensure that an effective sanction is applied where a tax file number is not quoted for the deferred interest investments covered by the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bendigo in his contribution raised some of the concerns he had about tax file numbers and the effect that they would have on pensioners and so on. I think it is fair to say that it is through arrangements such as those which this Government has sought to put in place over the last few years that we have seen a massive reduction in taxation evasion and avoidance and the rorting of the system that were certainly characteristic of the past. Therefore, to suggest that certain classes of people should be exempt, I really do not think is appropriate. When the Government chose to put in place a number of other considerations, particularly in respect of pensioners, there were claims that this would be dreadful, that lots of pensioners would be picked up and that their pensions would be affected. Of course, that simply did not happen. I think that the assets test is a classic example of where that measure applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I will comment on foreign source income. It was through the work of the Committee to which I referred earlier that we saw some very meaningful contributions to this particular matter. Foreign source income legislation was introduced by the Government some 18 months or so ago. It sought to crack down on the use by Australian residents of overseas tax jurisdictions for the purpose of minimising or, indeed, completely subverting their taxation responsibilities in this country; in other words, the use of taxation havens. Through the foreign source income legislation we have seen the Government deeming certain countries with comparable tax regimes to be appropriate for Australian taxpayers. Of course, we extract the appropriate company tax rate from people investing in those jurisdictions who do not have comparable tax regimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a government we have always been willing to finetune this legislation to ensure that its operation is a lot smoother. This is exactly what this legislation seeks to do. Three of the amendments proposed in the legislation will operate to relieve double taxation that can arise under the measures that were proposed. This goes to the heart of fairness of the tax system. All Government members should be seeking not to impose onerous taxation burdens on people but to extract what is their fair and reasonable share of taxation commitment to this country because, at the end of the day, people want the services provided by governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first instance, relief from double taxation is to be provided in relation to an Australian controlled foreign company that has changed its residence from a low tax country either to Australia or a listed comparable tax country. Secondly, corporate unit trusts, public trading trusts and superannuation trusts will be treated similarly to other resident taxpayers by being granted an exemption from Australian tax for distributions from a controlled foreign company out of income previously attributed to them. Finally, the third amendment will ensure that taxpayers are not disadvantaged by the operation of the rules for the conversion and carry forward of foreign losses incurred before 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we are determined as a government to act against attempts to erode the integrity of the foreign source income measures. Therefore, one amendment will deny taxpayers a tax advantage they have sought to obtain by changing the residence of a controlled foreign company from a comparable tax country to a low tax country. These taxpayers will be denied foreign tax credits on dividends paid by the company out of pre-1990-91 profits accumulated in the comparable tax country. It is all geared towards ensuring that fair, justified and reasonable taxes are paid to the country which, after all, people enjoy for the provision of services to which I referred earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, the Bills are appropriate inasmuch as they tidy up some loose ends associated with legislation already before this place or legislation which has already been passed by this Parliament. They go to the heart of the question of equity and fairness and ensure that taxation revenue to the Government is not minimised by people who seek to arrange their corporate affairs so that they get some benefit, which ordinary PAYE taxpayers cannot afford to do. Accordingly, I believe that it is justified. These particular Bills go part of the way to ensuring that that is the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again this Parliament&mdash;the place where everything is expected to be put on public show, and where people of Australia can get some idea of what the Executive Government is up to; otherwise termed `keeping the so and sos honest'&mdash;has been put under time constraints with each and every piece of legislation under the guillotine. After the discussions we had in previous sessions, I thought that the Government could talk to its bureaucracy, get its house in order and have this sort of legislation passed with proper debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the results of the last session: massive amendments have had to be brought to the Parliament because of legislation not being properly considered in this place. But here we are again. We have five pieces of legislation being debated cognately and under the guillotine, but with barely two hours granted for their debate. We have that length of time only because of debate being curtailed in the matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer to some of these Bills, particularly the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, which comes to this place each year. It deals with the applicable thresholds under which individuals&mdash;married couples, single parents and others&mdash;are exempt from the levy. I note that this year the income threshold for individuals is unchanged at $11,745. But there has been an increase in the appropriate area&mdash;married couples and sole parents&mdash;where, if the family income does not exceed $19,674, parents will not be obliged to pay the Medicare levy. The income threshold for those people will continue to be increased by a further $2,100 for each dependent child or student. As the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Free) pointed out in his second reading speech, that would lift the threshold for a family with three children to $25,974. That is of some assistance to people whose income is under great pressure in the present economic climate, which of course has been created by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of this we have to say that the Medicare levy is almost fraudulently presented to the Australian people as the cost of the Medicare service. I am almost sure, without checking, that the levy still stands at 1.25 per cent, and probably something less than $3,000m of tax collections. It is a far cry from the massive cost that has been imposed on the Australian people by the introduction of Medicare&mdash;a cost that is doing nothing for the people. It seems that there is only one parallel in the whole operation, and that is that the queues waiting to get into hospitals are growing at the same rate as the expenditure. One would expect the queues to get shorter once the expenditure increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I went to the Australian National University where I addressed a group of students on their particular concerns as to the lack of funds available for education these days. It is interesting that we have a common situation in hospitals and universities: in both cases there are now massive waiting lists. People who otherwise qualify&mdash;in different ways of course; one group academically and the other because they are sick&mdash;are waiting to get into the particular institution concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I looked at the 1983-84 Budget outlays and took out some figures. Today health expenditure is almost all consumed by Medicare. I know that a following speaker could say, `Medicare&mdash;the Health Insurance Commission&mdash;only spends this much'. But let us face it, it nearly all goes into supporting our universal so-called free health service, which is supposed to be funded by the Medicare levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health expenditure in the 1983-84 Budget represented 9.72 per cent of the total tax dollar. In other words, 9.72 cents in every dollar went on health. At that time, 9.04 per cent of the tax dollar was spent on education. Today, education gets 9.06 per cent of the tax dollar&mdash;up 0.02 per cent&mdash;and health gets 15 per cent of the tax dollar. So, in the lifetime of the Medicare levy, the percentage of the tax dollar spent on education has stayed practically the same while that spent on health has fast approached a 100 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I were one of those young students being denied further education because there are no places, or one of these people with elective surgery problems, some of which are pretty serious&mdash;recently in my State a woman had her toes amputated because she had been unable to get appropriate attention for a so-called `elective' type problem of circulation difficulties in her leg&mdash;I would be pretty annoyed to think that this Government has been so inefficient in its management of the health dollar that, having practically doubled the outlays, it had in fact increased the size of the waiting lists, which were practically non-existent when Medicare was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an amazing situation. Time and time again the Government was at pains to tell us about the two million people who were uninsured. I do not know what insurance has to do with the price of fish. Those people were not unprotected; they had access to all medical services. Of course, it was unnecessary for many to be privately insured; they were simply able to get the medical services they needed, and when they needed them. They were not like women who wrote to me during my time as shadow Minister for health. I remind the next speaker that I did complete a health policy. If the Government had taken some notice of it at the time, it would not be facing the dreadful consequences of disruption within its own Party. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject of the Bill is the levies applicable to people and the consequent costs, and I am going down the road of the real costs. The implication in this piece of legislation is that people with incomes under this threshold pay nothing for health. My point is that the Medicare levy from which they are exempt is a fraction of their health costs. As such, they should be warned that life is not as good as the Minister's second reading speech would tell them. That is my real point in raising these other issues relevant to the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is an appropriate time for me to give the Government a bit of advice on how to rectify the situation so that this legislation is truthful; in other words, gives the full story. These people of lower socio-economic circumstances who think they are not being taxed should, in fact, not be taxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear a lot about hidden taxes in this place. We have the wholesale sales tax&mdash;totally hidden. We have excise in fuel&mdash;totally hidden. And, of course, we have health costs&mdash;totally hidden, notwithstanding what the people are told. People on a particular income level&mdash;for instance, $25,974 for a family with three children&mdash;genuinely believe that they pay nothing for health. But, with the massive growth in tax for health expenditures which has occurred in the life of Medicare, those exempt people are paying a lot of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But being exempt does not entitle them to get into hospital. That is another point that I am trying to make. The Government has made a mess of it because, in doubling these expenditures and in applying taxes to these people who think that they are exempt, the Government has provided no service. Of course, this Government lacks the honesty of the New Zealand Government. During my time as shadow Minister for health I attended a conference where a Dame Dorothy Fraser was the keynote speaker. Reading a speech, a copy of which I have obtained, she said that there are 50,000 people on waiting lists for public hospital admission in New Zealand, and that waiting lists are the means by which public hospital services are rationed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She then went on to complain about the administration of waiting lists, pointing out that those in the know in the public service or politics were able to get pushed up the list. She did not for a minute complain about the fact that the Government rationed public hospital services. The difference between that lady and this Government is that this Government keeps telling us that waiting lists are all a myth, that it has the thing under control. Yet, of course, honourable members opposite in their own Caucus fought tooth and nail&mdash;and did not find a solution. In fact, their $2.50 solution will get them nowhere and will, of course, create more distortions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who got this threshold exemption today really have substantial reason to complain, because they are still paying if they are paying any tax at all. Of course, some people with family incomes of $25,974 would be paying substantial personal tax. The other day I employed a young man at $500 a week. In handing him his first cheque, I gave him something like $415. I said, `Goodness! My wife'&mdash;who does the pay in our family&mdash;`must have taken out more than was appropriate'. This bloke has a wife and two kids. I thought that this could not possibly be the amount of tax that he has to pay&mdash;but it is. He was more up to date than I was. He said, `Oh, no, that is what I was expecting'. That is $85 a week tax on a young man with a wife and two young children. Of course, of that $85, 15 per cent&mdash;he is below the threshold; he would just scrape in&mdash;is going off to fund his health services. If he is not listening to me today, I intend to go back and tell him that, because I think that that is a matter of great importance and interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the point we make: the Government got it wrong. It should never have attempted a universal service, and it should never have attempted to create the situation that exists and then blame the providers, as it has done. Whether the Government blames doctors, pathologists or pharmacists, the Government is at fault, firstly for attempting the impossible and secondly for complaining about the number of doctors in the system. It is pretty obvious what will happen when people see a system in which there is no limit to the amount of business one can get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Doctors have a great advantage over most business people; if they say to us that we had better come back next week, we usually go back next week. They are not to be blamed for that, any more than we should blame the doctor who feels it necessary to give substantial pathological services because he believes in his mind that he should take all those steps. Of course, in these days of great litigation, one might wonder how many steps a doctor should take. That is his problem. Nobody wants to encourage abuse but, if one creates a system such as that created by this Government and then expects that there will not be a growth in the number of providers, one does not understand the fundamentals of human nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to health, I will stop with that particular point because I would like to make a couple of remarks on some other areas. Briefly, we have some fringe benefits tax amendments which, as I understand it, raise the levy somewhat. But I wonder whether the Government, which is now very concerned about resource projects and about giving people jobs, realises what it is doing in relation to the amount of construction in remote areas&mdash;which is even more labour intensive and probably more rewarding for workers who are able to get that work&mdash;and how the fringe benefits tax has killed the development of our north. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was a young man everybody said that we had to develop the north in case some of our northern neighbours did it for us. I do not know whether that threat is past, but I know this: when we have diamond mines and other mining developments with only a token resident work force, with people being flown in every couple of weeks, we will never get development. The thing that has done that is the fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the fringe benefits tax might have been applicable to luncheons and to taking the wife and kids out on a tax free dinner, I think it was very foolish for the Government to apply the tax to those remote areas. As I recollect, the coalition has always said that it would review that situation. The tax is killing the north. If one goes to Argyle Diamonds, one will find hardly one permanent resident. All of the new developments are now based on flying people in and flying them out, because flying people in and out of their job is not a fringe benefit. But the minute one gives them a house, it is. It is easy to say that they should build their own houses. What? In the middle of the desert? They are not likely to do that. That is killing the north-west and it is killing our remote area development. If we are not prepared to populate those areas, maybe some of those predictions of people from 20 or 30 years ago will come to pass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the matter to the Government's attention because I think it is time that it realised that what seemed to be a rather simple thing in fact is not. The fringe benefits tax was built around the bloke in the Mercedes driving past the people in the tram&mdash;as the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), described it&mdash;who had their lunches in their brown paper bags. It sounded very convincing. Of course, when one looks at the tax statistics it is interesting to note that, a bit like the people who are being told that they are exempt, those workers in the tram have not since then got one extra sandwich in their brown paper bag&mdash;not one. </PARA>

All of that tax was levied, but there are no more sandwiches in the brown paper bag, and the biggest losers from the current economic situation are, of course, those same people. These people have little to thank the Government for in respect of the fringe benefits tax. The tax did not provide the benefits to the people for whom the benefits were supposed to be provided, the low income workers, as is the case with the Medicare legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard a couple of remarks about income tax international agreements. In terms of these international agreements, one of the great concerns of government these days&mdash;and I think rightly so&mdash;is one which the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) happened to mention: tax havens. They include the Cook Islands, the Bahamas&mdash;you name it. I have always wondered why, when the Government brought in its imputation proposal, it chose to retain the tax on companies and let them pass franked dividends to shareholders. I still believe that if the Government reversed that it would find nobody in the corporate sector needing a tax haven, because corporations would not pay tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that corporations enjoy profits. I believe that that is a myth we have created for ourselves. We hear of BHP, the big Australian. BHP is a piece of paper. It is the shareholders of BHP who should be making the profits. But, funnily, the first benefits of any great corporation go to the staff and the people for whom it creates jobs. I think that those corporations ought to be given every opportunity to provide those benefits and to do away with their search for tax havens; when they transfer money out of their business for any reason, it should be taxed appropriately&mdash;and I would be quite brutal on people who tried to turn that into some sort of tax rort. </PARA>

We need to understand that whether health care is paid for by the private sector or by the public purse, it is expensive. I am one member on this side of the House who supports the view that the levy should more closely represent what the actual costs are. I have put that view many times. I believe that if the levy more closely represented what the actual costs were, the vast majority of people&mdash;or many of them who believe that the levy represents their health insurance&mdash;would have a closer understanding of how expensive health care is and what the actual costs are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the honourable member for O'Connor is wrong to suggest that in the halcyon days of the 1970s there were no hospital queues. I was working in the public hospital sector in Perth at the time and very often I was responsible for handling waiting lists for outpatients and for surgery. Those have been a part of our public hospital system for a long time&mdash;they existed in the 1960s, too. To run an efficient hospital it is important to have some sort of a waiting list. I am not suggesting that waiting lists as they stand at the moment are desirable, but it is important to understand that the people who are on the waiting lists are waiting for elective surgery, not for emergency treatment or treatment that must be given straight away. It does not do us any good to talk down the health care system in this country, because it is a very good system and one that provides a substantial service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member then suggested that in some way Medicare has created an oversupply of doctors at the moment. The cause and effect relationship is a pretty tenuous one. All those people who are now practising medicine, having just joined the system, went through a five- or six-year training course and two years in the hospital. They are a result of decisions made even before we came to government, because of the time it takes to train a doctor and for him to become registered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would think that things such as the closed shop mentality that exists in the specialist colleges has something to do with supply and demand in particular specialities and the waiting lists that we have. I think immigration has something to do with the number of doctors, and the policies of medical schools have something to do with the number of doctors. So in all of those areas the cause and effect relationship that the honourable member is trying to draw is very tenuous and it would not stand up to much scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The co-payment is part of a structure which will bring about a change in the way in which medical services are delivered. My view is that the co-payment should exist for all classes of people. The co-payment is not a new concept; it was part of the original Medicare structure for some patients. We have extended that, and my view is that it should be extended to the gamut of those who want services. It is not a view that is supported by the Government, but I think it makes sense; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>intellectually, it is a consistent argument. I will not get distracted any more, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I understand that you are concerned about the way in which this debate has become wide ranging and the way in which the honourable member for O'Connor ranged into the area of health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other pieces of legislation are before us, and many of them deal with taxation measures which are of concern to constituents. In respect of changes in the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1991, the legislation extends the threshold of the levy and gives some relief to people on low incomes. I think that is a desirable thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill aligns the rates. Presently, fringe benefits are taxed at 47 per cent, whereas the top marginal rate is 48.25 per cent. That represents the marginal rate plus the levy. The aligning of those two rates is something which simply brings some consistency into the way in which the legislation operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill deals with a large number of aspects of taxation. For example, tax deductions will be available for expenditure incurred for environmental impact studies, which gives fact to the commitment of the Government in respect of the environment and the necessity for environmental impact studies to be undertaken by many people who are involved in developing projects. By this legislation, the plant and the articles that are required for environmental impact studies are, appropriately, eligible for taxation relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other changes within the Bill. One deals with the capital gains tax cost base. It allows taxpayers to offset non-deductible costs such as interest, repairs, rates and taxes and insurance premiums which are not part of the acquisition costs of the particular item but are part of the costs of holding those items. I believe the capital gains tax legislation, which is an important part of making our tax system fairer, is being improved by these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the honourable member for O'Connor said about there being a gulf between the Opposition and the Government is portrayed starkly by our position on the capital gains tax legislation. It has been our view&mdash;and I think it is a view that is internally consistent&mdash;that capital gains, in the year that they are realised, represent income; as such, they should be taxed along with other income. The position that obtains on the other side of the House is significantly different from that, and this represents one of the seminal aspects of taxation law on which the Government and the Opposition are significantly different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example which I have given before is of somebody who sells a package of shares or a property and earns a $30,000 capital gain, given indexation for inflation and other factors that are taken into account. I believe the suggestion that that should not be taxed whereas the wage-earner earning $30,000 in the same year should be taxed is an absurd one. It is clear that we should treat all income realised in any particular year the same. The capital gains tax changes within this Bill improve the legislation, something that those of us on this side of the House would argue is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was mentioned by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), there are amendments within part of the legislation before us to support the existing tax file legislation. This again represents an area of taxation law in which the starkness of the difference between our view and the view of the Opposition is put under the microscope. It is clear that the tax file legislation represents an opportunity for the Government to collect large amounts of taxation which previously went begging, and our reinforcing the legislation by introducing this Bill today is an important part of our legislative structure. We confirm the tax concession for research and development at a rate of 125 per cent&mdash;something that I am sure honourable members opposite will endorse and see as a positive measure which reinforces our position on encouraging research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As also mentioned by the honourable member for Macarthur, the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2) brings into effect prevention of double taxation and provides a level of security for the tax rules for arrangements between Australia and India and Australia and Poland. Indeed, the allocation of taxing rights between contracting countries over different categories of income is part of the way in which we go about this. It allows us to specify rules which will resolve complaints and claims between the residential status of a taxpayer and the source of income. Indeed, this piece of legislation is important from the point of view of improving the way in which we tax those people who have interests in other countries and in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It provides also for the prevention of avoidance and evasion of taxes on various forms of income between the treaty partners. It is something which, as the honourable member for Macarthur and Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration has mentioned, has been reviewed by that Committee. It is an important area of tax policy which enables us, in a very correct and proper way, to make tax law understandable, simple and understood for those people who have interests in other countries and in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a large number of pieces of legislation in this package before the House. The first speaker from the Opposition, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), suggested that the Opposition was looking for some minor amendments, but I think I can summarise by saying that, as a whole, he suggested there was very little that was opposed by the Opposition. It is the case that, while the time for debate on these pieces of legislation has not been as substantial as we would have liked, essentially there is a great deal of accord between the Opposition and the Government in respect of them and they have my support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address myself briefly to the fringe benefits tax amendments in respect of this whole group of taxation Bills which unfortunately is being brought down, once again, under guillotine. It is a shame that time and time again we come into this House and talk about the relevance or lack thereof of parliament. Parliament as an institution, it seems to me, is increasingly under attack by this Labor Government. This is not a view that I brought to this House of Representatives, because I came here with no firm understanding of the mores of parliament, of its institutions, or of the basic mechanisms within which it operates. I came to this place, if you will, with an open mind seeking to learn and participate as a representative of the people of the electorate from which I was sent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, over time, it has come to be my view that Executive Government drives this place and those of us who rise to speak to an empty chamber do so with increasing irrelevance. Executive Government treats us, firstly, with contempt; secondly, with disdain; and, thirdly, with lack of any consideration for any of the views we might put or the points that we might make. The Labor Party controls the numbers on the floor of the House of Representatives. The Labor Party disdains the value of its committee system, which is supposed to operate on a bipartisan basis. I have made speeches in this place before regarding the relevance of parliament and how I believe that we could improve that relevance if we gave more power and a greater ability to consider to the bipartisan committee system. If we allowed it even to examine legislation before this place, perhaps we would put more pressure on the bureaucracy, on the civil servants who draft the legislation which frequently comes before this place flawed and lacking input from the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have this week visiting the Parliament the first parliamentary committee from the New Zealand Government. That committee parallels the committee of which I am a member, except that those committee members call their committee Education and Science and ours is Employment, Education and Training, tracking DEET. It was interesting today in our first meeting on this historic occasion that we learned that New Zealand's committees are actual statutory authorities; that is, they are enabled by Act of parliament, not just enabled by the House of Representatives or in fact allowed continuance by the Speaker.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I appreciate your drawing that to my attention. I suppose I headed in that direction only because I decry the fact that, once again, we are debating Bills under the gag. I did rise to speak briefly about the fringe benefits tax. I guess it relates to what I said a few minutes ago regarding my conceptions of this place when I came into Federal Parliament. It is the fringe benefits tax brought in by this Labor Government that essentially brought me to this place. It was not, I would remind the House, the incidence of the tax itself so much as the attitude of the bureaucracy to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late one day in my office in private industry, in private enterprise where real goods and real services are produced, where wealth is created, I sat down to read a document put out by a gentleman by the name of Trevor Boucher entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guide to employees on a fringe benefits tax</EMPHASIS>. I very seldom get angry, but that day I became particularly angry not at the tax, not even at the unfairness of taxing one body, a corporation, for the tax of another man, the individual, but because the document itself, in bureaucratic-speak, said, `We do not believe that those who are in business, industry or commerce produce goods or services wanted by the public; rather, we believe you're all there just to rip people off and this is why we are bringing in this fringe benefits tax. We are going to catch'&mdash;as the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) said &mdash;`these people out there who rip the system off by living in remote areas of Australia where it is dry and hot and the flies surround you day and night, and a company has the audacity to let them have a house at reduced rent, and we are going to charge the company fringe benefits tax because that is a benefit to the employee'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think honourable members on the Government side of the House got it all wrong. I think probably they got it very right when they decided that we needed to consider fringe benefits as part of the overall tax system. The honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) said, `In all these Bills we are attempting to make the tax system fairer'. On this side of the House, I would say, `We would like to make the tax system more fair'. So, when we address ourselves to the fringe benefits tax, there are a number of other issues that arise cognately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at Austudy, the family allowance and the family allowance supplement, one finds that the basis for means testing those benefits to Australian citizens is taxable income. Taxable income does not take into account fringe benefits. But the tax law takes into account fringe benefits because it says that, if one individual is given a vehicle to use as part of his work requirements, that individual may use the vehicle for personal use and the company may then pay a tax for his use of the vehicle for personal business. That is called a fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take Joe Bloggs, and let us make him an employee of the XYZ Mousetrap Company. Joe Bloggs gets a salary of $10,000 a year. He also gets a free vehicle that he drives in his work, which is a few miles a year, and he drives it many miles a year on personal business. He pays no tax on that vehicle because the company pays it on his behalf. Joe Bloggs also receives from the company an allowance to send his children to a very expensive private school. Joe Bloggs pays no tax on that allowance to send his children to the very expensive private school, because the company pays the tax on his benefit. Joe Bloggs takes out a low interest loan from the company and borrows $50,000 or $100,000 at one per cent interest. Joe Bloggs pays no tax on the value of the interest that he would have paid had he taken the loan in the marketplace; instead the company pays a fringe benefits tax on his behalf. All of these items realistically add to Joe Bloggs's ability to live, to eat, to purchase and to consume; but Joe Bloggs is not taxed, the company is taxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we tax the wealth generators&mdash;that is, businesses&mdash;which do real things to make real products and provide real services that society demands and requires. That is why we are in such a mess today, is it not? It is because the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), decided to tax individuals and companies almost out of business. We do not have as many companies paying fringe benefits tax now; there are far fewer companies in this country to pay that tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I am trying to make, as succinctly as possible, is that if we are to means test Austudy as a massive benefit to students in Australia, to assist them with their living expenses while they study in a senior secondary, post-compulsory environment, why do we not include the benefits that an individual receives through fringe benefits as well as through taxable income? Why do we not do so? And I would like an answer to this question if possible: why do we not include fringe benefits for family allowance and family allowance supplement? I can give the answer. The answer lies at the heart of the reason why the fringe benefits tax was charged to the company and not to the individual, which was, and continues to be, that it is so difficult to charge the individual and the individual is unlikely to report to the Government the true value of fringe benefits received by him or her from the company. It is too hard, and people will rort the system; but we can trust companies, so we trust the companies to pay the fringe benefits tax for benefits which they give to employees and which they do not enjoy themselves and for which they receive no taxation advantage. It does work pretty well. In fact, the Government frequently boasts about the millions of dollars collected each year in fringe benefits tax. The Government boasts that the amount has increased substantially. We should have known at the beginning&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address the first part of my remarks to the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. This Bill is introduced in the context of active debate about the future role of TAFE. This debate raises important issues of policy about the future of training in Australia and of Federal-State relations. The main issues are, first of all, the relationship of TAFE to schools, universities and colleges and private providers of training; secondly, the establishment of full and adequate measures of key competencies required in the workplace, that is, the outputs of education and training; thirdly, ensuring that TAFE operates in a regulatory framework which gives institutions the flexibility they need to respond to the requirements of students, industry and the local community; and, finally, providing adequate funding to meet the growing demand for TAFE services over this decade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While TAFE is principally the responsibility of the States, the current Government has, I regret to say, done little that is constructive in this area during its term of office. It has generally resisted the effective monitoring and assessment of the outcomes of education and training, attempting control through what one might describe as the input side&mdash;control over institutions themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accord has prevented any support for the effective removal of industrial relations rigidities. Indeed, it has given active encouragement to drawing training issues into the industrial relations arena. It has sought to achieve performance by the imposition of central performance indicators without any long term framework or strategy. It was criticised for this last year by the Skills Formation Council. Finally, the Government established the unified national system of higher education without any proper consideration of the relationship of TAFE to the new institutions or of what the ending of the binary system might mean for TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The October 1990 report of the committee on training costs, the Deveson Committee, described Australian training systems as arguably `at the back of the pack' internationally. The coalition has advocated for some time the reform of TAFE, making it a more flexible and competitive sector responsive to consumer demand. Our approach is very different from the approach which the responsible Minister on the Government side of the House, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), has taken. He seems to believe, in relation to TAFE, as he believes in relation to higher education&mdash;and one suspects in relation to schools&mdash;that the only way one can achieve quality and performance is through increased central regulation. In the one area where he has had free rein, the effect has been a disaster. The coalition policy supports&mdash;it supports the Government in this&mdash;wider scope for fee paying courses, significant autonomy in staffing matters, increased autonomy to raise funds from non-government sources and, where possible, the provision of subsidies to students through TAFE study grants of one kind or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past 13 months the Government has received the reports of two independent inquiries into training, each of which addressed aspects of the role of TAFE in Australia's overall education and training systems. The Training Costs Review Committee, chaired by Ivan Deveson, submitted its report, known as the Deveson report, in October 1990. The Australian Education Council's review committee on young people's participation in post-compulsory education and training, the Finn committee, presented its report in August this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deveson report recommended the development of open and flexible training markets and the development of TAFE as institutions focused on training the trainers. The Chairman of that Committee, Ivan Deveson, then Chief Executive of Nissan Australia, warned&mdash;in words which were clearly directed towards the Government&mdash;in the foreword to his report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is critical to the future success of training and award restructuring that union/employee demands relative to training costs must be maintained at reasonable levels&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the whole subject of training must not become excessively burdened with the rigidities of the industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA>The report recommended, firstly, that people, not courses, should be subsidised. Such an approach would better identify the subsidy element. Secondly, it recommended that the development of a national training market required national recognition and portability of skills. The method of accreditation at present varies from State to State. Thirdly, it recommended that there should be greater flexibility for TAFE to charge fees and that the Commonwealth should remove its current regulations which prevent these fees. This would end the bewildering array of fees and charges. I am pleased to say that, with the bipartisan support of the Opposition, the Commonwealth did move in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report further recommended that a deferred fee or HECS type scheme could be discussed, although the equity and practical problems with such a scheme should not be underestimated. It recommended as an alternative the provision of loans to needy students. It suggested that the Government should encourage TAFE to substantially increase its role as a provider of training services to industry, mainly on a cost recovery basis, and that this should include the provision of training support. It suggested that TAFE should develop new, more flexible staff employment relations and financial and administrative arrangements which enable TAFE to compete in the market, and recommended the setting of targets for entrepreneurial activity&mdash;that is, externally raised income. The report further suggested that TAFE needed increased funding&mdash;in fact, real increases of some 5 per cent over the next five years with a substantial proportion going into the promotion of equal opportunity objectives&mdash;and that Austudy benefits for TAFE students should be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee chaired by Brian Finn of IBM recommended significantly increased participation in and the development of target attainment levels for post-compulsory education and training. The report noted that there was a particular need to strengthen the role of industry and to enhance the status of TAFE as a post-school option. I am bound to say that the emphasis that the Government has given in its education and training policies has not been conducive to raising the status of TAFE in the eyes of the community because in the whole process of reforming the higher education system there was clearly no consideration given to how TAFE might successfully interact with that system. In fact, the implication was that if one was not going on to higher education after school one was not undertaking a satisfactory option. I think the Government carries a burden of responsibility for the problem that TAFE now faces in raising its status in the eyes of the community, but it is most important that that happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommended the establishment of a set of new national targets for post-compulsory education and training which encompass schools, higher education, TAFE and other training, and which identify target levels for attainment as well as for participation. We may well take these words to again be pointed very much at the fact that throughout its term of office the Government has emphasised the numbers of students in the system but done precious little, if anything, to monitor effectively the levels of attainment that students are reaching, either in the schools or in the training systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, the Finn Committee proposed that almost all young people should take sufficient post-compulsory education and training to complete year 12 or some other initial post-school qualification and at least half should go on to higher levels. More specifically, the Committee proposed the following set of targets: at least a level one traineeship or participation in year 12 for all 18-year-olds by 1995; at least a level two traineeship or progress towards a higher level vocational or academic qualification for almost all 20-year-olds by the year 2001; and at least a vocational certificate level three or progress toward a vocational qualification above level three or a diploma or degree for at least 50 per cent of 22-year-olds by 2001. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This set of targets can be distilled into a single summary target that by the year 2001, 95 per cent of 19-year-olds should have completed year 12 or an initial post-school qualification or be participating in Education or training. To support this target, the Committee proposed that governments should agree to introduce a post-compulsory education and training guarantee whereby all young people would be guaranteed a place in school or TAFE after year 10 for two years of full time education or training or its equivalent part time for up to three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommended that the State or Territory governments should introduce a uniform compulsory requirement to attend school unless exempted at least to the end of year 10; the current entry level training arrangement should be reformed; and that a new entry level training system should be developed which extends these reformed arrangements beyond the existing apprenticeship and traineeship occupations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, total national expenditure on TAFE was some $1.6 billion, of which the Commonwealth contributed $375.1m. Meeting the TAFE participation target would undoubtedly require a significant expansion of TAFE funding, although demographic factors will restrain this growth. The Committee estimated that, on current trends, TAFE expenditure would reach $1.95 billion by the year 2000. The target for expenditure under the Committee's proposals would be $2.19 billion. The Committee concluded that TAFE's current dependence for some 80 per cent of its funding on the States would mean that the TAFE system would continue to be squeezed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Finn report was welcomed by the coalition for its emphasis on the better reporting of educational and training outcomes as a guarantee of quality rather than an emphasis which would have reflected, I regret to say, the Government's approach on the central regulation of inputs. Nevertheless, a signal shortcoming of the report is its failure to address some of the vital structural issues involved in lifting incentives and improving morale in education and training institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A broader, more far reaching approach would have set an agenda for reform which emphasised the need for more autonomous and flexible institutions, with the capacity to respond to the student market and to the needs of industry. It would have emphasised the need for industrial relations reform and the devolution of staff training matters to TAFE institutions and greater independence of management in the schools and TAFE. Neither of these vital structural reforms was considered by the Finn Committee. I regret to say that, in the flurry of announcements and briefings to the press that have been given by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) in the lead up to the Special Premiers Conference, there has been a great deal of reference to the willingness of the Commonwealth to centralise funding and control over TAFE but, so far as I can see, there have been no announcements and no recognition on the public platform of the need for the structural reforms in TAFE that are absolutely fundamental to improving the accessibility, performance and status of these institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent Government proposals that are being put before the Premiers effectively adopt the Finn No. 1 option for the Commonwealth to assume funding for TAFE. The proposals have received a mixed reception. They have received some positive comment from the business community and from Mr Finn himself. I noticed that the New South Wales Minister for Further Education, Training and Employment, Mr Fahey, was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 18 October as calling the proposal blackmail and saying that it was unacceptable. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 16 October, South Australia's Labor Party Minister for Further Education, Mr Rann, said that his State would reject any East German centralist model for TAFE. One can only endorse those sentiments because he has seen such a model imposed on higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even within the Minister's own Party, I think there is clearly a perception of his centralist tendencies and their deadening effect. No doubt there will be much sympathy on the back benches of the Party for these kinds of comments. It is common knowledge that the Dawkins model for higher education has been a disaster, with the destruction of the binary system, the destruction of institutional autonomy and the destruction of collegial relations within those institutions. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a hidden agenda for higher education in relation to enterprise bargaining which was revealed by Mr Paul Hickey earlier this year in Darwin. I am sure that members of the public are grateful to him for revealing that secret agenda. He is a very honest public servant. It certainly gave the lie to the nonsense which was put about both by the senior and the junior Ministers in this area when that matter was raised as an important item for reform by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly the issues involved are politically complex. We will learn much from the discussions at the Premiers Conference. But, whatever the outcome of that conference, the coalition will continue to recognise the key role of TAFE in Australia's training system. We acknowledge the need for the building up of the TAFE system over future years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not oppose this Bill, but I foreshadow an amendment which I will move criticising the Government for its failure to recognise adequately the role of technical and further education in Australia's education and training systems, its continuing emphasis on centralist solutions and its failure to recognise the need for more flexible TAFE institutions which can be more responsive to student and industry demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) provides grants of financial assistance to the States, the Northern Territory and higher education institutions. Among its provisions is the transference to the Commonwealth of Victoria's share of the responsibility for funding the higher education program at the Victorian College of Agriculture and Horticulture so that it is funded entirely through the Higher Education Funding Act from next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The VCAH is a multi-campus institution, now amalgamated with the University of Melbourne. The college is unique throughout Australia because only one other college that I am aware of, the Darwin college, provides advanced programs and TAFE programs under the one umbrella and, by all accounts, is successful. Having visited that institution and having spent some time on a number of its campuses, I have been impressed with the quality of the programs that it puts forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funding announced in this Bill also includes expenditure for commitments announced in and since the Budget by the Government. The post-Budget announcements attempt to address the enrolment and overcrowding pressures being felt in institutions. The present Bill makes no attempt to alter the legislative framework established by the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 as amended. One must, therefore, note that the Bill provides that a maximum allocation of funds is set for each program but that ministerial discretion will still determine the actual amount to be granted and the conditions under which those grants will be made. Phrases such as `in the opinion of the Minister' and `the Minister may approve' appear throughout the legislation. To many in higher education, those phrases will be redolent with meaning as they witness the system being administered under this eastern European-style framework, subject to constant exercises of discretion by the Department and the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a political system for the allocation of resources. Importantly, it was described as fundamentally flawed by the Industry Commission on that ground because, as the system is structured at present, it has very little capacity to respond to the demands of those seeking its services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to say in this debate that the current problems of unmet demand and overcrowding are, to a significant extent, a result of the rigidities imposed by the Government's regulatory framework for higher education. Institutions are limited in their admissions by quotas imposed by the Government and have restricted access to capital for development; student charges, other than for amenities, are determined entirely by the Government; course profiles require Government approval; and there are serious rigidities in the employment conditions for staff. These restrictions distort demand and prevent institutions from responding adequately to such patterns of demand as they perceive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the system of funding higher education has drawn strong criticism from the Industry Commission in its August 1991 report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exports of Education Services</EMPHASIS>. The Commission concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is evident to the Commission that the current arrangements for funding higher education are flawed. The most obvious manifestation of this is the growing number of qualified Australian students who are unable to gain entry to Australian universities.</PARA>
<PARA>In its report, the Commission noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without a mechanism which takes better account of the costs and value to society and to the student of education services, decisions by the Government and institutions as to how many places there are and how they are allocated will very likely be wrong.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are not the words of the Opposition; those are the words of the Government's most authoritative advisory Commission. That Commission has said that, under the system established by the Government, resource allocation decisions will very likely be wrong. Of course, that would have to be said of any system which depends ultimately for those decisions on political and bureaucratic discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission recommended that the Government accept the need to alter current arrangements so that qualified domestic students are not precluded from a place in public universities and that a reference be sent to the Industry Commission on appropriate means to meet the need and rectify the current system. The report further noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission's concern is that there is a need for a public inquiry to determine what arrangements would be most appropriate for the provision of funds for higher education, including the mechanisms by which this might be achieved. It does not accept that previous inquiries are sufficient: there has been clear evidence during the course of this inquiry that there are a wide range of inconsistencies, inequities and inappropriate incentives present.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has of course already indicated that he does not support such a reference; he does not intend to loosen the Government's political and bureaucratic grip on the nation's universities, even if it means that some 30,000 qualified students are excluded, and even if it means that next year a greater number will be excluded because of the measures the Government has taken in relation to overcrowding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anticipating the refusal of the Government to provide a reference&mdash;and we hope there will not be such a refusal; I am still waiting on the decision of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) on this matter&mdash;the Commission recommends immediate implementation of one of the discussed options, which overcomes the serious problem that qualified students who do not have a funded place are prohibited from public university study. I submit that makes a complete mockery of any claims of equity in the existing arrangements. And what does the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), a self-styled man of the Left, have to say about this? When asked on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Face The Press</EMPHASIS> what values from the Left he brought to his portfolio, he replied:</PARA>

They could get industry sponsorships. There are institutions in Australia which have told me they will admit those students and will get industry sponsorships for them and put additional funding into our higher education, but the Minister will not allow it.

There is no perception on the part of that Minister or the Government of any strategy to build up the universities in Australia over this decade. We waited a year for that statement and when it came down it was a damp squib; it failed completely to put forward any intellectual justification that was worth a carrot against the arguments that were spelt out at great length by the Government's own advisory body&mdash;the Industry Commission. The main initiative in that statement for the decade was a $70m fund which would be distributed amongst institutions according to whether they were using their resources well or not&mdash;another centralist initiative which will set up someone to decide whether the institutions are administering their resources well or not. </PARA>

Again, in stark contrast to the Opposition, this Government is not being paralogistic, arguing in circles or begging the real question and is not failing to see the wood for the trees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever this House debates education, employment and training&mdash;even the Opposition backbenchers know this to be true&mdash;the Opposition front bench greets the debate with derision and the big yawn. Where does the Opposition stand on the matter of training? It is really there for all to see. Honourable members opposite resort to word fencing, chicanery and pettifogging. In other words, they are muddled, confused, woolly headed and very prone to unwarranted conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill (No.2) is to provide Commonwealth funds for TAFE colleges in 1992 and to provide cost supplementation for 1991 grants. The Bill provides an opportunity for members of this House to focus upon the significance of vocational training to meet the current and future needs of this nation. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), in a speech on 1 October to a joint session of the Australian College of Education and the Australian Council of Deans of Education, made the very strong point that Australia needed to be a clever country certainly, but it also needed to become a capable country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, way back in 1968 the OECD recommendations to Australia were to dramatically increase year 12 retention rates up to 80 per cent or 90 per cent, to increase tertiary participation to around 30 per cent and to involve a significantly increased percentage in vocational training. In 15 years of neglect, Opposition members when in government virtually all but ignored those recommendations, placing this nation at a huge disadvantage in the international economy. They went for the resources boom. Does the House remember their reliance on a small elite and a huge, largely unskilled or semiskilled work force, and how they forgot about the most important resource and attribute&mdash;the one between people's ears?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An examination of the current education, training and employment scene is enlightening. There has been a dramatic increase in year 12 retention rates from 40.6 per cent in 1983 to over 70 per cent in 1991. There is an ever-increasing requirement for skills in the work force. There are declining full time employment opportunities for young people in the age range of 15 to 19 years. In 1966, 59 per cent of this group of 15- to 19-year-olds were in full time employment, compared with just 28 per cent last year. Not all of this change is accounted for by increased participation in education. Substantial numbers of young people are attempting to enter the work force without post-school education or training. Right at the moment, 30 per cent of young people do not complete year 12. Half of this group proceed with some sort of training, mainly apprenticeships. However, the other half&mdash;15 per cent of the total group&mdash;are at great risk in the labour market. Over 40 per cent of those in the 15- to 19-year-old age range enter the work force without formal post-school education or training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures, which form the background to the Finn report commissioned by this Government, highlight dramatically the extremely limited opportunities for two-thirds of school leavers. That is particularly true, and disproportionately so, for school leavers in electorates such as mine of Port Adelaide; many young people do not enter higher education. Apprenticeships have not increased as a proportion of the youth population since 1980. Full time TAFE places account for less than 3 per cent of 15- to 19-year-olds. The apprenticeship system is also highly gender biased with fewer than 10 per cent of apprenticeships being for females. Most of them, of course, are hairdressers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost all of the growth in educational participation has been in schools and higher education. From 1983 until 1990 participation trends in TAFE have hardly changed; growth rates have averaged 2.8 per cent per year. This Government has been responsible for a revolution in retention rates in higher education. However, there is still a long way to go, particularly in regard to vocational training and the State responsibility of primary education. The two areas of vocational training and primary schooling are still Cinderellas and the poor cousins. Under the current predominantly State funded regime, the TAFE and the training sector have suffered the major resource constraints since the middle 1980s, thus leading to serious barriers to access and a chequered pattern of growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the six years to May 1990 the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in TAFE colleges rose by 38,000 nationally, at an average growth rate, as I said before, of only 2.8 per cent per year. I clearly acknowledge that in the interests of this nation that growth rate is not good enough and needs to be addressed. By comparison, over the same period, growth in universities&mdash;funded almost exclusively by the Commonwealth&mdash;meant that numbers rose by 112,400 nationally at an average growth rate of 7.3 per cent per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1983, while the number of 15- to 19-year-olds in higher education increased by 80 per cent, the numbers in TAFE rose by less than 12 per cent. As I said earlier, together schools and universities have accounted for virtually all the growth in education and training amongst 15- to 19-year-olds since 1983. In the vocational skills sector, as in primary schools, which is almost exclusively a State government responsibility, long term strategies are patently required. Finn pointed out very clearly and very powerfully that there needs to be a growth of between 35 per cent and 50 per cent in vocational training. In 1983 education and training pathways for young people recorded the following facts: 15 per cent were at university; 25 per cent were in vocational training; but 60 per cent had no post-school training. That was the track record and the legacy of the Opposition when it was in Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, 25 per cent of young people were at university&mdash;an increase of 10 per cent; 30 per cent of young people were in vocational training&mdash;representing some increase but not enough; but there were still 45 per cent of young people with no post-compulsory training. Finn sets out ambitious new vocational targets for young people to be achieved by the year 2000. He said that 95 per cent of 19-year-olds should complete the equivalent of year 12; 30 per cent of the post-year 12 group should attend university; and 50 per cent&mdash;this is the key&mdash;of that group should be involved in post-compulsory vocational skills, education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two major strategies are enunciated by Finn to support those targets. Firstly, there should be an education and training guarantee to give young people guaranteed access to TAFE similar to that which they already enjoy in relation to schools. Secondly, there should be a reformed and extended entry level training to expand opportunities for young people who do not go to university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community in general recognises the importance of education and training. I remind the honourable member for Goldstein that since 1984 ANOP has noted a large shift upwards in the importance which parents, young people and the wider community place on education and training. In fact, the Minister pointed out recently that in 1990 more than 91 per cent of parents endorsed the view that all young people should complete 12 years of education and training, compared with about 70 per cent in 1984. The ACTU, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Business Council of Australia and the Metal Trades Industry Association have either endorsed or supported the broad thrust of the Finn targets and strategies and the Commonwealth's preferred response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's offer is a positive proposal to meet the needs of TAFE, which is facing a shortfall of 145,000 places nationally in 1992. In a recent edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, in an article headed `TAFE expansion urgent', the President of the National Union of Students, Ms Brigid Freeman, is reported as saying that centralised funding would allow students to move more freely between State systems without being penalised and that students wanted better links between TAFE, universities, industry and the workplace. Knee-jerk reactions by some people in regard to greater Commonwealth involvement in TAFE is somewhat pre-emptive. Australians expect their State and Federal politicians to raise themselves above political point scoring at a local level and to come to grips with this country's problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a bit of an attitude in this nation of knocking everything just for the sake of it. When the announcement was made that the multifunction polis&mdash;most of it in my electorate&mdash;would get the green light to proceed, some individuals and sections of the community came out almost immediately against the project even before they could possibly have known what concepts were involved. That sort of behaviour has frustrated the innovative and creative people in this country for decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The education proposals by the Commonwealth do not represent a plot, as some have said, for a power grab. As with the MFP, the proposals encapsulate a vision and a commitment to planning for the future rather than just letting it happen willy-nilly. Why should we not plan for the future? Resource implications of the Finn proposals are substantial, but they are not impossible to meet. At the highest end of Finn's estimates, the increase in annual recurrent costs to governments between the years 1991 and 2001 would about $4.4 billion. Capital costs over the decade would be of the order of $3.2 billion. The greatest proportional increase would be in TAFE. Expenditure in TAFE would increase by between 37 per cent and 48 per cent. Expenditure on higher education would increase by 18 per cent to 28 per cent. Schools expenditure would increase by 12 per cent to 21 per cent. All these increases would depend on wage growth assumptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finn has also noted that, under current funding arrangements, TAFE has become a poor cousin to the other sectors. I add that this also applies to primary schools. This is most clearly shown in the contrast between substantial growth in higher education funded by the Commonwealth and recent declines in TAFE funding by the States. Recent State budgets offer no immediate prospect of an expansion of TAFE. State budgets in Victoria, Tasmania, and my own state of South Australia have restricted TAFE to no growth in financial resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Australia in fact increased TAFE fees by up to 40 per cent. Tasmania introduced such severe fee arrangements in 1991 that enrolments in some vocational courses fell by over 30 per cent. Queensland is the only State which is increasing its funding to TAFE; but that is not a good story either, as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) would well know. Queensland's participation in TAFE is 23 per cent behind the national average. </PARA>

The Special Premiers Conference this month provides a historic opportunity to ensure that Australia's future needs for skills and training is nationally led, ideas driven and does not fall between the cracks of inter-governmental relations. The Government's preferred position is for the Commonwealth to assume full funding responsibility for all publicly funded education and training beyond year 12 or its equivalent. That would mean effectively increasing the Commonwealth's contribution from about 10 per cent of the total now to about 70 per cent. Obviously, this would require a constructive partnership of the States to provide the financial boost needed to take vocational education and training into the next century.</PARA></TALK.START>

Secondly, it provides a wider definition of capital projects to encompass major investments in course material and equipment which substitute for capital. The recent Government statement <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Higher Education: Quality and Diversity in the 1990s</EMPHASIS> sets a new direction for the development of higher education policy, centring on the development of a comprehensive set of measures to further enhance the quality of higher education teaching and provision. </PARA>

There will be the formation of an independent national quality assurance structure, encompassing all stakeholders in the system, to report and comment on the application and effectiveness of quality enhancement measures developed by institutions. Also taken into account will be the establishment of a national centre for teaching excellence in higher education to examine and disseminate information about good teaching practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the honourable member for Goldstein would remember the book by Professor Gundy, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Buck Stops Here</EMPHASIS>, in which I think he described the quality of teaching in our higher education centres as abysmal and in our equivalent CAEs as just slightly above abysmal. As well, there is a reference to the Higher Education Council to explore the characteristics of quality in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee described this proposition as `a positive, major initiative'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth-funded student load has increased by 40 per cent between 1983 and 1991. Recent decisions will increase the Commonwealth-funded load by a further 9.3 per cent between 1991 and 1994. As a share of the 17- to 64-year-old population, Commonwealth-funded participation in higher education has increased from under 3.5 per cent in 1983 to 4 per cent in 1990. With recent decisions, it is projected to exceed 4.2 per cent in 1994 and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Growth in 1993 and 1994 is explicitly designed to maintain opportunities for undergraduates, and to increase postgraduate places in response to increased demand for postgraduate qualifications and a projected shortfall in the academic labor market during the 1990s. In 1991, there has been an unexpected level of overenrolment by institutions, leading to a problem of overcrowding in a number of cases. This problem reflected a number of factors, but in a number of cases it appeared that the admissions process had not been monitored closely enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To assist institutions to deal with this problem, the Government is prepared to be flexible on the achievement of the commencing and total load targets set for each institution. From 1992 additional flexibility will be provided, allowing institutions facing the likelihood of exceeding total load targets for reasons beyond their control to adjust their commencing load by up to 5 per cent. Unfortunately, press coverage implied that this may result in 5 per cent fewer commencements in aggregate than provided by the Government. This is not expected to be the case; it is expected that the higher education sector will, in aggregate, enrol close to its commencing target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The State distribution of Commonwealth funded places has become more equitable as the growth in places has been allocated to States according to relative needs. For example, in 1983 participation in higher education as a share of the 17- to 64-year-old age group ranged from 3.1 per cent in New South Wales and 3.2 per cent in Queensland to 3.8 per cent in Western Australia and 3.9 per cent in Victoria. By 1993, the range will be from 4 per cent in New South Wales and South Australia to 4.2 per cent in Queensland and 4.4 per cent in Victoria. </PARA>

In contrast, Victoria has a very high participation rate&mdash;an expected 4.4 per cent of the 17- to 64-year-old population in 1992 compared with the national average of 4.15 per cent. To assist in improving the national balance, Victoria will receive about 22 per cent of the places over the 1991-93 triennium&mdash;below its population share of 25.8 per cent in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summing up, I think it is quite clear that this Government has had a real and much admired commitment to education and training in this country. This is evidenced by particular gains in higher education and secondary school enrolments. That the focus now should be on vocational training is proper and correct. I hope that the States will take some lead in the future, too, and redress the problems that they have with the very foundation years of education&mdash;those spent in primary school. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate centres on one key theme, as far as I am concerned. I see it as a debate concerning whether the Government can provide the funds for the necessary training and education of our younger population. When we look at that question, what we notice about the present Government is that, in those areas where we have to generate wealth so that industry, businesses and people can be taxed so that we can provide for services such as education, there is a great stifling effect on development and progress in generating extra money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cake has been put into a clamp. The amount of revenue which can be generated in this country has been throttled so that now we are faced with a crisis in a crucial area. As a nation, we want our young people to be better trained, but over the last five or six years the Government has given no incentive to those businesses that really want to get on. I think of Coronation Hill&mdash;and, back in my area, a proposed world class pulp mill for Wesley Vale. That went down the tube. It had the capacity to generate extra taxation revenue for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country now we see a squeeze coming on with the demand of so many young people. I give the Government credit for encouraging people to stay on at school, but the Government did not provide properly for those young people as they stayed on. The Government did not provide extra money so that extra classrooms could be built for year 11 and year 12 students, particularly in my area. The Government did not provide extra money for TAFE education so that the tooling necessary for developing the skills for the 1990s and into the 2000s would be there for the young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know why the Government cannot provide these resources. It is because it is not generating the revenue. I say to the Government that it cannot expect Australia to be a clever country while at the same time it creates an atmosphere of disincentive for investment. We have to get these two things together. If we want to provide good government services in this country, first of all we have to generate the taxes and the revenue to do it. If this Government had been wise in 1985 and 1986 when it told us that there needed to be reform of the industrial relations system, the waterfront and shipping, and had gone on and done it, the revenue would now be available for our universities and 30,000 young people would not be locked out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the other debate. We are at the end of 1991 and the Government is telling us&mdash;it is not the Opposition's figure&mdash;that there are 145,000 people wanting to go into training for whom there are no places. There are 30,000 young people sitting outside the doors of our universities who cannot get in. That is the nub of the debate. We can have lots of figures about what has been achieved, but the fundamental line is that&mdash;145,000 people wanting to be trained who cannot be trained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 30,000 young people who want to get into tertiary institutions. They have done year 12 studies&mdash;12 years of studying in our schools. They are qualified, but the Government cannot provide the assistance for them to go in. Yet it provides, as the shadow Minister said, opportunity for overseas people to come in. They can pay their way into our universities. Why cannot Australians, if they want to, pay their way? What is wrong with paying one's way to get a better education?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government members sit opposite with glum faces&mdash;because there is nothing wrong. There is nothing wrong with paying one's own way. If people want to do it, why can they not have that freedom of choice? Why should governments in Australia have rules and regulations that prevent people from being better educated? What right has a government to do it? No government has such a right. But, of course, the Labor Party in Australia has these ideological views that must not be transgressed, whether young people's lives are being affected or not. That is the Government's attitude to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in the comment of the previous speaker that this was not a plot to centralise control of TAFE education. Maybe it is not a plot, but, on the basis of experience of Labor governments, the reality is that if they get their hands on the money they want to control the whole show. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at our experience in regard to higher education and the universities just recently&mdash;the latest experience that Australians can look to. Surely that must be the most credible example because it is recent. In the legislative framework we find two little phrases used in regard to grants: `in the opinion of the Minister' and `the Minister may approve'. Those phrases occur repeatedly in the Act. The universities are told that they can be independent. We can remember the debate here. The universities and the CAEs were to be totally free to choose whether they joined. Were they? They certainly were not. They were forced, cajoled and herded together, to put it simply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have people saying to us tonight that this is not a plot in regard to training and TAFE. It certainly is not a plot, because a plot is usually something which is secret. But in this sense the Australian people can see right through it.

We have kept retention rates for years 11 and 12 and we have moved them up and we will continue to do the same'. When we think of the strategy which this Government has undertaken in education, particularly under Minister Dawkins, it is a bit like a nice coloured balloon&mdash;a big air balloon, colourful and exciting. When that balloon begins to have difficulty, another balloon should be ready so that when it crashes to the ground and looks a pretty awful sight another colourful balloon is going up. So people's eyes are drawn away from the mess of the balloon which is falling to the ground to the new balloon which is going up and, hopefully, they will be so distracted that they will not see the difficulties that exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the House a few examples in my own electorate in regard to TAFE education. This Government has been good in regard to education. It has continued to put money into education. Why is it then that in my area, while the Federal Labor Government has been espousing that rhetoric, in my home State, under another Labor Government, classroom after classroom, floor after floor, campus after campus is being abolished and closed down? It is ridiculous. We can walk into beautiful buildings whose rooms are full of material which is not being used because of the inadequacies of the Labor Administration. Maybe the reason is centralised power. The industrial relations system in education and the TAFE area is also greatly debilitating to this country. The sooner this country breaks down that industrial relations system in education, the better our young people and this country will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many things that this Government has done in regard to education have been fundamentally flawed. The reason is that it is centralist in its approach. The Government wants to back the teachers' unions in this country above young people's futures. An honourable member said in this House that there will be some sort of assessment or measurement of standards. I remember that we tried to do that in schools in 1978 or 1980. A survey was conducted on how to maintain standards. Who shot it down? The Australian Teachers Federation. Who is it backed by? The Labor Government. That is the situation. The people who have worked in those circumstances know it well, but it is unfortunate that the Australian Teachers Federation will not accept measurement standards in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) that the industrial relations system in education has to be broken down and freed up so that our young people, and their parents, feel that they are getting a better education. There is a great need to do that. A total of 30,000 people are not getting a position in our universities and 145,000 are not getting appropriate training. This Government has been in power for the last eight years and it is a great tragedy that its policies have failed to such a mammoth degree. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the two Bills before the House, namely, the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2). It is mainly the latter Bill that I will concentrate on this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's higher education system has undergone a period of unparalleled growth and structural change since the release of the Government's White Paper on higher education in July 1988. Unlike the Opposition and, particularly, the shadow education spokesperson, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), this Government is of the belief that all Australians have the right of access to all services that our society offers, including, of course, quality higher education. Both of these Bills build on this social justice philosophy by funding a greater number of places in post-school education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the contribution made by the honourable member for Goldstein in this debate, I can assure him and the House that I am happy to be a captive of an ideological position which encompasses a vision and a philosophy for the future development of our nation's education rather than a captive, as he is, of a failed and discredited past which had no direction, no vision and no future. That clearly describes the Opposition's position on education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Goldstein had the hide to suggest that the pre-1972 system of full fees for all university places, with a system of scholarships to allegedly assist disadvantaged groups, would somehow improve equity and access to tertiary places. I was a university student during those dark days when that was the system and it was clearly evident, as backed up by statistical information, that numbers of students from low income families and disadvantaged groups were much lower than they are under the current system. It was an elitist system then and if it were reintroduced it would be a regressive and elitist system again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hawke Government has achieved a great deal in the higher education sector and these Bills will continue to build on these achievements. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) provides for enrolment growth; capital funding, including a renovations program; a pilot scheme for joint funding of places with industry; advanced engineering centres; additional research grants; and normal costs supplementation, including salary increases. Funding for the third year of the new triennium will include funding for an additional 2,845 intakes, a further increase in capital expenditure to $277m and approximately $75m for a new quality enhancement scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is continuing its commitment to quality in accordance with the statement, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Higher Education: Quality and Diversity in the 1990s</EMPHASIS>, which was released last month. The amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 will allow for the implementation of the Budget decisions to provide additional funding in 1992 over and above normal triennial commitments. One measure is the inclusion of some $70m annually from 1994 for a quality enhancement program whereby participating institutions will receive additional funding on the basis of good performance in the use of all resources to attain the best quality in their programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill focuses on a comprehensive set of measures to maintain and enhance the quality of higher education teaching and provision. The extra funds will be used to reward institutions for making the best use of all their available resources. As outlined by my colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), institutional participation in the new quality assurance arrangements will be voluntary and the allocation of normal operating grants will be unaffected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's approach to quality assurance balances institutional autonomy with public accountability. It is based on self-assessment by institutions rather than relying on external assessments of quality. It relates the monitoring of quality to the goals of individual institutions. It involves assessments which include both qualitative and quantitative indicators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill allows for comparisons to be made against the different circumstances of institutions, including the composition of their student population and their performance over time. It will, therefore, encourage diversity and innovation while confirming public confidence in the higher education system and reinforcing its international reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there will be a comprehensive review of modes of delivery in higher education to look at how technology can best be harnessed to improve access to, and the quality and efficiency of, higher education. In this respect, the Government is taking the lead internationally in providing a funding incentive to institutions over and above funding for student load to promote the highest possible level of quality in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the release earlier in the year of the report of the Australian Education Council Review Committee, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Young People's Participation in Post-Compulsory Education and Training</EMPHASIS>, more simply known as the Finn report, there has been a greater focus on credit transfer between TAFE and the higher education sector. This report confirmed that employment opportunities for people, especially young people, are severely diminished when their access to education or training is limited. The report argues that economic imperatives and the resulting work force changes mean that almost all young people will require some post-compulsory education or training. The Finn Committee advocated greater transfer arrangements within TAFE and higher education institutions and recommended that money be allocated to further the credit transfer process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental conclusion of the Finn report is the need for a major expansion in the provision of vocational education opportunities over the coming decade. The TAFE system is the major provider of vocational education services in this country and is funded principally by the States. By contrast with the higher education system, the TAFE sector has suffered major resource constraints for a number of years, including funding cuts, leading to serious barriers to access and unprecedented and unacceptable levels of unmet demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my State of Queensland, the TAFE sector was underresourced, poorly managed and unable to reflect the needs and aspirations of Queensland's young people during the dark years of Liberal-National rule. It has been only in the past 18 months that real increases in TAFE funding have been provided by the Goss Labor Government to redress this previous neglect. But there is still a long way to go to catch up and reach the national average, let alone the funding levels required to achieve participation targets recommended in the Finn report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nationally, the rate of growth in State funding for, and therefore participation in, TAFE has not matched demand and certainly has not matched the growth that has occurred in higher education. In the six years to May 1990, the number of 15- to 24-year-olds enrolled in TAFE colleges rose by 38,000 nationally at an average rate of only 2.8 per cent per year. Over the same period, the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in universities rose by 112,400 nationally at an average rate of 7.3 per cent per year. Since 1983, while the numbers of 15- to 19-year-olds in higher education increased by over 80 per cent, numbers in TAFE rose by less than 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent State Budgets in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania have restricted TAFE to no growth in financial resources. Queensland is the only State which is increasing its funding to TAFE, but its participation rate in TAFE still is 23 per cent behind the national average, because of the starvation of funds that TAFE suffered under the previous government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a nation, we are confronting a basic choice: do we continue on our present course of the Federal Government upgrading the capacity and resources of our universities while the vocational education and training system, under the administration of the States, continues to decline in its capacity to address the needs of our young people and our work force or do we strike a new balance between the two sectors and accord equal esteem to the two main education pathways to employment for school leavers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Finn report has put forward the view that, if we are to live up to our aspirations as an advanced nation providing real opportunities for all, we have no choice but to significantly upgrade our vocational, education and training system as a matter of urgency. This will require a commitment of resources by both the States and the Commonwealth and a national approach to skills recognition, accreditation and articulation. Existing structures and institutional arrangements in TAFE and training will need to be reviewed and in some cases radically altered. A new partnership will need to be forged with industry, especially in the key area of structured entry level training. New links will have to be developed between schools, TAFE and universities to promote mobility and portability of skills across different sectors and between employment pathways. Most importantly, a change in community attitudes will be essential if vocational skills education is to receive the priority which our national interests demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the university sector, the Commonwealth Government has pledged further commitments for growth which will take us 94 per cent of the way to the ambitious targets for higher education set by the Finn committee for the year 2001. In the vocational skills area, there would need to be growth of between 35 and 50 per cent over the next decade to reach these targets. The Finn committee has estimated that to meet its targets an additional $814m per year in current prices will be required by the year 2001 to fund the running costs of an improved vocational education training system. Capital expenditure needs will increase this figure to about $1 billion per annum. A new report released just last Friday indicates that this figure may well be a considerable underestimate of the costs of implementing Finn's targets. The State governments will have to face the reality that new funding arrangements for the vocational education sector will have to be negotiated in a realistic and meaningful way if real equality of employment pathways after school is to be achieved. We can no longer rely on parochial arguments about control if we are serious about providing expanded training opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increased participation in higher education has always been a major goal of this Government. Commonwealth funded student load has increased by 40 per cent between 1983 and 1991. The recent decisions by the Government will see an increase in the Commonwealth funded load of a further 9.3 per cent. However, growth in places in tertiary education needs to be accompanied by growth in capital funding if overcrowding is to be avoided. The higher education system has experienced some particular stresses in recent times as a result of high levels of overenrolment and overcrowding. The Government has announced in the Budget a range of measures to deal with these problems. They are an acceleration of the capital program, the introduction of renovation grants on a matching funds basis, and additional recurrent funding to help cope with enrolment pressures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The State distribution of Commonwealth funded places has become more equitable as the growth in places has been allocated to States according to relative needs. This has been good news for my own State of Queensland. Queensland has for a long time faced a funding imbalance in terms of provision of tertiary places. Queensland is receiving 23.6 per cent of the increase in places over the 1991-93 triennium. This is well above its population share of 16.9 per cent. This continues the pattern of the past seven years where the Federal Government has moved Queensland's share from 14 per cent of places in 1983 to 16.3 per cent of places in 1993. We will have to move further to catch up, but there is a clear commitment from the Federal Government to address this past neglect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of this increased funding can clearly be seen in the statistics for the Nathan campus of Griffith University, which services my electorate. In 1983, Griffith University's enrolment in terms of effective full time student units was 2,045. By 1991, this had risen to 5,268&mdash;an increase of 158 per cent. The additional capital funds will allow the Government to make early decisions on new capital projects to commence in 1993 in order to facilitate the proper planning of these developments by institutions. The Government has increased capital funding every year it has been in office. This has meant that between 1983 and 1992 there has been a fivefold increase in the level of funding&mdash;up from $48.9m in 1983 to $265.8m in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before us includes provisions to extend the definition of higher education capital projects to encompass projects other than merely building projects. These provisions will mean that the Government will be able to provide greater funding towards equipment and course material. The wider definition recognises the potential for new technologies and alternative delivery modes to improve delivery of and access to higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides funds for a Commonwealth program to establish three advanced engineering centres in partnership with host institutions and industry. The focus of the centres will be advanced undergraduate and postgraduate education and training. This is a tremendous initiative, as many honourable members will agree that we are suffering as a result of a dearth of engineers. This measure will not only increase the number of engineering graduates but also make them even more compatible with industry, and it should be welcomed by all sides. These advanced engineering centres will provide courses for industry and technical and further education teachers. They will also provide professional retraining for experienced engineers and applied research and design services for industry. This initiative will mean that engineers and graduates from a related field will be more compatible with industry. The Commonwealth is providing just under $10m over the triennium for the establishment and ongoing costs associated with this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has committed itself to spending some $12.9 billion on higher education over the 1992-94 triennium. Continued growth in the system will provide expanding opportunities for Australians to participate in higher education and, with the Government's new measures to further enhance the quality of higher education, teaching and provision, Australian students can expect to receive a higher education which is the equal of any in the world. I commend the Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted tonight to speak to this pair of Bills, but will confine my remarks this evening to the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. There has been a great deal of discussion in recent weeks about the Finn report&mdash;a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Young people's participation in post-compulsory education and training</EMPHASIS>. From time to time we also mention its predecessor, the Deveson report, which looked into the costs of training. But I would like to quote from a book written by Michael Porter, of Harvard University, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Competitive Advantage of Nations</EMPHASIS>. Professor Porter said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are respected and high quality forms of higher education besides the university. A high percentage of students who attend university is not necessarily a sign of the most effective human resource development. A system for vocational, technical and specialised industry training is a central priority in any advanced economy.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Porter was right and most of us entering the debate in this country today would not question that finding. Brian Finn's committee said, amongst many other things, that it supports absolutely the convergence of general and vocational education and an increasing emphasis on vocational training in senior years of secondary school and in TAFE, and that because of our history and our method of development we have encouraged a small portion of the population from both advantaged and disadvantaged backgrounds to enter university&mdash;generally less than 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have controlled that largely by the number of places, not by any mechanism of funding. We have said, `There are only so many of you who can go, regardless of how many of you wish to go or regardless of how many of you are competent'. We then set up, alongside that, a separate system of vocational training, but somehow we got it wrong. We got it wrong in that we tended to value apprenticeships, which represent only a very small portion of vocations in our country, but we did not value other forms of vocational training, to the point that vocational high schools in my own State, and in the State of New South Wales in particular, eventually folded because of community pressure. The community said that the vocational high schools provided a second-class education and people did not want that for their children. The children said, `Look, nobody pays much attention to us; the school is scungy, it is second rate, the teachers are second rate'. So eventually we gave up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sort of dual system has worked well in Germany. It has worked terrifically there. Germany has produced some of the most skilled artisans and trades people in the world. But it did not work for us in Australia. Finn said, and most of us who talk about this topic today reckon, that we have to move vocational training back into the senior years of high school. Increasingly, as our youth value education, we must encourage them to stay on&mdash;not because they are receiving Austudy, not because there are no jobs or not because there is nothing else to do, but because there will be useful outcomes for them when they leave school. Finn recommends that by the year 2000 some 50 per cent of the young student population at age 19 should still be in some form of training or education or in a job. I would support that target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Finn report recommends that TAFE must increase its concentration on broad based pre-vocational or entry level courses&mdash;that is to say, many of us have been critical of some parts of TAFE for trying to be everything to everyone. Basket weaving 3 and pottery making 27 may be terrific courses, but they are not what we are on about when we talk about being a clever country. I think we all agree on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Finn report says that industry must take a more active role in the development and support of training activities in schools, in TAFE, in university and in industry itself. There are lots of reasons why industry in Australia has not participated in training programs, in vocational training, to the extent that industry should have been a participant. One reason is the fact that we have not really allowed industry courses to be certified by the public bureaucracy, which largely has been responsible for training. It was three months ago that the first of the private training institutes run by industry was certified to provide a certificate to students which said that their courses were as good as they would have received in a TAFE, even though they may have been several times better. So we have not encouraged industry to develop its own training programs. We have encouraged the public sector but not the private. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the added disadvantage that many of our major companies are overseas owned. For whatever reason they have expected us, because of the nature of our public funded system, to supply the training for them. Obviously that has not worked. So we would support industry's taking a more active role, and we would hope that it does. I have to say that the training guarantee levy has not been successful in the slightest in encouraging industry in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would support the broad thrust of Finn on participation targets, of which there are several. I would think that those targets themselves should not be the end but only the means, because at the end of the day we are looking for quality. To the largest extent possible we want the entirety of our youth to be well educated or trained directly for a job in industry. Of course, increasingly training is becoming a lifelong experience worldwide, whether it is education generally or specific skills acquisition for specific tasks in the world of business, industry or commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would support Finn's recommendation that the concept of 12 full years of guaranteed full time education or training be provided in either schools or TAFE so that we can say to all our young people, `Firstly, we require you to stay on at least for 10 years in all States, and we would like you to stay on for 12 years'. Whether we provide vocational training in senior secondary colleges for the final two years of high school or we provide it in TAFE along with general academic courses really matters not. It is a matter for the individual States, and I would encourage diversity and competition because the more competitive we are and the more models we have which work well, the better chance we will have of arriving at the best quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of us&mdash;in fact three of us sitting here in this chamber tonight&mdash;have seen some of the best examples in Australia today of merged general academic education with vocational courses in senior secondary colleges, that is, those with just years 11 and 12 which basically merge TAFE and academic courses together. Those models have worked very well particularly in the State of Queensland, as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) would know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would support the principles of a new entry-level training system. Finn talks about new entry-level training. I am not sure that everyone knows exactly what that means. It is important that we visualise it accurately because today entry level into the world of work is basically through an apprenticeship, which means a craft, or through the Australian traineeship system, which largely is dedicated towards the retail industry, or through the old system of youth wages, where people left school at the Leaving Certificate or before and, from the age of 14 onwards, progressed through industry at increasing wage rates on birthdays. Put together, all of those really have not provided a satisfactory answer for us. So when we talk about entry-level training, we talk about the training mechanism that allows everyone to have a job or, at least hopefully, have entry to a job and training on the job in industry or in business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that one of the problems today with the apprenticeship system is that it is still based on a concept of master-slave relationship, which is no longer appropriate in these dying years of the twentieth century. Increasingly we talk about competency based training. The apprenticeship system is based, very parochially, on a time based system&mdash;generally four years of off-the-job and on-the-job training. So when we talk about a new entry-level training system, not everyone is talking about the same thing. I think we need to develop our thinking to a much greater extent. Australians have valued the apprenticeship system and may not value a new system, so we must ensure that what we propose will be acceptable to the community before we try to force it down its throat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other thing the Finn report discusses is the national project on the quality of teaching and learning of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) as being an appropriate forum for development of strategies for raising the standards of teaching. I would reject that proposition. That national project has personnel on the committee who are either bureaucrats or members of the Teachers Union. I would have thought that was the least appropriate mechanism to decide how we should go about improving the quality of teaching in our country. It seems to me that the users desperately need a place in that equation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One major difference that this side of the House has with the other side of the House when we talk about higher education and, increasingly, about Finn and funding for TAFE, is that of bureaucratic control. The current Minister for Employment, Education and Training has a model which literally has DEET as the big father over all the education system. The bureaucrats control the outcomes and try to control quality and the inputs, all by controlling funding. I reckon that is an inappropriate mechanism because I believe that we will get better quality through better diversity if we fund the student. By funding the student we give him the choice and introduce choice into the equation. Choice was always decided pretty well in the marketplace. If one puts Cadbury Schweppes up against Hersheys in the Australian marketplace, Cadbury Schweppes will win every time. The reason is that the Australian public wants its products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The university that provides the highest quality education will attract the most students and deserves the funding to continue its programs. I support the honourable member for Moreton in calling for increasing credit transfer links between schools, TAFEs and universities. We talk about pathways. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) is not very happy about this description about pathways. That bothers him a bit&mdash;I can cope with that&mdash;and it bothers me too. I think we talk in cliches far too often. What we are talking about is credit transfer. If students take carpentry courses in their two senior years in high school, surely there should be a mechanism in place which gives them credit for the course work in TAFE? This will reduce their apprenticeship term by a year. Students should at least get credit for the work that they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many courses in TAFE the university should be able to allow TAFE to give the student credit which the university will accept, as long as the university has some control over the quality of the outcomes and, therefore, the quality of the input of the students it is receiving. If the university finds that someone who has a certificate in business studies from a TAFE college is not able to cope with its advanced level programs&mdash;in the tertiary or fourth year&mdash;then surely it should have the right to tell TAFE, `We are not going to accept that credit any longer?'. But to the extent that it is advisable that we extend this credit transfer mechanism, then I support what the honourable member for Moreton had to say in that context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Finn report was big on national assessment standards. I support the Finn committee 100 per cent when it talks about assessment because that is another major difference between the Government and those on this side of the House. The teacher unions, together with parts of the bureaucracy, have been to the forefront in rejecting the concept of testing to prove the quality of outcomes for a whole host of reasons which, unfortunately, I no longer have time to go into tonight. Finn very strongly recommends national assessment and national testing to national standards, and I support it absolutely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I encourage further the evaluation of mechanisms to increase participation in education and training by the disadvantaged because there are still pockets of our society which are disadvantaged and still do not have the educational opportunities that others have. I know that we can argue about this, but I have said over and over again that some of the most disadvantaged in Australia today are those who just miss the entry requirement at university. This year's cut-off score may be great, but next year's cut-off score must be higher because we do not have the physical places any more, which is what is happening. So we throw tens of thousands of Australian students on the educational scrap heap because the Government cannot afford or does not have room for them at university. They could go if they could pay for themselves, but we refuse them a place while at the same time allowing overseas students to come and pay for a place. Talk about educational disadvantage. Tens of thousands of Australian students are truly disadvantaged in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I encourage an expansion of the careers education program. It is important that we give our youth every opportunity to understand what we call the real world of work in so far as it is humanly possible. Over the past decade, for one reason or another, we have tended to devalue the dirty jobs: the jobs in process industries, in the steel mills, in the chemical plants or in the mines. We have not valued them. Our schools have valued the jobs in law, in bureaucracy, in the State and Federal governments and in medicine. But we have not valued engineering or science. Unfortunately we have not valued teaching either because we have not kept pace with the pay scales in the teaching profession. We have allowed the unions to control the agenda to the point that that profession is no longer as respected as it once was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Finn report makes two recommendations basically in respect of funding. Those recommendations are important. One essentially says that the Commonwealth should take full funding responsibility; the other says that States will take full funding responsibility. In the former, Finn calls for the Commonwealth to guarantee all the funding and, in the second, he calls for the States to pay for everything after the first 12 years. It is my belief that, if we are going to be able to get the number of places in TAFE that are desperately needed, we need to find urgently the funds available to expand TAFE and we need to devolve the responsibility for TAFE to the colleges themselves, as I would propose that we devolve responsibility for universities back to themselves. Another area in which we disagree with those on the Government side is on the profiling process, the mechanism of funding places. I think that is a critical difference in the way in which we view, increasingly in the future, arriving at a quality outcome in both education and training for all our youth and all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, but I shall devote most of my time to the former. Many honourable members who have spoken on this legislation have been actively involved in the skills training inquiry as part of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training inquiry process. They are also currently in discussions with members of the New Zealand select committee on education and science who are currently visiting Australia. This is a first for both parliaments. Indeed, the whole notion of training, education, and the role of the technical and further education system within the community is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As many other honourable members have pointed out, we have passed a number of milestones in this area in recent times, not least of which has been the report on young people's participation in post-compulsory education and training, commonly known as the Finn review. A number of other processes are currently in place which assess the needs and demands of Australia as it moves into the twenty-first century. As well as that, we had the change of Australia's role in the international scene, the demands that are being made on Australia as it pursues markets in the Asian area and loses its traditional markets in Europe, and the once dominating role that Britain played. As it moved into the European Common Market, Australia had to find a different role for itself in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enormous technological changes have occurred in the last decade and have impacted upon the community in which we live and work and on the demands which are now placed on our students, our children and industry itself as we attempt to unravel and work towards the kind of education system which we feel is required for our children as they move into the twenty-first century. The equity officer of the Queensland Education Department, Dr Elanor Ramsey, whom I heard speak some nights back, told us that by the year 2015 the kind of jobs which many of our young people would have are currently unknown and are yet to be developed. She predicted that as much as 70 per cent of the kind of employment which people who are young now will have in the year 2015 is yet to be developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are preparing people for a changing world. The only thing which we will know and understand in that world is change. For all of us, particularly those in the political spectrum, we know and understand that change is the most difficult aspect of life for the community. Most people respond to change very badly. They have a view of the past which is coloured and rosy; they view the past as being somehow superior to the present. Perhaps they yearn for a knowledge of what is happening; often they yearn for their youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I think there are very few people who would yearn for the kind of state which our TAFE system is currently in. Most of us are well aware of the figures in which we have seen un-met demand increasing. It is estimated that in 1992 the shortfall will be in the region of 150,000 places. That surely comes at a time when the Government is pursuing its clever country ideal and, hence, we are no longer prepared to accept such a shortfall. It is in this context that the proposal to the States was placed. As well as that, the resourcing and the re-vitalisation of TAFE comes at a time when the community moves into that whole fabric of society where we have changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are currently discussing the nature of education and the role of education for society in general. Very many argue that as we pursue entry level training, as we pursue a more technical approach to training, and as we pursue school retention rates to year 12 and encourage students to take the kind of accreditation courses which we believe our young people need and should have, we are doing so at the expense of what has become known as general education. There are very many people in the community and in the education sector who believe that all of us need a wide and purposeful education and that that cannot be delivered by so-called vocational training. Some of us here would argue most rigorously about that and say that there is a role for both in what is a well constructed, well resourced and intelligently thought out 12 years of schooling for our young people. Some people say that it is possible to create a general well-rounded individual as well as someone who will have skills to take directly into the labour market work force. The 1987 Commonwealth Schools Commission report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the National Interest: Secondary Education and Youth Policy in Australia </EMPHASIS>said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are good grounds for believing that the levels of education and training in a population are important factors in international competitiveness amongst developed economies. Recent OECD . . . figures show that, in the early 1980s, Australia ranked fourteenth out of eighteen OECD countries in the population of 17-year-olds enrolled in either full- or part-time education . . . The gap at that time was substantial between Australia, with only 59 per cent of 17-year-olds enrolled, and . . . countries like Japan, West Germany, US, Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland all of whom exceeded 80 per cent . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As Australia attempts to look at itself in an international world, as it attempts to look at its Australian students not just in a competitive sense but as individuals in general education, we must move towards the kind of retention rates which we have heard talked about tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That dramatic rise in retention rates has been filled by the kind of works that have been done here and by a recognition by the community that, as society becomes more complex and more complicated, children are deserving of a knowledge and understanding of that. It is the objective of the Government to move quite a deal further down that way. The target of 65 per cent that was set for 1992 by the Schools Commission report has been exceeded in many parts of the country. The ACT leads Australia with its school retention rate, which is virtually 100 per cent. Queensland, where I live, was one of those slower places but it has moved further down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the kind of tensions that occur, the way in which education operates and the demands which are made, inevitably we have to recognise that TAFE, for whatever reason, has been left behind. In what have been enormous strides in the 1980s in secondary schooling, universities and our largest industries, which have moved towards training councils, the one sector that has not coped with change, responded to change or been flexible enough has been TAFE. It is partly the fact that TAFE has been controlled by State systems. It has been under-resourced, and one must ask why. Obviously, for many people it had a very low priority. TAFE was seen as second rate. We have heard a number of other speakers talk about the demise of technical colleges as they were seen as being for those people who were less able. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet our schools have continued to pursue a syllabus for 30 per cent of their population. What a nonsense! Thirty per cent of our schools' population currently goes on to university and yet every child in those schools and in that system is geared to getting the inevitable tertiary entrance score. We are condemning and saying to 70 per cent of our young people, `Sorry, folks, we don't care about you. We know you'll fail before you start because only 30 per cent of you are going to get the kind of end result which we are working for here'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">TAFEs did not participate in this change. As the university sector has grown, TAFEs have simply marked time and slipped backwards. Apprenticeships have continued along their path. It was a case of the master/slave, as envisaged in medieval times. We saw evidence of time based programs&mdash;`It does not matter if you could learn in four months, four weeks or 14 months what you needed to know to be a highly skilled trades person. Ah, no, you had to serve your time because that was the way it was in the good old days'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of our young people are rejecting apprenticeships. Industry is saying, `It's too costly. We're not going to do it. We don't want to participate in it'. People are saying, `I know I'm a trades person; I know somebody gave me four years of my time, but in the 1980s, when greed was good, we found a whole range of business people could not be bothered'. The kind of people who had traditionally used the TAFE system and had been part of it diminished as a percentage of our population. It is those kinds of factors which we must now change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a number of dynamics come together. Industry has recognised that if it is going to make money and if it is going to be part of our competitive world then it has to have a skilled work force. Part of developing that skilled work force is a change in the apprenticeship system, a change in the way in which we view our labour&mdash;not simply as people to be exploited but as people whose skills are valuable and can assist us down the profit path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen massive restructuring as well within the unions and the union movement. The Metal Trades Union has been leading the way in developing programs and training which will in fact take us into the twenty-first century. Gone are the incredible disputes; gone are the problems that arise when people develop only one, single, tiny base skill. We have multi-skilling; we have modules; we have competency based training. People show that they are able to do it and they are in fact then accredited. Indeed, this requires also the support of industry. What is it that industry wants; what kind of work force does industry need? Let us give it to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see not TAFE systems per se but rather some individual TAFE colleges responding to that challenge and saying to industry, `Participate; be part of us.' We have seen schools where that happens too. I can cite Oxley College in my own electorate, which was a very old physical high school with a falling population but is now a dynamic, moving, educational centre which provides TAFE courses for its students and responds to the needs and demands of the adult population within its area. It also provides a whole range of courses in literacy skills and so on. It is responding and working with the local TAFE college because it is happening on an individual level. I am sad to say it is not part of a systemic approach. Indeed, that is where we must go. We must look to the operation of a tripartite system between industry, unions and government if we are to meet the challenge together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we look at the way in which we must work and develop, we have to ask, `What is it that we want for our young people? What is it that we as a community need? What is it that we have to create to become the clever country and to maintain a standard of living which all of us wish to maintain?' As I have said&mdash;and others have articulated it here&mdash;Finn is very clear that the hope for the TAFE system lies in enormous resourcing. Who has promised this resourcing? This Federal Government. It has promised $1 billion a year. What do we see the States doing? They are walking away from it because they are still too territorial. The nonsense of States rights and the nonsense of territorial pride has denied 10,000 Australians the chance of a TAFE place in 1992 because the States are not able to be bigger and to look to what are national goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, we have travelled throughout the length and breadth of Australia and we have read many reports. Tonight, we have heard speakers from both the Government and the Opposition speaking about TAFE, entry-level training and the demands on the system, but not one speaker has cited a need for the States to maintain their territorial control. Indeed, industry has made demands that we need to be national, that a person who starts his or her course of study in Mackay in North Queensland should be able to travel to Melbourne and have it accredited; that a person who trains in Perth for the mining industry should be able to take his or her qualifications and work equally in Mount Isa. It is a nonsense in a country with a population the same as that of the Greater London Council that the States still manage and still wish to maintain control of what they know and recognise as an under-resourced and an underfunded series of separate entities, a TAFE system in this country which is denying our young people access to what is the most important facet of their education, which can take them into the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with Finn, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and others, I exhort the States to take the money to enable the young people to participate in education and I exhort them to provide for those 70 per cent of young people in our school system whom they are trying to channel into a fifth-rate tertiary course. It is simply not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hence, the Commonwealth is spending a good deal of money and time, and engaging in administrative channelling, as we move to a national curriculum, as we move to look at national assessments, and as we move to look at the whole range of areas that are offered in our TAFE system. As I have said, some of our unions have led the way in developing national courses and a national framework in which to operate. They see industry as being national. In fact, industry in this country is multinational. We have mining companies that operate not only here but throughout Asia. Indeed, BHP is even currently mining in the USSR. Of course, it is nonsense to suggest that the States should continue to control the system and say that only people who do these courses here are going to be able to be trades people in this little square of the world. As the world becomes larger and larger, all of us have to become part of it and participate in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we consider this States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill, which is enabling the transfer of recurrent funding and capital funding for 1992 as well as developing some further recurrent funding for the coming year, we have to say that it is in the TAFE sector that we want growth and we demand growth. Our young people and our community see the greatest need for change in this area. It is there that industry and unions are trying to work towards an Australia that will take us into the twenty-first century. We must demand change not just for the individuals involved but for all of us as a community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to address this House on the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2), which go to the vital question of education and how we are to fund and restore it to as healthy a level as possible in an Australia that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself has said must become the clever country if we are not to slide into some sort of obscure banana republicanism. The first of the two Bills seeks to provide TAFE for 1992 with the sum of $157m for recurrent funding and $215m for capital funding. The second provides for grants for financial assistance to the States, for the Northern Territory and for higher educational institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unquestionably time that we paid greater attention to educational matters in Australia, and none of the speakers who have gone before me tonight have in any sense denied that. In recent times we have seen considerable debate about both university and TAFE education in this country, and that is entirely appropriate. Whilst it is true that these Bills raise no great policy issues in themselves, they do present an important opportunity to raise some issues of educational policies and of the future of Federal-State relations, as mentioned by the previous speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Higher levels of education and training are, to a very great extent, the keys to lifting our productivity and efficiency and halting the slide in living standards and employment prospects that flow from our increasingly poor economic performance and burgeoning debt. Indeed, they need to be seen in the context of a need for a new and more enlightened approach to our workplaces and all that we do in them, including the way that employers and employees relate to one another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The higher levels of skills accumulation, which are so badly needed in our workplaces, are, of course, in themselves very largely dependent upon opportunities existing for adequate job training and retraining and with it the willingness of employees to take advantage of those opportunities. Given that our living standards have slipped badly in comparison with those of other Western nations with whom we might like to think we share some sort of sense of equality or kinsmanship, there should be a sense of urgency about addressing these questions. I would certainly say that, given youth unemployment levels of up to 30 per cent, depending on where one goes in Australia, there must be a sense of urgency about retraining and offering better training opportunities to young people if we are to offer them and ourselves a future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot escape the fact that Australian levels of labour productivity growth have not been up to OECD averages. This has impacted rather badly on us, particularly over the last 20 years. Whilst it may be true that productivity has been increasing in terms of our relatively poor performance in past years, the fact is that when our performance there is examined against other similar economies a very poor record shows up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the years of the accord, labour productivity improvements have averaged only around 60 per cent of OECD improvements. This poor and relatively declining rate of labour productivity growth has had, and if we are not careful will continue to have, a serious long term impact on living standards and on our international competitiveness. It must be understood that as long as productivity increases are not forthcoming there can be no real growth in wages levels. I was interested to hear the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) concede that to be the case in this place a couple of weeks ago in response to a question that I put to him. Regrettably, it is a brutal reality that the ACTU seems determined to hide from its constituents in its unrealistic pursuit of real wage increases, apart from productivity based increases, in the current environment. It seems to me that the ACTU needs to be exposed; it is cheating both itself and its constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is against that realisation that we must heed Ivan Deveson's warning&mdash;and I have heard his report referred to many times here tonight&mdash;that the development of TAFE institutions must focus on `training the trainers'. We must seek to encourage a more enlightened, a more flexible and a more realistic approach to providing training in a rapidly changing economic and social environment. Deveson continued on to say that it is critical that the whole subject of training not be excessively burdened with the rigidities of the industrial relations systems in this country. It seems that it is vital that regulation and control over training courses be applied, again in Deveson's words, `with a light hand, lest the local circumstances and needs not be overlooked or circumvented'. Regrettably, although I see tremendous signs of progress on the part of some honourable members opposite, there seems to be precious little evidence that the Government, at least at a formal level, has caught this message. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question of local circumstances is of great importance in rural Australia, and it is to rural Australia that I now turn my attention. Nowhere is greater freedom and the need to tailor-make training to the particular needs that might prevail more vital than in regional Australia. For example, Australia's farm sector traditionally not only has been highly efficient but also has managed to outperform the rest of the Australian economy in the vital area of productivity improvement. In the past, farmers and their families developed a wide range of skills and abilities in the pursuit of their family operations. They knew all about multiskilling, workplace flexibility and all of those wonderful concepts long before the ACTU even heard of them, let alone began to embrace them, or at least pay lip-service to them as being desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Skills were passed down through families and between neighbours, adaptation to new methods and technologies were embraced enthusiastically, and it was all very effective. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, would know all about it, with your own background in the very heartland of my own electorate&mdash;the mighty centre of Baan Baa. Baan Baa is quite a metropolis. Currently, there has to be real concern that that outstanding performance that has been the hallmark of Australian agriculture is now slipping away, and there is no doubt in my mind that that is largely the result of a declining involvement and interest in ongoing training programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to learn that in the United States some 40 per cent of farmers account for 60 per cent of farm production. All of those 40 per cent have engaged in further education and the opportunity to upgrade their skills in farm management. That clearly highlights a direct link between high productivity and farmers with further education, an illustration that can be extended way beyond the realms of agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Primary production continues to be one of Australia's most productive industries and it should be noted that it is also one of the most internationally exposed&mdash;not for primary industry the featherbedding enjoyed by so many other sectors in our economy to this very day. I want to point out that it is essential to ensure that we remain a competitive force and make the appropriate alterations to our traditional farm management training to cope with ever developing business strategies and technological changes. No longer can our rural youth rely upon the accumulated skills that have been handed down as being sufficient for the operation of a commercially viable business. That, of course, is what farming is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that Australian primary production stays in touch with the levels of those of our competitors, young rural Australians must begin to widen their knowledge of business and marketing practices. Regrettably, the figures are indicating now that only some 25 per cent of Australia's farm work force has advanced further than year 10 at secondary school. Whilst it is true that many have subsequently been heavily enrolled in relevant short courses and so forth, the reality is that much more will be needed in the future. We will simply have to address the need for adequate mechanisms to fund TAFE well enough to allow it to offer the courses and training that will keep rural Australia competitive. Again that is an illustration that extends far beyond agriculture. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) earlier tonight referred to the estimated 145,000 young people locked out of access to TAFE and related courses in Australia, and the 30,000 university student places that are simply not there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to my rural concerns, I want to speak briefly about the TAFE in Gunnedah, which is my own home town. Gunnedah is located on the Liverpool Plains in the north west of New South Wales. It is a town which services the surrounding farms, which are primarily wool, beef and grain oriented. There are three potentially major coalmines located in close vicinity; in fact it is estimated that the Gunnedah Basin contains some 42 billion tonnes of coal reserves. Significantly more coal lies under that basin than in the whole of the Hunter Valley. A substantial proportion of the population of the town and surrounding district is employed in one of those above mentioned industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was amazed to discover that as of next year the following courses will not be provided by TAFE in Gunnedah as a result of funding cuts: stage 2 of the wool classing course, the associate diploma in accountancy course, an open-cut mining course, a coal processing course, a meat inspection course, and a shopkeeping course. Worse, each of those courses is a two-year certificate course, of which only one year has been completed by students currently enrolled. One year is yet to be completed and the only alternative remaining for those students if they are to gain the appropriate certificate or diploma is to travel miles to another TAFE where the relevant courses are still being offered. Alternatively, they will have to wait for the courses to be reintroduced in their home town, and to be quite frank I do not like their chances very much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question must be posed: just how much will this really cost the local community and, ditto, how much does this sort of penny-pinching exercise cost Australia at a time when it needs every export dollar that it can raise? We need to keep in mind that we are still talking about a situation in Australia where only around 20 per cent of the population live outside metropolitan Australia but they go on producing something like 80 per cent of the nation's export wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse, it is my duty to record that other courses are to receive the chop. Reception duties and secretarial courses will go; the fitting, metal fabrication and welding course directed at the coalmining industry is to go; and the hospitality course providing training in cellar and bar work accompanying the hotel-retail management course is to go&mdash;I do not know how much use there is for that in Gunnedah, but perhaps that was to be an escape mechanism for those who wanted to leave. The farm bookkeeping course is to go&mdash;a very retrograde step. Training in explosives for both mining and agricultural application is to go. The post-trade refresher course for motor mechanics is also to go. Of course, that is to be deeply regretted, given the importance of the motor vehicle industry to remote areas&mdash;country areas&mdash;the rapidly changing technology that is involved and the need to ensure that there is a good pool of local mechanics who are abreast of technological developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each and every one of those courses can be directly linked to the wool, beef, grain, mining, transport or meat processing industries which are an integral part of that Gunnedah community. The Gunnedah community is part of that 20 per cent which is responsible for 80 per cent of Australia's exports, which I talked about a moment ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We stress the importance of developing further skills in the farm sector. Here is a perfect example of how we are ensuring that it just cannot happen. Each of those courses is in high demand, not only by the students but also by the industries and the community as a whole. In fact, what is happening is that opportunity for development of skills and training, as is so typical across country Australia, is often simply not available. The capacity of each industry to grow and to compete internationally, to develop those hard earned and desperately needed export opportunities that this country needs so badly, is being curtailed. Gunnedah TAFE, along with so many regional colleges, has shown the initiative necessary to ensure that its service is flexible and able to cater for the rural vocational requirements of its students. But it is not able to continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I draw my remarks to a close, I want to turn briefly to the question of the Government's willingness not only to fund TAFEs but also to allow local TAFEs to enjoy the sort of autonomy that they need to develop the sorts of courses that are relevant in their particular situations. I want to express a concern that in the current debate about the need for greater levels of Federal funding for such institutions we not lose sight of the need for that individual, localised sort of flavour in the development of courses. I think that this is a critically important area. I do not really dispute the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), but by referring to the Government's reluctance to let go of its centralised control, as seen in the other Bill before us, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2), I want to express my concern in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission has described the current approach to regulation and funding of higher education as fundamentally flawed. It has said that, as a result, the Government and institutions have tended to make incorrect decisions about the number of tertiary places and how they should be allocated. In fact, the Commission proposed five policy options to enable supply to better keep up with demand for places in higher education. Those five options were: increasing government funding to institutions&mdash;which is the one the Government has picked up to some extent; charging up-front fees for non-funded Australian students; charging full fees with deferred payment through the tax system; varying HECS to meet un-met demand; and introducing a voucher system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like other speakers in this debate, I do not deny the need for increased Federal funding input for TAFE or higher education but, by the same token, I do not accept the need for maintenance of centralised control. The current problems of un-met demand and overcrowding are seen to be the result of the recession and record numbers of those aged 16 to 24 seeking access to higher education. Access to education in institutions is currently being restricted by quotas, unrestricted access to capital for development, government controlled and ever increasing student charges, bureaucratically determined education profiles and rigidities in employment conditions for staff. All of these restrictions remove key incentives for quality, efficiency and appropriate courses and adequate student places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think we need to lift the ideological blinkers on this whole debate. In short, the attitude of both Government and Australians generally needs to be changed in two areas: firstly, we should not blindly accept that centralised control is acceptable and wise and the only way to go; secondly, we need to change the `She'll be right, mate; this is the lucky country' attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The editorial in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> drew attention to that. It pointed out that there seems to be a belief, especially among student groups, that the educational process is somehow corrupted if students are required to make a financial contribution to it. An argument is mounted that when a system is free the notion of providing a service to clients&mdash;in this case, students&mdash;tends to be overlooked. The editorial goes on to say that not everybody ought to be requested to pay, that it is very important to maintain the principle that there are safeguards for those people who cannot afford to pay. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That would be a help. It is all a question of attitudes. But students perhaps would benefit from the additional money raised by TAFE if TAFE were to go down this road a little further. For instance, in New South Wales it may be possible to provide some more of those 90,000 estimated extra places that are needed but which are now not available because of budget considerations. The editorial goes on to say that most TAFE students want an education that is oriented to workplace skills, that if we were to go down that road the culture of TAFE might benefit and that the payment of fees would give students `greater access and influence on the power structure of the TAFE system' itself. I conclude by saying that we must be prepared to be more flexible and more open in our attitudes to these questions because in Australia in 1991 we cannot afford not to be.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Other speakers in the debate on the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) this evening have tended to concentrate on the Finn report and on the future of technical and further education, together with educational trends among young people in recent years. I guess in a way I will do that also. I would like to concur with the comments of my colleagues who have spoken previously in the debate, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), on these questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vocational and educational training demands upgrading and national attention if young people across the country are to have their rightful aspirations and expectations addressed in a realistic way by government. However, I would like to take the House back briefly to a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Restless Years</EMPHASIS>, to highlight that report's recommendations in relation to TAFE and vocational training transition for the post-compulsory years of school where students do not wish to continue on to higher education in the guise of a university. Of course, many people currently consider higher education to be related only to university. A number of points were made in chapter 14 of this October 1989 report of an inquiry into year 12 retention rates. The report states in chapter 14:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every Australian is entitled to a senior secondary education. Devising means of ensuring this entitlement is a real option for young people ought to be the objective of all governments&mdash;both Commonwealth and State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure that honourable members would wholeheartedly underwrite that statement. In a second point, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee acknowledges the completion of senior secondary education by all young people would have significant and wide-ranging implications which are not at present well understood.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that has funding implications attached to it. The third point states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To achieve the objective of year 12 for all, the community must focus on improving educational opportunities and outcomes for young people from educationally disadvantaged groups.</PARA>
<PARA>I interpose here to say that many of those disadvantaged groups are the kids who end up going to TAFE. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee found that the provision of financial support to young people from low income families can help remove some of the barriers to participation in education. Accordingly, it is important that financial assistance schemes be maintained and that support continue to be provided to those most in need.</PARA>
<PARA>We can read there `Austudy'. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Family background can play an important role in influencing decisions about staying on to years 11 and 12. Efforts must therefore be made to ensure that the value of senior secondary education is widely appreciated in the community.</PARA>
<PARA>That is something the Federal Government has worked to achieve. Another aspect of the report which relates particularly to TAFE and to the discussion this evening is paragraph 14.9 of that chapter, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of relevant and appropriate courses in the senior secondary years is vital if young people are to be allowed to maximise the benefits of staying on&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, not to stay on for staying on's sake. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means that schools must offer a broad range of practically oriented courses and that the traditional emphasis of Years 11 and 12 exclusively as preparation for tertiary entrance must be broken down. Necessary elements of this process are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)that education authorities emphasise, and higher education institutions accept, that school-designed courses are educationally sound and can be used for tertiary entrance; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)the wider development of school/TAFE links and school/industry links.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that those little points are worth mentioning at this juncture in the debate because, as the honourable member for Forde so eloquently said in her contribution to the debate, for far too long in Australia we have concentrated in our secondary schools on equipping students with the qualifications for tertiary entry when probably only 30 per cent of those students would pursue a tertiary life after school. Many of the students have another orientation, and that other orientation is, in fact, better accommodated by the provision of courses through TAFE particularly, or by other sorts of courses. That is quite crucial, and we should not forget it in this particular debate, as I know the honourable member for Forde has not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to acknowledge that that particular report came well before the Deveson report and well before the Finn report, but it was not a report on TAFE. Of course, both the Deveson and Finn reports were much more oriented towards TAFE. As has been indicated in the debate already, the Finn report is the most recent contribution to the debate on young people's participation in post-compulsory education and training. In particular, Finn makes a point about the convergence of general and vocational education. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both individual and industry needs are leading towards a convergence of general and vocational education. There is an increasing realisation internationally that the most successful forms of work organisation are those which encourage people to be multi-skilled, creative and adaptable.</PARA>
<PARA>We would all agree with that. But also that was something which was said quite loudly and consistently by employers who discussed post-compulsory education with the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training when we did the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Restless Years</EMPHASIS> in 1989. In other words, whilst employers have requirements of individuals once they join their work force, they most specifically want capable young people who have had a general education and possess an understanding of the world at large. We do not want to see people streamed in a very narrow way vocationally. We want to see them have access to vocational education at the same time as they have access to a general education so that they will not be captive in a very narrow area for the rest of their lives, which obviously is of no value to either the young person or, in the long term, to the employer or the economy. The Finn Committee, on national targets, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . these imperatives should be recognised in the establishment of a set of new national targets for post-compulsory education and training which encompass schools, higher education, TAFE and other training, and which identify target levels for attainment as well as participation. In essence, the Committee proposes that almost all young people should take sufficient post-compulsory education and training to complete Year 12 or some other initial post-school qualification, and at least half should go on to higher levels&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure they will. The Committee also proposed the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . governments should agree to introduce a post-compulsory Education and Training Guarantee whereby all young people would be guaranteed a place in school or TAFE after Year 10 for two years of full-time education or training or its equivalent part-time for up to three years.</PARA>
<PARA>That was also mentioned by other speakers in the debate. Finn also made mention of, and gave some degree of concentration to, the need for national curriculum principles, which was another area commented on by the Employment, Education and Training Committee in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Restless Years</EMPHASIS>. We said that we must have a system in this country whereby we have recognition of certificates across the nation so that a student or an older person who goes through an element of training comes out with a certificate at the other end of that training which is recognised across the country. A national curriculum is also required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) is to be congratulated for his endeavours, and indeed his successes, in getting the State employment and education Ministers together to achieve some understandings in that regard. It has not been without some pain, I am sure. But it is a totally ridiculous situation to find that a person who is a podiatrist, for instance, in New South Wales and who travels to Western Australia has to re-sit podiatry exams. Often it would be a person in an older age group. Such people ought to be able to take that qualification&mdash;a very necessary one, I would suggest; with our ageing population it is probably one of the expanding areas of practice these days&mdash;from one State across the State boundary to another State without having to sit a new examination. They are not foreign countries, and that is something the States have to remember in this whole debate on qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrespective of the side of the House that we sit on&mdash;and I know that there are some people who disagree on one or other aspect of the TAFE debate&mdash;I am sure that we all agree that TAFE must not be seen any longer as the poor relation of higher education. It should be about skills, qualifications and competency, regardless of who administers it. I hope, indeed, that we are entering a new era for TAFE. Whilst there might be some resistance at the State level to the suggestions by the Federal Minister that the Commonwealth take over the funding of TAFE, I hope that the States are able to overcome those objections because it does make a lot of sense for the post-compulsory area of education in the higher education and TAFE regimes to be funded federally and for us to have the same goals and objectives for the TAFE system as we have for the higher education system in so far as 70 per cent of our young people are more likely to end up in that system than in the higher education and university system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These days there has been a complete change in the ethos of higher education away from smaller colleges and towards larger universities through amalgamation and other sorts of changes, so it makes sense for the Commonwealth to take up the funding option for TAFE as well. The Minister, in a letter that he wrote to the State Ministers for education and employment, has quite openly stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to emphasise that this approach relates to funding responsibility, not administration, planning and policy setting roles. In relation to TAFE, for example, a larger Commonwealth funding role would not mean a diminished State administration and planning role.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that the States ought to take note of that very small paragraph in the Minister's letter and realise that all that is involved is a change in the emphasis of the funding to ensure that national responsibilities for training are able to be met through funding of TAFE by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was able to perform a very pleasant function on Friday last week when the Federal Minister was meeting in Melbourne, I believe, with State education Ministers. Instead of him, I was able to open a furniture trades complex in Balga, which is just on the fringe of my electorate. It was at the Balga campus of the North Metropolitan College of TAFE in Perth. The Commonwealth Government had contributed $12m to this new furniture trades facility which was planned and constructed in close consultation with the local furniture trades industry and which incorporates the most technologically advanced equipment in Australia and possibly the world. The Western Australian Government contributed $1.4m. I think that serves as a good example of the ways in which the Federal funding can make advances in TAFE that might not be able to be made otherwise because of the cost of capital works and the cost of keeping our training standards and equipment up to a level that makes the people who go through that training eligible for employment when they leave it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia the furniture trades industry itself does not have some of the equipment that is available at the TAFE furniture trades complex and it will be sending its own people there out of hours to learn how to use the equipment and probably to run some business from there. So that TAFE complex is able to use the equipment and the funds of the Federal Government in a very good and enterprising fashion. Under the new rules that apply to TAFE, it will be able to keep any money that it earns in that way for the expansion of the facility and the campus. I think that is also a very important change. For the benefit of the House I will read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a passage about the Balga TAFE furniture trades complex, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . A combination of technical excellence, imaginative design and expert construction has created a furniture trades learning centre which can claim to be second to none in Australia. . . Designed and constructed by the Western Australian Building Management Authority for the Department of Technical and Further Education, the project is the first of three stages towards the full redevelopment of the existing Balga campus, which is located centrally in the northern suburbs. . . The 7,000 sq. metre Furniture Trades Department. . . is the largest of its type in the southern hemisphere, boasting a training facility for every aspect of furniture making under one roof.</PARA>
<PARA>Students who attend the Balga TAFE will be able to acquire an advanced certificate in furniture studies, which has been developed as a result of the cooperative efforts of the furniture trades study area of TAFE and the Furniture Industry Training Association. I was very pleased to see at this launch that the furniture trades unions were represented, the furniture trades industry was represented and, of course, the State and Federal governments were represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new equipment in this project is worth about $2m, and computer controlled machinery valued at about $1m has been installed in the flat panel area. These machines were purchased under a joint industry-TAFE venture with an industry contribution of $10,000 to provide equipment for TAFE under the Commonwealth skills for Australia funding. That funding is another element of money from the Commonwealth which TAFEs have taken advantage of where it has been available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the traditional training, some emphasis in the new facility is on CAD-CAM&mdash;that is, computer aided design and computer aided manufacture&mdash;because of its important influence on the efficiency of manufacture in this day and age. Training will be provided for 430 apprentices doing cabinet making, machining, woodworking, upholstery, french polishing, saw doctoring and wood-turning. Also, 36 pre-apprentices and 110 advanced certificate courses in furniture studies will be catered for, as well as some industry requirements. About 15 people will be assisted through industry restructuring, customised courses, CNC training and CAD-CAM. There will also be provision for 24 persons from special interest groups, such as disabled, unemployed, community programs, TAFE and Aboriginal Access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The BMA, which is the State government building authority, was awarded first prize at the Excellence in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Construction Awards for the main building and was also a finalist in the same awards for refurbishment. The actual structure was quite revolutionary and has a unique design providing a flexible structure that can be altered in the future because there are no load bearing walls and the roof is supported on steel pylons and wires. So the industry will benefit&mdash;as will the trainees of the area, particularly of Perth&mdash;from this excellent facility which has been mainly funded by the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is continuing to see technological development causing alterations to the manufacturing process and it needs to adopt many of these practices to maintain pace with the international marketplace. Given that many of the processes are now available to Australia as a consequence of this particular TAFE training facility, we will be able to undertake those processes in Australia, whereas previously certain elements of furniture manufacture would have had to be brought in from overseas. It will be an import replacement facility to a large degree and, because of the nature of the equipment that is now available, apprentices will be learning how to structure furniture in the way in which it is structured overseas. It is a rather revolutionary complex and one which I was very pleased to be associated with on the Minister's behalf. My colleague the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) probably would have been there also if he could have been, because it is on the margin of both of our electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Colin Andrews, the Chairman of the WA Furniture Industry Association, was at the opening, as was Malcolm Goff, the Director of the North Metropolitan College of TAFE, which has another new campus, an open learning centre, in Joondalup in the northern suburbs of Perth. So there is quite a lot going on in Western Australia in the TAFE area. The State Minister has recently announced that there will be more money going into further places in TAFE this year, which I am very pleased to acknowledge and to thank her for. Nevertheless, the discussion over the future of TAFE must be resolved, and I certainly hope that it will be resolved in favour of TAFE as opposed to being in favour of either the Federal or the State government, because we want to ensure that whatever the outcome, it is the best for the students and the people who will use TAFE in the future. Of course, I would favour the Federal funding option. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) one would not really understand the crisis that this country is facing in higher education at the moment. Listening to other members of the Government who have spoken on the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2), I found the optimism that they seem to exude quite surprising. My observation is that rather than moving towards becoming a clever country, we seem to be almost daily moving further away from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier tonight the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) was taking up that hackneyed theme that we hear from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) that the great achievement of this Government in education has been improving participation rates in high schools. There is no doubt that Government members can point to significantly increased participation rates; but when we look at the real reason for that, there is no doubt that most of those kids, or the great majority of them, are being forced to stay at school because they know that there is nothing for them when they leave school. There are no jobs available for them. That is the great legacy of this Government. I think it will take years for Australia to recover from the present position, in which jobs for young people have virtually disappeared. Almost in desperation, some of them are now staying in school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the school system has yet to entirely cope with their staying there beyond the post-compulsory years. Even for those who do stay, do learn and do want to go on to higher education, the cruel joke that is being played on them is that when they leave school they cannot get into universities or TAFE colleges. We find that awful figure of some 30,000 students leaving school and not finding university places available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I always find it rather quaint when I hear the Minister and Government members trumpeting their great success in keeping kids at school, when the great irony is that they have done nothing much in practice to do that, other than to create an economic environment which means that kids are frightened to leave school. Their expectations of having access to higher education have been heightened; when they finally face the prospect, those hopes are dashed. I think that is a cruel situation and that the young people of this country have been badly let down by this Government. The problems that that will create for us in the future are almost immeasurable, and it will be a great challenge for the next government of this country, which will be a coalition government, to come to grips with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that there has been quite a bit of discussion tonight about the Minister's proposals to take a greater interest in TAFE, if we could describe them in those terms. We are not quite sure exactly what he wants to do because he has not made it clear. As we read it, there is some intention to take greater control of TAFE. Of course, whilst he might have had some success in getting the Ministers to come together to agree that a national recognition of qualifications is desirable, that was a relatively easy project for the Minister to take on; it was one, of course, that made a lot of sense. We are pleased to see that there has been a recognition of the importance of that particular concept. I wish the Minister good luck in respect of his intention to take a greater degree of interest in or control over TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see that already the education Ministers in the various States have pretty much given him his marching orders in respect of that particular proposal. The New South Wales Minister for Further Education, Training and Employment, Mr Fahey, was quite forthright in calling the proposal blackmail and describing it as `unacceptable'. The Labor Minister for Further Education, Training and Employment in South Australia, Mr Rann&mdash;some of us would remember another gentleman in New South Wales with a name that sounds the same but is spelt differently&mdash;said that the State would `reject any East German centralist model for TAFE'. Those of us who are interested will watch with great anticipation to see what is going to happen with respect to the Minister's intentions to talk to the State education Ministers about what he wants to do with TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt in the minds of honourable members on this side of the House that something has to be done with TAFE, although I must say that in my experience it has emerged in many States in recent times from almost a Stone Age existence. Finally, I think that it is starting, in effect, to cope. We have seen some very worthwhile assistance along the way from some of the reports, including the Finn report, which we have been talking a lot about tonight and particularly the Deveson report, which I believe gave us some very strong directions for TAFE. I know that the Opposition, in particular, accepts almost in totality many of the things that Ivan Deveson had to say in his report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill that I am most interested in making a few comments on tonight is the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2). The Bill implements the 1991 Budget decision to provide for a real increase of 5 per cent in Commonwealth recurrent grants to TAFE. Incidentally, this is in line with some of the recommendations of the Deveson report into training costs. In 1990, total national expenditure on TAFE was $1.6 billion, of which the Commonwealth contributed $375m. The Finn report estimated that on current trends, TAFE expenditure would reach $1.95 billion by the year 2000. That committee also recommended significantly increased participation in, and the development of target attainment levels for, post-compulsory education and training. The report noted that there was a particular need to strengthen the role of industry and to enhance the status of TAFE as a post-school option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deveson Training Costs Review Committee stated that more than 100,000 Australians failed to gain entry to vocational and preparatory courses of their choice in 1990. This is despite the fact that interest in TAFE in the 15- to 24-year-old age group has fallen from 22 per cent to 12 per cent since 1984. I imagine that that percentage, whilst being alarming, is to some extent explained by the fact that kids are staying longer at school and that TAFE becomes a less attractive proposition for them at the end of year 12. That is where the problem lies. The expectation at the end of year 12 tends to be for a university education and TAFE, up until now at least, has been very much the poor cousin of the university system. I think that is a real challenge for TAFE. I know that some States, certainly my State of Queensland, have accepted that challenge. Queensland is making great strides towards becoming more relevant and up-to-date in the face that it presents to intending students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, full time TAFE provides, however, for less than 3 per cent of all 15- to 19-year olds and, of course, most of these are apprentices. In the lead-up to the Special Premiers Conference, which we assume is still on, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training has proposed that the Commonwealth Government assume responsibility for the vocational education and training system and be responsible&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal is one of two funding options that were put forward in the Finn report. It seems that the Minister has grasped&mdash;and I suppose we might have expected him to&mdash;the option which suggested that the Commonwealth should take control of this and take over the funding. The other option at the other extreme appeals more to me. I am not saying that lightly, but it seems to me that the Minister wanted to get control. He looks like taking that option. From my observation of what he has done in the other parts of the higher education system, that would be worse than putting Dracula in charge of the proverbial blood bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the States were to assume full responsibility for TAFE beyond the education and training guarantee that Finn talks about, they would require access to a wider funding base. For the moment, that seems to be fraught with difficulties. While TAFE has in many respects floundered under current funding arrangements, I am certainly not convinced&mdash;and I am sure that the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) indicated that he was not convinced when he spoke tonight&mdash;that centralising this important sector under the Federal Government will offer a solution to these problems per se. In fact, we very much doubt that it would because the problems are much deeper and more difficult to solve than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everything that the Minister for Education, Employment and Training has dealt with in his portfolio has, in our view, been a disaster&mdash;from the restructuring of the tertiary education sector to the training guarantee levy, which has to be the daddy of them all. We think that he has managed to just about put the kiss of death on everything. So why the States, for that matter, would want him to get his hands further into their TAFE systems would be completely beyond me. But then he might have something up his sleeve if, in fact, he does manage to meet with the Ministers or if the Premiers discuss this matter. But we will have to wait and see about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a great interest in TAFE. I wanted to say a few words about my local TAFE college. I want to leave a bit of time. Unfortunately, we are in that situation where the Government, in the interests of promoting democracy in this country, wants to guillotine all of this legislation so that we do not have a chance to debate things properly. As I said, I want to leave the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) the last few minutes because I know that he wants to make a contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, I believe that the Gold Coast Institute of TAFE has become a role model for the way that TAFE should be working. It is Queensland's largest TAFE institute. I believe that it has succeeded in responding to the specific training needs of business in the Gold Coast region. With enrolments at 18,000 and a total of over two million student contact hours each year, the Gold Coast Institute of TAFE is responding to the demands of the growing Gold Coast population. I would like to congratulate the college for being the excellent model that it is for the TAFE system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) for giving me these few minutes, which I hope to use in the best possible way. Both the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) deal with the funding of our tertiary institutions; namely, TAFE and the higher education establishments, being our universities and others which of course are almost totally funded by the Federal Budget these days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I thought this was a good opportunity considering the focus on TAFE&mdash;although I think many of my remarks are very similar in both sectors&mdash;to put the simple question: why, in the area of vocational training, is it necessary for the Federal Government to be the arbiter of how things are done and, more importantly, whether we look at a TAFE college or a university, why does the Government have to own the shop?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of TAFE, one of the more enlightening visits that I remember was to the Repco school for apprentice training in Melbourne&mdash;a basically private organisation doing wonders in the vocational training of young people. Nobody is there because he or she cannot get a job and has been shunted into the education system because kids can get Austudy when they are 16 but not the dole. Nobody is there doing that. They are all kids in employment; they are all being paid; and their employers have worked out that keeping them in full time training represents a better result than having them go one day a week to TAFE&mdash;and they are funding it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if the Commonwealth Government and the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) recognise the need for additional TAFE places&mdash;130,000 or something being a figure that is cast around&mdash;why are they not funding the students? Why does the Minister have to take the institution over and have it to himself to apply his great administrative skills? He is the guy who took nine years to get an economics degree and he wants to take over the running of all these institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best institutions I have seen are the ones that are run by the private sector. So why can we not have funding in these areas for students&mdash;for people? Why do we have to pack it all into an institution that then takes decisions that may not be in people's vocational interests? It is a fact that when we look into many of the programs offered in some universities and particularly at TAFE, which is aimed at vocational training, we find that some of them are not really the sort of training schemes that keep anybody in a job but the teacher. I am not sure that people would take those sorts of decisions themselves if in fact they received a government grant. Government grants, of course, are then applied to all others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) in his speech made a point that I make continually, and I thank him for making it again in this debate: why cannot Australians pay for an education when any foreigner can? In the current process we fund the institution, and the point I have made and wish to make again is that, if we fund the students, they can all be funded according to their individual academic achievement. If that is lower than the standard required, they either take a course that is less expensive or they add to that from their own resources. History is full of people who did just that and succeeded at very high levels, possibly because they carried that extra burden and it sharpened them up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think these sorts of points should be taken into account. But why do we say to Australians, `You have passed your exams, you are qualified to go, but unless you fit our system, because we have not provided enough places, you are not allowed to pay for an education'. Then we have the ridiculous arrangement of excellent universities, like the Bond University in Queensland, meeting high standards of education in a very small way. Students go there and they are told, `If you go to that dreadful place, you can't have Austudy'. Is Austudy a grant to universities or is it a grant to students? When I supported the legislation in this place, I thought it was a grant to students&mdash;I really did. But apparently a student cannot have it if he or she wants to go to a nasty old private university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an amazing situation where I support the Labor Government in Western Australia. It gave the Notre Dame people a block of land, and my constituents and everyone have gone crazy. I have written back to say, `If you can get a university for one block of land, that sounds like a very good deal for the taxpayer'. Let us have some private universities and let the students who go there get exactly the same treatment as the students who go to a public university or TAFE. We can do that by funding students and saying, `Here is your right, this is your entitlement; go and spend it at any approved institution, be it a vocational training sector or be it one of the academic universities'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part III of the Currency Act 1965 deals with the issue, issue price, standard weight and composition of coinage. The principal aim of the amendments proposed by this Bill is to empower the Treasurer to make statutory instruments relating to the issue, issue price, standard weight and composition of that coinage. The Act currently provides for the Governor-General to make regulations for those purposes. Constitutionally, in virtually all instances, Acts of the Governor-General are required to be made on the advice of the Executive Council. As such, Executive Council approval is required before any instrument made by the Governor-General under part III can operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was said by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) in the second reading speech to this Bill that the current Executive Council approval requirement demands considerable administrative effort and can involve time delays&mdash;I will be making some comments further about the time delays that do occur&mdash;particularly as the Executive Council only meets periodically. Such delays can create difficulties for the marketing programs associated with the launch of new coinage collector items. Some concern has been expressed by coin dealers about the marketing programs, and I will return to that topic later in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 4 will allow the Treasurer, subject to disallowance by Parliament, to determine the composition, the standard allowable variation from that standard weight, the design and the dimensions of coins. Of course, we all recall the design features of the original decimal currency when it was first introduced, and the fine work that was done by the artist, Stuart Devlin, in association with the coinage at that time. In addition, the Treasurer may, subject to disallowance by Parliament, specify in a determination more than one standard weight, design or set of dimensions, in relation to a coin of a particular denomination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal effect of clause 5 will allow the Treasurer to make and issue coins of a standard composition specified in the schedule to the Act provided they are of a standard weight, and of a design and dimensions, determined by the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Bill has three main purposes to simplify procedures for approval of new coins issued under the Currency Act: currently the approval of new coins, including variations to the design, metallic composition, et cetera, necessitate regulations made by the Executive Council; these provisions will authorise the Treasurer to grant the necessary approvals; and parliamentary scrutiny via disallowance procedures will be retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose these measures. The object of the measures, of course, is to streamline the administrative procedures. Concerns have been expressed to me by people who are involved in the marketing of coins. The criticism does not come from Mr Athol Nicholas of Bendigo Coins and Stamps, but I am indebted to him as he was able to provide me with a little background on the marketing of coins, the way it works, the role that the Mint plays and the role of the larger coin dealers and building societies, which have recently been incorporated into the marketing arrangements of coin sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a new coin is to be issued it is important that there are no delays in the implementation of the marketing strategy because the marketing strategy can be very crucial to the success of the release of that coin and its value on the coin market. It is very important that those delays are eliminated, adequate time is given for the marketing arrangements to be put in place, and that the coin dealers, building societies and others who are handling the release are not held up unduly with delays in the marketing of those coins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One special coin was the Anzac coin which was struck to commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of Gallipoli. It was much sought after, and I am sure it would be highly prized by those who purchased them. It was quite a unique occasion. I understand that coins were made available to the veterans from Gallipoli who embarked on that epic voyage. I am sure that the coin will have a very special place in their memorabilia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier I mentioned that a special 50c coin was recently introduced to mark 25 years of dollars. I refer to an article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 24 January 1991. I was aware that our currency had been devalued, but I was rather struck by the headline: `Special 50c to mark 25 years of dollars'. Is the true value of the dollar these days back to 50c? The commemorative coin, quite appropriately, has a merino ram's head on it, and it is quite striking. Obviously it will be much sought after. I understand from the initial release that it was intended that the coin would be a fairly exclusive and that it would be a much sought after collectors' item. I believe there was a surplus of those coins and that they have now been put into circulation. To some extent the free market price of coin sales has dropped because of the large number that has been circulated. At the moment they are bringing about 75c to 80c provided that they are in good condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twenty-five years of decimal currency is an important milestone for Australia and that coin, having been struck, has obviously been accepted very widely. It is interesting to reflect on that time, when the Federal Treasurer was the late Harold Holt. He announced that Australia would be moving to decimal currency, and one of the first names thought up for a unit of currency was the royal. It certainly stirred a lot of discussion at the time. I think the name was discarded after about five months of furore when the debate about what the new coin would be called raged across the front pages of the metropolitan dailies. Of course, it subsequently ended up as the dollar and Mr Holt subsequently became Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we think back to that time, it was quite a remarkable achievement because the banks were closed for only four days before the conversion. That is all the time they had to adjust accounting machinery and other mechanisms. It was a quite remarkable performance when we think about it. I wonder whether, with the technology we have now, we could achieve that in four days. The conversion program was expected to take two years but it was completed in total&mdash;that is, all the coin-operated machinery, cash registers, parking meters et cetera were changed&mdash;in 18 months. I want the Minister at the table to listen to this final line&mdash;it came in $28m under budget. I think it was quite a special achievement for those days for a project of that magnitude to be achieved within time and under budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time has moved on, and we have had the announcement by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), that the 1c and 2c coins will ultimately disappear from circulation in this country. Those coins have not been issued after 1 October 1990. I think the next stage is 1 February 1992, when they will be totally withdrawn and will not be able to be used at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen quite a change with decimal currency. The collection of coins is a worldwide hobby. Australia has taken a very important place in the scheme of things with its issue each year of mint coin sets, which are uncirculated, containing one of each denomination of the currency. Then there are proof sets, which I understand contain more individual specimens. I believe they are much sought after. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Australian Mint, in its annual report of 1989-90&mdash;the most recent one I could find&mdash;indicated that it had coin sales revenue of $24m. This related mainly to collector coins and special coins which the Mint strikes. It mentions its retail outlets&mdash;the Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies is involved, and I briefly mentioned the building societies earlier. It also produces 350 million Australian coins which are circulated each year. It really is a very large business. It is one that obviously we want to ensure carries out its marketing function and is not hindered by any administrative processes. This legislation sets out to improve the efficiency of those administrative matters to enable better marketing to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mint also plays a very important role in producing things such as Commonwealth Games victory medals and Commonwealth Games numismatic coins for collection. Apparently it has achieved 99.99 per cent accuracy of stores function. I am not quite sure what that means but I guess it is that not too many go missing. I thought that was quite impressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make some brief comments about the minor amendments to the Financial Corporations Act. They will allow the Treasurer to delegate to the Governor or Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank responsibility for varying and publishing the list of non-bank financial institutions. I see that the Chairman of the Finance and Public Administration inquiry into banking, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), is in the chamber at the moment. Obviously there is now a lot more interest in non-bank financial institutions. This is possibly as a result of some of the events which occurred in Victoria with the Pyramid Building Society and the Farrow Group. People are taking a much more active interest in the sorts of things that are occurring in non-bank financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment authorises the Treasurer to publish the list other than in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. I would imagine that that is to ensure that members of the public know what a bank is and what a non-bank financial institution is, and to have ready access to that information. I have a copy of all of those non-bank financial institutions. I did not have to look too far down the column to see that the list included the Bendigo-Sandhurst Mutual Permanent Land and Building Society of Victoria. It is one of the oldest building societies in Australia and, I am pleased to say, one of the most successful non-bank financial institutions. I looked a little further down the list and saw the Pyramid Building Society, Victoria, still listed there. It is currently in the hands of the receiver and will be listed there until that matter is resolved. The role of non-bank financial institutions is a matter in which the public is taking a great deal more interest than it used to. The coalition does not oppose the move by the Government to ensure that people are made aware of what role the organisations play and who they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last section of the legislation before the House involves the repeal of the Special Employment-related Programs Act 1982, which had its origin in the drought induced recession of early 1982. The Government is inclined to overlook the important part the drought played in that recession. The Act appropriated $300m from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to direct finance and grants to the States for projects that `contribute to the generation or maintenance of employment within Australia'. Under section 5 of the Act, no payments could be made after 30 June 1984. The $300m allocated under that Act represented the notional saving from the implementation of the Salaries and Wages Pause Act 1982 and from a wages freeze in the Commonwealth funded education sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the proposed $300m expenditure, $100m was said to be allocated to welfare housing. My electorate was the beneficiary of some of that housing. The rest of the money was intended to go towards capital works and repair and maintenance of equipment, roads, buildings and other infrastructure. It was estimated that the schemes to be funded under the Act would lead to a net direct increase in employment of between 6,000 and 10,000, with multiplier effects adding to the total. That legislation has now run out of time and is obsolete. The coalition does not oppose the amendment which removes that from the statutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes which have been brought forward are important. They will be important for the coinage side of things.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my contribution tonight I want to concentrate on that part that talks about the Reserve Bank publication of non-bank financial institutions which falls under the Act. It is important to make one or two comments about what, certainly at first glance, would appear to be a rather inconsequential change but one which I think in the fullness of time&mdash;out of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS>&mdash;we might find has some rather more important connotations. I do so having spent over 12 fairly long and detailed months looking at the Australian banking and financial industry. I come to this conclusion having examined in some detail the growth in this country of what has been described as financial conglomerates&mdash;that is, a blurring at the edges of what is a bank, what is a non-bank financial institution, where the distinctions are drawn and how we seem to be moving more and more towards the establishment of a group structure of a financial enterprise which, firstly, has a banking arm, secondly, a superannuation and a life insurance arm and thirdly, perhaps, plays the role of some non-bank financial intermediary or institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country we are also seeing the growth of NBFIs and the sorts of products and services which they are offering in the marketplace in direct competition against the banks. We are seeing the growth of institutions like building societies, and some were mentioned by my colleague from the other side during his contribution tonight. We have seen the growth of the St George Building Society, which rates as one of the top 10 financial institutions in this country, and yet it is ostensibly a building society based in New South Wales. Of course, it is not; there are other building societies under its corporate umbrella in Victoria and Queensland. So it plays a very real part in providing access for consumers to a variety of financial services and the provision of financial products which very closely resemble similar sorts of products that are offered by banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation proposes something quite simple. It enables the Treasurer to delegate to the Governor or Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia the responsibility for varying and publishing the list of non-bank financial institutions which fall under the Act. It is very simple and very straightforward. The legislation talks about putting those particular non-bank financial institutions into categories. Clause 8 amends the principal Act so that the Treasurer may publish the varied list of non-bank financial institutions which were exempt from the application of the Act in such manner and form as he or she determines and not be restricted to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. It will be published in a location different from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bendigo referred to the Farrow Group and the problems associated with the collapse of a building society in his State. It has been suggested by some that, if there was a clear distinction in the minds of consumers and if there was a recognition that there was a spectrum of risk in our financial services industry, many people would not have gone down a particular road in their investment decision. It has been suggested, for example, that if there were appropriate levels of prudential supervision, if there were appropriate levels of risk and risk maintenance, and if there were appropriate levels of some sort of standards, whether they be capital adequacy or whatever, people would have a knowledge of the safety and soundness of the Australian financial industry and would have a knowledge of which particular level in that industry they wanted to invest their life savings in. That is something which we should be striving to achieve. It is certainly something to which the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, when it is tabled in this place on the 26th of this month, will bring a great deal of attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simply by publishing a list in something that has not been specified, in other than the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette,</EMPHASIS> is perhaps developing at least a concept of greater disclosure by providing people with a list, in something which is more widely available than the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette,</EMPHASIS> of appropriate and approved non-bank financial institutions. That is a step in the right direction. People's access to that information is critical in allowing them to make a decision as to which particular institution they should invest their money with&mdash;whether it be a bank, a building society, a credit union or whatever. If that information is provided in a comprehensible form, if it is provided as a list saying, `This is a non-bank financial institution which is safe and sound and in some way is going to enshrine some degree of competitiveness for people', that is an appropriate way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that this amendment to the legislation will enable that to happen. I hope it will enable us to take yet another step along the road to greater disclosure and make information available to consumers. Even if it is in the form of a published list of NBFIs which fall within the ambit of the Financial Corporations Act 1974, it at least says to people, `Here is a list of so-called and approved non-bank financial institutions'. While we are striving for greater disclosure about those sorts of things, it is an appropriate way for consumers to have that information and, accordingly, to respond in terms of their investment decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, as has been suggested by some, this particular amendment will simply allow the Reserve Bank from time to time to publish that sort of information, maybe in its monthly bulletin, rather than in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, it may be wasted, as the information may simply be available to some people who have a broader knowledge of the source of other information about NBFIs, banking statistics and so on. How to make that information available to all consumers is an issue which should be addressed by the Governor or the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank when considering this matter at some stage in the future after the passage of the legislation. It is something which I think is important. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My friend across the table is asking what are the practicalities of making information available. I do think that there clearly are some difficulties in ensuring that information is made available. At the end of the day, there are even more difficulties in ensuring that, once consumers have hold of that information and are armed with it, they still make the correct decision. Nobody should ever take the responsibility for consumers' decision if they are provided with information. At the end of the day, the consumer is the person who will have to be responsible for the decision. Through discussing the methodology of distributing information through the counters of NBFIs, I would think, as has been suggested, that in terms of the practicalities it might be appropriate to provide the information in other forums rather than simply publishing it in a gazette.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gippsland was just about to suggest to me that the Reserve Bank does not supervise NBFIs. Whilst that may be the case at the moment, in the future the Reserve Bank may have a greater role in terms of discussing supervision on the functional basis that we have in this country at present. We may see that there will be further discussion on how best to achieve supervision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that extent, we may see it suggested by the Governor or his nominee member from the Reserve Bank that the NBFIs should, through their own organisational structure that is about to be put in place&mdash;the AFIC, which is to be created over the next few months, based in Brisbane&mdash;take the decision that information of this nature should be made available across the counters and in all sorts of building societies, credit unions and other organisations that are covered here. I think that is probably the most appropriate and the least expensive of all the options that are available and something which I am sure would fall very nicely into some sort of code of conduct of how NBFIs might operate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate with considerable interest. For a start, the Financial Legislation Amendment Bill deals with matters relating to the minting of coins which are special but are still legal currency in Australia. However, I recollect that we had a bit of a tax problem with that as people started to pay themselves in $100 coins or whatever the face value was. In fact, the coins could be flogged at the mint or to any gold dealer for substantially more than the face value. I think that particular problem has been overcome. It only goes to prove how quickly people will identify a situation and take some advantage from it. Legislators must at all times consider those matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coins that led the way in this regard were coins minted in Western Australia, a leading gold producer in this country. The Western Australian Mint is a leader in the refining of gold and all those matters that are associated with it. The goldmining industry in Western Australia is still a major contributor to our foreign reserves, notwithstanding the fact that this Government apparently saw some merit in changing the tax laws applicable to gold and that, with the advent of imputation, the gold industry was taxed at the dividend level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation proposes to give the Treasurer the ability immediately to approve applications due to changes that might occur from time to time with these coins on issue. That sounds reasonable but, on the other hand, it is not a bad idea to look at some of the history relating to these gold coins. It was Premier Burke who first suggested that maybe Western Australia should issue its own gold coins. Gold Corp was formed for this purpose and it became one of the iniquitous WA Inc. companies. When these companies were considered in the Parliament, the members of the Liberal Party complained bitterly about the Government's proposals, which included having corporations, of which the Government was the sole shareholder, which had no responsibility to our corporate laws and which refused to report to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the amazing situation of business enterprises that were totally above the law. The more interesting thing was that, although that was reported in the press, it was never condemned in the press. It is further of interest to me that had those things been properly dealt with, had the magnitude and the gravity of those rather foolish decisions been considered, Premier Burke might have a better image in Australia today. Quite clearly, when governments go out to give business enterprise&mdash;be it the property of the shareholders or anyone else&mdash;that form of protection against everything, they end up in the disastrous situation which we read about day after day in the WA Inc. Royal Commission proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other parts of this legislation deal with the role of the Reserve Bank in identifying institutions which fall under the Financial Corporations Act 1974. We are told that the amendments to the Financial Corporations Act 1974 permit the Treasurer to delegate to the Governor or Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia the responsibility for varying and publishing the list of non-bank financial institutions which fall under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) spoke about the role of some of those fringe institutions, namely, the building societies that have not really become banks. Due to decisions of State governments during the boom of the 1980s, when laissez faire banking regulations were seen to be more important than the quite sensible process of deregulation, what were traditionally lenders to the housing industry were freed up and told to go out into the big world of corporate enterprise. But nobody thought to put upon them the sort of controls that exist on the proper banks. We had State non-regulation with no responsibility by the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these institutions also carried the label of authorised trustee investment. Honourable members might be interested to know that the notorious Rothwells Merchant Bank in Western Australia was an authorised trustee investment. One might wonder why Mr Burke, Mr Dowding and others were frantic to rescue Rothwells considering that, for instance, as a result of that classification, the Roman Catholic Church, many large local government authorities and certain trade unions all had their money in there and looked like not getting it out. </PARA>

The first lesson that ordinary people should learn is that if established banks are paying 10 per cent and someone else comes along and offers 20 per cent, unless the security is foolproof, there is a good chance of losing money. We have had the Reid Murray groups and there was another chap whose name will come to mind who, many years ago in Western Australia, used to pay above the going interest rate. He went broke and went down with quite a few problems. He lost his reputation and everything. He was resurrected by the Burke Government as a financial adviser when all of these you-beaut schemes were introduced. He was one of the first.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not propose to detain the house with a long speech tonight, because it was only on Thursday that I drew attention to the fact that over the past six or seven years this Government has been legislating by exhaustion. Tonight we have a similar situation, where the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is about to put through the appropriate motions that will result in no fewer than 22 Bills being dealt with between now and midnight on Thursday night. As I understand it from the papers that have been circulated, the House will sit until midnight tomorrow night, until around 8 p.m. on Wednesday and midnight on Thursday to deal with these 22 Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been very cynical in the use of the guillotine and is debasing parliament. It is unfortunate that the Leader of the House, who I thought at the beginning of this session was going to correct the errors of the past, has fallen into the same habit as he developed a few years ago. I say this in a very sincere way. At the beginning of the session the Minister, at my request, made available to the House of Representatives a schedule of legislation. I asked the question of him so that we could get an indication at the beginning of the session of the legislation to be dealt with and hopefully put some discipline on the Government to ensure that the legislation was brought into the House in plenty of time to avoid this occurring. I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the Leader of the House will recall my saying that I hoped that the action taken by the Leader of the House at that time would lead to a guillotine-free session. I was very sincere when I said that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is occurring now flies in the face of what ought to happen in a well-run parliament. I know that the Minister has said on previous occasions that this is necessary because of the cut-off date in the Senate for legislation to be dealt with before the end of the session, but he knows that that provision prevails in the Senate. Therefore, the legislation should have been drafted, should have been processed through Cabinet, should have been processed through the Government party room and introduced in time for proper debate to take place and for there to be no need for a guillotine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is treating parliament with derision and on each occasion when the Government takes its action we intend to voice our protest. We know it has the weight of numbers and it can force on parliament whatever program it wishes, but we will take every opportunity to let the public know that proper consideration has not been given to the legislation by parliament, and indeed by Government and Opposition members. Shadow Ministers do all they can to ensure that the Bills are properly scrutinised, but on many occasions legislation is introduced on a Thursday and debated on a Monday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that tonight, for example, we will be debating the State Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill. That very important Bill was introduced on Thursday of last week, and here we are on Monday evening at 10.45 about to commence debating that Bill, which still has not been to the Opposition party room. It has been through our shadow Cabinet, the shadow Minister has had an opportunity to discuss the matter with some other members of the Opposition parties, but we have not had time to even process it through our party room in the ordinary way. Mr Deputy Speaker, we oppose the motion moved by the Leader of the House and we intend to vote against it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to add some words to those of the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife) because there is another aspect to all this which gives a clear indication as to why Australia is in the mess it is in. The Government could not run guts to a slow butcher.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple facts are that we are not dealing with matters of great complexity. What have we dealt with on the guillotine today? We have dealt with the Government's tax measures and its Budget measures&mdash;things that it must have been discussing for months before they came to this Parliament. Today under the guillotine we have dealt with issues in which the Government has literally changed the figures in a piece of legislation to lift the threshold in certain aspects of the Medicare levy. A really big, complicated exercise that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and his Government have held up till now! The Government has had to guillotine it through the Parliament, when many of these matters could have been pushed through immediately after the Budget and given reasonable time and consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last time this happened I stood up and said it was a bureaucratic conspiracy. I am no longer convinced of that. Every Bill here tonight relates to the Budget, measures relating only to financial adjustments, in many cases just changing the numbers in a law, and the Government has not had the time or the organisational skills to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members wonder why we are still waiting for a third runway. They can give us all the smart alec answers they like and talk about due process. `Due process' means to learn to run the place properly. If they cannot run this place, how the heck can they run the country? It is outrageous. It is outrageous when we look in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and again see the sort of measures they are rushing through this Parliament at the end of the session. They should know what happened when they did it last time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the first part of this session was taken up with amendments to Bills as thick as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. Why? Because the Government got it wrong the first time and it did not have an opportunity to get the assistance of the Opposition nor, for that matter, its own back bench, which has been denied the opportunity in many cases to make significant contributions in this place that, firstly, might help the Government in running the country and, secondly, might just give those on the back bench a chance to show their constituents&mdash;whose support they are going to need pretty soon&mdash;that they have some interest and qualifications regarding these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is treating our side with contempt, it is treating its own side with contempt and it is treating the Parliament with contempt. As I said, I could accept that when I thought it was some sort of bureaucratic conspiracy. But when I come in here and see the sort of stuff we are dealing with under the guillotine at the moment&mdash;the literal changing of numbers&mdash;I know that it is the Government's fault. I know that the Government cannot possibly do the sorts of things it claims it is able to do. As I said, one is not surprised to see one million people out of work and to see a country in tatters because the Government could talk but it could not run&mdash;it could not administer. I am fed up with it. I think it is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a constructive sense, I add that if the Government is going to keep people up until 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock in the morning, it might even look&mdash;I presume the Government might do that now for the rest of the session&mdash;at what I think is a reasonably successful arrangement of going right through on Thursdays and not having an official lunch break. The Government might try to gather some extra debating time&mdash;just to give its own fellows a chance to have a bit of a say about what goes on in this place to demonstrate to their constituents what they do here. The Government should not treat its own backbenchers like dirt. It never lets its own members ask questions about their own constituencies. They have all got to take their dorothy dixers. The Government has had a few revolts lately, but it has treated its own backbenchers like dirt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can see the Leader of the House making a note. If he is making a note to say that we used to do that when we were in Government, I can tell him that we did not. I have seen dorothy dixers go from one end of the table to the other because our members, firstly, had an interest in their own constituencies and, secondly, had questions they wanted to ask of their own Ministers to test them out to see whether they were doing the job for their constituents. They were not prepared to participate in this charade that this Government runs when all its poor folk, whom it calls its backbenchers, never get the chance to act as proper members of parliament. The Government, with its guillotine, never gives its members a chance to debate or to ask questions unless it suits the Minister on the front bench. Is it not about time that they learnt how to write questions? Half the time they write them, they are out of order. This is the way the Government runs the place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell the Leader of the House&mdash;he will shortly not even be the Manager of Opposition Business because he cannot protect his 2 1/2 per cent&mdash;that I have had enough of it. He will be back at university giving lectures on how he worked in government. Fancy, those poor kids will be taught administration by the Leader of the House. Thanks very much. There are a couple of people in Western Australia who run the Government's health policy whom I would prefer did not operate on me. Please do not teach my grandchildren, because I think there are other people who would do it better. That is the message. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is not bringing forward serious matters that have just come up; things that have to be introduced into this Parliament right now. The Government's money Bills do and they should have been lodged the same night that the Government delivered its Budget, if the Government had any ability to organise at all. It is about time that the Government took this on board and demonstrated that it has some administrative skills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join in the protest this evening at this further action on the Government's part to guillotine through a large proportion of the legislative program. It seems that year after year the Government dawdles through the legislative year and then brings on a bundle of legislation in the dying days and expects it all to be dealt with in a few minutes. It is all very well for the Government to claim that the legislation is important, it needs to be dealt with, or the Macklin amendment requires it. The Government is well aware of all those circumstances on 1 January when it plans its year. If the Government had any capacity to manage the Parliament, clearly, the legislative program would be brought on in an orderly manner. It is easy to come to the conclusion that if the Government cannot run the Parliament it is no wonder it cannot run the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought that the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) received some very interesting information on 16 October in answer to a question on notice addressed to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), who is sitting at the table. The honourable member for Lyons asked on how many occasions the guillotine had been used in each year from 1976 to 1990. I thought that the answer was most illuminating. Let us go back to the year 1976. Guess how many occasions the guillotine was used that year? Nought. In 1977 it was used twice and in 1978 it was used five times. There is a similar story for every year right through until 1985. When the Labor Government arrived on the scene in 1985 the guillotine was used 26 times. That was more than the previous years put together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986 the guillotine was used 40 times. When we got to 1988, it was used on 93 occasions to force Bills through the Parliament. In 1989, the guillotine was used 59 times; in 1990 it was used 78 times. Is 1991 to be a new record? There is a fairly good chance because a large number of Bills were guillotined through in the middle of the year. More legislation has been guillotined last night and tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a satisfactory way in which to deal sensibly with legislation. Is it any wonder that a very large proportion of these Bills has had to be brought back into the Parliament at a later stage to have mistakes fixed up. It is natural that when Bills are forced through with 10 minutes or 20 minutes debate there will be an inadequate debate of the difficult issues involved. Often, there is no committee stage at all. In fact, I recall an instance during the May session when the time allowed for debate had expired before the Bill to be debated had even been brought on. There was no debate at all on that Bill, let alone any opportunity for the Opposition to raise its amendments, let alone any opportunity for any detailed scrutiny of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noticed on occasions that the Senate looks a little more closely at legislation and finds some of the obvious defects in legislation brought before it. It is not just the Government that makes errors when it tries to bundle 93 Bills through in a very short period; the bureaucrats responsible for drafting them, in the pressure of those circumstances, make errors too. Therefore, the whole process has to be done again in a few months time. Surely it would be more sensible to bring these Bills into the House systematically, a few each day of the legislative program, so that proper consideration can be given to each of the Bills. It is really not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On each occasion the Opposition protests. Usually the Leader of the House indicates that he is unhappy as well; that he wishes it was not done that way and that he will try to do better next time. But each year the story is just as bad, and just as bad for Australia. It is not just that the Parliament is being treated with contempt but, what is worse, the people of Australia are being treated with contempt. Ordinary Australians who are affected by this legislation have no opportunity to look at it. They have no opportunity to make any kind of input; no opportunity to indicate to the Government where the legislation is flawed; no opportunity to raise with the Opposition improvements that they feel should be made. To allow 10 minutes, 20 minutes or 30 minutes for a debate is, quite frankly, scandalous. To allow 2 1/2 hours for debate on some of the important pieces of legislation is scandalous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the legislation that is around. There are Bills of great significance&mdash;Bills which the Government believes will significantly alter the way our country will progress. Surely, if the Government is proud of its legislation it would want it to be debated in the House and subject to considerable detailed examination by all Australians. The Government would want to take credit for what is good. Instead, the Government hides behind shoddy legislation by dumping it in here in a great heap, expecting us all to look the other way. That is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, our words are empty because the Government has the numbers to continue this gross abuse of power. The Government's use of its numbers to force through legislation without proper consideration is the sort of thing one would expect from a hillbilly dictator. I protest. I think it is time that the Government did better. If the Government is not able to do better, I think it should hand over to somebody else who can. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank honourable members who participated in the debate for their contribution. I will pick up one or two points. Firstly, I draw the attention of honourable members to something pointed out by the Clerk. There is a misprint in the name of one of the Bills. `Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Bill (No. 2)' should be `Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment (No. 2) Bill'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted actually to have an opportunity to respond to what honourable members have said earlier. I do not really know whether it is worth while responding to the remarks of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). His Party has already passed judgment on what it thinks about his administrative competence and where it wishes to see him if ever it comes to be part of the governing process again, and that is certainly nowhere near any administrative position. He had an opportunity in administrative terms to develop a policy. He was not able to do it. As a result of that, he found himself languishing on the back benches. Perhaps some indication as to why he languishes there still can be seen in the remarks that he had to make. For example, he got up and said to me: `Ya know, on Thursdays, whatcha oughta do is get in there and whatcha oughta have is a debate on Thursdays so you could explain your Bills'. The honourable member for O'Connor, of course, if he bothered to attend this place on Thursdays, would know that we debate through the lunch hour. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, you actually mentioned the word `Thursday', you stupid clot. So I guess that is the Opposition's particular problem there. Then the honourable member suggested to us that we needed to give a bit more freedom for the Government backbenchers at Question Time. I think I can remember once while this Parliament has been sitting&mdash;no, actually probably twice&mdash;when we have actually seen the Opposition back bench members rise to ask their questions of the Government on matters of Government policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just talking about tactics a bit, since the honourable member has raised the matter in this debate, I recollect that when we were in opposition we would operate on the basis that we would have a sort of specialised front bench question period on perhaps one or two days of the week and the rest of the time&mdash;or at least one day a week&mdash;we would let the backbenchers have at least a hit at it, or else we would operate with only two or three front bench questions during Question Time and then for the rest of that Question Time the Opposition back bench would have a go. I have never seen an Opposition back bench so massively dragooned as the back bench of this Opposition. Perhaps when one looks at the contributions of the honourable member for O'Connor, one understands some of the reasons for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point was made that we have been heavy users of the guillotine, and that is true; I would not run away from that. If honourable members opposite bothered to take out the statistics on closure, they would find that there was a distinct difference on the issue of closure between the period when they were in office and our period in office. It was the habit of honourable members opposite, in controlling the House, not to use a guillotine provision to finish off legislation but to close debate on each individual Bill as it came through. The net effect is the same. One can decide that one will announce the program for the week in advance and tell people when Bills will be on and that they will be debated for a couple of hours, and put through a guillotine. That is one way of restricting debate. If one works out one's own timetable and then at the end of each particular two- or three-hour slot one closes the debate, that will have the same effect. It will not actually produce a guillotined Bill. Nevertheless, it will produce just as much restriction on debate. That, of course, is the technique that honourable members opposite used heavily when they were in office. We happen to use the guillotine heavily; we think it is better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also been under a pressure that honourable members opposite were not under. I have really given up arguing with the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife), who always anticipates what I might say about the Macklin closure and says it for me. The point, however, is this: if honourable members opposite really have a serious beef about what happens to them in the House of Representatives, it would not be a bad idea for them one day to go and have a talk to a couple of their senators and suggest that they do not support the continuation of the Macklin amendment, because it is actually getting more and more ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At first, as I recollect, the Macklin amendment used to come into operation at the end of the month preceding the time that people thought that Parliament would rise. So it would come in at the end of May on the assumption that Parliament would rise by the end of June; and it would come in at the end of November on the assumption that Parliament would rise by Christmas time. The Macklin amendment for this year, for some reason or other, applies as of this Friday, which is effectively half way through November, and it is being pushed back further and further into the period of sitting. The effect of that, of course, is to put us in the situation in which we absolutely have to have Bills to the Senate by earlier and earlier dates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor suggested that we ought to have all of our legislation prepared when we put down the Budget. It is an interesting thought. Were we to achieve it, we would be unique; we would be about the first Australian government on record to have actually achieved that. In setting government hoops of performance to jump through, it is an interesting test; but it is not a test which anyone has managed to pass to this point as far as the operation of the House is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come down to the way in which the House operates and one advantage which those opposite have which we did not have. About four or five years ago, we decided that we would proceed with a pattern of sittings of two weeks on and two weeks off. I think the pattern is probably all right, but the net effect of that and one other development&mdash;which I will come to later&mdash;has been very bad for Government business. Even though, technically, under the Standing Orders we sit for the same number of hours under the two weeks provision as we did under the three weeks provision that is, of course, a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we had was three weeks with three days worth of sitting. We now have two weeks with seven days worth of sitting, but longer hours. Those three weeks worth of sittings of course provided opportunities to introduce&mdash;if one wanted to&mdash;regular Friday sittings. Upon suspending the 11 o'clock rule, one had nine days worth of 11 o'clock rule suspensions as opposed to seven days worth of 11 o'clock rule suspensions. Effectively, that difference of two days worth of 11 o'clock suspensions per month, of itself, amounts to almost a normal day's additional sitting&mdash;depending how long it goes. If we add in the Fridays as well&mdash;which, as I recollect, we frequently did&mdash;it gives us even more time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have further penalised ourselves in the management of Government business in this House by adding to what those opposite never did and that was provide an absolutely guaranteed regular private members' time. One thing was guaranteed when we were in opposition, and that was&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must confess that I have heard the same speech from the fellows opposite five times; so if I can put up with it, the honourable member can put up with it. We used to get grievance time when we were in opposition, and we would get it regularly. But grievance Thursdays were every second Thursday, not every Thursday. We would have a General Business Thursday every now and then, but generally it was knocked off. Yet we have a policy of never wiping out private members' business on a Thursday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one adds that together, even though technically the hours look the same, we have effectively rendered government time one-half to two-thirds what it was before. I would argue, nevertheless, that the House is a better place for that. I would argue that what private members have an opportunity to do in here, by virtue of the fact that they do have that guaranteed period on Thursdays, is actually useful given that the Executive controls this place. It opens up the possibility for there to be decent consideration of private members' legislation and it opens up the possibility that there be a guaranteed hearing of private members' motions. It means that there is at least a point in time when the Government loses control of the business of this place and hands it over to the people who operate it, enabling them to come at us about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not particularly want to see this very important change tossed over simply because it would allow us more time to consider the sort of legislation we are debating here. There is no doubt at all that the guillotine would be far less severe if we could have gone into that three or four hour slot either last Thursday or this coming Thursday in order to get the legislation through. Also, I think the fact that the two weeks on and two weeks off is much better for members of parliament, particularly those of us who come from more outlying areas. Honourable members get a better chance to do their business in their electorate when they have two weeks straight away from the Parliament, rather than when they are operating, effectively, with one week away from the Parliament in the month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So on the whole I think that the business of the House is better conducted, but there are penalties, and this is the penalty. Opposition members should not kid themselves that they did not impose similar&mdash;but, I admit, not as heavy&mdash;penalties on the Parliament when they were in government, because, generally speaking, they had sufficient time to operate without guillotine but with closure instead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By and large, I think the Parliament works better now, although it does not work perfectly. We still have a problem with private members' time in that we are still not in the situation where private members' material can come on for votes, and I think that is something we have to think about collectively on both sides of the House a bit more in order to improve the quality of that time yet again. But it will be this Government that has done it. It was never done by any members opposite when they had the opportunity to do it when they were in government. Furthermore, as the Manager of Opposition Business well knows, I think I am probably the only Leader of the House ever to have released the Government's program&mdash;</PARA>

I am the only Leader of the House ever to have released to the Opposition the Government's program for business for the period of the sittings, albeit with the obvious sensible caveat that governments cannot necessarily stick to those programs, because there will always be things which will knock off, change or alter in some way the legislative program as situations arise. The guillotine is no fun&mdash;I agree with the Opposition on that&mdash;but there have been some rewards for having to put up with it that extend to most of the people in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to begin my remarks on the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991 by adding my voice to the protests which have come from this side of the chamber about the way in which the Government has put itself in the position of railroading this legislation through the Parliament. This Bill is not a complex Bill. It provides for funding of programs which were announced in the Budget, and there is no reason whatsoever why this piece of legislation could not have been introduced into this chamber shortly after the Budget. Instead, the Bill was introduced last Thursday and brought forward for the resumption of the second reading debate today, the following Monday, before we have even had a chance in the Opposition to put this Bill through the party room.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only conclusion that one can draw from the handling of this legislation is that the Government holds this chamber in contempt. It is not interested in providing the Opposition or the public with the chance to fully debate and consider a Bill which appropriates well over $2 billion for schooling in this country. This debate will close in some 40 minutes time, and that will be the only allocation provided to this House to consider this immensely important series of programs. It is to the lasting discredit of this Government that these procedures have been adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The funding provided in this Bill is directed to Australian schooling, both government and non-government. Firstly, as to the programs that are funded in this Bill, the Government has failed throughout its term of office to provide an appropriate strategy to ensure that Australian students have access to world class schooling. Its approach has been centralist and bureaucratic, and it has manifestly failed to address any of these significant structural issues which have damaged and continue to damage schooling in this country. In particular, it has endeavoured to impose ever greater bureaucratic controls over schools, both government and non-government, through its intrusive accountability requirements and its obvious movements towards an imposed national curriculum in schooling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has constantly worked to tighten the grip of the centralised industrial relations system which has been destructive in its effects on the status of teaching, the role of principals, and on the management of schools. Indeed, there are very few features of Australian schooling which have not been damaged by the centralised industrial relations arrangements. Yet the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), who is at the table, has constantly sought to further centralise those arrangements and to create a national award and national teacher unions, always neglecting the fact that this centralisation continually takes away from the school and from the principal. It takes away the autonomy and the independence needed by those who should be leading quality education at the grassroots in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, through this system, has consistently excluded parents from an effective role in the government school systems. It has imposed decisions, increasingly through the Australian Education Council, with inadequate consultation with non-government schools, school systems and parents. It has further restricted parent choice of schools through measures such as the so-called&mdash;and one must say ironically named&mdash;new schools policy, the principle objective of which is to stop new non-government schools actually being established. Indeed, over the lifetime of that policy, since 1985, the Government has effectively prevented some 30,000 non-government school places coming into existence. It has failed consistently to lower the financial hurdles in the way of parents, particularly low income parents, exercising their right to choose a school which reflects their values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has failed to provide the community with satisfactory and objective measures of the standards of attainment of students in Australian schools. It has failed to push this measure through the Australian Education Council. It has failed to take any constructive action with the States in relation to the better assessment of the standards of learning in this country. Why? It is for fear of treading on the toes of its bureaucratic and union mates. Finally, the Government has consistently poorly targeted assistance to educationally disadvantaged students and deliberately neglected the severe problems of the rural educationally disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In responding to criticisms of this kind, the Government has concentrated on symbolic measures which have little or no positive impact on Australian schooling. I cite as examples of such measures the so-called effective schools program and the project on the quality of teaching and learning. These are poor substitutes for giving the community the information it is entitled to have, the schools the flexibility they need to do the job, the teachers the professional independence they require, and the parents the effective right to choose their child's school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will not oppose this legislation, but I foreshadow a second reading amendment which will condemn the Government for its restrictive funding policies for non-government schools; its operation of the new schools policy and the bureaucratic accountability requirements; its failure to recognise the real problems of language and literacy in Australia; and its failure to adequately address the problem of retention in rural and remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to the issue of the language and literacy initiatives funded in this legislation. A number of studies have shown the disturbing trend in which far too many Australian students not only are falling further behind the standards of the students in other countries, but also are too often possessed of basic skills too inadequate to provide a satisfactory foundation for effective participation in the workplace or as citizens in a democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been conservatively estimated that over one million Australians, many young and mostly from English speaking backgrounds&mdash;contrary to the view that the Minister seeks to present in this House from time to time&mdash;do not have adequate literacy to function effectively in this society or in the Australian work force. It is a national problem of immense magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition parties have already pointed to the serious deficiencies of the White Paper produced by the Government, which was universally condemned in the submissions made to the Government during its Green Paper stage. In its proposals, of course, we see reflected the weaknesses of the Government's entire approach in this vital area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, there is no satisfactory commitment to the objective assessment of language proficiency. The funds for English as a second language program are not targeted to the students whose proficiency in English can be demonstrated to be inadequate, because the Government refuses to undertake such objective assessment, so those funds are much less satisfactorily targeted to students on the basis of the language spoken at home. Of course, many of these students in fact probably have very satisfactory language proficiency, but the Government is not interested in targeting such enormous funds as are provided through this program effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the programs do not clearly distinguish between educational and economic reasons for teaching languages other than English at school, and there is excessively centralised decision making in the Minister as to which languages will be taught. The Minister has taken it unto himself to decide which languages will be priority languages and which languages will be learned in school. The Minister has never outlined, and does not outline in the White Paper, a satisfactory strategy for ensuring that there is available in the Australian work force a level of competence in those languages which will actually be of assistance to Australian exporters as they seek to break into international markets. No, the Minister decides that he will determine which languages will be taught in Australians schools at all levels, presumably on the assumption that somehow out of this there will emerge a sufficient number of proficient speakers of those languages which Australia requires for trade purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is evident in these programs the most extraordinary confusion on the Minister's part between the use of languages other than English for economic purposes and the importance of language for its educational value as a rigorous area of study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the Government is unable to act in this area without the heavy bureaucratic hand, and I cite here the fate of the ethnic schools program, where it appears that as a result of the Government's decisions, there will actually be a reduction in foreign language teaching by substituting costly bureaucratic control over this program by the school systems in place of the low cost, efficient program provided by the communities through their insertion classes. The Opposition condemns the Government's approach in this area, and I am pleased to say that it has been effectively condemned, particularly by members of the Italian community, who have provided the wider community and indeed mostly students from non-Italian speaking backgrounds with an excellent service in a non-bureaucratic and low cost way. Unfortunately, what the Government is proposing here will disrupt the provision of these classes and impose a much higher cost framework on the provision of such courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, there has been a comprehensive failure by the Government to address the problem of English language literacy for mother tongue speakers, because the one thing the Government does not want to find out is effectively where the problems lie. It has been talking about this problem for years. It has been introducing symbolic measures. But the one thing it does not want to have is an effective objective assessment of language proficiency, because that will be too politically difficult for it to introduce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against these severe shortcomings the coalition has an alternative approach which it puts forward as a proper basis for such programs. Firstly, there is an undoubted need to concentrate on encouraging best practice initiatives to address literacy problems and to teach languages other than English. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is a need to encourage independent initiatives at the school level rather than at the State and Federal bureaucracy level, and to encourage competition for funds on the basis of cost and quality through tender processes. These principles, of course, were fully reflected in the school level excellence program for languages other than English which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) announced last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, policy in this area has to be based on an objective assessment of proficiency levels. Finally, at the school level, it has to be focused on the educational value of languages other than English as a rigorous intellectual field of study, while targeting particular languages at the elite level for trade purposes. Programs in this area should further aim to promote the broader goal of structural reform of schooling in the direction of independent government schools, accountable to a parent market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Properly structured Commonwealth specific programs in this and other areas can make an important contribution to such a development. Of course, the programs which the Minister has put forward, such as the program for the quality of teaching and learning, are structured around the Government's industrial relations arrangements and will do precious little to encourage developments of the kind which we actually need to see in Australian schooling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because there are others who wish to speak in this debate, I will conclude my remarks shortly. I want to make some comments on the non-government school programs, which are of enormous importance to parents' choice in this country, yet the Government has consistently taken the view that it will do little more than tolerate the existence of the non-government school sector. It has put in place policies, such as the new schools policy, and the accountability requirements designed to ensure that the non-government school sector operates under the sorts of bureaucratic constraints which the Government has been compelled to place on it by its mates in the government school unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has provided a funding regime for the non-government schools which will ensure that the more expensive of those schools, in terms of the level of fees charged, will become increasingly elitist. At the end of the spectrum, where low income parents are seeking to exercise choice, the Government has consistently held back the appropriate capital funding so that the quality of the infrastructure available to schools catering particularly to low income families has consistently deteriorated. There are some special purpose programs which the Government has put in place to target particular areas. These do precious little to address the general problems of infrastructure which are emerging in the non-government school sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wherever one looks across the balance of programs being provided by the Government and funded through this legislation, one finds a totally unsatisfactory approach being adopted, one which fails to acknowledge the essential structural issues in Australian schooling, one which constantly focuses on what the Federal Government believes it can do by concentrating control in its own hands and, thereby, doing further damage to the schooling system in this country.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We incorporate many Special Programs to complement the on-going hard work of our most capable teachers in this school, as they endeavour to provide quality education for our students. We see Literacy development as perhaps our most major goal as it is crucial to learning across the curriculum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our school has been a "LITERACY FOCUS SCHOOL" which enabled us to provide additional inservice, and further strengthen the qualities of our teaching. We have a significant Aboriginal population and Pitjantjatjara is taught as a Community Language.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much has been done to establish a strong foundation for students to build on in their later schooling; without the foundation, attempts to assist at later stages of development are more difficult because already the cycle of failure, lost confidence, and a negative attitude to learning/school frustrate both learner and teacher.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Pennington Bilingual program is unique in the South Australian State System in that it fosters the cognitive development of newly-arrived children by maintaining and further developing their first language, parallel to their acquisition of English. In the past the learning of New-Arrival students was affected during the period when they needed to come to terms with the English language.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on. It is signed by Toni Cocchiaro. That is the real measure of the support for this Government's policy. I commend the efforts of those three principals who are outstanding leaders in South Australia and recognised highly within their local communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier that this Government is responsible for a revolution in employment, education and training in this country. Growth and attention given by this Government to higher education and secondary retention rates has been spectacular. However, participation trends in vocational training, although showing average growth of 2.8 per cent per year, have remained virtually unchanged. Similarly, focus on primary education, which is largely a State responsibility, has remained somewhat static. I am therefore delighted that this Bill rightly focuses attention on aspects of primary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objective of the new national elements of the literacy and learning program is to foster development of language, literacy and learning in early years of schooling&mdash;that is, from reception to year 3&mdash;by supporting ranges of major cross-State system activities, including development and delivery of cooperative professional development programs for teachers. I am pleased to say that negotiations are currently under way with Curriculum Corporation to manage the funding provided in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can take a lead from the White Paper on Australian language, there is no doubt that effective literacy is the key to children's personal and vocational development in preparing them for further education and training, life in the community and the world of work. While the literacy development of children is a responsibility of the whole community, schools have a key role to play. The White Paper goes on to say that by international standards Australia has in fact an excellent record in basic literacy. However, as new demands emerge for higher levels of literacy competence, we can no longer be satisfied with the standards of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The White Paper also says that the early period of schooling is critical to literacy development. There is no doubting the evidence that, if children are not making appropriate literacy progress by the end of the third year at primary school, it is likely that they may not make up the gap through the rest of their schooling. The theme of early intervention, that prevention is cheaper and more effective than cure, is a major point that needs to be made again and again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his comment. To support that contention that early intervention in the education system is more cost effective than prevention, that prevention is cheaper and more effective than cure and that quick-fix bandaid remediation is too late, too expensive and has a terrible success rate, I would like to refer to two examples acknowledged internationally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first one concerns the Inner London Education Authority's major four-year longitudinal study of primary age schoolchildren which was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS> educational supplement in 1986. The study states quite categorically that the effect of schooling on children between the ages of seven and 11 can make a substantial difference to a child's future progress and development and, more importantly, that primary schooling is far more significant than the child's race, sex, age or background. In other words, schooling for children aged seven to 11 is the most significant determinant of future success, regardless of race, gender or socio-economic background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other example I wish to refer to concerns Australia and the evolution of the Reverend Ted Noffs's life education centres. Ted Noffs realised that after 10 years of never ceasing crisis counselling on drug and related abuse, nothing would be ultimately achieved if the situation continued to be tackled solely at the dire and desperate end of the road stage, and that breakthrough of a positive, lasting quality could come only through preventive education of all young children from about 4 1/2 to 12 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people in education despair at the contribution of some educational bureaucrats in this country. I personally despair at what is often a decided lack of common sense and nous in dealing with issues that directly impact upon our young people. In fact, the contributions of the honourable member for Goldstein give me the same pain. We do not build houses with cardboard foundations and paper walls and then put in chandeliers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a person is setting up a new industry, he first pays attention to the infrastructure necessary for further success, because that is common sense, that is nous. If education, whether it be primary, secondary, vocational or tertiary, is to be successfully restructured in this nation, a huge dose of common sense needs to be applied. The good schools strategy announced in the 1991 March economic statement makes a great deal of common sense. The strategy has two stages. The first one is the effective schools project administered by ACER, which is an investigation of the features of schools which are successful in achieving measurable value additions and outcomes over and above that which would have been expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information collection phase, which involves surveys of school communities, is complete and it is expected that the final report will be available early next year. In 1992 the good schools program will concentrate on themes which have already emerged from stage 1&mdash;educational leadership, student welfare and behaviour, discipline and school organisation. Subsequent years will build on the 1992 report and full account of the report will be able to be taken from stage 1. Five hundred thousand dollars has been made available to the national project and the quality of teaching and learning to help fund its national schools project, the objectives of which support the good schools strategy. The focus on early intervention and good schooling obviously leads to good teaching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction by this Government of advanced skills teachers is particularly significant because it is creating a career path for highly skilled classroom teachers. Highly skilled classroom teachers will now be able to continue their careers while teaching students in the classroom. There will be significant additional funding under the award restructuring assistance program from 1992. The Bill provides for an additional $124m over the $50m originally provided in 1990 and 1991 to meet the Commonwealth's share of further costs already incurred in those years and to continue the operation of the program in 1992. There is no doubt that the quality of the relationship between children, parents and teachers and schools largely determines the quality of the educational program offered to our young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important aspect of this Bill is the community languages element of the school language and literacy program. The community languages element will operate from 1 January 1992 or from the date of royal assent, whichever is earlier. The Commonwealth will no longer make direct payments to ethnic community organisations but, and I hope that members of the Opposition are listening carefully, all funds will be directed to government and non-government school systems. However, those systems will be able to fund ethnic community organisations if they choose to do so. Funding levels are to be increased by 30 per cent in line with an initiative announced in the White Paper on the Australian language and literacy policy. This increase in funding will assist systems with the cost of aligning the community languages element with mainstream language provisions. Community language programs in primary schools expose children to the possibility of further language study, not necessarily a community language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The White Paper states that proficiency in languages other than English is important because it enriches our community intellectually, educationally and culturally. It also contributes to economic, diplomatic, strategic, scientific and technological development. However, the point does need to be made that the level of languages study in Australia has fallen in the last 25 years. In the 1960s about 40 per cent of final year students studied a language other than English. Today fewer than 12 per cent of year 12 students study a language other than English. At the higher education level it is even more dramatic&mdash;fewer than one per cent of all higher education students complete a language at any stage of their course. The Commonwealth will offer incentives for languages other than English to all schools with year 12 students. States and Territories have developed their own strategies for teaching languages other than English. Five languages are priorities in all State and Territory strategies&mdash;French, German, Japanese, Indonesian and Chinese&mdash;while Italian and Greek receive special recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as our trading environment is concerned, Australian exporters have nominated another list&mdash;Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Indonesian, Korean, Thai, Spanish, German and French, in that order. Obviously, it is not feasible to expect that all languages can be taught on an Australia-wide basis. Accordingly, the Commonwealth will focus upon a core of eight languages to be nominated by each State and Territory Minister. The eight will be chosen from the following group: Aboriginal languages, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, modern Greek, Russian, Spanish, Thai and Vietnamese. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The goal of the Commonwealth is to increase the number of year 12 students studying a language other than English by 25 per cent by the year 2000. To assist in achieving this goal the Commonwealth will offer incentives to all school systems who will have total flexibility in the expenditure of those funds. The grants will be calculated on the basis of $300 per year 12 student completing a priority language up to a ceiling of 25 per cent of all year 12 students in the preceding school year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, when it comes to education of young people this Government is still ideas driven and is still delivering improvements to the Australian nation. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am disappointed that I am under the gag and have so little time to speak, but I am delighted that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) is at the table and I hope he will take the opportunity in the five minutes that I have available to listen to the few brief points that I would like to make to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are four issues that we could address in respect of this Bill: primary schools, secondary schools, the country areas program and the Minister's White Paper on language and literacy. It is my view that our primary schools are the engine of the education system and from them flow all that comes after it. But we tend, I think, somehow to concentrate on the secondary schools and on universities to the detriment of basic learning and basic understanding. I suggest that the Minister, through the Department of Employment, Education and Training, should encourage the States to develop programs very quickly that go back and address the basics in education, the basics in literacy and the basics in numeracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was nothing wrong with the time, when, on the back of the dunny door, hung the paper with the times tables. There was nothing wrong, when we learned by rote how to spell. There was nothing wrong with the time when we could count, add, multiply and divide without the use of calculators, particularly when the batteries failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, it all starts in primary school and it has something to do with testing, because over the last two decades we quit testing&mdash;that is not the fault of the Minister and I do not blame him for that&mdash;nonetheless, we quit testing and it is time that we started testing again, to find out where we are. If we do not, then we may fail a great percentage of our young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Minister of the Wickert study, which said that 15 per cent of adults in this nation are functionally illiterate. I remind him that we do not know&mdash;because we have not tested our youth since 1975&mdash;to what extent our youth are illiterate. We do not know to what extent our primary schools are still feeding the illiteracy problem. I suggest that it is time we did know and that we know accurately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that secondary schools in this country have a great deal to offer. One of the major points of the Finn report, which I have read so many times I cannot count, is a point I agree with absolutely; that is, we must do a better job of incorporating vocational training within the envelope of secondary education. If we can do that in the model of Hervey Bay Secondary College in Queensland, or Redlands or Roma, then I applaud those as models. But I also recognise the fact that there are other models that have something to offer, and they include Oxley Secondary College in Queensland, which offers cradle to grave education, and particularly Upwey primary and high school in my electorate, which now will offer education from prep through adult education, from 7 o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock at night. That is not a bad community education concept as a model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue that I wanted to address is the country areas program. In that respect, assistance for isolated children and Austudy are in desperate need of relief from the assets test for families on farms and families caught up in the assets test who have businesses which are failing, for which they have assets, but for which they have little income. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that one of the things we might consider in the tertiary sector is the creation of a distance allowance for students, to give those who live a long way away from the tertiary institutions the opportunity to attend, a bit of an extra allowance on top, and to give them a chance to catch up with their city cousins. That would not be a bad idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn lastly to the White Paper. I think the White Paper had some good things to say. It had some positive things to say, such as the fact that it acknowledged our illiteracy problem. It established nationally consistent guidelines for assessment of literacy skills, but it failed in that it did not suggest national testing and it failed in that it is based on this silly concept&mdash;if the Minister will excuse me&mdash;of Australian English and standard Australian English, and non-standard Australian English and Aboriginal standard Australian English, which is a bunch of bureaucratic nonsense. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise an issue concerning a person well known to most Victorians, if not many Australians, through his regular appearances on the Saturday evening variety program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hey Hey It's Saturday</EMPHASIS>. While I must confess that I am not an avid fan of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hey Hey</EMPHASIS>, that does not detract from the fact that Mr Ken Morgan, through years of hard work, helped promote the Toyota brand name and, in doing so, created job opportunities for many thousands of our fellow Australians, not counting the 200 or more people who were directly employed in his three dealerships in Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, Mr Morgan and his associates are taking Toyota Motors Corporation and Toyota Finance Corporation to court, alleging that the Ken Morgan group was misled and forced to sign a contract, under economic duress, that effectively led to the receivers being brought in. As that matter is set to proceed later this week, it would be wrong to go into the specifics of the case. However, I believe it is fair to say that similar problems concerning Japanese manufacturers and Australian dealers are arising with an alarming frequency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) spoke of a number of Honda dealers who were told that their franchise agreements would be renewed if there were certain improvements to their premises. Despite those improvements taking place, Honda refused to carry out its side of the bargain. The honourable member for Stirling raised that issue because `others may move in and take up market share'. He then cited the fact that the Otsuka family of Japan took up one of those franchises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, we have seen similar cases. In the hard hit area of Geelong, Toyota moved swiftly against a local dealer, Mr Wal Lawler, who has been the subject of much publicity. Again, in the Morgan case there appears to be little consideration of what receivers have done to hard working Australian families, already devastated by the worst recession&mdash;some say depression&mdash;in 60 years. I know that the Motor Trades Association of Australia is doing a great deal to remove some of the worst inequities arising from the franchise laws but, for many Australians, the changes will come too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, it is difficult to withdraw from the view that some overseas companies&mdash;Japanese in this case&mdash;are using an economic downturn to drive local dealers to the wall, thus picking up commercial property and dealerships at bargain basement prices. I concur with the honourable member for Stirling that it is an issue that ought to be addressed as a matter of urgency by the Trade Practices Commission. Companies such as Toyota ought to be aware of the difficulties a situation such as that affecting Mr Morgan can create. While I certainly do not condone racism in any shape or form, sadly, there are many Australians who will judge the case of a Honda or a Toyota crushing local businessmen as good reason for limiting overseas control of our major industries. </PARA>

The initial response is to determine whether a problem being experienced by a television viewer or radio listener is interference or simply a problem associated with the installation or location of the complainant. To do this the Department provides affected viewers/listeners with a comprehensive, illustrated booklet entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better Television and Radio Reception</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This booklet is designed to enable people to identify and resolve the majority of interference problems themselves, or to refer the concern back to the Department by means of a questionnaire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to radio and television interference caused by transmitters licensed under the Radiocommunications Act&mdash;including amateur radio transmitters&mdash;the Department has found that the basic cause of the problem, in the majority of cases, is the inability of the affected radio or television receiver to reject signals from transmitters located nearby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such `interference' can usually be cured when the affected party installs appropriate filters in the affected television or radio receiver. In some instances, the assistance of a technician may be required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Department determines that a transmitter is the cause of the complaint, the owner of the offending transmitter is required to rectify the problem before resuming transmission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) During the last fiscal year the Department forwarded 16,244 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better Television and Radio Reception</EMPHASIS> booklets to persons complaining of reception difficulties. From these, 2,438 questionnaires were returned to the Department. Investigations emanating from these questionnaires revealed that approximately 50% of the concerns still related to immunity, whereas only 10-15 complaints were related directly to problems with a radio transmitter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No records are kept that would identify the number of complainants who have been advised to obtain filters or have their equipment modified. However, it is probable that nearly all complainants would have received this advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) It is assumed that the honourable member's reference to Australian Standards Council should be Standards Australia. The Department has had discussions with Standards Australia concerning the development of improved and compulsory standards to counter the lack of radio frequency immunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department is also working with supplier organisations to ensure that the industry as a whole is more aware of and responsive to this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department liaises with Standards Australia as a forum during the development of standards for radiocommunications and broadcasting. Currently there are no agreed international standards for television receiver immunity to radio-frequency interference. The German administration has the only known comprehensive standards of this type. While immunity standards have been discussed it would be impracticable for Australia to impose standards of its own in advance of international agreement as there is no domestic receiver manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If immunity standards were introduced now for new television receivers it is estimated that it would take ten to fifteen years before the majority of televisions in use would be equipped with this feature.</PARA>

An agreement is currently being drafted for consideration by both Governments covering the detailed terms and conditions of this grant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Management of the assistance program is the responsibility of the Queensland Government, and decisions about what particular projects are to be funded will be made by that Government.
