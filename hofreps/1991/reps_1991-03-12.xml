<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is to the Treasurer. I draw his attention to a report on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program PM last night that said that he has been `doing a bit of jawboning over the past few days', that he has told colleagues that he has `had it with policy paralysis, with lack of Government direction' and that if the Prime Minister does not quit soon he will. Does the Treasurer's reported jawboning signal that he is not fully satisfied with the measures contained in this afternoon's Government statement?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First, the report to which the honourable gentleman referred was entirely a fiction. Secondly, what we will see today from the Government's statement is change from the only party in postwar history that is capable of delivering it. As we will see, the opening up of this country will be accomplished to a point of finality in this statement. The Opposition may well ponder that, while it had 30 years of opportunity, it squandered it, pursuing the tired nostrums of protectionism, with the Liberal Party being browbeaten by the National Party, with its high tariff wall, with all of the penalties which that brought to farmers and graziers and the penalties which it brought to the urban population of Australia through the decline in our manufacturing capacity and the decline in services-the absence of services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we will see today is more change of a variety which this Government has brought. I know the Opposition has sat over there for years as we have read one statement after another-I think this is about our sixteenth statement. We have brought down eight Budgets and about nine of these. The fact is that every time we have read these statements the Opposition has thought, `Why wasn't it us?'. The answer is because it was too dimwitted to ever think of them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Could the Minister advise the House how the wool market performed during the first two weeks of auctions without minimum reserve price support.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were many predictions of doom and gloom before wool sales reopened on 25 February. Some of the predictions were totally uninformed and could be discounted immediately; others coming from wool industry organisations claimed to be informed, but were in fact scaremongering. The facts are as follows: in the last two weeks, 275,000 bales were offered for auction; pass-in rates were high for the first few days, but by the end of the second week they had fallen to less than 5 per cent on average. I am informed that much of the wool passed in was sold privately after auction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As expected, the price falls from the old 700c reserve were greatest in the middle and broader micron ranges. For example, the 24 micron indicator fell by 45 per cent, while the 19 micron indicator fell by 21 per cent. However, by the end of the first week of sales the market indicator closed at 420c a kilogram clean; on 8 March, it closed at 435c; and yesterday it reached 439c. This result is significantly better than the informed predictions and twice that of the doomsayers. I also point out to the House that the costing of the supplementary payment scheme was based on an average price of 375c clean and a volume of 444 kilotons. For each cent that the average price goes above 375c, roughly $2.9m will be saved.</PARA>
<PARA> The scheme currently looks like costing about $500m-not the billion dollars that the doomsayers in the Opposition and the industry were predicting. I do not think too much should be read into these figures. We still have not had a complete spread of all the wool types. It is really too early to predict exactly how the free market will pan out. There is a meeting of the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council this afternoon. We are looking at many aspects of trade. Members of the Vines Committee will be there. We will be working out how we should conduct this market from 1 July on.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the four months of the exercise of the free market, we have an opportunity to get an idea of just what the price is likely to be in a free market. Certainly, this is the time when we will get that picture. I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his question because I understand that some of the people in his area, particularly those with broader wools, are very concerned about the situation. But so far the indications are that the situation is nowhere near as bad as we thought.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. In light of the murder of the Australian Army warrant officer in Port Moresby last weekend, is he satisfied with existing security arrangements for Australian nationals?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question; it is an important one. I know that all members of this House will be deeply saddened by the murder of Warrant Officer Dowsett in Port Moresby last weekend. I know that I speak for all honourable members of this House in extending our sympathy to the members of his family. We obviously abhor the senseless and indiscriminate violence by criminal gangs in Papua New Guinea against not only expatriates, but also all residents. We expect that the authorities will move swiftly to bring the criminals to justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As this is directly relevant to the honourable gentleman's question, I can inform him that Ministers from my Government and from the Papua New Guinea Government have discussed on a number of occasions recently the need to tackle this serious problem of law and order in Papua New Guinea. When I was there last September, I had serious discussions with the Prime Minister and members of the Cabinet and this was one of the central issues that I discussed at length with them. In fact, specifically Prime Minister Namaliu and I agreed to undertake an examination of ways in which together we may be able to improve cooperation in the law and order area.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to those discussions, I undertook that within our relevant departments we would have a comprehensive review of our position. We have completed that review, and we will be discussing new and practical forms of assistance once Papua New Guinea has finalised its review. It has not yet finalised the review that it proposed to undertake at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, as the honourable member will appreciate, ultimately the responsibility for securing law and order in Papua New Guinea lies with the Papua New Guinea Government, but Australia is already providing very substantial assistance. Specifically, I inform the honourable gentleman that there is a police project aimed at improving police training, management, operations and forensic skills, and the program that we have in place is valued at some $29m over a period of five years. Currently we have 28 long term police advisers in Papua New Guinea. During my visit last September I arranged to increase that number to 43, all of whom will be in place by the middle of this year.</PARA>
<PARA> On one other matter which I am sure will be of interest to the honourable member, we are developing a new and more secure housing complex for Australian officers serving in Port Moresby. I have asked the Minister for Administrative Services to examine urgently the possibility of speeding up the completion of that complex.</PARA>
<PARA> I would trust that the honourable member for Groom would understand, firstly, that we are very much seized of the importance of the issue which his serious question addresses; secondly, that we already have in place accelerated programs to assist Papua New Guinea to address those issues; and, thirdly, that when we do receive that review from the Government of Papua New Guinea, we will see in that context whether there is more that we can do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Land Transport. Can he inform the House of the progress that has been made towards the establishment of the National Rail Freight Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1751" SPEAKER="Brown The Hon R.J." NAMEID="5A5" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CHARLTON" MINISTERIAL="LAND TRANSPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can give some advice about the progress which has been made. All honourable members would be aware of the fact that the task force, which was established to examine and report on the prospects of being able to establish a National Rail Freight Corporation of the kind that had been suggested, was set up as a result of the Special Premiers Conference held on 30 and 31 October last year following a special meeting of State transport Ministers, together with myself, on 7 September last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That task force has been established. It consists of not only our representatives, but also representatives of State governments as well as of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Ted Butcher has been chairing that. He was the President of the Inter-State Commission. That task force has been involved in a great deal of work. It has been operating as well through a number of sub-committees which have been specialising in different aspects of the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe the report has now been completed and should come before us soon. In the first instance it will go to a special meeting of the State transport Ministers and myself, under the provisions of the Australian Transport Advisory Council, on 5 April this year. As a result of consideration at that point, there will be a series of recommendations prepared to go before the Prime Minister, the State Premiers and the Chief Ministers of the Territories at the Special Premiers Conference which will be held on 15 May.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware of the fact that there had been a commitment by us to seek to have established that National Rail Freight Corporation by 1 July. I am pretty sure that we will be able to do that. Honourable members will also be aware of the fact, I am sure, that we will be insisting that it be commercially based, and that it be incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act, as it will be required to be. As soon as it is established under those provisions, there will be the need for us to appoint at least an interim board of directors. It will have the responsibility for the appointment of a chief executive officer, together with a planning and management team, which will then have the responsibility of bringing together all the other considerations, including industrial awards, industrial agreements, the provisions that will need to apply to the type of equity that will be brought in, and the way in which that equity will be valued. The particular responsibilities that we then set ourselves in connection with the National Rail Freight Corporation should then start to come together from 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me say, Mr Speaker, that the previous attempt on the part of governments to establish any type of similar operation occurred as a result of a decision in 1975 to establish the Australian National Railways Corporation. That exercise was undertaken by the coalition when it was in government. It took it almost three years to put it together. The decision by the Prime Minister and the Premiers was made in October last year. We have set ourselves a target to have that corporate structure in place with a board of directors and a planning and management team by 1 July. That means that we will do, in a period of about eight months, something that the coalition in government took almost three years to do.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1751" SPEAKER="Kerin The Hon J.C." NAMEID="QH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WERRIWA" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was reflecting on two components with respect to the trade in wheat to Iraq. The Australian Government provides, I think, up to about $1.3 billion of national interest cover for the various credit markets around the world. At present the national interest cover on the markets is about $1.1 billion. When we go to national interest cover, the industry itself accepts some of the risk. In terms of existing contracts with Iraq, before Iraq decided to attack Kuwait the split was 80:20. That was for wheat that had already been sold and not paid for, and that was risk that we did not think we could act on in terms of its retrospective nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of compensation for sales that were already made-in terms of justice, not in terms of retrospectively accepting risk-is still under review. What we have to take into account there is whether the Australian Wheat Board has sold all the last season's crop-and basically it has-what price it was sold at and how we would calculate whether any variation is due to the fact that the Wheat Board did not sell additional tonnages to Iraq. Some other commodities are in the same position. There are two components and certainly we are still examining the second.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The way he put it suggests that Defence Force members are being compelled to participate in the survey. It is a survey, but there is nothing sinister in its purpose. It is being conducted all over Australia wherever there are servicemen and service women, and also overseas, including within the Persian Gulf. The aim of the census is quite simple: it is to provide a statistical base, like any census, on which to build improved personnel policies in the Australian Defence Force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Twenty or 30 years ago we did not give much thought to service families. We made heavy demands on them, including shifting them around the country and forcing them to endure separation, but took their support for granted. Problems which were experienced by the families were seen as part of the job, and a so-called good wife-and almost always they were wives-did not complain. Some in the Opposition still belong to that same school of thought. During those times the legitimate aspirations of women to outside employment and family support were largely denied.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the life of this Government we have worked to redress many of those injustices. We brought down the Cross report and the report of the Hamilton Review of Effect of Service Life on Spouses.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear my predecessor as Minister saying, `Hear, hear!'. Those reports resulted in the establishment of programs of family support, including the Australian Defence Force (ADF) information and liaison staff, the family information network for defence and the family support funding program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, Minister Beazley set up the Defence Force Housing Authority and committed $750m to defence housing over 10 years. As well, very shortly we will be bringing into this House a generous and modern superannuation scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> Our program of reform is continuing. For example, we are aware of the need to assist spouses with employment and child-care. We know that many service families are isolated from the community services which most civilians take for granted. But we do not have accurate and reliable figures about the dimensions of these problems. This lack of information is what the census is designed to address, particularly in the areas of child-care, education, accommodation and employment.</PARA>
<PARA> It has always been a hallmark of this Government that we have targeted assistance to those in greatest need. This census will help us identify such groups within the defence community and to respond accordingly. The census has been expertly designed in conjunction with the Australian Institute of Family Studies, which will conduct the processing of it and the analysis of the results. It has been well publicised by Defence. Its purpose has been explained and very little concern has been expressed about it.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, might I urge all members of the ADF and their families to take the time to complete the census forms carefully and accurately because the results of it will be used directly to improve the quality of service life. The information in it will be treated confidentially and recorded anonymously.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services and Health may recall that during 1990 serious concern was expressed by doctors and pharmacists regarding the lack of sufficient influenza vaccine, particularly for those at greatest risk, such as the aged and those who suffer from asthma. This was due in part to large corporations, et cetera engaging in mass vaccinations of staff and, to some extent, supply failure. I ask the Minister: will he assure the people of Australia that supply of vaccine will be sufficient for all needs in preparation for the coming winter season?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that last year some concern was expressed within the community and within the Parliament about the availability of the influenza vaccine. As it turned out, that concern was not sustained. In Australia, conditions similar to those in Europe did not eventuate, so we did not have the pressures that had been expected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The experience of last year proves somewhat salutary for the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL). It has put a great deal more effort and resources into planning for this year. Last year I attended a launching at CSL of a campaign to inform pharmacists and the medical profession around Australia as to the availability of vaccines for this winter and also to indicate to those people some of the guidelines so that what is always going to be a somewhat limited resource is used most effectively. Such a plan is in place. I am confident that, providing there is an emphasis on those groups which are most vulnerable, particularly the aged, the problems that were experienced, or at least anticipated, last year will not be repeated this year.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7T4">Mrs CROSIO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Community Services and Health to the comments made by Dr Arnold Mann in the Sun-Herald of 10 March 1991 and again on the 7.30 Report last night that mammography screening may be of no benefit in reducing mortality from breast cancer. Firstly, I ask the Minister: does the evidence concur with Dr Mann's opinion? Secondly, if not, is the Minister able to reassure Australian women, most especially women aged 40 to 49, who appear to be most confused about the possible benefits of mammography, to allay any concerns they may have following Dr Mann's comments, and indeed those of Germaine Greer in the Sun-Herald a week earlier?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1753" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. The issue is one that has caused considerable concern. The answer to the first part of the question is quite simply no. Advice to the Government as contained in the report of the Australian Institute of Health entitled Breast Cancer Screening in Australia: Future Directions was unequivocal in its findings that mammography screening for breast cancer leads to a significant reduction in mortality. On the basis of the report's recommendations, the Government announced in March 1990 its intention to establish a national program for the early detection of breast cancer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main features of the program, which is being phased in over the next five years and which is to deliver a coordinated quality service for Australian women, are that a doctor's referral not be required; the service will be minimal or no cost to those taking part; and all clinics and assessment centres under the program will be accredited to ensure high quality service in both the taking and reading of X-ray film.</PARA>
<PARA> Present indications are that, with a fully operational screening program, 375 deaths, or 16 per cent of all deaths, could be averted every year if screening is of high quality. There are high take-up rates and there is a proper follow-up treatment of any abnormality found. The reduction in mortality in women offered screening after five years is estimated to be of the order of 34 per cent. Women who regularly participate in screening can anticipate a reduction in the risk of death from breast cancer of around 58 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the second part of the honourable member's question, I acknowledge that there is some concern among women as to whether they should participate in mammography screening. This would appear to be most evident amongst women in the 40 to 49 age group who seem to be subject to much conflicting advice as instanced by Arnold Mann's and Germaine Greer's recent comments.</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, let me say that there is considerable evidence that the incidence of breast cancer rises rapidly between the ages of 40 and 49 years. If I could emphasise that point: there is a very marked difference between women close to 40 as opposed to those moving towards the end of that decade. Screening for early breast cancers by mammography is generally agreed to be more effective for post-menopausal women but is nonetheless the most effective means of cancer detection for all women, regardless of age.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision, then, to include women aged 40 to 49 in the national program was made on the basis that about half the female population reaches menopause by age 50 and to exclude these women from the program would prevent a larger number of women from having access to a service which could be of great benefit to them. In line with the recommendations of the Australian Institute of Health, the age range will be monitored and reviewed regularly.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, women under 40 who either have a family history of breast disease or suspected early symptoms of malignancy will continue to have access to diagnostic mammography services, including the accompanying Medicare rebate. The question is an extremely important one and it is one that I was anxious to use to address the concern, particularly among women, that has been expressed to me and my office over the last few months.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;stood at the last election on a platform of wishing to reduce Commonwealth outlays by some billions of dollars. How one can reconcile a reduction in Commonwealth expenditure by some billions with some notion of social justice I simply cannot comprehend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the honourable member's question is concerned, a few years ago there was a review of special education funding throughout Australia-it should be remembered that the funding of these schools and other institutions is a joint responsibility of the Commonwealth and the State governments. As a result of that review it was discovered that there was a malapportionment-an unequal spread-of expenditure by the Commonwealth across the various States to support these services. Consequently, it was decided to put those programs on a more equal basis and to try to provide an equal amount to each State according to the needs and the numbers of the particular groups in question within each of those States. As a consequence of that, Victoria and South Australia both had their amounts reduced as those grants to other States-particularly Queensland, from memory-went up.</PARA>
<PARA> In order to ease the burden of that reduction on Victoria and South Australia, we entered into special arrangements with both of those State governments to phase down the reductions so as not to impact excessively on the budgets of the State governments. Those arrangements were made by agreement and both State governments accepted those arrangements concerning the reductions in Commonwealth support for these programs. As a consequence, we expected the State governments to pick up the amounts of the Commonwealth reductions in accordance with those agreements, and I think that the South Australian Government has been attempting to do just that.</PARA>
<PARA> I will make a further point about this because the Government is concerned about services which are provided to kids with learning disabilities. Therefore, the Prime Minister announced at the time of the last election that we would in fact increase our support for these programs in two important ways. First of all, as far as the non-government sector was concerned, we agreed to fund all of those special schools, not at category 8 as had been the case hitherto, but to increase the category to 12, which meant that the per capita grant going to those non-government schools which were providing these services increased quite significantly-by about 20 per cent in real terms, from memory. As well as that, we said that any school which enrolled a kid with these learning disabilities would be supported, in respect of that child, at the category 12 level regardless of the overall category of the school in which the child was enrolled. Secondly, we decided to increase, by 20 per cent in real terms, the grants to the States for the support of special education services within each of the States.</PARA>
<PARA> So I think the Commonwealth has done a lot to encourage and support these services-services which are vital, not only to the kids with these learning disabilities but also to the families who have such a tough job in trying to support them. The issue that has been raised by the honourable member is essentially one which ought to be taken up with the State governments. If there is something that we can do to assist the honourable member, within the confines of the existing program, as always, we will be perfectly happy to look at it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy aware of the chronic urban flooding problem on the central coast of New South Wales, with more than 8,000 families in my electorate being inundated up to three times annually? Is it a fact that the Gosford City Council's application for this year's flood mitigation funding was ranked last in the New South Wales Government's list of funding priorities? Will the Minister undertake to review carefully next year's funding application with a view to reallocating the New South Wales Government's priorities?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The funds made available by the Commonwealth Government for flood mitigation and water provision generally are always way under what is needed at any particular time. I have recently been involved with honourable members from the western suburbs of Sydney where there is a problem associated not so much with flood mitigation as straight drainage questions. For example, people cannot leave their homes at Christmas time because they are worried about storms. Within seven or 10 minutes, their houses can be flooded. We have a classic problem that really goes to the inadequate planning over the years throughout the western suburbs of Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other parts of the country, including urban areas-particularly the areas of the honourable member for Robertson and in the Newcastle area-flooding also occurs quite frequently.

<PARA> The honourable gentleman asked about the allocating mechanism. I would have to check but I think it is quite true, as he says, that in New South Wales the Gosford area was given a very low priority by the New South Wales Government. There was a general acceptance of the priorities put on these by the New South Wales Government. It put a particular demand on us of another million dollars for Nyngan, given the tragedy that occurred to that town. That meant that there was some adjustment, and this particularly affected Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the general Gosford and Narriah Creek area, there is and was a particular problem and it was given a low priority. I cannot understand that, and I will be getting back to the New South Wales Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The short answer to the honourable gentleman's last question is yes, because I do think that we have to take a closer interest in the priorities. The honourable member for Shortland and his colleague the honourable member for Newcastle are particularly concerned about the situation in Throsby Creek. I really do think that we ought to have a better revaluation of the priorities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services aware of recent claims that the Government's educational profile process for determining funding for higher education institutions has led to increasing interference and intrusion in university affairs? Is there any validity in these claims?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1757" SPEAKER="Baldwin The Hon P.J." NAMEID="MD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SYDNEY" MINISTERIAL="HIGHER EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of some claims, but they are coming from one source only, to the best of my knowledge, and that is from the honourable member for Goldstein, the Opposition spokesman on education. I am afraid the honourable member for Goldstein appears to be suffering from what I would characterise as the `cracked record syndrome'. He goes on asserting that the institutions are hostile and bitter against the profiles process, which is the main methodology that we use to arrive at funding decisions for higher education institutions. He asserts repeatedly that it constitutes a form of unwarranted interference in the internal autonomy of higher education institutions. He keeps on saying that. Of course, he does not substantiate it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have a process, a legislative requirement, that the Higher Education Council report regularly to the Parliament on the profiles process. One of the things that it has to keep watch on, if you like, is the system-wide features, such as whether there is an erosion of institutional autonomy or academic freedom. The Higher Education Council, which is an independent body, has consistently reported in recent times that the profiles process is working well. That view, of course, is mirrored by the main body representing the higher education sector at the management and administrative level-that is, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee (AVCC).</PARA>
<PARA> When the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill was debated in this House last Thursday, the honourable member for Goldstein, once again, came out with this stuff. Once again, he just repeated it without any substantiation. I quoted from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee's pre-election policy statement which made it explicit that it favours the profiles procedures as they have been refined and that it much prefers them to that which went before.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Goldstein came up with a quotation from one particular individual who, he claimed, could be said to be representative of the view of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. I am pleased to advise the honourable member for Goldstein and other honourable members of the House that we are now in a position to get some definitive information as to what the position of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee is on the profiles process. I quote from the submission of the AVCC to the Australian Education Council joint Federal-State working party on Higher Education, in which it comments specifically on the profiles process. This document, which has become available in the last couple of days, in part says:</PARA>
<PARA>In general, higher education institutions are satisfied with the present educational profiles and data collection arrangements. They are certainly preferred to the old CTEC triennial visits. The AVCC and institutions still believe that too much detail is required and discussions are taking place to try to simplify this. But institutions have accepted the present arrangements extremely well and would not wish them to change and cause further disruption in the short term.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope the honourable member for Goldstein is paying attention. The submission goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Overall, however, the AVCC believes that the profiles and present data collection arrangements provide an excellent accountability mechanism and enable the government to be reassured about both educational quality and the efficient and effective operation of institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the honourable member for Goldstein that, in the debate the other day, he argued that the AVCC thinks that they are a very poor accountability mechanism. If we look at the actual terms of his amendment, we will see that he is questioning their usefulness and effectiveness as an accountability mechanism. I have another couple of bits and pieces, although I will not go on at great length.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will. On the question of data collection, there was a problem, particularly in the early days, about the nature and format of data requirements to be provided by institutions, and I quote again from the AVCC submission:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There have been representations to the Federal Minister about the demands which the DEET and NBEET place on institutions and the Minister has taken action to reduce these.</PARA>
<PARA>We have reached agreement on the most important part of that, which is the basic student data. In conclusion, I refer to one final quote just to make the point:</PARA>
<PARA>Experience has shown that universities develop their own identities, characters and strengths. It is not for governments to try and develop the characteristics and strengths of institutions. These will evolve within the institutions according to the educational profile which they choose to negotiate with the Commonwealth government taking into account priorities determined at the national level.</PARA>
<PARA>The absolute final point is that in this submission the AVCC called for direct Commonwealth funding of institutions, bypassing the States. So this `terrible' process that we inflict on the institutions is so terrible that they apparently want us to bypass the States and be directly involved in funding institutions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Land Transport. Can he advise the House whether the Government proposes to proceed with an Australian design rule (ADR) requiring from 1 March 1992 all new motorcycles to be wired so that when the engine is set running the low beam headlamp and running lights will turn on? If so, what are the road safety benefits of this proposal?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1758" SPEAKER="Brown The Hon R.J." NAMEID="5A5" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CHARLTON" MINISTERIAL="LAND TRANSPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is that the Government will be requiring, through the Australian design rule arrangement, that all new motorcycles sold from 1 March 1992 be hard wired in order to provide for the low beam headlight or special daytime running lights to come on when the ignition is turned on. That requirement is firm and the Government will not retreat from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should emphasise that the best available evidence to us indicates that a provision of that kind will bring about a 3 per cent reduction in the number of crashes and injuries and fatalities involving motorcyclists. That means that that provision alone will save anything up to 10 lives a year and will cause to be reduced the number of serious injuries by something up to 100. I do not think that I need to emphasise that among motorcyclists there tends to be a very high incidence of crashes, injuries and deaths because of the special vulnerability of motorcyclists. Many other road users indicate from time to time that they simply did not see the motorcyclist. For every 10 million kilometres which are travelled by motorcyclists, six young men-or women, as I am reminded by interjection-in Australia die. Of course, there is a much higher incidence of male deaths and the figures relate to the deaths of young males between the ages of 17 and 20 years. The prospect of a motorcyclist being involved in a crash or an injury is 15 times higher than for any other road user of comparable age. The likelihood of a motorcyclist dying as a result of crashes is 20 times higher than for other comparable road users, particularly car drivers.</PARA>
<PARA> I think there is a growing awareness on the part of the whole community that, having made very significant inroads into the road trauma since 1970 as a result of compulsory seat belts and random breath tests, we now have to start targeting other points of concern as well. Lights on for motorcyclists is one of the most important points. I should emphasise as well that motorcyclists endorse our proposal, because almost seven out of 10 motorcyclists at the present time voluntarily turn their lights on. I think it is also unfortunate-I am going to make mention of this because it reflects very unfavourably on the honourable member for Wannon-that he has failed to adopt what we have always adopted in this Parliament in connection with road trauma, road crashes, road injuries and road deaths-that is, a bipartisan approach.</PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Leader of the Opposition to pull the honourable member for Wannon into line. The honourable member for Wannon is making a clown of himself. On Monday, 8 April, motorcyclists will gather at the airport to ride in here. Apparently they will be inviting honourable members to ride pillion with them. The honourable member for Wannon has suggested that he will get a 250cc motorcycle and, like a clown, join them. The honourable member knows that I am serious about this. The best thing for him to do is to support the ADR proposal that we have introduced-that is, that daytime running lights become a standard requirement. It has been indicated-and I quote his words from a statement that he issued--</PARA>

<PARA> Opposition members-Oh!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know it will be no news to the Opposition, but I do not race out checking its questions after Question Time. This is a question without notice about private savings. I said that private savings had risen in the last recent while. That is true. It may be that they have declined since the early 1980s, but have risen more lately. The fact is that that is all the more reason why there should be a commensurate reduction in the call by the public sector on savings. That is why this Government has reduced the call by the public sector on savings to 7 per cent of gross domestic product, which of course far outstrips any likely shift in private savings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When these questions are put, they should be put in terms of the weighting as that applies to savings in general. The great shift in savings which has been undertaken in Australia has been undertaken by this Government in relation to the public sector. It has also reduced the rate of tax on savings generally, because the rate of tax on savings when the Opposition left office was 60 per cent at the margin. It is now 47 per cent at the margin. In terms of company savings in the corporate sector, the Opposition taxed $1 of company income as to 78c upon a distribution. That is now 39c and 47c with a personal distribution but, because there is no such thing as undistributed profits taxed now, it is 39c. So in practical terms, the weight of tax on distributed income has fallen from 78c in the dollar to 39c. So companies, for the first time, may save because one cannot argue--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition cannot argue that 22c in the dollar represented savings for companies compared with 61c in the dollar, which is a position under this Government. Firstly, the Liberals left the rate of tax on savings at 60 per cent for those with the greatest propensity to save-high income earners. Secondly, in terms of company and corporate savings, they left 22c out of the dollar of distributed income. In practical terms that is now 61c after companies pay at the 39 per cent rate. In comparing this Government's record on savings with what the Opposition did about incentive to save, one sees that the Opposition did nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then there is occupational superannuation. As I have said in the House before, we will have upwards of $1,000 billion in superannuation funds-that is, a thousand, thousand million dollars-by the turn of the century. When I came to office, that was $17 billion-a $17 billion to $1,000 billion shift in the level of savings in a structural way which has now been noted approvingly by our Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and International Monetary Fund assessors. They could never have noted approvingly when the Opposition was in office because that level of savings did not exist.</PARA>
<PARA> On public savings the Opposition did nothing-yes it did; it ran the deficit out to 5 per cent of gross national product. That was its contribution to public savings-it drew them down. In terms of tax on savings, it did nothing other than sock people 60c at the margin and companies 78c. In terms of structural savings, it had nothing but a superannuation scheme which was a boutique proposition for the wealthy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member well knows, I was recently in his electorate looking at some of the great vineyards of the Hunter Valley. The point of the question is that wine is becoming one of Australia's major manufactured exports. This is against the background of the world market being grossly oversupplied. For the latest year that we have figures for, world wine production was some 32.3 billion litres while world consumption was some 24.4 billion litres. It is against that background that we are competing on the market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian wines have won acceptance overseas despite very keen competition from other countries, and our exports are continuing to grow, even with the high exchange rate. Exports have risen from 11 million litres four years ago to 37 million litres last year. If the pattern of exports for the first half of 1991 is sustained through the rest of this year, we will export about 56 million litres of wine-that is a fivefold increase in five years. These exports could be worth an estimated $180m.</PARA>
<PARA> Our largest export market by volume and value is the United Kingdom. Other important markets are Sweden, New Zealand, Canada, the United States of America and Japan. The gross world oversupply of cheap, poor quality wine will remain perhaps for decades, but Australia still has the potential to expand its exports provided it maintains its commitment to exporting high quality, value for money varietal wines. This will make wine one of Australia's major exports.</PARA>
<PARA> This growth has arisen because we can offer consistent quality wine. I was recently privileged to confirm what the honourable member for Canning and the honourable member for Cowan have been telling me about Western Australian wines. I visited the Margaret River area this weekend and found that Western Australia, like many other parts of Australia, is in the business of producing superb wines, and we are exporting them well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; by leave-Mr Speaker, early this year I determined that I should deliver a major statement about what we must do together to meet the economic challenges facing this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today I want to speak with my fellow Australians, not in the jargon of economists but in terms that we can all understand. I do this because, while I will be announcing decisions of fundamental economic importance for the future of this country, the securing of that future is in the hands of each one of us. </PARA>
<PARA> Government has the responsibility to lead the community by getting the right policy framework-and we will do that. But it is only with the understanding, the commitment, of all Australians-as individuals, and through their representative organisations-that our nation will best meet the challenges ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> What are those challenges? The first is for us all to realise that this tough, increasingly competitive world of five and a half billion people does not owe, and will not give, seventeen million Australians an easy prosperity. The days of our being able to hitch a free ride in a world clamouring, and prepared to pay high prices, for our rural and mineral products, are behind us. From this fact flows everything else. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge for the foreseeable future, is to produce more than we spend. The rest of the world will not allow us to continue indefinitely to live beyond our means by borrowing from them. </PARA>
<PARA> Our rural and mineral products will remain important into the future. But the challenge is to add to them. That is, we must export more manufactured goods and services and substitute more quality Australian production for imports. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge is therefore to make the decisions and adopt the practices and attitudes which will enable this and succeeding generations to achieve those basic goals. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the challenges. How we are prepared together to meet them will determine the standards we can enjoy and the kind of Australia we will pass on to our children. </PARA>
<PARA> I will today announce a package of substantial new measures directed to the fundamental task facing this nation: improving the productive capacity of an economy that will be more internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> Highlights of the package are: tariff cuts, reduced wholesale sales taxes for business, substantial business savings through simpler depreciation, retraining assistance, new support for apprentices and further initiatives in education and research to build the `clever country'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) will today be making more detailed statements covering the announcements in their portfolio areas. </PARA>
<PARA> All these measures continue and intensify the far-reaching reforms my Government has initiated over the past eight years. Ultimately, they sharpen our ability to reduce the current account deficit and stabilise foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that they share one overriding objective: building a more competitive Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In this statement I will reaffirm for the Australian people the longer-term economic goals to which we aspire, and identify the progress we are making towards them. </PARA>
<PARA> And I want all my fellow Australians to understand where the nation is moving and to understand how all of us-workers, employers and government-have complementary roles to play in achieving our common goals. I say it again: in the final analysis the challenges ahead demand the involvement of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, the Australian economy is currently at or near the bottom of a downturn that has been sharper, deeper and more prolonged than we anticipated.</PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the recession has hurt many people and cost many jobs, and that is something I regret deeply. </PARA>
<PARA> Higher unemployment is likely in coming months. Rural Australia in particular is experiencing a very tough period. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some important global factors at work. But I do not walk away from my Government's ultimate responsibility to manage the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA> And we certainly do not resile from having taken the necessary decision to squeeze demand by high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Policy makers and commentators, in Australia and around the world, underestimated the strength of resurgent demand in the wake of the 1987 share market crash. </PARA>
<PARA> But with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that had we acted sooner to dampen that surge, some of the current hardship could have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> The question facing us now is not: will we emerge from the recession?</PARA>
<PARA> For the decisions necessary to end the recession have already been taken: official interest rates have been brought down by 6 percentage points over the last fourteen months; and tax cuts paid on 1 January will also stimulate demand. </PARA>
<PARA> Business will begin to rebuild stocks, and international confidence will be helped by the successful end of the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> There are testing months immediately ahead. But the best estimate is that we will be coming out of the recession in the second half of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> So the real question, and the real challenge, facing us is: how can we ensure that when we emerge from the recession we will be best equipped to take up the opportunities for sustained growth?</PARA>
<PARA> In particular we have the opportunity to secure economic recovery:</PARA>
<PARA> - with low inflation</PARA>
<PARA> - and hence lower interest rates</PARA>
<PARA> - in an increasingly competitive and productive economy. </PARA>
<PARA>And this Government is determined to seize that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what this Statement is really about today. It is not about short term palliatives, but longer term structural change to make us a more competitive nation. </PARA>
<PARA> That was what my Government set out, eight years ago, to achieve-through fundamental reform of long established economic institutions and of deeply entrenched attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA> We still have a long way to go but today we can certainly say that, together, we have made substantial progress: we are more open to the world and we are more efficient at home. </PARA>
<PARA> We are becoming more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA>1. Tariffs and Australia's trading future</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, the most powerful spur to greater competitiveness is further tariff reduction. </PARA>
<PARA>Tariffs have been one of the abiding features of the Australian economy since Federation Tariffs protected Australian industry by making foreign goods more expensive here; and the supposed virtues of this protection became deeply embedded in the psyche of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> But what in fact was the result?</PARA>
<PARA> - inefficient industries that could not compete overseas; and</PARA>
<PARA> - higher prices for consumers and higher costs for our efficient primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA> Worse still, tariffs are a regressive burden-that is, the poorest Australians are hurt more than the richest. The Industry Commission estimates that the burden tariffs imposed on lowest income Australians is three times heavier than that imposed on those with the highest incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Right from the start, this Government deliberately and determinedly set about pulling down the tariff walls. By 1992 our existing programs will have slashed the nominal rate of assistance to the manufacturing sector by over one-third, from 13 to 8 per cent, and the effective rate from 22 to 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The results, the benefits, have been dramatic. Since 1985, manufacturing output, employment and exports have all expanded at rates faster than the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Australian consumer and business, prices for many goods are lower than they would otherwise have been. </PARA>
<PARA> Tariff cuts presented Australian manufacturers with a major challenge. To their credit, many of them are meeting that challenge. Their endeavours are too rarely appreciated and their success too often underestimated. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, this Government will continue to open up the manufacturing sector and Australian industry generally through lower protection. I now announce:</PARA>
<PARA> - the general level of assistance will be reduced from 10 per cent and 15 per cent in 1992 to a general rate of 5 per cent by 1996;</PARA>
<PARA> - tariffs on passenger motor vehicles will be phased down from 35 per cent in 1992 in annual steps of 2.5 per cent to 15 per cent in the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> This change can be expected to result in an average real reduction of $2,000 to $3,000 in the price of a $20,000 car, in today's dollars, over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> I also announce:</PARA>
<PARA> - tariff reductions on textile, clothing and footwear will be accelerated so that the maximum tariff will be 25 per cent by the year 2000 and the termination of quotas will be brought forward two years to 1 March 1993; and</PARA>
<PARA> - general agricultural assistance will be reduced in line with the pace of tariff reform in manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> The dimension of what we have achieved is demonstrated by the fact that these changes will bring the average nominal rate of assistance down to 3 per cent, and the average effective rate down to 5 per cent, by the end of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA> All these changes will help keep inflation, and therefore interest rates, down. </PARA>
<PARA> They will also make our exporters and our import competing sector more competitive by lowering the cost of their inputs. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall impact of the reforms will be a net gain in employment, although jobs will be lost in declining industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout my public life it has been my firm conviction that if the community believes that change is necessary in the interests of the community as a whole, then that belief carries with it a necessary corollary-that the community must not leave those individuals or groups who are adversely affected to bear the whole burden of change. It must itself be prepared to share that burden of change, as well as reaping the benefits of change. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, we will establish labour adjustment programs to assist displaced workers in our car and textiles, clothing and footwear industries with relocation, training, and wages subsidies for redeployment to other jobs. This will cost at least $90m over the life of the programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, with these tariff cuts, we demonstrate once again our commitment to liberalising international trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been fortified in this approach by a number of recent reports, not least Dr Ross Garnaut's report Australia and the North-east Asian Ascendancy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have rejected the views of the so-called `new protectionists' because they are simply proposing, in effect, the same discredited policies that had isolated our national economy from the rest of the world and caused the great damage we are all working to repair. </PARA>
<PARA> However much our competitors might bend or break the principles of fair trade, our own self-interest is served by a steadfast refusal to return to the days of protectionism. </PARA>
<PARA> But I do not for a minute seek to excuse those nations who do flout the rules of international trade, especially those who have caused so much damage to our farm trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem lies in the inadequacy of the rules on agriculture under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. GATT has been an outstanding success in substantially reducing manufacturing protection around the world. As a result, world trade in manufactures has boomed. </PARA>
<PARA> But at the same time, agricultural trade has been absolutely corrupted-particularly by the European Community and to a lesser extent by the United States and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, their combined farm subsidies have averaged more than $300 billion a year, not aggregated over a period of time, but they have averaged $300 billion a year. This is for a sector which produces only about 3 per cent of their GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> This has imposed a heavy burden on our farmers: despite consistent large productivity gains, they exported the same volume of goods in 1989-90 as they did 10 years earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> While world trade thrived, agriculture, one of our most important, competitive and significant sectors, has marked time. </PARA>
<PARA> So what further steps can we take to improve our trading position?</PARA>
<PARA> First, we will maintain our vigorous international campaign to achieve equal treatment for agriculture under the GATT umbrella. The Europeans already accept, due in no small way to the efforts of the Cairns Group, led by Australia, that there can be no result in the Uruguay Round negotiations without substantial reform of agricultural trade. We will keep pushing them as hard as we possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA> Members on both sides of this Parliament have recently visited Washington, and will travel to Europe in coming months, to urge both sides to avoid the chaos and insanity of a trade war. </PARA>
<PARA> This international campaign by Australia depends for its credibility and impact on one thing: on our general willingness to practise at home what we preach abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) will announce a rural adjustment package in April to ensure that those farmers most in need during the current rural crisis receive appropriate assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, we will help our farmers and manufacturers take effective action against foreign producers who seek to dump their products on the Australian market at unfair prices. We will strengthen anti-dumping procedures, including by cutting 40 days off the time taken to process complaints. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourth, the preferential tariff arrangements for Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea will be phased out from 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA> Fifth, we will provide $2m to continue the Australian-made campaign, since reducing our reliance on imports is totally complementary, in economic terms, to expanding our performance in exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixth, we will upgrade the services available to Australian exporters. In particular:</PARA>
<PARA> - We will boost the capital base and range of services provided by the Export Finance Insurance Corporation by making available a $200m callable capital base to supplement EFIC's existing reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> - A new $50m facility will be made available by EFIC, to enable Australian exporters to meet demands for performance bonds without using their own reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> - We will create a new program of fellowships so that Australian business men and women, and recent graduates, can get direct working experience in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> - We will implement the McKinsey report recommendations including refocusing Austrade's efforts on the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> - We will transfer responsibility for Austrade to the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development from 1 September.</PARA>
<PARA>Greater Efficiency and Competition within Australia</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, with further tariff cuts, we are dismantling the barriers to competitiveness and efficiency that stand at the borders of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is also set on dismantling the barriers that exist within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We have pioneered the concept, and the delivery, of micro-economic reform-seen by industry, rightly, as an essential means towards higher productivity and efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> We are freeing up our transport systems; we have revolutionised our taxation system; we are creating more efficient workplaces; we are injecting competition where for too long Australian firms and public sector enterprises have been content with the quiet life. </PARA>
<PARA> And we are reforming the processes of Government itself through the Special Premiers Conferences. </PARA>
<PARA> In all this, perhaps no issue has achieved the prominence of the waterfront-essential to our export performance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly satisfying to be able to report to the House on the achievement, just last week, of a new agreement that will deliver breakthroughs in waterfront productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement between the Waterside Workers Federation and Conaust Ltd, following an earlier agreement with National Terminals (Australia) Ltd, now means waterfront employees and the two largest waterfront employers are committed to a total restructuring of their industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In describing the significance of this latest agreement, Mr Speaker, I can do no better than to quote the words of Mr Richard Setchell, the Chairman of Conaust, who said it was `a win for the economy and the international competitiveness of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA> By year's end, the national waterfront labour force will have been cut by over 1,500-in anyone's language, a major gain in efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> In all, the agreements provide for productivity gains of up to 60 per cent; in smaller ports and in grain handling, 70 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> What appeared an ambitious program when we commenced these reforms, is now proceeding on schedule, and without major industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> In shipping, we are ahead of schedule in delivering smaller, more efficient crews on existing vessels and the introduction of new ships crewed at manning levels equal to or better than those of our major trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA> In telecommunications, in aviation, in road and rail transport, in removing through national uniform regulations the requirement for business to meet six or seven different standards, we are achieving fundamental gains in efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, this activity amounts to the most ambitious plan, the most rapid pace, and the most comprehensive sweep of micro-economic reform this country has ever seen. Productivity is increasing, and new investment is taking place-all without industrial disruption. </PARA>
<PARA> And here we are witness to a paradox. Those who for more than a generation in office entrenched the inadequacies of the past and themselves effected no change whatsoever, now with an hypocrisy that is truly breathtaking, clamour for even faster change. </PARA>
<PARA> They bear an onus, which they simply cannot discharge, of showing how in a practical way this could be achieved without poisoning the better industrial relations and investment environment we have created-without, in short, bringing the whole reform process to a grinding halt. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of our results versus their rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> We will press ahead with further reform, to increase competition and efficiency within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> For the consumer, competition means lower prices and a broader range of better quality goods and services; for producers it provides the spur to better performance-at home and abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to see the whole domestic economy opened up to this kind of positive structural change. </PARA>
<PARA> And we have established a sub-committee of Cabinet's Structural Adjustment Committee to examine systematically the whole economy for opportunities to promote this process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Trade Practices Act is our principal legislative weapon to ensure consumers get the best deal from competition. </PARA>
<PARA> But there are many areas of the Australian economy today that are immune from that Act: some Commonwealth enterprises, State public sector businesses, and significant areas of the private sector, including the professions. </PARA>
<PARA> This patchwork coverage reflects historical and constitutional factors, not economic efficiencies; it is another important instance of the way we operate as six economies, rather than one. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefits for the consumer of expanding the scope of the Trade Practices Act could be immense: potentially lower professional fees, cheaper road and rail fares, cheaper electricity. </PARA>
<PARA> This has to be done-and I have initiated the process, by today writing to the Premiers urging a positive examination of all we can do, at the May Special Premiers Conference, to widen the ambit of the Trade Practices Act to bring such excluded areas within the scope of a national framework of competition policy and law. </PARA>
<PARA>Investment for the 1990s</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, to secure sustainable economic growth and the living standards to which we aspire, we need to ensure that there is a fertile environment for investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Our efforts to repair the macroeconomic fundamentals underpinned rapid investment growth in the late 1980s-through the Accord, through floating the dollar, and through cutting Government spending. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, however, one other fundamental which is crucial to investment: inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vital that Australians understand the debilitating nature of the inflation disease. </PARA>
<PARA> High inflation has brought high interest rates and a higher cost of capital than in our trading partners. This, in turn, undermined investment and made it harder for Australian firms to compete overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also discouraged productive investment in areas that would generate jobs and exports in favour of speculation in real estate. </PARA>
<PARA> But today we have the opportunity, as I have said, of putting Australia on a low inflation path. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's inflation is now below the OECD average: ours is 6.9 per cent and just 5.4 per cent in underlying terms and theirs is 7.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> A continued lowering of inflation is, without doubt, the major contribution this Government can make to the climate for investment in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course new investment, combined with lower tariffs, has meant, and will mean for a time, higher imports and a higher current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> This becomes even more obvious at times when commodity prices are falling, as they are now due to the slowdown in world economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> But this is a short term cost we must bear if we are to wind back the current account deficit in a sustainable way and thereby reduce our foreign indebtedness permanently. We are taking the essential steps to build an economy that is stronger in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> And there are other important areas where we can take action to foster productive investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is very concerned at the difficulty which small and medium-sized Australian companies face in raising long term funds. </PARA>
<PARA> We are pursuing discussions with major financial institutions aimed at overcoming this difficulty by ensuring a readier flow of such funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of new industry and the rejuvenation of the old depends on ready access to appropriately skilled labour-access which is increasingly difficult in our sprawling cities, with their often inefficient transport systems. These factors also reduce the quality of life for the residents affected. We are cooperating with State and local government to develop effective approaches to these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, this Government has done more than any other to reform the taxation system so that, as far as possible, tax considerations do not distort investment decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I announce:</PARA>
<PARA> - a substantial widening of exemptions from sales tax for business inputs used by manufacturers, primary producers and miners. The cost to revenue of this measure will amount in 1992-93 to $375m. But the cost benefits to producers, allowing for the effects of mark-ups as goods pass along the production chain, will in that year total around $700m.</PARA>
<PARA> - we have radically overhauled depreciation provisions to bring them more in line with business realities. The reforms to be announced provide, for the first time, a definition in the Act of effective life and, importantly, it will allow self-assessment by the taxpayer. This will result in savings to business of the order of $100m in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> - expenditure on environmental impact statements will be fully tax deductible over 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> An industry which will benefit from these new tax provisions is tourism, which has generated over 100,000 new jobs during the 1980s and has the potential for very substantial further expansion. </PARA>
<PARA> One sector of the Australian economy is unique in terms of the investment environment in which it operates-the forest industries. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's consistent commitment is to the proper protection of our precious native forests. This has been, and remains, fundamental to our approach to Government. </PARA>
<PARA> But we recognise that-in part due to this commitment-there has been a contraction of the forest resource allocated to existing operations in the industry. Concern about future access to the resource has made new investment uncertain. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Government has decided to provide resource security for major new wood processing projects</PARA>
<PARA> - where the project involves a capital-intensive, value-adding investment of $100m or more and is directed to export or to import replacement;</PARA>
<PARA> - where the proponent of the project makes a commitment to adhere to environment, heritage and Aboriginal policy requirements; and</PARA>
<PARA> - where the State Government agrees to enact parallel resource security legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Resource security will involve undertakings, backed by legislation, guaranteeing an agreed volume of timber supply from an identified catchment area. There will also be provision in the legislation to establish plantations to provide for long term timber supply. The objective is to phase out woodchip exports by the year 2000 or soon after, and replace them with value-added products. This new emphasis on plantations will also, over time, take pressure off our native forests. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, the Government decided on resource security legislation only after receiving unqualified legal advice that it was the sole way the Commonwealth could provide a binding undertaking of the kind necessary to get major projects started which will provide new exports and new jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Government has a duty to listen to and understand all legitimate community interests. It has a responsibility then to seek as far as possible to balance those interests where they compete. It should, where appropriate, establish processes aimed to achieve that purpose. In the end, Government must do what it was elected to do and make the necessary decisions. This will mean facing up to tough issues and it will rarely entail universal approbation. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is in this case where I believe my Government has struck the correct balance between environmental concerns-to which our commitment remains vital and unambiguous-and the interests of one of Australia's largest industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn next to the question of the Clever Country. I said at the outset that securing the future of the country is in the hands of each one of us. To achieve change, we must mobilise our most valuable resource: the talents of the Australian people. This does not necessarily mean working harder; in Germany and Japan, both highly successful competitive countries, working hours are actually falling. </PARA>
<PARA> But it does mean working smarter-working more effectively, using new materials, new production technologies and new management methods. It means being, like Germany and Japan, a clever country. </PARA>
<PARA> During the last election campaign I said Australia needed to become a clever country. The centrepiece of my commitment to that goal was the creation of a network of Cooperative Research Centres. I said that these Centres would draw together outstanding research groups to provide new drive to our national research effort. Today I announce that the Government has selected the first fifteen Cooperative Research Centres. These Centres will focus their research effort on projects in the following key areas: resource based industries; manufacturing and information industries; the environment; and medical research. My colleague the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) will provide details of successful projects this week. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to continue indefinitely the tax deduction for spending on research and development at 125 per cent. Cooperation with our talented neighbours in the region is important if we are to remain at the frontiers of technology. The Multifunction Polis provides an opportunity to do this. Next month the Government will receive the report of the MFP-Adelaide Management Group which was set up to assess the economic and social viability of the MFP. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to understand that cleverness is not confined to our universities and `hi-tech' firms. Cleverness is something that should permeate the entire society-and especially our workplaces. And the foundation of a clever country is its education system. I have repeatedly, as you know, stated my pride in our achievements in virtually doubling the school retention rate, and expanding the number of tertiary places. Quite simply, unless we give our young people the motivation and the opportunity to bring out the best in themselves through education, we shall never be able to bring out the best in ourselves as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I announce an increase in the number and average value of Australian Postgraduate Research Awards; extra funding of $15 million over three years for the Country Areas Program to focus on greater rural school retention; and $10 million over three years in a community project to identify the key elements of good schooling. </PARA>
<PARA> Ours is a dynamic region, in a world of ceaseless technological innovation and burgeoning knowledge-based industries. In a clever country, all of us, as workers and managers, need to upgrade our job skills regularly. A recession can savagely damage the job skills of a nation. Apprentices have been hit particularly hard in the past-young Australians seeking to acquire and improve their job skills have been laid off with their training incomplete. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, I announce a new program of assistance so that employers can retain and improve the skills of apprentices and other workers who would otherwise be working reduced hours or have been retrenched. We will also spend $74m over two years to provide work experience opportunities for people unemployed for more than six months; and we will commit $50m over the next fifteen months to provide additional pre-vocational training places, and we will seek State cooperation in this. We will provide $6m three years to strengthen management skills. </PARA>
<PARA> Education is clearly a vital preparation for the work force in a clever country, but it is in the workplace itself that the skills must be developed if they are to yield the productivity dividend we so desperately need in our enterprises. Our trade union movement has made an enormous contribution to the creation of a more efficient Australia. Union amalgamations involving workers in metals, the public service, health, textiles, timber products and telecommunications have already been concluded. There are some 50 other amalgamations currently under way. The Government will commit a further $1.5m to assist this process in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> I also pay tribute to those employers who, in partnership with the trade unions, have secured major gains through award restructuring and workplace reform. </PARA>
<PARA> My Government has provided financial assistance to this process and we will virtually double our financial support over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia has proposed a major research project on international performance benchmarks of business input services. </PARA>
<PARA> We have directed the Bureau of Industry Economics, with the cooperation of the BCA, to undertake this project at a cost of $1.8 million over four years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Pappas Carter Report commissioned by the Australian Manufacturing Council, and recent publications by EPAC, have placed particular emphasis on the importance of changing the workplace culture. In cooperation with the AMC, we will develop a program to raise the efficiency of Australian enterprises to world standards. We will draw on the experience of our own world class companies together with the best practice that can be found anywhere in the world in this endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly pleased to announce that John Prescott, managing director of BHP and chairman of the AMC, has agreed to chair the board that will oversee the new program. </PARA>
<PARA> We have earmarked $25 million over two years for the program. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, the measures I have announced today are absolutely vital for the continued transformation of the Australian economy. At the same time, they compromise neither our demonstrated commitment to fiscal restraint nor our medium term objective to maintain the structural integrity of the Budget. Their total costs in outlays and forgone revenue are $33 million in 1990-91, $446 million in 1991-92 and $854 million in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, this Government has never been in doubt about the kind of Australia we wish to build-a modern, growing, prosperous and competitive economy, within a tolerant and fair society; a nation where quality of life counts for as much as quantity of output; an outward-looking community, enmeshed with the dynamism of the Asia Pacific region, and capable of taking on the best the world has to offer-and winning. </PARA>
<PARA> These are not short-term goals; they are not transitory values. </PARA>
<PARA> They are deeply embedded in the character of this Government and of the Party I have the honour of leading. </PARA>
<PARA> This process of modernisation, of adaptation to the changing world economy, is not something that has some future cut-off point. It must be a continuing process. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no point at which we can say, reform is finished-because there is no point at which the world will stop changing. </PARA>
<PARA> And this is the essential point, Mr Deputy Speaker. We live in a world of unprecedented, indeed breathtaking, change. Our own region is a crucible for change. </PARA>
<PARA> We can no longer afford the easy simplicities, the costly complacencies of the fifties and sixties and seventies. </PARA>
<PARA> I say ``costly'' because we are now paying the price for the neglect of those decades. </PARA>
<PARA> Our task now is to make sure that future generations are not called upon to pay a similar price for any neglect or complacency on our part, in this make-or-break decade. </PARA>
<PARA> We need the habit of adaptation-because the lesson of international competitiveness must be constantly learned and re-learned. </PARA>
<PARA> If we get the basics right in these critical years we need not set limits on our prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not avoid the fact that I hold these prospects out to you at a time of recession. But we should understand that Australia comes to this task with two great advantages-enduring advantages that transcend the temporary, but real, difficulties of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA> First, we bring to the task our great natural and acquired endowments as a nation-our vast material resources, our vibrant multicultural community, our strengths as a free and prosperous people, our proximity to the fastest growing regional economy in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, in meeting these tremendous challenges that lie ahead, we are not, in 1991, starting out from scratch. We are not, in this decade, coming to the task cold. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already taken many of the essential decisions, we have already learned many of the vital lessons, we are already enmeshing ourselves with our region, we have already mastered many of the skills that we will need, to enter the next century with well-founded confidence that we will reach our goals. </PARA>
<PARA> But we must face the fact unflinchingly that we need, as a nation, to equip ourselves further, to meet the challenges of exposure to international competition. </PARA>
<PARA> That has been central to the endeavour of this Government. It is central to the theme of this statement. It is the central purpose of the measures that I have announced today. It must remain the central challenge of this great nation for decades to come. </PARA>
<PARA> I restate my belief with which I began: the involvement, the commitment of all Australians is the vital ingredient to success in the challenge ahead. It is a challenge that, together, we can face and meet with confidence. I present the following paper:</PARA>
<PARA> Building a Competitive Australia-Ministerial Statement-12 March 1991. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The package of measures announced today ends forever Australia's sorry association with the tariff as a device for Australia's industrial development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In presiding over such a major transition, the Government, through its Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, has ushered in a new philosophy for Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> By turning its back on tariffs, Australia will be further propelled in its quest for international trade and efficiency, a search begun with the opening up of the economy in 1983 when we floated the dollar and abolished exchange controls. </PARA>
<PARA> As in all nations before it, the pursuit of trade and competition has instilled in Australia a thirst for greater efficiency at home and a larger dominion abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's statement will further serve those ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA> Within a couple of years, remaining non-tariff barriers will have been completely removed. </PARA>
<PARA> By the end of the decade, tariffs on motor vehicles and on textiles, clothing and footwear will have been wound back to such an extent that effective rates of protection will be less than a third of their present levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Across the rest of manufacturing, tariffs will have fallen to a mere 5 per cent by 1996. </PARA>
<PARA> Within this decade, Australia will have renounced once and for all the fallacious doctrine that prosperity can be found behind the insular wall of protection. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry's problems are only the most recent example of how we deceive ourselves if we think we can ignore the imperatives of the international marketplace even in a commodity where we are dominant. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's statement completes the program announced in the economic statement of May 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> It puts an end to the high tariff culture which did so much to diminish Australia's potential in the postwar period. </PARA>
<PARA> But the decisions announced today do more than complete the transition to an open economy. </PARA>
<PARA> They will also make our domestic economy more responsive and supple, giving us a greater capacity to compete with imports and produce goods and services at lower levels of cost. </PARA>
<PARA> But our frontline goods and services can only be competitive if the productive sectors which support them are required to be similarly competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures announced today by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Senator Button are designed to improve that prospect, strengthening forever the productive base of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of that process I also announce today significant taxation reform measures which will further reduce tax burdens on Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1983 the Government has undertaken path-breaking reforms of the Australian tax system, increasing its fairness and economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The reforms direct Australia's scarce investment funds to the most economically promising activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Reform of the tax system has attacked tax shelters and discouraged speculation, while enhancing the attractiveness of genuine business projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The closing of loopholes has funded reductions in tax rates and the establishment of a full dividend imputation system. </PARA>
<PARA> These have removed the bias against corporate equity investment and created a world-class financial system for Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA> The reformed tax system is an essential foundation for the restructuring and growth of the Australian economy in the 1990s and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's statement builds on our major reforms with further measures designed to simplify the tax system and improve economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures will reduce the tax burden on genuine business activities, particularly those engaged in competition on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Each measure flows from the basic tax reform direction consistently pursued by the Government and will enhance our competitiveness as a trading nation. </PARA>
<PARA>Wholesale Sales Tax</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The wholesale sales tax is an important element in Australia's indirect tax system, and has been substantially reformed over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> I announced in the 1990 Budget that it would be comprehensively reviewed in order to simplify its operation and to consider further avenues for removing tax on business inputs. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the continuing need for enhanced competitiveness, the Government has given priority to measures to reduce tax on business inputs, as these can operate to disadvantage Australian producers of goods relative to their international competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> In last year's Budget, I announced a significant widening of the tax relief provided for computer hardware used in manufacturing related processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has now decided to introduce a major reform to the wholesale sales tax system with a package of changes designed substantially to reduce the tax on business inputs. </PARA>
<PARA> A wider definition of production has been adopted so that a wider range of goods used by goods producers can be exempted from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Activities for which goods will be exempt include:</PARA>
<PARA> - pre-production activities such as research, development, engineering and technical design;</PARA>
<PARA> - production-related activities such as ordering raw materials, controlling or costing production processes, monitoring emissions, cleaning premises, lighting and so on;</PARA>
<PARA> - post-production activities, including storage, handling and dispatch in relation to the goods-producing premises, and rehabilitation of mine sites; and</PARA>
<PARA> - staff training in relation to such activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Exemption will also be extended to goods used in the transportation of products by rail, pipeline or conveyor. </PARA>
<PARA> Restrictions on the range of goods which are exempt under the existing exemption provisions will be eased. </PARA>
<PARA> When mainly used in eligible activities, lubricants, office furniture and equipment will also be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> Hand tools used in agriculture or fishing will be similarly exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> To reduce the costs of handling goods at sea ports and international airports, exemption will be introduced for freight storage and handling facilities at such ports. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, the exemption provisions will be extended to subcontractors so that they do not suffer a disadvantage compared with in-house production-related activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The comprehensive new provisions to give effect to these exemptions will be drafted in a plain English style and introduced in the Budget sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> They will take effect on the date on which legislation receives royal assent.</PARA>
<PARA> The new exemptions will reduce tax revenues by $200m in 1991-92 and $375m in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> Because input taxes are subject to mark-ups as goods pass through the production chain, this measure will have an even greater impact on production costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The cascade effect of this taxation relief at the input taxing point will induce a cost benefit estimated at up to $700m in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA>Depreciation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Flowing from its tax simplification agenda, the Government is also introducing major reforms to the processes determining depreciation claims by taxpayers for plant and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> These reforms will have many positive benefits as they provide taxpayers with more discretion, greater certainty and enhanced simplicity in dealing with the now complex and often cumbersome task of applying these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence the reforms:</PARA>
<PARA> - legislate to clarify the meaning of effective life;</PARA>
<PARA> - permit taxpayers to self-assess the rate of depreciation of plant and equipment;</PARA>
<PARA> - reduce the number of rate classes for depreciation from 18 to seven broad-banded rate classes;</PARA>
<PARA> - allow taxpayers to pool items within a rate class for further administrative simplicity; and</PARA>
<PARA> - permit items below $300 or with a life of less than three years to become deductable immediately, to reduce the large accounting task associated with small items. </PARA>
<PARA> The methodology of depreciation is already substantially concessionary. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance a five year life asset which would be written off at a scheduled 20 per cent a year on a straight line basis can under present arrangements be written of as to 36 per cent in year one under the declining balance system. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that most of the value of the asset is depreciated within the first two years of its life. </PARA>
<PARA> The 20 per cent loading previously introduced by the Government facilitates such an outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not believe that assets should be written off faster at an even higher budgetary cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather, what is needed is a less arbitrary approach and enhanced simplicity in the application of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment to the law to provide greater clarity to the meaning of effective life will give taxpayers a much enhanced capacity to select appropriate write-off periods suited to their circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The law will specifically refer to factors to be considered in determining effective life, including predictable obsolescence, circumstances of use and the restriction of plant life to the life of a project in which it is used. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxpayers will continue to be able to appeal a decision by the Commissioner on the effective life of an asset, in the first instance with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and, if required, the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA> However, such appeals will now be argued with the assistance of the new definitional criteria and the process of appeal will commence earlier than under present arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> These new processes should see depreciation claims equilibrate quickly with the actual effective lives of assets. </PARA>
<PARA> Permitting taxpayers to self-assess the rate of depreciation for allowable plant and equipment gives them the freedom to use rates which they believe are more in keeping with the circumstances of the use of the asset. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation will, however, continue to provide guidance on rates of depreciation through private and public rulings. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxpayers exercising the option to self-assess depreciation rates will be required to annotate their taxation return to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner will be able to consider the taxpayer's claim. </PARA>
<PARA> This reform will mean that for items of plant and equipment, both large and small, taxpayers will be able not only to truncate any process of review or ruling by the Taxation Office but may have the more immediate advantage of improved after tax incomes from a more appropriate deduction in the years in question. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that implementation issues are addressed adequately, the detail of the self-assessment system for depreciation will be determined after full consultation between the Taxation Office and interested bodies prior to implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> The reduction in the number of rate classes from 18 to seven will also greatly simplify the accounting task for much of Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA> Broad-banding will make depreciation claims for the myriad of depreciable items at many and varied rates dramatically more simple. </PARA>
<PARA> Pooling of assets within a rate class will amplify the simplicity. </PARA>
<PARA> The new depreciation arrangements, other than broadbanding and pooling, will take effect for items acquired and first used, or installed ready for use, for income producing purposes on or after 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Broad-banding and pooling will be available from the 1991-92 income year in respect of all items, including those acquired before 1 July 1991, while used for income producing purposes, unless the items remain eligible for special depreciation rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures are expected to reduce tax revenues by $100m in 1992-93, but to have a declining cost in later years. </PARA>
<PARA> These reforms will not only materially and beneficially affect the after tax position of a business; they will also provide flexibility and relief from the onerous and costly task of preparing depreciation claims. </PARA>
<PARA>Environmental Impact Studies</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I also announced in the 1990 Budget a review of the tax treatment of expenditures relating to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> That review is continuing, but the Government has decided to announce an initial outcome today, which of course was referred to earlier by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> For expenditures incurred after today on environmental impact studies, tax deductions will be allowed over a period of the lesser of 10 years or the life of the associated project. </PARA>
<PARA> The deduction will remove a bias in the tax system against projects requiring such studies and against appropriate environmental assessment processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of this measure will be low initially, but steadily build up to an estimated $45m per year after 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Tax Measures</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Some other tax measures form part of the initiatives announced today by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The deduction for eligible research and development expenditures is to be extended indefinitely, with the rate of deduction of 125 per cent to continue after 1995, as indicated earlier by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> This extension will maintain strong fiscal assistance to this activity and enable companies to develop their research and development plans on a long term basis. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the arrangements announced for the motor vehicle industry, the wholesale sales tax on luxury vehicles is to be reduced to 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This is expected to reduce tax revenues by about $15m in the current financial year and $45m in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>Fiscal Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Let me now discuss the fiscal impact of the measures announced today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's approach to budget strategy has been, and remains, keyed to the medium term requirements of policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This has involved, first, the need to achieve a Budget surplus, contributing to national savings and easing pressures on the current account. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time personal income tax relief negotiated under the accord has brought further progress in enhancing our international competitiveness, and in successfully tackling inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, budget formulation has involved sustained efforts to improve the effectiveness of outlays programs, the efficiency and equity of the tax system and the productivity of government enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures announced today are fully consistent with the medium term objectives of fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In aggregate, the measures will add only $123m to outlays in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax and tariff reforms will cost the revenue an estimated $324m in 1991-92, although this will increase in the medium term reflecting the full-year cost of the new exemptions under the wholesale sales tax and the phased reductions in tariff duties. </PARA>
<PARA> These costs to revenue, however, are in the higher service of significantly improving the efficiency of resource allocation in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Those improvements will serve to strengthen the nation's income growth, with beneficial medium term fiscal effects. </PARA>
<PARA> The package announced today deals with our underlying structural problems without losing sight of current cyclical difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> The present slowdown in economic activity will contribute to a substantial reduction in the surplus this year compared with a record $8 billion outcome for 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> This budgetary response, involving slower revenue growth and increased outlays on unemployment benefits, will serve to cushion the effects of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA> With similar intent, measures announced to enhance labour market and training programs, at a cost of $45m in 1991-92, will protect the skills base of the labour force from the effects of the recession and develop that base further. </PARA>
<PARA> In the medium term our objective will be to maintain the structural integrity of the Budget so that, as the level of activity recovers, the Budget will further contribute significantly to national savings. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to meet this requirement the Government will, as usual, carefully scrutinise its spending programs in formulating the Budget of 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> The discretionary outlays measures in this Statement are modest but the Government intends to ameliorate those impacts with measures in the forthcoming Budget round. </PARA>
<PARA> Such an approach will ensure that the public sector comes out of the present slowdown in much better shape than after any previous postwar recession. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Sustained consistency in rational structural reform has been a hallmark of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we have yet again demonstrated our commitment to that standard, this time in circumstances of economic adversity. </PARA>
<PARA> With these measures we complete our transition to an open economy. </PARA>
<PARA> By promoting a more competitive cost structure we also underpin our transition to a lower inflation path in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> The process of structural change in this country has been long and arduous, but we have made great strides. </PARA>
<PARA> Our export sector is now a much larger part of our economy than when we came to office. </PARA>
<PARA> This package will continue that process and will ensure that as the economy comes out of recession we will have in place the proper ingredients for a firmly based expansion of our economy throughout the 1990s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a definite matter of public importance, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The economic depression throughout much of rural and regional Australia which has been exacerbated by the uncertainty caused by the Federal Government's approach to primary industries, particularly the wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I will be followed on this side by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). It is my intention to highlight the vast gulf, the vast chasm, that exists between the common portrayal of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) as the farmers' friend and the reality of unrealised commitments and crushing letdowns which have left Australia's rural communities exposed, helpless and hopeless; squeezed out by declining prices and, of particular significance in terms of this Government's responsibilities, exploding costs and charges. The honourable member for Bendigo will turn his attention to the impact of these policy failures on the lives of rural Australians-forgotten rural Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The unbelievable uncertainty that has beset Australia's farm sector in recent years has extended right through from unpredictable domestic economic management designed to meet unpredictable and, I would suggest, moving economic objectives and targets through to the disgraceful and humiliating-not to mention massively damaging-180 degree turns that were made in relation to the wool industry reserve price scheme by the Minister, and through to the amazing contortions of the Minister's public position on matters of importance to the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the only certainty confronting the bush, it seems to me, is-to butcher Murphy's law-that if anything can possibly be done to further undermine stability in the rural sector it will be. I never cease to be amazed by the Minister's capacity to find a convenient smokescreen, and the current wheat debate is as good an example as ever. We read in Saturday's Australian that Minister Kerin was to push for a base price on wheat. The headline reads, `Kerin to push for base price on wheat'. The article introduces itself in this way:</PARA>
<PARA>A proposal included in a submission to go to Cabinet on Monday from the Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Kerin, will place extreme pressure on the Government to grant wheat growers a $417 million subsidy for next year's crop.</PARA>
<PARA>Without it, growers believe many farmers could move out of wheat production, leaving Australia unable to fulfil forward sales contracts already signed. </PARA>
<PARA>No doubt that left many wheat growers with a warm, fuzzy feeling, being nicely comforted-`The Minister is going in to bat for us, he will put our case so forcefully that the Government will have to respond'. But interestingly enough, yesterday's Australian Financial Review carried a quite different story. It said in fact that the Minister's submission could not be expected to back the key request from the Grains Council of Australia for a guaranteed base minimum price. </PARA>
<PARA> So I pose the question on behalf of Australia's farmers: who has got the story right? Is there a gap between what the Minister wants us to believe that he believes and what he actually believes is good for farmers? What does he propose is in the best interests of farmers on this, and what has he proposed in the past on a range of other issues? Farmers find themselves constantly being subjected to warm, comforting reassurances from the Minister. Yet the delivery appears to me never to be there. If the Minister cannot carry Cabinet, I would suggest that he might do well to respond to those farmers who suggest that he should resign. If, on the other hand, he is getting what he wants from Cabinet, then he ought to resign anyway because it does not square with what he is telling farmers he is pursuing on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen plenty of evidence of this particular problem over the years. There was a magnificent blunder over the wine tax, an issue which came up earlier today. In 1983 we were promised no sales tax or excise on wine, but in the 1983 Budget the Government introduced an excise tax. In June 1984 it scrapped the tax, but then it replaced it with a sales tax in the 1984-85 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there was the blunder over the 15 per cent tariff on imported grain harvesters which was introduced in August 1983. It was unfair and it was discriminatory. It was replaced in the end, from January 1986, with a subsidy on local production, by which time the tariff had cost the grains industry nearly $30m, and there was precious little agricultural manufacturing capacity left anyway. There is even less now. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently we have had the wool fiasco. After all the market wrenching speculation over the floor, and then its dropping from 870c to 700c, the Minister paraded the world stage promising that the new level was `immutable', `cast iron', and would not be moved again until it was moved upwards. Having pegged our international credibility to that one-and remembering that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) stood with his wonderful, as he told us he was that day, Minister for agriculture on that issue-we then found ourselves in the humiliating and shameful position of finding that the pin had been pulled. I pose the question: what is Australia's word now worth to our international trading partners?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister recently made the statement in this place that a lot of farmers have benefited from high interest rates. This followed his claim in February 1990 that high interest rates did not hurt rural people as much as city people. This had shades, of course, of Gough Whitlam's comments to the effect, `You have never had it so good'. No doubt the Minister was referring to those few remaining farmers who, not weighed down with debt, found that they had a few dollars to invest and that interest rates on short term deposits were quite attractive. Apart from being quite laughable to the vast majority of Australia's farmers-particularly wheat farmers who now, I am told, labour under an average debt of $225,000-this statement is revealing not so much for what it does say but for what it does not say. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, it is obvious, I would have thought, that most farmers have been and are being massively hurt by high interest rates. They have been paying about double what their American counterparts and triple what their Japanese counterparts have been paying for their borrowed money. This has been a huge dampener on productive capability in this country, particularly in the rural sector. We even had the Prime Minister acknowledging that this afternoon. It has also been a great distorter of investment patterns. It has discouraged investment in productive farming exercises. Remember that Australia's farmers have a record for outstanding productivity improvements, matched by no other sector, I would suggest, of the Australian economy. That is now being put at risk by the policies of this Government. Not only is there a restriction of investment in productive exercises, but there has been a massive encouragement of short term speculation of a non-productive nature. </PARA>
<PARA> Most importantly, the Minister-who, we are constantly assured, is not economically illiterate-must realise that those interest rates are the teller of this Government's hopeless incapacity to grapple effectively with the structural problems undermining our economy. Despite the Minister's reply of a simple yes-no ifs or buts, just yes-to the question that was put to him by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) in February as to whether he wholeheartedly endorsed the current economic strategy of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the Minister must know that those economic policies have seen farmers all but crushed as the graph of declining prices crosses over the graph of exploding costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important thing that this Government could and should have done for farmers was to tackle farm costs, or farm inflation. That would have delivered a healthy economic environment in which farmers could not just have survived, but would have found themselves in a position where they could face the current prices collapse from a position of far greater strength. But the cumulative effect of high levels of inflation in the bush is massive. I would suggest, tragically, they are not properly appreciated. If they were, the pressure for action would have been irresistible. </PARA>
<PARA> I often ask farmers how much better off they believe they would have been if they had enjoyed West German or American levels of inflation over, say, the last 20 years. The answer is, of course, that they would have been infinitely better off. Farm sector inflation has been horrific. I refer briefly to some remarks I made in this place last Thursday:</PARA>
<PARA>I recall during the 1989-90 financial year being told by a farmer who has his operation computerised and is able to keep a very close track of costs that whilst the consumer price index increases for that year came out at something like 8 per cent, his farm costs rose in the order of 14 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I can relate to that sort of problem. As I said in this House on 7 March, I recall buying a four-wheel drive Toyota in the early 1980s. It cost me exactly $8,000 registered on the road with a tray top. We kept it for six years and replaced it at a cost of $24,000 registered on the road with a tray-the same type of vehicle. That translated, in terms of the commodities that we produce, from a value of around 20 steers or 70 tonnes of wheat in the early 1980s to a figure of something like 50 steers or 240 tonnes of wheat six years later. I would not be brave enough to do the calculations on today's prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer-and no doubt the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who wholeheartedly supports his policies, as we have established-would have us believe that the Government is effectively tackling inflation and points as evidence to the lower outcomes that we are currently experiencing. He conveniently claims that this is a result of the Government's monetary policies since those policies have inconveniently failed to rein in our trade imbalance problems. But that is the shifting nature of political life in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that the horse has bolted because inflation over the 1980s has done its damage. The Minister must be aware that these inflationary trends have been a major component in the horrific interest rate equation that he so interestingly claims has benefited, in his words, a lot of farmers. That inflation has been the result of Labor's incapacity to address the problem of too much money chasing too few goods. In particular, the accord has failed abysmally to address the problem of our very poor productivity in this country and the need to relate wage levels more realistically to both productivity and the capacity of industry to pay. The industrial relations club has insulated and protected those under this mantle at the expense of those not so covered: the unemployed, the small businessman and, above all, the farmer, who cannot pass on increased costs-which are the effect of inflation-to his customers, particularly his customers abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is that wheat growers, like wool growers and so many other farm groups at the moment, find themselves exposed and vulnerable when the chill winds of an economic downturn of the massive proportions we are now facing confront them. Worse, given that the Government has failed to give them the capacity to operate effectively and lay down fat during the easier years, if there have been any of them during the 1980s, they now find that the Government has no intention of honouring its previous commitments. In a second reading speech in the House of Representatives on the Wheat Marketing Act in 1989, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am aware that the averaging arrangements in the previous GMP scheme provided support to growers in circumstances of extreme market downturn such as in 1986-87. If such a crisis were to occur again the Government would need to give close consideration to special support arrangements for the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did he keep that promise?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did not keep that promise. What did wheat growers get? Precious little, as pointed out to me by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). Despite the assurances by the Government that no one industry would unfairly bear the cost of sanctions imposed against Iraq, there is still no clear evidence, I would suggest, of the Government's intentions in this department. We had a question related to this today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have before me two press releases issued by the Minister's office yesterday. They are identical, apart from one particular paragraph. The first of them says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government decided not to further contribute to the wheat industry for losses due to the Iraq sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA>The second press release says:</PARA>
<PARA>The question of compensation for losses resulting from Australia's compliance with UN trade sanctions against Iraq will be considered at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA>There is further confusion. Where are we going? What are we to believe? Where is the consistency? The $100m offered for accelerated pay-outs at previous pools, a figure not even mentioned in the first statement, is woefully inadequate when set against the total of outstanding funds of $350m. The need to offer sufficient security to growers to encourage them to plant a crop this year was, on the best indications, probably not even put before Cabinet. I note with great interest that even Dr Lawrence, the Premier of Western Australia, is angry that the Government has not looked at the option, according to today's Age. </PARA>
<PARA> The risk that Australia will not produce enough grain this year to meet traditional markets has now become a virtual certainty. The Government's refusal to grapple with this issue is, I suggest, irresponsible in the extreme. It is also grossly unjust when we realise that not only has the Government been prepared to go on propping up all the other inefficient areas of the economy but also those inefficiencies have of themselves caused so much damage to the farm sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government goes on backing losers. We have seen some progress today: credit where credit is due. But the fact remains that we have seen a consistent willingness to back losers such as the motor vehicle industries, the clothing and textiles industry, Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd-even the tens of millions of taxpayers' dollars allocated to redundant wharfies. But we expose ourselves to the possibility of irreparable damage to a proven farm sector. It is high time that the real nature of the Government was exposed on this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing I can tell the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) is that he should not believe all newspapers or pick from them selectively. Sometimes some journalists listen only to one source. I admit it is very confusing, but I would not take notice of any one particular journalist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second thing I can tell the honourable member for Gwydir is that what occurs in Cabinet is not to be made public. But I can assure him that the Cabinet did examine very thoroughly the Grains Council of Australia's submission on the guaranteed minimum price of $151, that this was part of my submission in terms of the annexure and that the Cabinet gave that full consideration-as well as a lot of other information I put before it as a result of my visit at the weekend to Western Australia, where I got some very good information that supplemented that provided by the Grains Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The third thing I can tell the honourable member for Gwydir is that situations change and that it is necessary at times to hold a position while preparing to move to a new policy prescription. This affects all governments and all Ministers. The example the honourable member for Gwydir gave of wool is a classic case of that. Like any other Minister in this position, I was in exactly the same position as a Treasurer who has to hold an exchange rate but at some time has to change because of the situation in the market, because of factors beyond his control; otherwise, the alternative or the continuance with the status quo is even worse. In this case, if the market had not deserted wool in January, we would not have had to change. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth thing I can tell the honourable member for Gwydir is that statements which are valid by themselves can always be taken out of context or portrayed politically as generalisations of the particular. Again, to pick up the point that he made, it is quite true that high interest rates do not necessarily disadvantage farmers with higher disposable incomes. One only has to ask accountants in country towns when they are faced with placing money onto short term money markets and into various securities, particularly for farmers who have a cash flow in terms of one very big cheque: for example, cotton farmers or wool farmers in the boom years. This is a situation that financial management requires. If interest rates are high and there is a positive cash flow, high equity-and about 86 per cent of our farmers have high equity-does advantage farmers. At the other end of the scale, farmers with low equity and massive borrowings, and with banks imposing additional interest rates, there is the complete reverse of the situation, and life is near impossible for those farmers. That is why 5 per cent to 9 per cent of farmers today are in really desperate trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth thing I can tell the honourable member for Gwydir is that industry policy is slow. We in this House all represent various interest groups in a very pluralistic society. Thank goodness there are still differences between the political parties! My political party, the Australian Labor Party, represents some people more avidly than do other political parties. This is the nature of things and I think it is very good. </PARA>
<PARA> In a very pluralistic society, the speed with which one can get change in any particular interest group is dictated by a range of factors. It is dictated by whether one has a majority in the Senate, whether one has to deal with the potty Democrats, whether one can get change-and get change in attitude. Dealing with the sugar industry is a bit like dealing with the waterfront. One can take the view that one should not touch the sugar industry but should get rapid change in the waterfront, and vice versa-it depends which political party one is in. In the sugar industry I removed some measures which had been put on in an emergency war time setting-World War I-and of course it was a bit quick to move them. </PARA>
<PARA> I have my own views on how speedily change can be effected with regard to the waterside workers. What we have achieved and what was in the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today represent an enormous achievement, particularly given the situation in which the Opposition parties, with all the time they have had in government-particularly from 1975 to 1983 when there was far more economic awareness than we ever had in this country before-did nothing. There was a lot of benign protectionism from the previous Prime Minister and the party and the Ministers who served with him. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gwydir touched on many aspects of the general running of the economy and how this affects the farm sector. I do not particularly disagree with his identification of some of the economic variables that affect the farm sector and its capacity to make income, the whole question of costs and overseas markets. Of course, to bolster his case he concentrates on farm costs. I do not deny him that right. We can always get farm costs down further. He also conceded today that more action is being taken in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the interesting things in relation to farm costs just as a diversion-is seen when we start looking at wheat farmers' budgets. On the weekend I spent a lot of time with agricultural consultants looking at the sort of budgets they are facing if the on-farm return for wheat is about $70 a tonne, as it was last season. One of the very big costs for each tonne is about $21 for chemicals, such as Roundup and Hoegrass. We import most of our chemicals. It is true that Greenpeace tried to wipe out the only chemical producer we have, and nearly succeeded. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of what was achieved in 1988, and in going along with the National Farmers Federation at that time by removing protection, we are now getting world agricultural equipment-including tractors and that sort of thing-chemicals and fertilisers at world prices. The more we remove protection and eliminate those producers in Australia, and unless people can compete here with world prices, we are going to have less and less control over the main inputs to farm costs. There is a distillate rebate for the farm sector which is worth over $400m a year. The demand all the time is to take off tax on cars and petrol. That has administrative problems. We accept the problem with farm input costs. If we took taxation off petrol we would find that many farms in convenient areas would become petrol stations. We import tractors from overseas. I do not know how we are going to get the price of seed down any further. Harvesting is just a reflection of tractor costs and depreciation rates. As I said, most of them come from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> It really is the off-farm part of the cost structure for farmers that is the greatest cost. That is why we are trying to put so much attention into what is known as micro-economic reform, which once upon a time was called industry policy. For example, I have here a harvest payment advice to a producer which shows that for one shipment of grain from the farm with a gross return of $2,666 the deductions were $1,026. The largest proportion of that, $826, was for freight. This producer was a long way from Port Kembla. This is a New South Wales cost. It is that cost off farm that is crippling producers. They have been very right to argue for waterfront reform in the grain handling area, not that the amount of reform that was achievable there was really enormous. The bulk trades through our ports, with the exception of two or three ports, was basically under control. </PARA>
<PARA> The economy-wide problems that the honourable gentleman referred to are the ones that perplex any government. The implications for our economy of the Government's moving into financial deregulation and floating the Australian dollar are still best described as the Australian economy living through a rather steep learning curve. The macro-economic variables to get inflation lower, to get interest rates lower and to get the rate of exchange at a sensible level-are really the essence of management of a modern economy. Twice during the life of this Government we actually had inflation coming down quite well, and we lost it in 1985-86 with the massive terms of trade collapse and the very rapid turnaround. Again, we were bringing inflation under control, but then we had the stock market crash. As stated in the Prime Minister's statement today, all the world economies pumped up the economy too much and again we lost the chance to get inflation down. </PARA>
<PARA> Inflation is now coming down and the current recession will assist in that regard. That is why the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister have been stressing that as long as we hold our nerve, we will have a chance to get inflation and interest rates down for the first time in a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate of exchange is another thing that is affected more by overseas factors. I have taken the view for quite some time that our exchange rate is not determined enough by the current account deficit and the current account balance, or by the demand for foreign funds, but is determined too much by the asset value of Australia's stock markets and the economy as a whole. We have had this energy-rich phenomenon. We have had people moving out of the Japanese stock market. But the primary thing that affects that exchange rate is the value of the United States (US) dollar. At present our dollar is coming down because the US dollar is strengthening. It is beyond our capacity as an economy of 17 million people to control an exchange rate with the electronic transfer of money and the communications networks that we have today. Instead of speculating on currencies, we can engage in legitimate trading operations that have exactly the same effect. Our corporate citizens live through this period of floating exchange rates and financial deregulation, and we have seen the mistakes that they have made. Now again we see a chance for all those private people in the economy to understand just how exposed this economy is. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think any honourable members opposite are suggesting that we move away from internationalising the economy. Members opposite suggest that we are going to have to lessen internal competition. What this Government has done, above all others, is get through to the people of Australia that we do live in a hostile international world, that our primary, mineral and energy products are those that we can best trade in and that we need to do everything we can to bolster those industries, but we also have to set a social conscience and look after our own people. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures available to any government are fiscal, monetary, wages and industry policy. Our achievement has been enormous. Of course, people will say, `More!'. We have entered into a period of record fiscal surpluses, which are by far the best achieved since the 1950s when we started keeping records that we can compare. We have the lowest public sector borrowing requirement, to the extent that infrastructure funding is now being neglected in the views of some, certainly with respect to country roads, for example. </PARA>
<PARA> In a recessionary situation it is not the time to have further cuts to government spending. If the Opposition had its way, it would say that we should cut more money, or if it is really keen, it says we should cut more in some areas-it has a different set of priorities-and add to it in others. I suppose that is fair enough; that is the argy-bargy of politics. Having gone through all the Budgets that I have personally gone through line by line, I must say to the Opposition that the room to move and the flexibility is quite limited. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area of policies where governments have some control in this society, given that we have central wage fixing, is wages. The accord has given enormous net benefits to this society. One of the great differences between the major political parties in this House is that the Opposition parties would move away from central wage fixing, move away from principles around the accord and move to wage deregulation. That may advantage various individuals within the wage situation; it may advantage various firms; and it may give a lot of flexibility. But I would point out that there is a lot of flexibility under the accord at present and we do not run the risk of throwing the baby out with the bath water and having the exploitation of some people and a massive wages blow-out. That is something that we will argue about as we go into the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area is monetary policy. We have been keeping on a hard policy with respect to money supply and monetary policy itself because we have been trying to limit imports. Of course, that weapon has been shown to have clear deficiencies. We really do not know where one should put more weight. I have already said that we cannot put much more weight in the fiscal area. That really means that, whether we like it or not, we have to face the fact that our standard of living is going to have to come down. The big trick for government is to make sure that the weight of the standard of living coming down in this country does not fall on the backs of those people who can least afford it. That is why we are governing for all Australia and not just for sectional interests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support in the strongest possible terms the matter of public importance submitted to the House by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). In 1982-83, two major disasters occurred in this nation. The first disaster, over which we had no control, was one of the worst droughts in Australia's history. The second disaster was one which the Australian community did have some measure of control over, and that was the election of a Labor government-the Hawke-Keating Government-in 1983. Both of these events have devastated the Australian rural community in different ways and in different time spans. The 1982-83 drought and also the horrific Ash Wednesday fires created pain and anguish for the residents of rural Australia. However, country people are a hardy, resilient lot and they worked tirelessly and recovered from those circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Will they recover from the second disaster? The second disaster, the advent of the Hawke-Keating Government, with its rural policies and failed high interest rate policy, which it said we had to have, has ensured that rural Australia will continue to feel the pain and anguish every day with no sign of recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> Rural unemployment is at record levels. I give one example, and it is a pity that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is not here to hear it. According to the Weekly Times of 27 February 1991, unemployment in rural Victoria has reached record levels, with some 54,000 country people out of work-worse than the 1982-83 drought period. It is only the second time in history that the Australian Bureau of Statistics' records have broken the 50,000 barrier. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasing costs-both on- and off-farm-for labour, fuel, transport, shipping, et cetera, have hit the rural sector hard. High interest rates, inflation and both on-farm and off-farm costs are increasing. Country businesses are all operating in overdraft and businesses are going to the wall daily-coupled with commodity prices falling on international markets. It is interesting to note that high interest rates for farmers have meant that wives and children are increasingly trying to get work off the farm to provide a cash flow to service interest debts. The hours worked by farm people, and especially farm women, are considerably in excess of the national average and the return for effort in monetary terms is increasingly inadequate. Country families have a choice to make: they have to decide whether to stay on the farm and work or leave and try to get additional revenue to pay off the costs of that farm. </PARA>
<PARA> Rural families are deprived of equality of access to education. We all know of the Austudy problems that this Government imposed on rural people. Access to health-I refer to hospital closures, especially in country areas-is restricted for people in country areas. Rural families have also been deprived by the restriction on access to training and children's services, with the cost of getting young children in rural areas to receive those services and any social support that goes with them. </PARA>
<PARA> There is isolation in country Australia. With the increased cost of living, it is almost impossible for many families to maintain two cars. In the rural sector, with no public transport, this is especially difficult-I would say impossible. When this Government came to office in 1983 petrol was 39.9c per litre. At the moment in my electorate it is 69.9c per litre. Fuel costs are always greater in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many family breakdowns in rural parts of Australia. Rural women and families are having to cope with increasingly depressed husbands and suicides as a result of the devastating crash of family income. Just imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, your children coming to you and pleading for new shoes or new clothes so that they can go to school and look decent. People in the rural communities of Australia just do not have the money to provide those things at the moment. They have to refuse social outings for children as a result. They have suffered damage to their social status within communities because of the conditions they are facing as a result of the high interest rates imposed on them by the Hawke-Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The health problems of people in rural Australia are not able to be solved because of restricted access to hospital facilities, lack of doctors and lack of hospital facilities. If one approaches this Government about a small country hospital being closed down, all it can offer is the mickey mouse solution of a community health centre, which is just a block of empty offices with no-one there to staff it. That is the way things are going in rural Australia at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of communications I refer to the cost of subscriber trunk dialling telephone calls. Such calls which are made purely and simply to maintain family contact. The telephone service is cut off if one does not pay the bill. The mounting cost of long distance phone calls leaves many women and families even more remote and isolated in country Australia. I quote from a statement put out by my colleague the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), regarding the rural depression and where it is going:</PARA>
<PARA> The worst is yet to come for farming families, and the rural depression will last longer than previously predicted . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who was at the table a few moments ago, has even admitted that it will, and the statement put out by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today in fact confirms it. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Australian Agricultural Outlook Conference in Canberra, which finished today, said that . . . the depression would not end in the first half of this year as the Government had predicted but would last at least another 18 months . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is the situation that we are heading into and that country people find themselves locked into. It has been caused by this Government's failed economic strategies and a recession forced on the community by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), who through his own arrogance says, `It's the recession we had to have'. The Government's failed primary industry strategies have been overseen by the so-called farmers' friend. If the Minister was the farmers' friend, where was he when his friend and Cabinet colleague the Treasurer was forcing up interest rates? Where was he during the closure of many of Australia's domestic and export meatworks due to industrial disputes? Where was he during the Heinz dispute? Was he out there supporting the tomato growers? I did not see him. Where was he during the live sheep trade problems? Where was he during the SPC problems? Was he out there supporting the fruit growers and the fruit industry? There was no sign of him. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the Minister's support for waterfront reform, transport and shipping reform and labour market reform? Let us hear his voice loud and clear on that issue. He is virtually silent. Where was he when the wheat industry faced problems? He was saying to 45,000 growers that he would place extreme pressure on the Government to support the growers. That was quoted in the Weekend Australian of Saturday, 9 March. What did he produce? Very little: the extension of the guarantee on borrowings of about $100m and nothing upfront; maybe a boost in funding for the rural adjustment scheme carry-on finance, after a review later this year-maybe in April-and no compensation for losses arising from the trade sanctions against Iraq. That was to be considered later further down the track. </PARA>
<PARA> When the chips are down the farmers' friend cannot carry the day and is culpable. He is culpable, along with his Cabinet colleagues, for much of the plight that rural Australia finds itself in right now. The 1982-83 drought has passed. The 1983-91 disaster drags on. The Hawke-Keating Government, devoid of any new ideas, has this day released a grab bag of belated measures. It is far too little, far too late for many residents of rural Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is extremely easy, when times are hard and commodity prices in the rural sector have collapsed, for the Opposition to take 10-second grabs and harp on as it has today. But when one looks at what Opposition members have said and promised over the last six months, one realises that the only uncertainty which has been highlighted in the discussion of this matter of public importance is the uncertainty and division on the other side of this House. Everybody in this House-on both sides-is as concerned about farmers and their incomes as anybody else, and I say that as a third generation farmer. I acknowledge that over the last eight months I have been criticised because I will not talk down the rural sector. I have been criticised because I will not throw up my hands and surrender.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What price have we paid as a result of the hillbillies in the National Party of Australia running around talking down the rural sector? Lending rates to farmers are 6 per cent higher than those for anybody else because bankers have been convinced by the talking down of the rural sector that agricultural industries are not viable. But they are and commodity prices will come back. We recognise that they are down now and that things will be hard for the next two or three years-everybody knows that. But throwing up one's hands and surrendering and offering no alternative policies shows no leadership by the other side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite should go back to their constituencies and tell their farmers, who are paying interest at 20 per cent, that Opposition grandstanding has added another one or 2 per cent to their margins. At the present time, a person can get 14 or 15 per cent interest across the board-unless that person is a farmer. When I was on the Couchman television program I tried to get that through to the thickheads in the National Party, but it did not do any good. So, ultimately, the farmers are paying that price.</PARA>
<PARA> But what is even worse is that it is beyond the capacity of the majority of honourable members opposite-not all of them; the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), has an understanding and I will come to that in a minute-to understand that, by saying that things are ruined, they are devaluing our markets overseas and making it harder for us to sell our commodities. All they are doing is making it harder for us to get a price and sell things. I would rather be criticised in this House for refusing to talk down the agricultural sector in order to try to get a decent price, to try to take on the Americans and win some points in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round than throw up my hands and surrender like the mealymouthed people on the other side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I would like to concede that last week the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the President of the National Farmers Federation, John Allwright, and I, along with the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett), worked together in a very refreshing and bipartisan way to attack the problems that, ultimately, are downgrading the commodity prices of our primary producers. These problems arise as a result of the corrupted markets of the European Community and the export enhancement program (EEP) in the United States. It was sad that at the time we were talking to the American officials, here in Australia the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) said that our visit was a waste of time. People in the United States can read papers and word goes back. How do we feel when one of the so-called agricultural leaders in this country says that, when we are trying to convince the United States that we are united in this cause?</PARA>
<PARA> But, at the same time, we were successful in getting a commitment from Carla Hills, the trade representative of President George Bush, that careful attention would be paid to ensuring that the EEP would not impact on our markets and that the Administration would target the EEP. At the present time the other concern we have in regard to wheat-I am sure that the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) would acknowledge this-is that the level of capping has now been fulfilled and the Glickman Bill will be going before the Congress in the next few weeks. Many of the rural-based politicians in America are trying to get an increase of $475m to boost the EEP. We have argued strenuously against that and there is some support for our propositions-time will tell whether it comes off. But it was refreshing to see that bipartisan support in Washington for the future of Australia and Australian agriculture. As I have said, while it is easy for Opposition members to score a few cheap points and say that we do not care because we are in government, we have to have the guts to make the tough decisions. Ultimately, commodity prices will determine the future of Australia's farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> We recognise the seriousness of the situation in the wheat industry; so does the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). Hopefully, the downturn in wheat could prove to be relatively short-just as prices drop dramatically over a short period, they can also recover just as quickly. It is unlikely that all major producing countries will again experience such favourable growing conditions and high yields as they did in the northern hemisphere this year. Recently, of course, the prices have been firming with the end of the Gulf war. I will read from an article which appeared in the Wall Street Journal entitled `Wheat futures prices post third rise in a row in ``victory lap'' rally that boosts other grains'. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The U.S. Agriculture Department exhausted its allotment of export bonus credits last week, and authorisation for an additional $475 million-</PARA>
<PARA>that is for EEP-</PARA>
<PARA>of such credits is stalled in the House of Representatives. In the absence of bonus credit competition from U.S. suppliers, the European Community scaled back its awarding of food aid as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The result, analysts said, was a market acting without government stimulation and responding purely to supply and demand for the first time in months. The effect on prices has been bullish, with wheat futures leading a rally that has included nearly all grain futures contracts for three days in a row. </PARA>
<PARA>So we can be hopeful that the EEP will not be boosted and we can be hopeful that, ultimately, prices will firm across the board. It is important that we get the plantings-and I acknowledge any other speakers in this House who have said that-in order to reach the level of 13.7 million tonnes which we need to meet our markets. But talking down the sector will not give any encouragement to farmers to go out and plant. I do not need to be told what it is like to plant when the prices are down. We destroyed 1,000 tonnes of cane two years in a row and we did not cut a stick in the following year due to a drought. We had to destroy our crop for two years because there was no market. So I do not need a lecture about understanding farmers-not when I have lived through the experience of bringing home yearlings when we could not get a price in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue relates to a guaranteed minimum price bid. It has been the subject of some debate and there is a concern about our being consistent. We have just argued in the United States about the importance of the Uruguay Round. If we impose a subsidy on ourselves what will the pro-EEP people in the United States Congress say? They will say that the Australians are just as corrupt as they, or the Europeans, are and down our argument goes. Ultimately, our future hinges on a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA> Our future hinges on working with the United States by leading the Cairns Group and trying to break down the corrupt trade barriers that are having the greatest fundamental effect on agriculture in this country and will continue to have that effect in years to come. Quite simply, with a population of 17 million people we do not have the capacity to consume our products in this nation. Some 80 per cent of what we produce has to be sold overseas on corrupted world markets. Only 21 per cent of the products of the United States are sold overseas. It has a domestic market of 250 million people and 79 per cent of its farm products are consumed domestically. So it has the capacity to take on the Europeans. The Europeans have the capacity to do the same; we do not. It would be as ridiculous as standing in front of a Mack truck and waving one's hands and expecting it to stop if we were to try to take on those countries in a subsidy war. We have to argue with the courage that we have displayed in the Cairns Group and articulate the reasons why, for the long term interests of the free world, free trade is the only way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of that it is easy to score cheap points. It is easy to say that we are fighting for free trade and that no other country is doing it. But we have had success in manufacturing; we have got the breakthrough in the beef industry; and we will get it in the grain industry. But it will take a lot of hard work. It is unfortunate that I have only 10 minutes in which to discuss agriculture. I am happy to come back at another time-any time-and take on the Opposition on this basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gwydir talked about uncertainty in his matter of public importance and I have a great quote about uncertainty in the National Party. In an interview the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, Senator Boswell, had this to say about the wool scheme:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no split in our own Party. We supported the floor price at every occasion. In fact the coalition joint party rooms supported the floor price right up until, right up until yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that about six times during that whole interview. The only uncertainty that exists is within the National Party, where we have the Leader in the Senate disagreeing with the Leader in the House. And we talk about consistency. </PARA>

<PARA> The limit-of-cost estimate for the work is $12.71m as at August 1990 prices. The works referred to the Committee combine into a single project-the construction of additional facilities for the Joint Telecommunication School and support facilities to enable 7 Signals Regiment to provide the necessary support for the school. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Telecommunication School provides specialist signal training for the Australian Defence Force (ADF). It cannot train the required numbers in the facility it currently shares with 7 Signals Regiment. In 1985 the ADF examined specialist signal training common to two or more services with a view to conducting joint training by one service and to recommend the most appropriate location for a training school. As a result of this study, Cabarlah was selected and the joint training school was raised there on 1 September 1986. The Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force relocated their schools to Cabarlah, leading to a significant increase in the staff and student population. The 1985 study was reassessed in 1990 and Cabarlah was confirmed as the most suitable location for the school. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the existing facilities at Cabarlah were constructed in the 1960s when there were 212 personnel posted there. Some facilities remain from the 1940s. The current establishment is 420 service personnel, including 160 trainees, and 15 civilian staff. By 1995 there are expected to be 718 service personnel, including 230 trainees at any one time, and some 25 civilian staff.</PARA>
<PARA> The objective of the proposal is to provide sufficient working and living accommodation so that the school can train sufficient specialist personnel for the Defence Force by building permanent, purpose designed training facilities, upgrading working facilities for the supporting administration, medical-dental and technical maintenance functions, additional living accommodation for all ranks and rank and file dining and recreational facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was concerned about the quality of the water supplied to Cabarlah and took evidence from the Crows Nest Shire Council that it was examining the possibility of providing an adequate filtration system. We have recommended that the Department of Defence and Australian Construction Services continue their discussions with the shire council to provide better quality water to Borneo Barracks. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter of concern is that the land surrounding Borneo Barracks is zoned `Rural A' and most of the blocks in the one-kilometre buffer zone around the base are about four hectares in area. Rezoning to `Rural B' would allow two-hectare blocks and there could be consequential effects on the operation at the base. While Crows Nest Shire Council does not anticipate pressure for more intense subdivision before its current strategic plan expires in the year 2000, it is aware that there is some development in an area close to the buffer zone. Both the Council and the Department of Defence are aware of these potential problems from urban encroachment, and the Committee commends them for their sensible and cooperative attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee would like to thank the personnel at Borneo Barracks for all the work that went into its inspection and public hearing on 19 December 1990. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As both the local member for Cabarlah and the Deputy Chairman of the Public Works Committee, I support generally what the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has had to say. I also place on the public record one aspect of that hearing on 19 December last year which I think it is important that the Australian people understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen over recent months the protest movement around this country in relation to what we have been doing, very justifiably, in the Gulf. Indeed, the same situation happened in the Cabarlah area in the lead-up to that 19 December hearing. I quote from the Toowoomba Chronicle of Wednesday, 19 December a statement made by Mr Brendan Greenhill of the Queensland Anti-Bases Coalition in relation to this public work:</PARA>
<PARA>The spending of $13m at Cabarlah is excessive and ultimately of little or no benefit to the Darling Downs region and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the innocent words, `telecommunications training' are military doublespeak for training spies. A large part of the working life of these students will be spent on intercepting the private phone calls of ordinary Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA>He further went on:</PARA>
<PARA>We cannot understand the uncritical attitude of the Toowoomba City Council and the Crows Nest Shire Council. The 100 per cent increase in student numbers will only bring greater pressure on the community and attendant social problems such as-</PARA>
<PARA>and wait for it-</PARA>
<PARA>excessive drinking and sexual harassment. </PARA>
<PARA>I reject these statements, as indeed I did in the questioning at that public hearing, as they are what I would term sensationalist rubbish. In fact, 50 per cent of those who will be trained at the Joint Telecommunication School are likely to be women. What does Mr Greenhill suggest of the women in our Defence Force and of the Defence Force generally? As I said to him at that meeting, does the Defence Force comprise a bunch of drunks and sexual deviants? I hasten to add that I disagree with that very strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, by law the military cannot intercept, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, private telephone calls. I finish by saying that Lieutenant Colonel Bill Spencer, the commanding officer at 7 Signals Regiment at Cabarlah, has not received any complaints about sexual harassment. As well, in supporting what I had to say at that time, he said that Defence Force personnel were prohibited from collecting intelligence data against Australian nationals and that whatever work the Joint Telecommunication School students did they carried out in a battlefield environment and it took a long time-perhaps up to eight years of peacetime training-to prepare personnel for just that. </PARA>

<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government should be condemned for its economic mismanagement and fiscal irresponsibility, which has resulted in a severe and protracted recession and led to:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) a substantial decline in Commonwealth revenues for the year ending 30 June 1991;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) a major increase in Commonwealth expenditure for the year ending 30 June 1991;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) a reduction in the Budget forecast of an $8.1 billion surplus to a possible deficit for 1990-91;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) an increase in the public sector's call on national savings of up to 3% of Gross Domestic Product in 1990-91, compared with the Budget forecast of a zero requirement; and</PARA>
<PARA> (5) an expected deficit starting point for the 1991-92 Budget based on existing forward estimates''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Loan Bill 1991 will allow certain Commonwealth expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The explanatory memorandum to this Bill notes that:</PARA>
<PARA>This is a normal procedure for financing prospective deficits in the Consolidated Revenue Fund and has been used by successive governments over many years. </PARA>
<PARA>It is notable, however, that this is the first Loan Bill to be put before the Parliament since 1987. This is the first time since 1987 that there have been insufficient funds in the Consolidated Revenue Fund to meet ongoing government spending requirements. Loan Bills are also typically moved shortly after the appropriation Bills in anticipation of a government's deficit financing requirements. It is indicative of the extent to which the Government has been out of touch with what has been happening with our economy that this Bill should appear before us now, when it has been apparent for some time that the Budget projections would not be realised. Indeed, the Government was warned at the time of the Budget that its projections were based on unrealistic assumptions. </PARA>
<PARA> This year we have already seen Appropriation Bill (No. 3)-which is usually passed in May or June-being brought forward to February in order to finance the Australian contribution to the Gulf war. These Bills are evidence of the perilous position of the Government's fiscal policy-a situation that has been brought about by the selfsame Government's engineering of a recession in a misguided attempt to address the current account balance of payments deficits by attacking economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only a little over six months since the Budget was handed down and already a projected Budget surplus of $8.1 billion has been forecast to run down to balance and possibly even into deficit. The projected net public borrowing requirement of zero per cent of gross domestic product is heading into positive figures for the first time since 1987-88, so the public sector will again be drawing on national savings to the tune of up to $12 billion or 3 per cent of GDP-this, at a time of continuing increases in our net overseas indebtedness. </PARA>
<PARA> The loss of the surplus means a further increase in the level of our indebtedness, courtesy of the Government's loose fiscal policy. The Government has had the entirely worthy objective of using the surplus to retrench debt in addition to providing payments to the superannuation schemes of government business enterprises. Although the overseas component of the projected debt retrenchment is locked in place, the Government will be forced to issue new debt to the extent that the surplus is run down and the Government falls into deficit. Thus we are looking at a possible $7 billion of new debt being issued by the Government during the sorry life of the current Budget. This is the fiscal policy that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) only last year stated in his Budget Speech would be `the Government's principal weapon against the current account deficit and our overseas debt'-empty words. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now obvious that this weapon was never properly loaded and that it has now badly misfired in a way that is likely to exacerbate the recession. The Treasurer, who spoke to the State Premiers in June last year about the need for the public sector to keep its hands out of the cookie jar-as he so quaintly put it-has been forced himself to delve into that jar in order to finance his recession. The pride of the Government's economic policy, the much vaunted surplus, has been exposed as a weak reed unable to withstand the ravages of the Government's high interest rate policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has contended that there was to be a structural surplus of lasting significance to the Australian economy-a surplus that would deliver us from our current account problems and provide a sound basis for economic recovery. The Government has now dismissed the run-down in the surplus and the prospective emergence of a Budget deficit as being attributable to cyclical factors. Yet, for this to be true, the original Budget surpluses, of which we were meant to be so proud, must have also been cyclical in nature. In fact, we have seen a major running down of the structural surplus as well as the cyclical downturn due to the Government's deliberately engineered recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Bank's buy-out of the State Bank of Victoria, for example, is but one structural measure that has cost the surplus $400m. It is doubtful if it could be correctly described as a structural measure, but perhaps it could be if the structure it was intended to save was the State Labor Government of Victoria-because that is the only circumstance in which to describe that measure as a structural measure would make any sense at all. The Government's refusal to dispose of the Pipeline Authority in a proper commercial manner and the Opposition's subsequent blocking of that sale has cost its surplus $700m. We have seen another $400m go down the drain in the wage-tax deal with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only has there been a running down of the structural component of the surplus, but also the simple fact is that we never had a quality surplus to begin with, and it is therefore hardly surprising that it should be projected to disappear after only six months. The surplus was based on such dubious achievements as the Commonwealth-State debt fiddle; the $370m windfall in provisional tax payments; and cuts in payments to the States of $482m. The Government has shown itself to be unable to control the growth of Commonwealth outlays where there have been increases in all of its major portfolio spending areas, but particularly in the area of social security spending. </PARA>
<PARA> The overrun in outlays has already been estimated at between $1.6 billion and $2.6 billion. At the same time, the Government has been stung by a massive decline in tax receipts brought about by-as the Treasurer so quaintly described it-`the recession we had to have'. Pay as you earn tax receipts for 1990-91 are expected to fall to a level nearly $3 billion short of the Budget estimate. The Government's attempts to bring forward company tax receipts through the new payments system have had the entirely opposite effect of sending many firms broke with a consequential loss in company tax revenue. Appeals directed to the Treasurer and the Australian Taxation Office by many firms for relief from the early payment regime have fallen largely on deaf ears. Thus we are now expecting the first decline in company tax collections since 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> Revenue has also suffered from the insanity of the politically motivated luxury car tax-honourable members opposite will remember that. Thrust upon us by the Australian Labor Party's election campaign strategists, the tax was supposed to raise $105m in revenue in 1990-91. It now looks like losing the Government revenue, having first served to devastate a part of the new car market. This Treasurer is the only Treasurer I have ever known who can turn a sure thing into a loss. He is right there with the high flying entrepreneurs he so often loves to belatedly criticise these days, belatedly recognising the love affair he and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) once had with those gentlemen. Of course, the Government is now going to scrap the luxury car tax. But the damage has already been done in a hit-and-run attack on the industry that has left everybody concerned worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> Total sales tax receipts are expected to fall to $1 billion short of the Budget estimates. Overall, according to one private sector assessment, revenue is expected to fall short of the Budget estimates by around $4.4 billion. The progressive run-down of the surplus is indicative of the extent to which the Government is out of touch with the Australian economy. At the time the Budget was handed down, it was widely criticised, not only by the Opposition but also by private sector analysts for its overly optimistic assumptions. For a Government that was deliberately engineering what it then called `a slowdown', the Budget projections could only have been described as wildly optimistic. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only did the Government fail to lay down a Budget with realistic projections, but also it has repeatedly failed to acknowledge the progressive run-down in the surplus as well, despite increasing evidence that this was in fact taking place. As late as 31 January of this year, the Government was forecasting a surplus of about $4 billion. It was only a matter of weeks before the Treasurer conceded that the surplus was expected to be only $1.7 billion. Now we have the various private sector estimates of a Budget deficit.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government should continually resist revising downwards the surplus figure demonstrates both its lack of knowledge of economic conditions in this country and its unwillingness to do anything worth while to arrest the downturn by changing macro-economic policy settings. It is for these reasons that for some time now the coalition has been calling for a mini-Budget to make up for the non-Budget that we were served up last August, which at that time and since we have been expected to take seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government had heeded the Opposition's call for a mini-Budget based on realistic expectations and designed specifically to tackle its recession, we might not have been in the position in which we find ourselves today of staring down the barrel of Budget deficits with all their implications for monetary policy and for the longevity of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's industry policy statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was yet another missed opportunity for the Government to signal a change in the direction of macro-economic policy and specifically to tighten fiscal policy. Regrettably, there were no substantial measures in the statement, despite the coalition's oft repeated intention to support any such substantive change in policy direction if it were judged to be in the best interests of this country. Without a change in macro-economic policy direction, the industry policy measures we heard announced today have little prospect of making a substantial contribution to delivering us from recession. The loosening of fiscal policy under this Government can only serve to put further pressure on monetary policy to carry the burden of restraint that the Government cannot manage in its budgetary policy. This means a more protracted recession than might otherwise have been the case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hardly surprising that further falls in interest rates have been ruled out by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the past week and continue to be strongly resisted by the Reserve Bank. While we can only welcome the Treasurer's stated desire-to use another quaint phrase of his-to `snap the inflation stick', it would be preferable if this were achieved without snapping the whole economy in the process. The Government can only sacrifice so much employment and growth for the sake of tackling inflation and the current account deficit before the whole exercise becomes counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has promised us `a low inflation growth path'. I might get back to some of his forecasts about inflation. Of course, there are presently no indicators as to when we might again embark on a path of economic growth. But by all accounts, the relatively low inflation rate is a result of greatly depressed demand, rather than a favourable underlying rate of growth in prices. </PARA>
<PARA> We are a long way from changing inflationary expectations, which are one of the principal factors driving the inflation rate, particularly in the light of the Government's stop-go monetary policy that stems from a lack of Reserve Bank independence. Thus the so-called gain from the pain could well prove to be illusory. We may end up with no gain from the pain if inflation resumes once the economy turns around. That is why urgent attention needs to be paid to fiscal policy-to take the undue weight off monetary policy that has characterised this Government over the last few years. Unfortunately, it is fiscal policy, as indicated by the need for this Bill, that is receiving the least attention from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Inherent in everything I have had to say so far is the unreliability to be placed on the forecasts made over the years by the Treasurer and, in particular, those forecasts made in comparatively recent times. I take honourable members back to the Treasurer's 1988 Budget Speech, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We are well on the way back to prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA>It transpired that by April 1989 the Treasurer was out there defending the Government's economic policies, claiming them to be appropriate, after the national account figures for the December quarter of 1988 revealed soaring imports and a decline in exports. It was a short transition from being well on the way back to prosperity to defending the Government's economic policies on spurious grounds. The Treasurer was not deterred, because in August 1990 he was at it again. He said then:</PARA>
<PARA>These are definitely the golden years of change. Of course they are the golden years of change. </PARA>
<PARA>They were, of course; he was right. But they were a change for the worse. And that was not the message that he was intending to convey. In March 1990, 12 months ago, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We won't let there be a recession. </PARA>
<PARA>We all know what happened. As if to justify what happened-and what many seemed to know had happened long before the Treasurer and his Government knew-the Treasurer then said in November 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>It's a recession Australia had to have. </PARA>
<PARA>The words come back to haunt him, and we will remind him of them because if anyone in this country deserves to be reminded of the kind of nonsense that that exemplifies it is our Treasurer. The Treasurer finally got around to admitting that Australia was in the grip of a recession, rather belatedly and after the Prime Minister, I think, forced him into the situation. That was when the September figures for last year showed that the economy had suffered one of its biggest falls in 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we go to the Treasurer's forecasts on interest rates. I cannot go through the lot of them, because time simply does not permit. But in February 1989 the Treasurer was out there rejecting claims, including claims by a former economic adviser of his, that the Government would have to increase interest rates to tackle Australia's then worsening balance of payments problems. The Treasurer then claimed that monetary policy was tight enough. By May of the same year, 1989, the Treasurer was getting cold feet and he warned then that he would not hesitate to push interest rates higher if the Government failed to arrest the then horrendous $1.19 billion blow-out in the current account deficit for April 1989. He would be happy to have a $1.19 billion deficit these days, of course; but at that time it was pretty horrendous and what followed was even worse. </PARA>
<PARA> In July 1989, true to form, the Treasurer predicted that interest rates could fall within six months. The Treasurer took a little time to get around to amending that forecast. It took him 24 hours to retract the claim that he had made after bad trade figures once again left Australia's current account in the red, to the extent of $17 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a whole litany of forecasts on inflation which have proved to be abjectly wrong, and again we can only go to a grab bag to illustrate the point, but back in 1988 at the time of the Budget the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>Inflation remains Australia's number one economic disease. Its eradication is one of the Government's fundamental objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been a case of objectives revisited. Again the eradication of inflation has become one of his fundamental objectives. He has been through the whole gamut. He has been through economic growth; that was an objective. He was going to tackle the balance of payments and balance of trade deficits; that was an objective. He was going to reverse the trend to greater and enormous international indebtedness; that was an objective. But he failed miserably to make any impression in any of those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> We are back to the inflation stunt by the Treasurer at the moment. I have reminded the House of what the Treasurer said at the time of the 1988 Budget. The consequence of all of this was that in October 1988 inflation rose to 8 per cent, despite a better than expected September trade deficit of $1.78 billion. It is creeping up all the time. The Government encourages the market to anticipate the worst and then, when the deficit comes in at a lower figure-although still outrageously and unsustainably high-it can claim it is a little bit better and things are on the mend. Of course, that bad news, good news technique does not wash any more. The Treasurer has done it to death. He has made an art form of it. The Treasurer went on in this speech to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Success in these areas will secure for Australia an inflation rate of 3 to 4 per cent in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Nineteen ninety has been and gone and he did not get anywhere near the 4 per cent figure, and let it not be forgotten. Now he is promising some nonsense, some objective, and he expects us to take him seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1990 he said that our inflation rate was one percentage point below that of the OECD average. I heard the Prime Minister repeat something along the same lines in his statement earlier today. The latest OECD figures that I can get show that Australia's inflation performance, which was running at about 6 per cent at the end of the September quarter, was worse than that of the seven major OECD nations' average of 5 per cent over the same period. </PARA>
<PARA> Admittedly, the Prime Minister might have more recent figures than are available to me, but I would like to see them and I would like to know his source. So we have this nonsense. The Prime Minister obfuscates, when he gives the OECD example, by conveniently referring to the average of all the OECD countries. When we look at the seven major OECD countries, with an average inflation rate of 5 percentage points for the period which we are comparing, as against our 6 per cent, we see the extent of the deceit. </PARA>
<PARA> Our economy and the Government of this country have been suffering under the leadership-if that is the right word-of a Prime Minister driven by the polls to hang on and by a Treasurer with a naked ambition to grab power from the Prime Minister. Only last night, despite the on again, off again campaign of the Treasurer to assume the prime ministership, we heard another report which went along the lines that-and this is attributed to the Treasurer-if the Prime Minister does not give it away within two or three months, the Treasurer is not sticking around. I would like to see the Treasurer go and I would like to see him take the Prime Minister with him. That would be a start along the road to some economic, fiscal and social responsibility in government in Australia-assuming there was someone on that treasury bench who could effect the remedies. I doubt whether that person exists. Nevertheless, I think that a better bet, a better quinella, would be any two of the backbenchers than the one we have got now. Mr Deputy Speaker, I remind the House that I have moved a second reading amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague the Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean) advised this House in the second reading speech, the Loan Bill is a routine means of financing government outlays which exceed available funds in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The Bill is consistent with the practice adopted over many years of introducing an annual Loan Bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the Loan Fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the Parliament, but for which insufficient funds are available in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Loan Acts were required virtually on an annual basis between 1911 and 1987, but since 1987 there has been no requirement for a Loan Bill for the simple reason that there has been a sizeable Government surplus. I think that is a point that is worth dwelling on and certainly it is something which I will return to a little later in my contribution this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Loan Bill itself provides authority to borrow money and to charge certain expenditures to the Loan Fund. It also allows the minor expenses incurred in raising the loans to be charged to that Loan Fund. Generally speaking, Loan Bills have been required when outlays have exceeded the amounts raised through taxation and other revenues; that is, when there has been an overall Budget deficit. However, the surplus in Consolidated Revenue is usually $4 billion to $4.5 billion lower than the Budget surplus or, as has been the more usual case, deficit. This difference is essentially due to contributions to the National Debt Sinking Fund and to superannuation payments in respect of public trading enterprise employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst a Budget surplus in the order of $1.7 billion is now anticipated in 1991, according to revised figures-although I note that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) indicated that there is even a possibility, based on his knowledge, that the surplus may become a deficit this year-a deficit of some $2.5 billion, nevertheless, in the Consolidated Revenue Fund is still going to arise. Accordingly, therefore, the Bill provides authority for the Loan Fund to meet defence expenditures incurred after the passage of the Bill that would otherwise have been met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. It also authorises the supplement of the Consolidated Revenue Fund so that it can meet its other commitments. Finally, the Bill also provides the borrowing authority to cover these payments from the Loan Fund itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already appropriated by the Parliament, apart from loan raising expenses which, of course, will be quite small. In fact, the Bill in no way impinges upon the prerogative of the Parliament to appropriate public moneys, but simply provides a mechanism for financing expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> During the contribution this afternoon by the honourable member for Curtin, I noted that he ranged fairly widely and went to a number of specific issues relevant to the Government's monetary and fiscal policies. I also take this opportunity to provide some observations on those particular matters. I note that, as usual, the Opposition in this particular case has moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the legislation before the Parliament. It is not proposing to vote against the second reading; it is proposing to substitute some words which in some way are supposed to indicate, yet again, some failings on behalf of the Government in respect of its management of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that some of the points which are contained within that are worthy of further examination. The first point that needs to be addressed is this question about the surplus and why there is a potential, in the words of the honourable member for Curtin, for that to no longer be the case for the 1990-91 financial year-and if not a zero surplus, perhaps even a deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> The most obvious point to make is that, with an economy such as Australia's in a recession, it is most difficult for those projections, which were made using particular information available at the time when the Budget was framed, to be realised. There is no magic in that. The fact is that when governments of either persuasion sit down to work out what will be the outcome for the Australian economy, based on projections given to them and on the best available figures, certain of those projections are generally on the conservative side and we find a Budget framed accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have found-as has been admitted as late as this afternoon by the Prime Minister in his industry statement-is that the recession was probably deeper and, as it would turn out, possibly more sustained than the Government would otherwise have wanted. Certainly, as far as this Government is concerned, policy has been implemented to try to remedy this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important also to recognise that those projected cuts to the surplus and the reasons for them do not simply go to misprojections made at the time of the framing of the Budget. For example, when the Budget was framed, who was able to look into the future and foresee the difficulties for Australia's primary producers? Who was able to foresee the problem of the oversupply in the Australian wool industry? Who was able to foresee the difficulties of the oversupply in the Australian wheat industry? Who was able to foresee the difficulties and the effect on the Australian Government's revenue of the Gulf war? I would not suspect there would be too many who were. </PARA>
<PARA> I also do not suspect that there would be many in this House-indeed, if any-who could seriously suggest that it was the Government's fault that the wheat producers and the sheep farmers of this country overproduced; that they wanted to maintain stockpiles of those products; that they wanted to maintain certain floor prices in the case of wool; and that they are even now searching, as they traditionally do as agrarian socialists, for government hand-outs and continued support. I suggest to the people in this place and to those outside who take an interest in debates on the economy that they look at the reasons for difficulties encountered by governments in maintaining projections, whether it be on surpluses or deficits, in trying to determine how those end figures are arrived at. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to look at where the Budget surplus, which was expected to be $8.1 billion as estimated in the Budget Papers, has actually gone. I draw attention to a very good article in the Age of 23 February 1991. I quote some of the figures contained in that article under the subheading `Where Mr Keating's Budget surplus has gone':</PARA>
<PARA>Revenue losses</PARA>
<PARA> - $2800 million less from taxes and other receipts caused by declining job levels, lower incomes and reduced spending-</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, the fact that the economy is in recession has meant that there have been lower tax receipts; no-one resiles from that on this side of the House. The Treasurer has stood up in this place and said that that is what is happening. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> - $640m caused by higher-than-expected tax refunds, also reflecting lower incomes and financial losses. </PARA>
<PARA> - $430m as a result of tax cuts from last November's wage-tax trade-off. </PARA>
<PARA>Incidentally, that wage-tax trade-off was what the honourable member for Curtin referred to in his contribution. We all know what the Opposition's stance has been in terms of wages over many years. At the time of every national wage case hearing, it opposes any increase in wages to the employees of this country. It then comes along in debates such as this tonight and berates the fact that the Government, through its relationship with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and peak unions, is able to keep a lid on the wages policy of this nation, even in difficult circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable members in this place that the increase in wages that has been passed on now was based on the September consumer price index figure of 0.7 per cent. Had that not been the case, one wonders, in all this berating of Australia's inflation rate and the Government's performance in keeping inflation under control, what the claims would have been now in an oppressed economy for some sort of perceived wage justice. </PARA>
<PARA> I am getting a little away from what I was referring to-it is a point that I might come back to shortly. There has also been increased spending occasioned by a variety of factors. The honourable member for Curtin has come in here time and time again, as have other Opposition spokespeople, suggesting that the Government has not been tight enough in its fiscal policy and its fiscal responsibilities. Again I read from the article:</PARA>
<PARA>Increased spending</PARA>
<PARA> - $750 million because of Opposition's rejection of pipeline authority sale and assets test on family allowances. </PARA>
<PARA>How can the Opposition stand up in this place and justify the claim that this Government abrogates its responsibility to tight fiscal policy when it sells out on issues such as that? Even in terms of equity arguments, there is no argument. I will be interested to hear people who follow me in this debate go to that specific issue. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an increase of something like $440m extra on unemployment benefits. These are the increases in social security, the overspending and the overrun, to which the honourable member for Curtin referred. What does he expect a responsible government to do when the unfortunate consequence of a recession is an increase in unemployment? Does he expect the Government to turn its back on those unfortunate people who, for a variety of reasons, tend to lose their employment opportunities? Does he expect the Government to say, `Well, look, we are sorry; we know that it's an unfortunate consequence of the recession that you have lost your job, but we are not going to do anything about it and give you any income support.'?</PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable members in this place of the sorts of policy options and nonsense that were put forward by those on the other side and that were rejected at the election last year. Opposition members were talking about unemployment benefits being paid for a period of nine months and then totally cut out so that people were left to their own devices. In the constant calls from those on the other side for further government cuts in spending-translate that to mean fiscal responsibility-one wonders where the cuts would come from. Yet it is quite often stated in this place by the less socially responsible on the other side that it should be in areas such as social welfare that people's payments must be maintained because of adverse economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also included within this increased spending as a result of the recession about $275m for wool industry assistance. The growers got themselves into that position-not the Government; not even the Opposition. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> - $130 million on ``other minor outlay decisions''. </PARA>
<PARA> - $700 million on unexpected spending increases in such areas as natural disaster relief, pension payments. </PARA>
<PARA>One would hardly object to some of those things being paid because the Australian Labor Party does stand for some form of social justice and social equity. It does not stand for not looking after people who have been affected by natural disasters or people in need of increased pension payments. </PARA>
<PARA> When one analyses the problems associated with the Government's meeting its commitment to an original projection of a Budget surplus of some $8.1 billion, one can see quite readily where that money has gone. There is no magic about it; it is there. Whether it be this Party in government or whether it be the Opposition in government, if the same set of circumstances existed, the same difficulties would arise. </PARA>
<PARA> I was absolutely staggered today by the comments by the honourable member for Curtin that there was no indication as to when economic activity in this country was going to pick up and that the policies of the Treasurer, the Prime Minister, the Government and everybody on the treasury bench were dreadful. He was looking for scapegoats and stirring up leadership challenges-all a substitute for policy on the other side. The Opposition needs policies, not the visiting professor's throwaway lines for consideration at some stage in the future. `I am only thinking aloud,' says the Leader of the Opposition, but when he is asked about those thoughts he has nothing to substantiate them. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin echoed that by saying there is no indication of when economic activity will pick up. I can do no better than refer the honourable member to the newspapers of today. The Australian has the headline `Economy shows signs of life'. The Australian Financial Review has the headline `Figures suggest economy is ready to begin growing again', and states:</PARA>
<PARA>According to figures from the Bureau of Statistics yesterday, stock levels fell by only 0.3 per cent in the December quarter, compared to 2.5 per cent the previous quarter. And manufacturers' sales were steady over the quarter. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, what that is suggesting is that business is starting to develop again and to restock, and manufacturing is starting to pick up. In a recession, as things are going down, people run down their stocks. Once those stocks get to a low level, then one obviously has to start to manufacture again-and that is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> The second bit of news, of course, came on top of last Friday's news of a predicted boost to the December quarter gross domestic product of around 2 per cent from unexpectedly high growth in the export sector. Exports are going up. Yet the honourable member for Curtin is suggesting there is no indication of when economic activity will pick up. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the consumer confidence figures for March, issued by Westpac in conjunction with the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, suggested there was a 10-point rise in the index to 77 points, so consumer confidence is starting to increase. It may well be that just as a result of the end of the Gulf war people are starting to speculate that economic activity in this country will not be in a prolonged state of recession; nevertheless there is tangible evidence of this happening. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also some speculation that what we may see in terms of growth figures for the December quarter, when they are released in a few days time, is that technically the recession is over. I do not think anyone in this Parliament would want to see it any other way. If it does happen, I think that would be an appropriate response to policy initiatives that have been put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the view on the other side of this House that the Government simply sits back and lets it all unfold-that because the recession was upon us, because the Budget figures were in some way in error, and the estimates made within the Budget figures were in error, the Government had no policy response. What absolute nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA> As was indicated by the Prime Minister in his economic statement today, one of the major issues confronting Australia in the future will be the continuing attack on our number one evil, which is inflation. Despite what the honourable member for Curtin had to say, the inflation rate in Australia now is below the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average. Even if one goes to Great Britain and looks at the inflation and unemployment rates there, Australia still does marginally better. That is worthy of further consideration by all honourable members in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Why constantly talk down the Australian economy? Do those honourable members on the other side of the House get some perverse pleasure out of talking down the Australian economy with doom and gloom? There are those opposite who constantly put out press releases saying, `Isn't it dreadful that this Government has engineered this terrible recession-but isn't it good for us?'. People walk around with newspaper releases and banner headlines from newspapers decrying the fact that the economic conditions in their own particular electorates are so bad, instead of getting out and talking up the economy, and looking at ways in which they can, within their own areas, support the initiatives of the Government, which has not been lying back and taking it easy on policy development. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, the fact that this legislation is here is worthy of support, not for the reasons advanced by honourable members opposite but simply because it is necessary. It is necessary as a measure which has been in place for many years, up to the last few years when this Government was able to create sizeable Budget surpluses, something which those on the other side of the House were never able to do. That is a fact which should never be forgotten. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the 2 1/2 years since assuming Opposition responsibility for the portfolio of science, I have visited dozens of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation facilities and met with hundreds of CSIRO officers and staff. As a consequence I have developed an abiding respect and affection for the organisation, and in that I am little different from most, if not all, members of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> CSIRO stands as Australia's foremost research and development institution. Its scientific and technological achievements have made it internationally famous. Ordinary Australians, whilst generally lacking any detailed knowledge of CSIRO, recognise and respect it in a way not duplicated by any other government or semi-government agency. CSIRO has been such a part of Australian life for so long that it has secured a unique place in the nation's consciousness. </PARA>
<PARA> Lest anyone think that I am embarking upon a eulogy for CSIRO, let me say immediately that I am instead about to wish it a happy birthday. The nation's most prestigious research and development agency celebrates its sixty-fifth birthday on Saturday, 16 March. </PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO was founded in March 1926, and has since become the focus of the nation's rural and industrial research effort. CSIRO sprang from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research which was established in 1926, but it acquired its current title in 1949. Though the organisation originally focused on primary industries, since the Second World War it has developed internationally competitive research capacities in industrial applications. </PARA>
<PARA> At present CSIRO operates through six separate institutes-the Institute of Information Science and Engineering; the Institute of Industrial Technologies; the Institute of Minerals, Energy and Construction; the Institute of Animal Production and Processing; the Institute of Plant Production and Processing; and the Institute of Natural Resources and Environment. It has its headquarters in Canberra but manages research facilities throughout the length and breadth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO also has shareholdings in companies involved in transfer technology, rare earth magnets, smokeless briquettes, sewage treatment and disposal, agricultural chemicals, genetics, growth factors, and transport systems. CSIRO's charter encompasses fields as diverse as advanced minerals technology, bio-molecular engineering, space science applications, manufacturing technology, the environment and agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO's major achievements include the transformation of Australia's semi-desert regions into grazing country, with the use of trace elements; and the development of smelting and arc welding technologies, as well as sophisticated ceramics. CSIRO has also been at the forefront of radio astronomy which has resulted in the development of the Interscan microwave landing system which is now used in the world's major airports. </PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO is pivotal to the environmental debate. The realisation of the concept of sustainable development will be possible only through the application of scientific knowledge. CSIRO's recent work on plasma arc furnace technology, Airtrak pollution detection systems and climate related research signals the importance of science and technology in overcoming further degradation of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The work of CSIRO is also integral to lifting the competitiveness of Australian industry. The organisation has developed new processes to ensure the domestic textile industry retains its advantage in world markets. Most recently the Sirospin system has revolutionised the production of fine quality woollen yarn and halved the cost of conventional processes. </PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO super-clean coal technology ensures that Australia's coal resources will long retain their key presence in the export market and play a greater role still in power generation. CSIRO is set to keep Australia at the frontiers of scientific and technological change right into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> As would be expected of a member of the National Party of Australia, I now want to concentrate my remarks on agricultural research and development. I do so unashamedly, particularly given the very proud and long association between the former Country Party, but now National Party, and the CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO's efforts have been instrumental in boosting the efficiency of plant and animal production in the rural sector. The organisation has led the world in developing new crop strains which are disease resistant and capable of flourishing in what were once thought to be hostile environmental conditions. CSIRO's genetic engineering research programs also serve to produce livestock which are highly fertile, less prone to environmental stress and capable of commanding higher prices in international markets. Its efforts to control cattle poisoning from plants and micro-organisms alone have saved producers $100m annually. CSIRO's entomological and plant industry research programs have devised new ways of reducing the threats to primary industries posed by insects and other pests without recourse to the application of chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO has increasingly turned to assisting farmers to overcome problems associated with land degradation and soil salination and acidification. CSIRO's land and water care research programs are designed to provide farmers with practical land management strategies which retain farm productivity whilst preserving and improving the quality of soils. </PARA>
<PARA> The future of CSIRO is secure, primarily because it has managed to balance commercial imperatives with strategic objectives. This balancing act, often delicate, consumes much of the time of CSIRO's leaders and, I might add, legislators. Much of the debate about the future directions of CSIRO centres on this very point. In a nutshell, the debate is: to what extent should we require CSIRO to maintain a body of knowledge upon which it and other researchers in Australia can draw, whilst at the same time tailoring its research to take up commercial opportunities?</PARA>
<PARA> In recent times, under the strong and imaginative leadership of the Chief Executive, Dr John Stocker, I am confident that this balance has been about right. CSIRO has demonstrated its fierce determination to be at the cutting edge of science and technology. The organisation does not complacently shuffle along, like so many other government business enterprises, arrogantly assuming the taxpayer will fund its existence come what may. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to concentrate my remarks on a discussion of CSIRO's future. We know that CSIRO has a social or community value in that it generates a body of knowledge which is of wide public benefit. This is particularly so in respect of the environment. This is an area in which it cannot be expected that industry linkages will be easily located. Nor can we be dependent upon finding imported solutions to our own domestic environmental concerns; they are too specific. </PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO's long history of involvement in Australia's agricultural industries has given it an intimate understanding of environmental and climatic conditions. CSIRO alone is capable of marshalling the resources, the hard data and the human expertise to confront problems of this kind. It alone is capable of building practical solutions to issues such as land degradation, arising from years and years of steady deterioration. It alone has a tradition of scientific objectivity and good commonsense that makes it a trusted ally of primary producers and industries whose activities bear upon the environment in various ways. Its work on Landcare and water resources therefore are at the forefront of public policy in respect of the goal of sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA> The CSIRO will be the research agency to which governments will look to establish baseline environmental data upon which policy will be built. The organisation will continue to play the role of umpire between combatants in the debate between development and conservation-although we know that it should really be a debate over development and conservation, as neither objective is mutually exclusive. This is why government Ministers queue up to avail themselves of CSIRO's research capabilities. CSIRO's role in this regard is set to become even more critical. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of the economic benefits that we as a parliament, and the nation as a whole, expect to be generated through CSIRO is not lost on the organisation itself. The organisation has also managed, not without difficulties, to take a more commercial orientation in recent years. It has discovered, not without some modest prompting, that it has a more direct role in industry development strategies. But, once prompted, it has seized on the chance to play a more important role in ensuring the future of Australian industries so as to assist Australia's industries to attain a higher degree of competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Access to new technologies is only one facet of competitiveness, but it is an important one. CSIRO's collaborative work with industry is significant in this respect. Such interaction teaches CSIRO more about commercial imperatives, which feeds into its future research programs and enables them to dovetail more effectively with industry. Such interaction also affects its private sector partners and teaches it more about the potential of technology strategies in improving the competitiveness of its production processes or product developments. </PARA>
<PARA> As an example, consider the role of CSIRO in working with Mount Isa Mines Ltd (MIM) in producing the innovative Sirosmelt or Isasmelt process. The smelting process is instrumental in improving the efficiency of lead smelting processes. MIM built a pilot plant at Mount Isa in 1984 and has now embarked on the construction of a $50m smelter incorporating the original CSIRO technology. The smelter will produce 60,000 tonnes of lead a year. The technology is now established in Europe. It also has environmental pluses-higher rates of recovery of sulphur dioxide and other lead emissions than other smelting technologies. It is cooperation of this sort which will be enhanced in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> As CSIRO continues to mature, so will its interaction with Australia's industry become more frequent. There will be an ongoing debate within CSIRO, within this Parliament and within the research community as to the degree of CSIRO's commercial orientation. Suffice it to say that CSIRO well knows its duties and responsibilities to the nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very sorry that, after the sterling words of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who told us about that wonderful organisation the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, I have to bring the Parliament back to the matter of the Government's having to be forced to borrow money to balance its Budget this year. This debate on the Loan Bill is about debt. It is about a government that has never been able to manage its affairs. We now have this particular demonstration. It is certainly a fair weather government, one that does better with its financial arrangements when things are booming than when they get a little tough. All of those words are in stark contrast to these particular words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This year inflation will fall further, the current account deficit will markedly improve and employment will pick up-in short, the kind of outcome the Government was seeking . . . without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession. </PARA>
<PARA>I am reading from an editorial in the West Australian. It points out:</PARA>
<PARA>Those words could have come from any one of Treasurer Paul Keating's optimistic speeches in the buoyant times of the past few years. In fact, they were drawn from his 1990-91 Budget speech, brought down six months ago. Even then, the imminent economic slowdown cast a dark shadow that was obvious to many Australians although Mr Keating, it seems, was not one of them. </PARA>
<PARA>The tragedy of those remarks is not only their dishonesty but also their stupidity. It is no secret that I have an interest in racing horses. I always say of jockeys, `I don't know the one I dislike most-the dishonest one or the stupid one'. In both cases, the effect is much the same-one does not win the race. We are being told by the Government, after all those bold words, that it has to borrow some money to balance the books. It is not even as though it started with a balanced Budget; it claimed it would deliver an $8.1 billion surplus. When it is all over and the borrowings, the lendings and the repayments are worked out, it is possible that the book figures will still show some sort of surplus, but it is fairly unlikely, apparently, according to some other expert commentators. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that at this stage of the game, notwithstanding a predicted $8.1 billion surplus, the Government has to come to this Parliament and ask us to authorise it to go out and borrow some money so it can go on paying, in particular, the defence forces, which are especially mentioned in the second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some other words that have to be taken into account in those remarks of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). He was telling us that we could have all these things he promised without the misery and despair of high unemployment and savage recession. When he thought everything was lovely, he perceived unemployment and recession as misery and despair. That is exactly the situation of unemployment if one happens to be unemployed. He knows it, but he comes into this place these days and basically shrugs it off. Today the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said, `Yes, we admit that this is the situation', but he did not sound very concerned about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is time that the Treasurer read those words, because it is evident that he knows the damage he has done. Once he is confronted with it he does not want to admit to it. He is a big kid. He says, `My dad can beat your dad'. He is the sort of person who is never wrong. That is a pity for Australia. If he could occasionally see the error of his ways, he might correct them in time. He is so busy denying that he is wrong that the problems continue. That is not a matter of recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing that is most consistent with the Treasurer's performance as Treasurer has been that he is a reactionary. While he boasts all the time of the way he has implemented reform in this area and reform in that area, history does not support him. He was made Treasurer after he delivered the leadership to the Prime Minister. That was his prize. Up to then he had the industry portfolio and some other portfolio. He knew very little about economics. Days later almost-certainly not more than a few weeks-he was the Treasurer of Australia. He had one typed foolscap page of economic policy to help him out, plus the teachings of old Connors and Jack Lang, who were his mentors. He has a close association-he certainly did in the past-with Bill Hayden, who came in here during my three years as a member of the back bench of the Fraser Government and constantly criticised our Budgets for not having big enough deficits. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish I had the time-I will find it in time-to research some of the speeches of the Treasurer over his 26 years in this Parliament when he was in opposition to find out how he supported industry protection. I will bet honourable members that the support is there; he would have been shoulder to shoulder with Black Jack McEwen, the person he now criticises. Industry protection was not only the policy of the Menzies Government; it was the policy of the Australian Labor Party when it was leading the push. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer comes in here as some born-again economic dry trying to tell us that industry protection was all his own idea. That is what he came to the Parliament with. He came with total opposition to the Campbell inquiry recommendations. He came with total opposition to the Howard proposals for licensing six international banks. He came with a general Keynesian approach to economics. Contrary to popular opinion, he practised that. He came in with all those things, and then suddenly he found that he was holding the purse strings and the cheque book and he had to start doing a few things. </PARA>
<PARA> The first thing the Treasurer decided to do was implement all the social policies promised by the Prime Minister in the Australian Labor Party's election speeches. When he went to balance the Budget, he found he was about $8 billion over. That is the first test of a Treasurer, particularly one who claims the economic credentials of this Treasurer. As we know from his background, he left school at the age of 14 and had a brief flirtation with the private sector. He actually took a job, but he did not last long there before he became a trade union bureaucrat. He learned a little about adding up; he got the numbers to be endorsed at the age of 24 as the honourable member for Blaxland and he has been there ever since. They are his economic credentials; that is why he is bluffed by all the bureaucrats and the econocrats of Canberra-because he does not know any better. </PARA>
<PARA> Once the Treasurer says something he sticks with it through fire and flood, and storm and tempest. He never gives up on it. He might be comprehensively proved wrong, but he will not change his mind, because he is a big kid. That is his problem. He is an economic vacuum. He is stuffed up every morning, cranked up on the J-curve and the non-farm deflator, and away he goes. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make is that this bloke was confronted with an overrun on expenses and he had two choices. He made a lot of election promises which he could no longer finance with revenue. He had the opportunity to stand up and say to the Australian people, `I can't deliver on our election promises because . . . '. He could have blamed Malcolm Fraser. He could have said, `Fraser and Howard were such bad managers that they've left nothing in the kitty for all these promises which we anticipated. Therefore, you don't get Medicare'. It was just a mere $2.6 billion of his $8 billion of overspending which he claimed, as I will elaborate in a minute, as an inheritance. </PARA>
<PARA> To suggest that Malcolm Fraser and our health Minister were about to reintroduce Medicare after seven years of trying to get themselves out of Medibank was the height of stupidity. Over a quarter of this Treasurer's $8 billion overspending was in one outlay-Medicare. He had the opportunity to say to people, `You can't have that because the Liberals have left me with this terrible economic situation'. But not Paul; what did he do? He said, `Well, I'll spend the money and I'll blame the Liberals for an inherited Budget deficit'. I have never heard of an inherited debt. Someone might dearly love his grandmother, but I bet he will not accept all her debts when she dies. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Treasurer did that. That was his first step. It was deliberate but, because he knew it was wrong, he blamed the Liberals. He went on blaming them for four years over which time he borrowed $26 billion and pumped it into the Australian economy. He did that when we were recovering from the rural recession. It was a recession, of course, caused by weather: it did not rain. </PARA>
<PARA> In the seven years that the Treasurer has been in that position he has mentioned the drought only once. That was when he had to defend the increase in taxation that he had imposed on Australians. He said that it came off a very low base, namely, the income levels of the drought year. Other than that, he ignored it; it was all the Liberals' fault. That was a stupid thing to say. He was not even smart enough to recognise that it had rained and that the Australian economy did not need that injection of money. But that was reactionary. He reacted to the situation and forced the money into the economy because he thought it would create jobs. As I said in this place just the other day, he had a debt for jobs policy. He then went a bit further. </PARA>
<PARA> The next thing the Treasurer was confronted with was the exchange rate. He was the new boy and the money market dealers certainly woke up to the fact that he did not know much about anything. So they started to manipulate the exchange rate. They had 10 per cent this way and 10 per cent the other way. The Treasurer devalued by 10 per cent in an attempt to straighten that out, but it did not work. The dealers tried to pressure him in the other direction.</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer did not have a written policy of floating the Australian exchange rate when he was elected. What is more, he had not even given it a thought. But in response to being pushed and shoved around by the money markets, he thought that if he threw them the football, they could play with it themselves. So he devalued the currency. He did not ask himself what the consequences might be. It was fine economic theory, but it just so happened, as we have discovered, that the Australian currency is of a size that can be easily manipulated by the big institutions of the world which in many cases turn over more money than our nation and they have been doing it. In the last six months they have taken on the Reserve Bank, which tried to lower our exchange rate when it got stupidly high, and they just kept buying the dollars the Reserve Bank was spending. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that they are going to do the same thing to the Reserve Bank when they work out that our interest rates have sunk as far as it is prepared to let them go. After that this Government will have no opportunity to manipulate interest rates, if it is necessary to stimulate the economy, because those big institutions now have so much money in Australia-$130 billion-that they will just pack up and take it away. To pick a figure, they will say to the Government, `Ten per cent is it'. That is when the economy has really got some problems. I think that when the Treasurer makes all these statements he might know that or have been told it. </PARA>
<PARA> Having inflated our economy as he did, the Treasurer turned round and deregulated the entire financial system. He turned the entrepreneurs loose on the economy. What the Government had not borrowed to get things fired up they did. The jobs kept growing but they were not growing on real production and real development: they were growing on borrowed money. The borrowed money was not being spent on the means of production; it was being spent on office blocks that, half the time, were being filled by government bureaucrats. It amazes me to this day that we have to install our bureaucrats on the thirty-fifth floor of a building in the middle of Sydney, Melbourne or Perth. But the money was funny money. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Treasurer eventually discovered what a mess he had made of things, he had to react again. So he jammed up interest rates. On what? On the very instrument that had created this economic growth-debt. He made it so expensive that people had to walk away from it. Some crashed and some managed to stagger away, but the reality was that suddenly the very thing he had that was boosting the economy-debt-became too expensive. Of course that crashed and all his jobs with it. The jobs that those opposite talk about day after day were the result of a debt-led recovery. I do not want to organise the economy, but nobody asked themselves what the consequences of this decision would be. They had a good idea at the time and this bloke did not understand for the simple reason that he has no qualifications, no experience-nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> The town of Geraldton, which is in my electorate, is about to have a by-election. The Liberals have endorsed a man called Bob Bloffwitch. He is a very successful Ford dealer. He is not only successful in his own right in a small town but also he is recognised throughout Australia and consequently has been made President of the Service Station Owners Association of Australia. He has also been made President of the Western Australian branch of the Motor Traders Association. Honourable members know, as I do, that such people are in conflict with government and government bureaucracy every day. They do not pick people just because they are nice; they pick them for ability. The town of Geraldton is very lucky to have that man offered to them. Yet people are running around saying, `I don't think he has done enough in the community'. Madam Deputy Speaker, you would know, as we do, that if one wants to succeed in this place and have something done, one wants a little more experience than selling cakes on a Saturday morning. </PARA>
<PARA> In truth, in economic terms that was about the limit of the Treasurer's experience: he had sold a few cakes on a Saturday morning. He did not have any experience. He has been bluffed by the Canberra bureaucracy and he has made many dreadful decisions. His theory is: push it up on debt and drag it down with interest rates. He says that he is some sort of student of the arts and a few other things, but he is certainly no student of history. When he set out to deflate the Australian economy with his high interest rates, he had a dozen examples at least available to him of why that would not work, why he could not achieve his soft landing, why he could not avoid, as he said, the misery and despair of high unemployment and savage recession-because nobody has known how to work it out and it so happens that Australia is worse off than most because we are in the very unfortunate position of having a centralised Federal bureaucracy in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a group of people with the highest per capita earnings in the nation totally insulated from the business world. They look out of the window in the morning and find their taxpayer-funded cheques in an envelope in the letterbox and say, `What recession? What-they have no bread? Why don't they eat cake?'. That is the situation in Canberra. We know that the statistics come through far too slowly and that nobody's feet are on the ground. The messages were there, as the West Australian newspaper said months before. But, typically, no government has ever been able to properly administer a monetary policy in terms of achieving a soft landing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer had all that information available to him. He just did not do anything about it because he did not know. He sent the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean) to give us the bad news-the Treasurer was not going to do it-that he now wants the authority of this Parliament to borrow money so he can go on paying people, notwithstanding his brave words of six months ago. In that time we have seen the situation go from a predicted $8 billion Budget surplus to a probable deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> Imagine standing up in front of a board of directors as the managing director, which basically this man is, and telling it that. It would say, `Have you got your resignation in your pocket?'. But the Treasurer shrugs it off because he believes more in rhetoric. Winning the argument is so important to this man. It does not matter about all those people who are not working any more; it does not matter about farmers and everyone else who do not know where to turn. They do not matter as long as Paul feels, at the end of the day, that he has won the argument. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a disaster for Australia and it is tragic that we are sitting here today having to discuss the Loan Bill when the Government had all that going for it. But of course the Government is going back to where it started from-$26 billion in its first four Budgets; it will be back there again. The only reason we have big taxes is because it let people borrow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Loan Bill which is currently being debated in the House will give the Government the authority to borrow money in order to meet the shortfall between the money it had appropriated in the Budget and the funds it now has available to it through Consolidated Revenue. The Bill is necessary because of the major deterioration in the Government's budgetary position-because, as the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has said, of the incredible elimination of a projected Budget surplus of $8.1 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frankly, the presence of this Bill and the fact that we are debating it this evening is unbelievable. Six months ago we believed we were on target for a Budget surplus and now we find that the nation has lost $8.1 billion. The question that the Opposition can justifiably ask of the Government is, `How could you get it so wrong?'. As the honourable member for O'Connor has said, the cheap jibe that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) constantly makes in answering that question is to denigrate the Opposition. Yet, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) pointed out last week in a personal explanation:</PARA>
<PARA>In 1982-83, which was the last year of my treasurership and the beginning of his, the gross domestic product to debt ratio was 13.7 per cent; it had risen by 1989-90 to a cool figure of 33.3 per cent-and is still rising. </PARA>
<PARA>That is why we are here-because the gross domestic product (GDP) to debt ratio has been blown out of proportion. </PARA>
<PARA> I am participating in this debate because I think there are some ironic parallels between the situation that the Treasurer finds himself in this evening and the situation that farmers in my electorate have had to come to terms with over the last six months. As a result, not entirely but very largely, of this Government's policies and as a result, particularly, of the Treasurer's decision that farmers should wear high interest rates, farmers find that they too are the managers of assets that have now gone unpredictably and substantially into debt. The surpluses that they were confidently predicting two years ago in the face of good wool markets and rising grain markets have disappeared. It is sobering for us to consider the plight of rural Australia, which is so closely allied with the plight of Australia and which bears so many parallels to the reality which the Treasurer has had to come to terms with as, suddenly, he finds that the surplus he had expected has gone. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote from comments made by Mr Peter Taylor, the President of the New South Wales Farmers Association, which appeared in the NSW Farmers magazine of March 1991. Mr Taylor says:</PARA>
<PARA>When 74 per cent of farmers are carrying an average debt of more than a quarter of a million dollars and when farm costs in the grains industry eat away 97.5 per cent of a farmer's income, they are more than justified to complain,</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government continually attempts to take the heat off itself by laying the blame for this rural depression on overseas markets. Obviously the prices farmers receive are playing a major part, but only as much as the costs farmers pay, such as interest rates and fuel taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> The average farmer in debt is paying nearly $36,000 per year in interest payments-an horrific load which is not sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> In NSW this would be worse, as the average total farm debt in NSW is nearly $287,000-by far the highest in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That grim reality which is currently gripping rural Australia bears some parallel to what has happened in this chamber since a Budget surplus was predicted when we gathered for the August 1990 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the farmers who are hurting. As you would know from your own electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker, small businesses are disappearing. When the Treasurer came into office in 1982-83 bankruptcies in Australia numbered 4,909-a figure which we would concede was too high. By 1986-87, presumably in the heyday of this Government, the number of bankruptcies had risen to 7,534. Last year 9,131 people went bankrupt-a horrific number. What do we have from the Government? We have cheap shots about the administration of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia eight years ago, as if we bore some responsibility for the current demise and the economic circumstances facing Australia eight years later. Those cheap shots are cheap not only because they are mischievous but also because they are blatantly in error, as the honourable member for O'Connor has pointed out and as I wish to reinforce in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> During the administration of this Treasurer, the net foreign debt has gone from $23.3 billion, or 13 per cent of GDP, when he came into office, to $108.1 billion, or 32 per cent of GDP. The gross foreign debt has gone from $38.8 billion in 1983 to $137 billion in 1989. Is it any wonder that we are looking at a disappearing Budget surplus? Surely it is simply because we have spent ourselves deeper into debt and we have spent that money on unproductive activities. We are unable to sustain those unproductive activities and they are not, in themselves, making any contribution towards the export earnings of the nation. So we find that the money which the Treasurer had so proudly announced in the 1990 Budget has mysteriously disappeared-$8.1 billion. The economy is in tatters, rural Australia is in tatters and the Budget handed down so proudly last August is also in tatters. </PARA>
<PARA> I reinforce the comment I made when I rose to address the House: the Treasurer is facing what Australian farmers face every day-with one major difference. As the Bill before the House so uncomfortably illustrates, the Treasurer can borrow. He can dip his hands deeper into taxpayers' pockets in order to compensate for his errors. The farmers have no such choice. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to bring one tangential argument into this debate-directly related to the Bill, I hasten to reassure you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I point out that even the surplus that the Treasurer handed down last August is hardly a matter for pride. A surplus Budget of that magnitude indicates simply that the Government is taking more in taxpayer revenue than it ought to take. The Government has $8.1 billion of taxpayers' money that could have stayed in the taxpayers' pockets. We had defended that because the nation is so far in debt that we felt there was an obligation to generate additional tax in order to pay off the debt. But, as the honourable member for O'Connor has pointed out, the whole Budget is skewed simply because we have in fact taken money for unproductive purposes. I do not think that this excessive Budget is a matter for pride at all. I think the surplus indicates that in fact the taxpayers have been charged excessive tax. It is okay to use this surplus to pay off an accumulated debt, but it would have been far better if that debt had never been accumulated in the first place so the surplus would have remained with the people most likely to spend it responsibly-the taxpayers who first earned that money. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill we are debating tonight is in fact a benchmark of the failure of this Government. The Government will choose, conveniently, to blame the fall in taxpayer revenue for the blow-out in the Budget and the consequently disappearing surplus. It will blame the recession and it will even blame the Gulf war. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall pick up the remarks that I was making prior to dinner on a Bill which is, I briefly remind the House, an authority to borrow money-money that the Government needs simply because the appropriation it allowed for in the Budget and the funds now available to it are dramatically different. That difference is to be made up through the operations of this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is necessary principally because of the major deterioration in the Government's expenditure position. Just prior to dinner we were reflecting on the enormous turnaround in Government fortunes which has occurred. How can it be that six months ago the Government was talking about a Budget surplus and yet today it finds that $8.1 billion has disappeared? Frankly, the Opposition is asking the Government: how could it have got it so wrong? I drew what I said was a rather ironical analogy between the reality that the Treasurer currently faces-that what he predicted would be his Budget is not his Budget-and the reality that all the farmers in my electorate are facing every day as they recognise that they will no longer be able to do what they had budgeted for.</PARA>
<PARA> In my comments just before the break I said that this Bill is very much the benchmark of this Government because it indicates how the Government has failed not only to perform but also to prepare itself for this sort of recession. It is easy for the Government to blame the fall in commodity prices for the consequent fall in revenue and the unpredicted fall in the tax revenue that it had expected, and it is easy for it even to blame the Gulf war-which was unpredictable-but the reality is that there has been no real preparation by the Government for this sort of eventuality. There has been nothing trim about this Government and it has not been ready for the difficulties that a turnaround in the world economic situation has produced. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been easy for members of the Government to approve expenditure on Medicare and social engineering policies and to stand in this Parliament and claim how the Government has created jobs when those jobs have been funded from the public purse. Now when the squeeze is on the public purse, we find that those jobs have disappeared. What the Government stands condemned for, particularly from a rural perspective, is the fact that in spite of what has been an unprecedented run of good seasons when the nation has not faced those droughts that are so characteristic of agriculture in Australia, there has been no real fat. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at the difference between the capacity that Australian primary producers have to be competitive and productive and the capacity of their competitors overseas. I pointed out before dinner that there has been a dramatic difference in inflation rates, with Australia at 7.7 per cent, Japan at 2.5 per cent and Germany at 2.3 per cent, and a dramatic difference in the way in which these nations have gone about addressing their balance of payments. The balance of payments blow-out that we face means that effectively we are going backwards in trading terms to the tune of $2.5m every hour and if that sounds unbelievable, it adds up to $50m a day, $500 million every 10 days and $1.5 billion every month. </PARA>
<PARA> In the matter of public importance this afternoon, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) made the point that much of what is keeping Australia non-competitive is not on-farm but off-farm costs. Of course he is right. Look at the cost of processing one beast for slaughter in Australia, which is $111, compared with the United States of America, where it is $36. Or look at the total processing cost of a beast, which in Australia is $193 and in the USA, $88. Or look, as we have from time to time this week, at the difference in waterfront performance in Australia and what happens in overseas ports. For example, there is a difference in the capacity of a crane driver loading and unloading containers. Overseas countries have the capacity to move 25 containers an hour while in Australia only 11 containers are shifted each hour. </PARA>
<PARA> This afternoon's statement was designed to address some of this non-competitive edge that Australia and Australian businesses currently labour under, but there is too little competition and it is too late. The illustration of just how late it is is the fact that in six months our $8.1 billion surplus has now come to a point at which we have to pass this Bill in order to generate more revenue for the Commonwealth. If that is the case in March 1991, what will it be like in March 1992 or, in primary production terms, when the chickens come home to roost?</PARA>
<PARA> If the Treasurer thinks he is seeing a fall-off in tax revenue as a result of the rural depression, he has not seen anything yet. The real bite of the rural depression is only just beginning to affect my farmers. What will happen to wool cheques when, instead of a 700c guaranteed price, we are selling wool, little as it is, at 450c or 500c, as is the case today? Those are the cheques that wool growers will be looking at. What will happen when, as a result of the Cabinet decision, primary producers fail to plant grain and so not only will less export revenue be generated, but of course less tax will be paid by each primary producer and we then face an even greater deficit reality? What will happen when the growing queues of unemployed people mean that those people are no longer taxpayers because they have been, in effect, employed by the Commonwealth instead of undertaking some form of productive pursuit?</PARA>
<PARA> I am told in the Commonwealth Employment Service offices in the Riverland that the majority of Riverland fruit pickers this fruit season, which is just coming to a conclusion, have been local people and not imported people, as is normally the case. Why? Because there have been more local people out of work available to do that job. What does that mean? It means that rural unemployment is only just beginning to be seen for what it is. As the fruit season comes to an end, these local unemployed people who have had casual work will no longer have work and so rural unemployment queues will grow even longer and there will be even fewer people from whom the Treasurer can rake tax revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> The national debt that we face we are told is a debt of something like $7,400 for every man, woman and child. There is a real sense that this Bill simply increases it, and that is an indictment of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA>It is certainly not my confident prediction that the Budget will remain in surplus. We know that it is down to approximately $1.5 billion and still falling.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I ask the rhetorical question: why do we need a Loan Bill other than for the reason that the Government is at serious risk of running a deficit in its Budget? The responsibility for that deficit lies on the Government's shoulders. We have brought ourselves to the point where we require a Loan Bill because of mismanagement on the part of the Government. It is true, as the Minister Assisting the Treasurer has said, that the Bill is consistent with the practice that has been in place for many years. But it was the proud boast of the Government that no such Loan Bill would be required in 1991 because of the supposedly outstanding surplus in the Government's Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So it is a matter of serious concern to this House that all of those confident predictions have amounted to nought, and that of course has very serious implications for the management of the economy.

The reduced rate of sales tax for `luxury' vehicles will apply to all taxable dealings that occur on or after 13 March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> When the rate of sales tax on `luxury' vehicles was increased by this Government last year, motor vehicles specially fitted out for transporting disabled persons whilst seated in wheel chairs-which were previously subject to a tax at 30 per cent-were excluded from the higher rate of tax and became taxable at the general rate of 20 per cent. The Bill will ensure that these vehicles remain subject to the tax at the lower rate. The reduction in the rate of sales tax on `luxury' motor vehicles will cost $15m in 1990-91 and $45m in 1991-92.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In talking on the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill, I think it is worth looking back a bit to the history of the original Bill and why this amendment Bill is now being brought before this chamber. One of the first points that we should remember is that self-government is a relatively recent development for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It occurred in 1988 with the self-government Act and the electoral system for the Territory was specified in the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988. This system is what is known as the modified d'Hondt, something that I do not think anyone outside the ACT has ever heard of and hopefully-if it is anything like it was at the last ACT election-is not likely to hear about again. It was adopted as a compromise following lengthy debate and it provided for a form of proportional representation that had not previously been used in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think all honourable members could not help remembering what happened at that first election held on 4 March 1989. The kindest thing one could say is that it was a debacle; it was a total fiasco. The counting of votes alone took nine weeks-over two months-from the time of the election to determine who was actually going to be a member of the ACT Legislative Assembly, which is absolutely extraordinary. This was supposed to be one of the Government's shining pieces of legislation, the great step forward for the ACT, the move to self-government. It started off not with a bang, but with the greatest fizz of all time. Nine weeks to get results! But it was not just that. A total of 117 candidates stood for 17 positions. In fact, not only were there 117 candidates, but there were also 108 different parties standing for the ACT. The fiasco goes on. There were nine Independents. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing that I am sure all honourable members must have been quite astounded about-maybe amused or refusing to believe-was that the residents of the ACT woke up one day to find that, amongst the parties standing for the ACT, there was a party called the Party! Party! Party! Party and another group called the Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party. I see that the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) still cannot smile. There was another one called the Surprise Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Many residents of the ACT were obviously not impressed with what was being offered. They certainly did not believe that the system that the Government had finally brought in was one which for which they could show the sort of respect that one would have expected for the inaugural election for the ACT Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting to note that in this debate on the amendment Bill there is a notable omission from the list of Government speakers. I am talking about the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch). Why should I mention his name? He was the Minister who brought into this place the original Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988. Well may he hang his head in shame. It seems amazing that he has not even put himself on the list to speak in favour of the amendment Bill brought here tonight by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting back to that election, not only can we recall the names of some of those 108 parties which were standing for election, but we can also look at the ballot paper. The ballot paper was a whole metre wide, the biggest ballot paper that has ever been seen in Australia. I am told on good authority by my colleague the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) that it was the second biggest ballot paper ever seen in the democratic world, beaten only once, in the 1930s in Illinois, when that State had the orange blanket election. So the ACT was subjected to another first-certainly the biggest ticket in Australia and the second biggest in the world. It is something that I would have thought the Government would not be very proud of and something that I would have thought the honourable member for Canberra, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly)-who obviously likes to express her concern about preserving our trees-would not be all that pleased about. </PARA>
<PARA> The ballot paper had 139 boxes on it, which obviously led to widespread confusion. I am not suggesting for one second that the honourable residents of Canberra are not well informed on electoral matters, but when we looked at what this meant in practice, we saw an informal vote amounting to 5.69 per cent, which is staggering. In the nine weeks that it took to count the votes to actually obtain a result, the scrutiny of the ballot papers required eight stages. In other words, those ballot papers had to be dealt with eight times. Each ballot paper had to be sorted into 209 categories. For the benefit of honourable members, I compare that with what happens in the Senate, where the bigger States, such as New South Wales, have several million votes to be counted. They still only have to be put into 140 categories. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, everyone would agree that something has to be done about the situation in the ACT. But this time we have to get it right. I say to the Minister for Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons), who is at the table, that he still has not got it right. That is notwithstanding the fact that there has been a Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry chaired by my colleague the honourable member for Chisholm who, along with members of that Committee, put a considerable amount of time and effort into trying to get a result. But because of the delay in dealing with this matter, there was a suggestion at one stage that there might be a referendum to choose between two options. After having given the residents of Canberra the choice of 117 candidates, we are now going to give them only two options. One option was going to be a single member electorate or the Hare-Clark system-but that has been overtaken by events. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the Government sat on this report for nearly 18 months, it now appears that there is a sudden rush. This amendment to the Act was introduced towards the end of last week. It was rushed straight into the Parliament for us to debate here tonight. Frankly, I cannot understand why, after all this delay, there is such a need for urgency to push the Bill through the House of Representatives. Obviously, because the Government holds the numbers, it will go through, but I give notice now that the Opposition intends to move a number of amendments in the Senate because there will be more time there to debate it properly. Because of that we intend to oppose this Bill here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major stumbling blocks the Government faces and has to get around in trying to come to some sensible position on this whole question of a voting system for the ACT-something some people have described as a complete shemozzle-is its hang-up on the list system. In other words, we can have the tick the box approach because the Australian Labor Party seems to have a great hang-up. I guess it is worth considering for a little while why the Government has such a hang-up. </PARA>
<PARA> My understanding is that it probably comes back quite simply to the problem that the Government has on factional deals. If it does away with the list system, it has a problem with its factional deals because it cannot be sure who is actually going to get elected on its list, as the voters might take a different view from the one that the hierarchy, the machine men in the party, want to put forward. So there is little wonder that the Labor Party has considerable difficulty in trying to come to a rational solution to the problem that saw this farce in the election back in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have pointed out, we are now having this extraordinary rush, having had 18 months to consider the Committee report, and the Government is now trying to push it through the House of Representatives with a minimal amount of debate and a minimal amount of time for people to consider what is in this legislation. One could make the observation, which has been made many times before, that this demonstrates the kind of contempt the Labor Party seems to have for this chamber when it comes to seriously debating some of the proposals put forward, particularly when this is a fairly difficult piece of legislation for people to come to agreement on. Certainly, it is going to have a serious impact on what could happen in the ACT Assembly at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Government will find that the coalition parties will reject outright some parts of the legislation; in particular, the restriction upon the individual's freedom of choice and its attempt to try to force voters, willing or not, into voting for a strict party list system. We do not accept that and we will oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I have to say that there are areas that we would support, and this will become obvious when the Bill gets to the Senate. I would also like to point out that the parts for which we do have some sympathy draw basically on aspects of the Joint Standing Committee report-the inquiry that was chaired so ably by my colleague the honourable member for Chisholm. We are trying to see-I hope the Government will realise this-a fairer and more democratic approach; an approach that will lead to the achievement of a quicker result than the disastrous nine weeks that it took last time. </PARA>
<PARA> I will list the sorts of reforms that we would like to see so that the Minister can take note of them. First, independents and minor parties should not automatically be disqualified if they do not achieve a minimum share of the vote. I think if we are being truly fair in a democratic sense, we should accept that point. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, voters should have the freedom to alter their preferences if they so choose, including-and I emphasis this point-a vote across party lines. It seems quite extraordinary that the Government would like to impose this sort of restriction because it does not suit its factional arrangements. I do not believe that the majority of people in the ACT would be very happy with this. So we will not go along with this approach of locking people into a party list system that the Government seems so keen to promote. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that there have got to be clearer and more logical rules as to what is a formal vote so we can get quicker counting. Again, we do not want to go back to the nine weeks that it took last time. We would also support the view that frivolous candidates ought to be discouraged and, clearly, tighter rules of registration and increasing the deposit would be an obvious way to approach that. As my colleague Senator Parer, who will be in charge of the passage of this legislation for the coalition in the Senate, has pointed out correctly, we want a ballot paper that is somewhat more user friendly. It should not be one metre wide, trying to break another Australian record and getting onto the world stage as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point we will be taking a very strong stand on is the question of postal votes. It seems extraordinary that the Government is trying to place a restriction on postal votes, the like of which is not expected in an election for this chamber or, indeed, in an election for the Senate. It seems to me quite extraordinary to try to put a closure on postal votes that would be different from what occurs for the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the points that I wanted to raise. As I pointed out, we will be opposing this amendment, but we will be moving our own amendments when the legislation reaches the Senate. As I say, I do not believe the Government has yet come up with the right solution to get around what really was a bit of a farce back in 1989-one that I think did much to discredit the efforts to have self-government in the ACT and one which reduced the respect of those in the ACT for their own Assembly. Again, I think that is very much on the Government's head because of the way it allowed this situation to develop. Clearly, we do not believe that the solution that has been offered in this amendment will get rid of all of the problems of the earlier system. For that reason, the Opposition will be opposing it and, as I have pointed out, in the Senate we will be moving specific amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), who has just spoken, listed well the problems of the modified d'Hondt system, but perhaps he has forgotten that the problems with the system were due to the amendments that were moved by his Party in the Senate. We would not have had the modified d'Hondt system if it had not been for the amendments that his spokespeople moved in the Senate. We would not have had the d'Hondt system at all if the Opposition parties had been willing to accept what the people of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) had wanted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Government has been quite consistent during this debate that has now been going on for half a dozen years in supporting in principle single member electorates. It is very striking how clearly single member electorates are supported by the people of the ACT. When a poll was conducted by the Canberra Times about a year ago, single member electorates were supported by over half the people responding. All of the other systems that were suggested were supported by a total of less than half. The other possibilities that were suggested were the Hare-Clark system, which got 20 per cent support; the modified d'Hondt system, which got 10 per cent; the simplified d'Hondt system, roughly what we are debating tonight, which got a small proportion. A small proportion did not know which system they preferred. But a clear majority of those who had an opinion supported single member electorates, and that is the system the Labor Government has advocated consistently throughout this debate. This would have been introduced years ago if the Opposition parties had been willing to accept what the people wanted, but it was not. We have gone through a tortuous saga of different types of systems, trying to find one that could get the agreement of one of the other parties in the Senate. Because of their opposition, we have ended up with this complex, modified d'Hondt system. </PARA>
<PARA> I am astonished even now to hear the honourable member for Wannon saying that he does not support the amendment that relates to postal voting. It was the existing arrangements on postal voting in the legislation that were the principal cause of the long delay in getting the vote counted last time. So to oppose simplifying that is to endorse a protracted counting procedure. Even at this moment, the Opposition is still being obstructive and rather inconsistent in what it suggests. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill may not be ideal, but it is the system that the Government had thought that the Opposition was going to agree to and that, therefore, had a reasonable chance of being passed by the Senate. The Opposition has now gone back on that agreement, but the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill, although it keeps in place a form of the d'Hondt system, involves a considerable improvement, a simplification of the d'Hondt system, and therefore is a Bill that I support. </PARA>
<PARA> The simplifications are quite straightforward and are consistent with the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which reported on the subject a while ago. The simplifications involve the registration of political parties and the requirement for them to have a minimum membership, thus preventing individuals registering more than one political party and avoiding the foolishness and the mockery of the Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party and the Party! Party! Party!, which really were an affront to any commitment to democracy. The Bill requires a deposit from candidates again to discourage frivolous nominations and a number of other very straightforward and entirely desirable modifications. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to emphasise yet again that it seems to me that single member electorates are the best system. We are familiar with them in this House. This is the system that the people of Australia are used to. This is the system that gives the most direct representation in the most accountable form. People can identify who their member is: they can identify the policies and the work of that member. Therefore, it is the system that the people of Canberra would feel most comfortable with because they are familiar with it. They have said in an opinion poll that that is what they would like. Labor would introduce that if the Opposition parties would agree. </PARA>

<PARA> By the way, I am very glad that we are not likely to be debating this issue again in this House. The Government has decided that it will pass the Australian Capital Territory electoral system over to the ACT Government after the next election, and that is where the electoral system for the Territory should be settled.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The history of providing a democratic government for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) has been a long road from the Seat of Government Act 1908 to the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill 1991; it has been a long road to the promised democratic land. We have had many Acts and commissions, from the first feeble practical step in 1928 with the election of the first representative to the present-day ACT Government. It has been a story of conflict, confusion, vested interests, elitism, partisan politics and incompetence. Regrettably, I have to say that the present Bill is a continuation of that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The present structure of the ACT Government is a reflection of almost all the defects of the Australian political landscape-the adversary system; the world's most rigid party system; the domination of Parliament by the Executive Government with no separation of powers, as underlined by Mr Fitzgerald in Queensland; the confusion of the role of representatives and of the legislative role of elected members; over-representation of government; and the multiplicity of politicians and the enormous associated bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Ironically, the one sin that bedevils most Australian elected governments is that of the gerrymandering of electoral systems through single member electorates. It is the one thing that does not apply at the moment. While the present system is certainly not as good as the proportional voting system that we have for the Senate or the Tasmanian Hare-Clark system, it has not distorted the wishes of the people of the ACT; but it is certainly a hopeless system in terms of its competence and practicality in counting and other such details. </PARA>
<PARA> But the voting system is far from the real cause of the Canberra public's perception of the inadequacy of the Government foisted upon them. The voting system is only one fairly minor factor. The ACT Government is a source of ridicule and disillusion throughout Canberra and even the rest of Australia. It is a savage condemnation and mirror of the Federal Parliament and of both the Government and the Opposition which created it. Merely tinkering with the voting system will have little effect on the public acceptability of the ACT Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill turns the clock back and proceeds down the Bjelke-Petersen way-it simply piles horror on horror. Abandoning all principles of a fair electoral system and one vote one value in the hope of short term party advantage will only reflect on the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and hasten the disintegration process that is already under way. I emphasise that my criticisms of the sorry saga of the ACT Government cannot be attached to the present elected members. They are almost as much victims of the system as are the residents of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the Bill, currently the 17 members of the Legislative Assembly are elected at large by a party list proportional system, incorporating a defective preferential element generally referred to as the modified d'Hondt system. This system allows candidates to stand as individuals or as members of a registered party group. The system lets voters cast votes for independents or individual candidates as easily as party groups, but the counting rules employed in the modified d'Hondt system allow votes cast for other than party group tickets to be credited to candidates who have been specifically rejected by the voters who cast those votes. This provision for false crediting of votes is not possible under any other proportional system used in Australia or, as far as I am aware, anywhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> One might expect a Bill amending the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act to deal with this problem. It does, but only by replacing it with a greater affront to democracy-that is, in effect, the removal of voters' rights to direct their preferences across parties. The modified d'Hondt system is the result of political horse-trading, and there is no rationale behind it. It does not strive for simplicity for the electors, scrutineers or counting staff; it does not aim for logical operation or for the retention of vote value for those voters whose first choice is unsuccessful or for consistency of outcome. Small groups which between them would have enough votes to elect one or more representatives under a normal proportional voting system are denied this right under modified d'Hondt, which prevents them from transferring ballots to like minded groups. </PARA>
<PARA> It was difficult to see how the ACT electoral system could be made any worse, but this Bill does it. The Bill prevents preferences being given across parties. The Government is really saying to the voters of Canberra at the next election, `You can take the chance of voting for a minor party or independent, but if whoever or whatever you choose is unsuccessful in getting elected in his or its own right, you will not only be denied representation by the candidate or group of your choice, but also the chance to have any influence at all on the election'. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Bill the Government is really proposing a form of first past the post voting. It is designed to have an insidious effect on voters by sending them the message, `Vote for an independent candidate or minor party, and your vote will be completely wasted'. It is a system which suppresses the wishes of the electorate by presenting many voters with the reality that the only way for them to vote effectively is to vote not for the candidate they prefer, but for a party that they may dislike in order to ensure that it defeats a party they dislike even more. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian parliamentary elections have not seen votes wasted due to non-transferability since the Queensland State election in 1960. That was the last parliamentary election in Australia that used the first past the post voting system. It says something about the Government that, in order to get what it wants in the ACT and to prop up the failing political fortunes of the major parties whose share of the total vote is slipping, it is willing to entertain an electoral system like the one abandoned in Queensland 30 years ago and even earlier in the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> When votes are wasted because the electoral system will not allow them to be transferred, the chance that minority voters will win a majority of the seats without any regard to the choices made by other voters is greatly increased. It is quite possible for two parties winning, say, 36 per cent and 32 per cent of the vote respectively under the Government's proposal to win all 17 seats between them. Voters for the other candidates and groups unable to combine their support to elect their own representatives or even to combine with the less successful for the two major parties to assist it to win a larger number of seats is shut out altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will promote a winner take all electoral regime because of the inability of the less successful of the two major parties to benefit from subsequent preferences of voters supporting small groups and Independents. It is curious thinking on the part of the ALP to shut its ACT party branch off from preferences and to foist a first past the post psychology on voters in the ACT. Possibly the ALP hopes to drive Australian Democrats, Independent supporters, greens and others to switch their primary vote to the ALP ahead of conservative parties. </PARA>
<PARA> But if so, it should look at what happened recently in New Zealand where, despite the `don't waste your vote' psychology of that country's first past the post voting system, 17 per cent of New Zealanders did not vote for either major party. Neither major party in New Zealand benefited from any second preferences those voters may have cast. In the final wash-up the Nationals got 48 per cent of the vote and 70 per cent of the seats. That is where the single member electorates, first past the post system gets us. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill appears to present an undesirable feature by using the party as a counting unit and as the unit for the allocation of seats. If so, candidates on party tickets would in effect be indirectly elected. They would not be chosen by the voters individually unless those voters supported the party ticket as a whole. In practice such a system would mean that voters would help elect party candidates they may dislike. This is a distortion of democracy for the purpose of maintaining power in the political party machine. Fortunately an electoral system like this could not be imposed on Federal electors because of section 24 of the Australian Constitution, which provides that the House of Representatives must be composed of members directly chosen by the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes to allow the new ACT Government to determine future electoral systems. The more cynical in the community could be forgiven for thinking that the purpose of this Bill is to secure a Labor majority at the next election through the first past the post voting system, and then revert to single member electorates, establishing a winner take all regime for Labor with all seats in the ACT. In any case, there are obvious dangers in any electoral system which can be changed at the discretion of the ruling group of the day without the consent of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> This was well demonstrated in Germany in the 1930s and in Queensland in the 1950s, and even in the National Roads and Motorists Association. In truth, it is regrettable that all of history demonstrates that it is not possible for ruling groups to resist the temptation to distort electoral systems in favour of themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The setting up of a democratic system for the ACT is, or should be, a program of long term vision. To be fair, the present Government and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in particular have put the long term view on the agenda in many areas, even if the detail does not often match the rhetoric. But in taking the long term view, the electoral system for the ACT Government is a relatively minor, though important, aspect of the future democratic system. </PARA>
<PARA> But I guess the question that should be asked at first is: does Canberra need or want the city-state model that has been foisted upon it? I think if we asked the people the answer would, at the moment, be very much no. But there are many options that could have been chosen. The present model adds to the already vast level of overgovernment in Australia, and it has a mind-boggling sized bureaucracy which is far out of proportion to the number of people it purports to serve. But those people have to pay for it, and they will pay increasingly in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Another option would be to `disappear' the ACT as a separate entity and to include it in New South Wales. After all, it is only a century-old parochial compromise. Of course, I am quite sure that there would have to be a referendum under the Constitution. I can say now that the people of Australia would vote overwhelmingly to disappear the ACT boundaries. Normal local government could then be installed, and the State functions of the ACT could simply be part of the New South Wales system. This would be in line with what happens with the capitals of the vast majority of major countries of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Another option would be to install a local government, with the State functions carried out federally for a period of years, or even permanently. A variation of that could be that the State functions could be subcontracted to New South Wales, or arranged through some form of Federal-State cooperation. There are many options, and advantages and disadvantages, but by plunging into the present city-state model, as we did in 1988, with no real experience or history of democratic government by either the elected or the bureaucracy, it was a sure-fire recipe for disaster-which is what has occurred, at least in the public's view. </PARA>
<PARA> The option of installing local government for a period and then proceeding to some form of State government would give the virtue of at least having some experience in the whole business of government. But irrespective of whether the present city-state model or some other basic type of democratic government is installed, the mechanics of how to achieve it have been largely ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> These mechanisms and principles could be summarised as follows: the sovereignty of the people must be established, and the Government must reflect as accurately as possible the wishes of the people; the system must allow for stable government; it must provide checks and balances, and prevent domination by any one group; it must have an established level of representation which allows each individual to have some say in the decisions which affect them; and, most of all, it must have mechanisms for accountability. The present system in the ACT fails on almost all counts. </PARA>
<PARA> These principles have to be effected through the voting system structures and methods of establishing change to the system, and this has to be achieved with simplicity and with minimum cost. I deal first with the voting mechanism reflecting the wishes of the public. Every intelligent member of this House knows that only proportional voting systems can truly reflect a full cross-section of the public. If one rises above partisan considerations, the only valid argument against proportional voting systems-such as the Senate system or the Hare-Clark system-is stability of government. The fact is that proportional voting systems will never give us the majority government which the Westminster system demands. But, in my view, it is not the voting system which is wrong; it is the system of government that we have, which demands we have a majority in the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Westminster system-being one of the earliest systems in the world-is now the most antiquated. Many countries have found better systems. The Westminster system which now exists in England has to be the worst in the world-a unicameral system, first past the post voting, and five-year elections. It has had permanent minority government for years because of it. </PARA>
<PARA> With the spread of education and political activity around the world, this problem is now arising in a number of countries. The Westminster system is becoming unstable. We have seen the problem in Israel, which has proportional voting and basically the Westminster system. The same problem has arisen in India, and in Greece. With the rise of a diversity of opinion in Australia, our system will become increasingly unworkable. No government will ever control the Senate now unless the proportional voting system is changed. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures on voting indicate that 17 per cent of Australians did not vote for either major party at the last election. Increasingly things will be unworkable. The truth is that proportional voting-in other words, a system that really reflects the wishes of the people-is in basic conflict with the Westminster system. We have had a marvellous opportunity in the ACT to separate executive government from the legislature, and to go for the system which has been well-developed and has proved to be the most stable system in the world-that is, the American system with that separation of executive government and the legislature, whereby the President is the executive government and quite separate from Congress. With their system Americans have had elections every four years for nearly 200 years since George Washington. It is certainly the most stable in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the few great things we have developed in Australia, and I must say it is very surprising that it came out of Tasmania, is the absolutely brilliant Hare-Clark system. As soon as we can establish the system of separating the executive government and the legislature, it works brilliantly. Here in the ACT, where we have two Federal electorates, we would simply have seven members for each of those electorates. When we get a third, there will be 21 members. That ends gerrymandering of boundaries forever. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I rise to speak on the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill which conducted the inquiry into the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) electoral system during the life of the last Parliament. It was one of the most interesting, if not frustrating, exercises I have undertaken in my brief time as a member. The chief recommendation of the report of that Committee reflects the continuing problem which has plagued the Government and this Parliament in achieving an electoral system for the ACT, and that is the question of compromise. As a member of that Committee, my view was that the modified d'Hondt system was an absolute disaster. I do not know whether anyone can reasonably argue against that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The d'Hondt system itself is a European system, as the last speaker, the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), quite correctly pointed out. It is a system which is largely quite foreign to a Westminster system of government. Indeed, at least in the Australian context, in lower Houses the Westminster system has known only single member constituencies-with the exception of Tasmania-and, in the Senate, a form of proportional representation. A feature of the Westminster system is that it depends on a government securing a majority. That is the basis of the way government operates, and hence the main role of the electoral system is to present a parliament with a majority of members who can form a government. </PARA>
<PARA> The d'Hondt system in its pure form is a party list system. That is, there is no scope for the exchange of preferences from the particular party lists or individual list standings. Inasmuch as there is no exchange of preferences, it is a form of proportional representation, and mathematically it is a sound form in that the will of the people expressed in the voting between the various lists will reflect the voting intentions very clearly in terms of the numbers elected from the list. </PARA>
<PARA> Once there was some modification of that and an attempt to incorporate into the d'Hondt system a feature of our lower House system in this Parliament and in the majority of the State parliaments-that is, a preferential system-it was inevitable that it was not going to work. That was the obvious result of the election. It was not simply that it took such a long time to get a result, but it was clearly frustrating to the people of the ACT and a matter of some hilarity, I suppose, to the rest of Australia. The fact that this special part of Australia, which does not relate to anything that the rest of Australia really knows, should be subjected to this peculiar electoral system I suppose had some sort of ironic justice in which the rest of Australia took some delight. </PARA>
<PARA> But it was never going to work, and that was the bottom line. The modified d'Hondt system came about due to the failure of the Government, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats to be able to come to a conclusion as to what system should apply. Through trying to serve all masters by having some features suggested by each Party in the final legislation, the end result was an absolute farce, and it was treated that way by the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that stick in my mind about the evidence which was given before the Committee was a ballot paper which was sent to the Australian Electoral Commission. Honourable members will recall that there were 117 candidates in the election and the ballot paper was a monstrous thing of a few metres long. This particular voter sent his ballot paper in with each of the 117 voting squares coloured with a different texta colour. His message to the Electoral Commission was that he would not let his three-year-old son colour in the ballot paper because he was a bit worried that the son might have fluked a formal vote. One of the other features of the electoral system was to make sure that almost every vote was formal. People had to work really hard in order to get an informal vote. The voter had to be very deliberate to make it informal. If people let their pens loiter too long near a particular box, they could be almost certain their votes would be counted. </PARA>
<PARA> The end result, combined with the general reaction against the need for self-government by the population of the Capital Territory, led to the whole election, its result, the candidates and the various groups standing in the election to be simply a laughing stock. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence before the Committee was quite clear: that it is absolutely impossible to allow the modified d'Hondt system to be continued. If we are to have a party list system, then it must be pure d'Hondt. Once we start trying to attach features of other systems onto pure d'Hondt, the end result is unworkable. My personal view when taking evidence was that the ACT should have the same system which is enjoyed throughout most of Australia, and that is single member constituencies. I take on board very much some of the comments made by the honourable member for North Sydney, but inasmuch as his comments are valid they apply to the system of government in this country as a whole and cannot be limited to the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe the Westminster system should be reviewed; it is perhaps a matter which should be before the Prime Minister and the Premiers during the next decade when we hope to reform the system of government as we go into the next century. Many of the points the honourable member for North Sydney raised were valid, and I agree with a number of them, but we do not solve larger problems by trying to experiment with the electoral system of the Australian Capital Territory. I believe that if we are serious about these issues those matters should be addressed, firstly through the Premiers and the Prime Minister and then maybe through a constitutional convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though I believe in single member constituencies-and I believe a majority of the Labor members on the Committee believed in that-it was quite clear that the Opposition members were not going to cop such a result. At the end of the day, the Opposition parties believed that single member constituencies would return a very strong Labor majority in the ACT. I do not know whether that is right or wrong, but at the end of the day I think it is very misplaced because people are not stupid: they will vote against governments if governments are bad-we have seen that time and time again in our single member constituency systems throughout the various States and at the Commonwealth level-and the Government of the ACT would then reflect the will of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not resile from my support for single member constituencies for this system. But, given that the Opposition would not accept such a system, the Committee made an attempt-and I acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the then Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee)-to get a consensus, to try to overcome the problems that bedevilled this entire process from its inception. That is how the concept of a referendum arrived, but there were always going to be problems. </PARA>

That has a very real risk about it. It also flows from that that, even with the referendum, only two electoral systems were being proposed. At the end of the day it really should be up to the ACT Government to decide its own future.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take that interjection. The proposal allows a system for the next election and then proposes that the decisions go back to the ACT Government. After the whole process of sorry compromise, which has bedevilled this whole problem, the shadow Minister responsible for this area, Senator Parer, apparently reached an agreement with the Minister at the table as to what the proposal should be. That is what is reflected in this particular Bill, that is, that we should proceed with the d'Hondt system as it was initially proposed-without all these ludicrous modifications which make the thing unworkable-and then allow the ACT to decide its own fate, which I believe is a reasonable position-not perfect, but at least a reasonable end result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apparently, Senator Parer suffers from the problems which bedevil other shadow Ministers. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) got rolled when he took his proposal into the shadow Cabinet. The old idea about, `We are not real certain about the d'Hondt system; we want the exchange of preferences', was thrown around. Obviously, the lessons from the last election have been forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that the Opposition will be opposing this legislation. Of course, in the Senate no doubt it will be stopped. As the wheels turn we will go to the election with exactly the same system as we have at the moment. We will have the same ludicrous problems facing ACT electors. Maybe they will not be quite as extreme; maybe there will not be too many `sun-ripened tomatoes' standing this time. Who knows? In any event, they will be all the same problems and complications which resulted from the last election. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Bill before the House is not my first choice. However, I believe that it is a reasonable compromise, if I can again use that word. It is reasonable inasmuch as it will provide a simplified system which would work. It would actually allow d'Hondt to do what it was designed to do, and then the whole question could be decided by the ACT Government. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons I support the legislation before the House. The end result of this, with the Opposition opposing it, will mean again that a decision of this Parliament will be open to ridicule throughout the rest of Australia. The people of the ACT will be confronted with a ridiculous electoral system which is neither fish nor fowl, and the whole sorry episode will be repeated. No doubt there will be another inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I am pleased to say that I am not on that Committee, so I will not have to go through the whole matter again. I am very sorry that we cannot seem to come to grips with something which essentially should be a fairly simple matter. It is a very sad indictment of our system, to the extent that we cannot resolve this matter. The Minister's proposal is workable and I believe it should have the support of the House. </PARA>

A number of the things the honourable member for Fisher said were really quite extraordinary.

I am told by the honourable member for Fisher that the Government is putting up something it does not believe in. If the debates in this place are some sort of game in which the Government only puts up something that it believes will be supported, and as in this case the Government does not think it will be supported, why is the Government putting it up?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nothing is a total waste of time if we do not regard the Parliament with contempt, as the Government obviously does. If the Government has a fair proposition and it believes it can be argued-I know the arguments for single member constituencies and they are quite powerful; in this particular place they are not terribly powerful, actually, but they can be argued-why does it not put it up and argue it? If it does not want to do that it goes on to its second argument and says that it is up to the ACT Government. If it is up to the ACT Government and that is this Government's argument, why is the Bill that it has here tonight not designed to hand the issue over to the ACT Government? It is not. It is designed only to hand it over to the ACT Government after a subsequent election based on a system which the Government does not believe in. Where is the logic in that? I really do not know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next thing the honourable member for Fisher said is that this is a reasonable compromise. A reasonable compromise between whom, between which parties? It is the sort of compromise which the Government has predicted will not get through this Parliament because it will be blocked in the Senate. It is a reasonable compromise between which parties? I do not see the reasonableness of this compromise; it does not seem to be a compromise at all.</PARA>
<PARA> What is put up to us tonight is what was originally put up and was originally knocked back. We originally knocked it back. Why did we do that? Because it stopped people voting preferentially across party lines. That is why we knocked it back. I remember the arguments very well. I personally have followed very closely the whole development of self-government in the ACT over the years. I followed all the arguments. Regardless of what one thinks about self-government in the ACT or whether or not the form is right, the present Government in the ACT is doing a whole lot of things which previous arrangements have not been prepared to face up to. </PARA>
<PARA> I was formerly responsible for the health functions in the ACT. A lot of previous governments did not face up to those. I was in the process of facing up to them when we were thrown out. The present Government in the ACT is actually facing up to those things. This is a Government that is facing up to a lot of difficult issues, but the present Federal Government is not prepared to hand over to the current Legislative Assembly the job of deciding its own electoral system. It is not prepared to do that. It is putting up the original proposal, the unmodified d'Hondt. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that was knocked back in the first place-and let us understand this very clearly-was that it prevents a person from voting other than according to a party list. One cannot transfer preferences from one party to another or from an Independent to a party, or whatever. Let us get that absolutely clear. I am told that, according to all the statistics, the ACT is the most highly educated community in Australia--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr CARLTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am told that it is also the richest. It is a community of public servants, defence personnel, academics and others in private enterprise. The people of the ACT are perfectly capable of looking at all the details of these things and understanding them. There is also an overwhelming concentration of media attention on these issues. Those of us who come down here and turn on our radios in the morning get much more local information about things than we ever get in our capital cities and country areas. Everybody is much better informed here. Yet we have this unbelievably thick-headed proposal put forward by the Government which prevents people from voting across party lines, preferentially. It is quite astonishing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People such as the honourable member for Fisher say that the system is not what the Government would really like: it would really like a system of single member constituencies, but it does not think it could get that through, and it believes that it should be up to the ACT Government, or whoever has the majority in the Assembly, to decide for itself. That is not in the legislation. That has been delayed until after the election. If the Government really believed that it would have put it up now. Then I am told that this legislation is a reasonable compromise. It is clearly not a reasonable compromise. It goes back to the original, totally unsatisfactory proposal. Therefore, the Opposition is perfectly justified in opposing it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other elements in the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill to which attention should be given. I am told by my colleague the shadow Minister that the drafting of the Bill has been very difficult and that it is a bit of a mess. As to the actual drafting and the amendments that we might like to make to make it more sensible, I understand we will be looking at that in the Senate. We cannot look at it in this House because it is almost impossible to look at anything sensibly in this place. I recall having to respond to 250 pages of taxation legislation over the course of a weekend. If it had not been for the Senate that legislation would never have been looked at satisfactorily. Under this Government hardly a single thing is examined sensibly in this House. A government which cannot run Question Time in this House, which has no idea of democracy as it applies to the House of Representatives, is putting up some half-baked list system from Belgium, or wherever, which does not allow sensible, intelligent and informed people to vote across party lines, to vote for independents. </PARA>

We are simply not prepared to put up with it. I am pleased that the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) has indicated his opposition to it. I am quite confident that the other independent and party members in the Senate will take a similar view and the thing will become consigned to the dust heap from which it should never have emerged.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important to look back a little at the reasons for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) having self-government. Many of my friends in the ACT have said to me, `Why did you give it to us when we didn't want it, when we voted against it?'. Having served on the Joint Standing Committee on the Australian Capital Territory from 1983 to 1987, I am able to tell people why this Federal Parliament wanted them to have self-government. One of the problems we have is that the Parliament was not frank with the people of the ACT about the reasons for their having self-government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On that Committee we had to deal with very interesting things. I am interested in and like town planning issues, but I felt all the time-and I am sure members from Queensland and Western Australia felt the same-that we should not be making decisions on pedestrian crossings near the Kaleen school. I felt we should not be making decisions about the shy birds along the Molonglo River. We were making these sorts of decisions. Witnesses from the ACT appeared before us because, in a democracy, eventually people have to go to some elected people, and the elected people for the ACT were the people I have mentioned-myself and people from New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people have no right to make town planning decisions for the people of the ACT. So in the end it was not what the people of the ACT wanted but what the Federal Parliament wanted, and we were not frank about it. We did not make it clear enough to the people of the ACT that we did not feel we should be dealing with these issues. There might have been a less juvenile approach by the ACT people if we had made clear to them and helped them understand the reasons for their having self-government. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought at the time that this was an ideal opportunity for the people of the ACT to show the people of Australia how a local government should be. I thought that an ideal number of members for the local government in the ACT would be perhaps five or seven. But no, we had the political parties in the ACT all wanting to get people up and there had to be a lot more. I do not think that the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) would mind my saying that when he was Minister for Territories he said he felt that nine would be enough. But no, they had to have 19 members-I think that is the current figure-so that the political parties could get a few people elected. Having served the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in the ACT for about a year and a half while I was building a farm in New South Wales, I know that there are plenty of ambitious people in the political parties in the ACT. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not just in the ACT. But there are plenty of competent, ambitious people in the ACT: I will pay them that compliment. Naturally they wanted a chance to be elected to something so they advocated what I thought was an excessively large local government. I also felt that, as well as perhaps a commission of five or seven well-paid members, they should be elected by proportional representation, by the Hare-Clark system that existed in Tasmania. But, when one thinks about it, we have already given the ACT what it did not want, which is self-government, for very good reasons from the point of view of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can recall a truckie getting 100 Dexedrine tablets on prescription in the ACT because this Parliament could not get around to introducing legislation such as existed in all the States under which Dexedrine tablets were not available without a very special permit. So truckies came to the ACT and took advantage of the fact that the Parliament was too slow in getting around to fixing up all the ordinances that it had to attend to. That was the sort of problem that existed. </PARA>
<PARA> It was unrealistic to expect this Parliament to govern the ACT competently. That is what we should have said to the people. So, having given them self-government, which they did not want, let us not tell them what sort of system they should have in electing that government. We should leave it entirely to the people of the ACT. The least we can do is give them the system they want. Living out at Queanbeyan next to the big elephant one gets to know what the people here want, and they want single member electorates. It does not matter whom one talks to-whether it is a driver, a shopkeeper, someone serving in a shop or a public servant-they all want single member electorates. That to them is a system they understand and it is a system that operates in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If the people want single member electorates perhaps we should give them a referendum and let them have a choice. Surely the people are entitled to select the system they want. I know that there have been objections to the single member electorates. I prefer the Hare-Clark system-I always have. I would prefer that it operated right throughout Australia. But I know people have objected to that, saying that it would entrench the Australian Labor Party. That is quite wrong. Anyone who has been in local government knows that by the time we get to electorates of about 10,000 people the Independents start to come up. I think that members of political parties are not nearly as prepossessing as they think. We would find that in smaller electorates active local Independents-like the honourable member for North Sydney in his electorate-would be elected. That is what happens in local government and that is what would happen in this case-the best people would be elected in a system of that type. I would not guarantee that ALP government would be entrenched through single member electorates; in fact I doubt very much that it would. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for North Sydney tackled a few issues concerning the type of government that should exist. I do not really agree with him that the United States system would be satisfactory in Australia. I think there is quite a lot of conflict between the executive and the legislature in that system-so much conflict that I believe that the American Administration is having a lot of problems tackling its deficit for that reason. The legislature may want more spending on community services and welfare, for instance, and the executive may want far less spending in that area and perhaps more spending on defence. That is the sort of conflict that one gets. </PARA>
<PARA> Here in the ACT we could have a model for local government throughout Australia. Australia has too many levels of government-three levels is too many. Here we could show that local government could work really well. I believe that it will work; I am confident that in a few years time when the ACT gets over having self-government pushed on to it, it will become responsible pretty quickly and show Australia what local government should be like. But I firmly believe that we should let the people of the ACT-not us-pick the system and we should let them sort it out for themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try to be brief in my remarks tonight, given the other pressing matters that are due to come before the House. But I wanted to respond to a few comments made by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) and the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton). The honourable member for North Sydney made one comment which has stuck in my memory; that was the comment that `it was not possible for ruling groups to resist distorting electoral systems to benefit themselves'-I hope I have quoted the honourable member accurately. I can accept that there is an element of truth in that because the electoral system which the people of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) were forced to use at the first election for self-government was not a system that my Party foisted upon them for our benefit. It was a system foisted upon the people of the ACT because the Liberal Party of Australia knew that it had no chance of getting the majority of the votes. It then set about coming up with a system which brought in a form of proportional representation because it thought that that would benefit the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Independently of that, the Australian Democrats-the great men and women of principle-came to the conclusion that it was in their direct electoral interests also to bring in a system of proportional representation because they thought that with a small proportion of the vote and the right system of proportional representation they would get one or two seats and perhaps hold the balance of power; that would serve their interests. So when the honourable member says that `it is not possible for ruling groups to resist distorting electoral systems to benefit themselves', as long as he includes members of the Senate as members of the ruling group, then I am prepared to accept that proposition. The system which the people of the ACT ended up with was forced upon this Government and the people of the ACT by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Party has made it clear all along-and the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) has reaffirmed it in his second reading speech-that it believes that the best system for the people of the ACT is the system of single member electorates; the same system which is used to elect members of the House of Representatives, the people's house of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> While I agree with that comment by the honourable member for North Sydney, he made a few other comments with which I have to take issue. He described the current d'Hondt system as a winner-take-all system and a first past the post system and he used another series of descriptions which I do not think accurately describe d'Hondt. D'Hondt is a system of proportional representation. If someone were to have more than 5.6 per cent of the vote, I think it is, under the system proposed by the Minister that person would be pretty well guaranteed election. In fact, I think it is possible for a person to get as little as 4 per cent or less of the vote and still be elected as the last member of the ACT Assembly. To say that that is a system of winner-take-all is not a fair description of either d'Hondt or the modified d'Hondt system. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for North Sydney went on to say that he would consider `disappearing the ACT into New South Wales'-I think that was the expression he used-or he would sub-contract State functions of the ACT to New South Wales. I would have a problem with that, but other members might be attracted to that idea. I think the people of the ACT have the right to decide whether they have whiz bins or whether a road should be built in Woden and so on. I do not think it would be right to `disappear' the ACT into New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that was an accurate reflection of the honourable member's comments. Perhaps he meant to disappear State functions into the State of New South Wales and allow local government functions to be administered by an Assembly government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for North Sydney went on to say that only a proportional voting system could truly reflect the will of the people, but he conceded that there were problems in ever getting a stable majority government under such a system. The response I would make is that certainly in these tough economic times countries, States, city states such as Canberra and even local governments need strong governments or councils to make the tough economic decisions that are in the long term interests of those countries, States or bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United States where no-one controls the Congress, where the party system is not well-developed and where people breach party discipline regularly they cannot reach agreement on the tough budgetary decisions that need to be made in the interests of the United States. If we look at countries in Europe where proportional representation is well-established, we see that it is often very hard for the governments to maintain their majorities because they have built up coalitions of many parties in order to form a minority government. It is very hard to make those tough economic decisions that need to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I make is that if one looks at countries like Israel or Germany, where there are proportional representational systems, one finds that there is a great deal of power in the hands of the party bureaucrats who decide the order of people on the list which is submitted by their Party to the electors. I believe that under a system of single member electorates there is greater flexibility for a popular, hard-working, local member-whether that person is an Independent or member of a party-to break the system and break into the Parliament. In Germany or Israel if a person's particular faction or group does not have influence in the party machine that person cannot get up high enough on the party list to be elected under proportional representation.</PARA>
<PARA> Dare I say that if we looked at the members of the Senate I think we would find that a large number of them have graduated into that chamber through experience in the party machines in the various States. I think that if one looks around this House one can see that there is a much more highly developed sense of members representing their own local area and the development of contacts within their own electorates. I think that is one of the strongest arguments in favour of single member electorate systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for North Sydney went on to say that he favours the American system of government where the executive is separated from the legislature. He said that the system of having a President and an elected Congress was the most stable in the world. The members of the House of Representatives and the Senate in the United States represent single member electorates and they are elected, dare I say it, with a first past the post system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for North Sydney says that that is what is wrong with the American system, so I hope I was correct when I heard him say it was the most stable system of government in the world and that he believed it was a system which was working well. That is an example of single member electorates and people elected by a first past the post system where, if people vote for minority candidates, their preferences do not even count. They are the comments I make in a good-hearted manner to the honourable member for North Sydney because I was very interested in the comments that he made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mackellar directed some comments to this side of the House, suggesting that it was extraordinary that the Government was putting up something that it did not believe in. The honourable member for Mackellar is as responsible as any other member of this Parliament for the fact that this legislation is before the House. The honourable member for Mackellar is an active participant and a very influential member of the shadow Cabinet, no doubt. He believes-and he said it here tonight-that the modified d'Hondt system, which was used at the last election in the ACT, is better than the alternative put up by the Minister in this legislation. I hope that I am being accurate, because that is what he said. I do not know whether he realises that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mackellar says that he knows because he knows how the system works. In evidence before the Committee we were told by the expert Australian Electoral Commission that in fact only two people in all Australia understood how that modified d'Hondt system worked and were able accurately to count that result, certainly with lots of people carrying out their directions. At that time only two people in all of Australia could have done that job and I doubt that the honourable member for Mackellar was one of those two people, though I stand to be corrected. I am sure that while the rules of modified d'Hondt might be becoming a distant nightmare for the Electoral Commission's staff since it was some time ago that they had to count all those votes, I am sure that with a lot of training and effort they will be able to ensure that at least two new people will understand the modified d'Hondt system if the Opposition is successful in blocking these sensible reforms which the Minister has before the House today.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is a system which certainly does not allow any flexibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is that the Opposition is on the record as saying that it will block any attempts by the Australian Labor Party to put up single member electorates, which is the system of government which all the opinion polls show is what the people of the ACT want.

<PARA> That is good, but the Liberal Party members of the ACT Assembly have to explain to their voters that the honourable member for MacKellar and all his friends will ensure that modified d'Hondt, the electoral system that people had to put up with at the last election, might be the system that they have to use for the next election of the ACT Assembly. That will be for one reason only, which is that the Opposition is not prepared to adopt the sensible amendments that this Minister and this Government have put before the House tonight in an attempt to undo some of the ridiculous amendments that were foisted on this Government through Senate obstructionism in the last Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Australian Capital Territory Electoral Amendment Bill 1991. It is perhaps a little unusual for an extra member of the Ministry to come to the dispatch box on an issue such as this, but I do have a particular interest in this matter and I wanted to take the opportunity, in part at least, to congratulate the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) on bringing close to conclusion an excellent bit of legislation which required some considerable skill and effort in the process. I have a particular interest in issues going to our voting systems. I want to take this opportunity to talk, and not at too much length, about the issue of so-called compulsory voting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that the issue was raised by the shadow Minister, Senator Parer. I am not sure whether he is batting on with that proposed amendment in the Senate but, in any event, given that it is now a matter for contemporary political debate, whether it is from Senator Parer or from Nick Greiner, who raised the issue in a more general sense, I wanted to take the opportunity of making some comments. </PARA>
<PARA> The paper circulated by Senator Parer was headed `Why Not the Freedom of Voluntary Voting?'. My response to that would be: why not indeed! Of course it should be apparent to even a cursory observer of the Australian political process that in this country we do not have now nor have we ever had this thing called compulsory voting. We have had optional voting in the past and what we now have is a system that provides for citizens to respond to the duty to attend at a polling booth on a periodic date determined for elections; they do not come rushing at us all that regularly, notwithstanding the concerns about the number of Federal and State elections, and so on. But infrequently, citizens of this country are asked to attend at a polling booth, to take receipt of a ballot paper and to have their names struck off the roll. Then at that point they can elect to do whatever they will with the ballot paper. It is obviously the case that on occasions a number of people do elect, for whatever reason-and usually I would suspect by way of a protest about the political system in this country-to cast an informal vote. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a huge philosophical leap to argue that we have compulsory voting. In a democratic society we have compulsion of a greater or lesser degree in every aspect of life as we live it. We have a compulsion to drive on the left-hand side of the road, a compulsion to send our children to school until a certain age and a compulsion most regularly abided by on this side of the House-perhaps less so on the other-to pay taxes. And on it goes. </PARA>
<PARA> There are numerous-sometimes subtle, sometimes quite explicit-forms of compulsion, so we should not get too hung up on the word `compulsion'. We should look, I think, at the issues in relation to our voting system in a much more general way. Over the last decades in Australia, I think the number of informal votes-which seems to me to be perhaps one of the most obvious criteria against which a concern should be measured for the voting system or, possibly, even the compulsory attendance-has been shown to be quite small. By way of illustration, at the last Federal election for the House of Representatives the informal vote was about 3 per cent. That has of course varied. At times, by dint of changes to the voting system, there has been confusion. Periodically, there is a rise in informal votes that one can attribute to hostility aimed at the major parties or in relation to particular issues. But all of that, I would have thought, was quite manageable and, indeed, quite expected and really just part of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Way back in our history, we can look at the voting levels before the introduction of compulsory attendance. For example, in 1922, the turnout was 58 per cent of voters-which of itself is, I think, quite a good figure. The introduction of compulsory voting caused voter turnout to rise from 46.9 per cent at its lowest, ranging through to 47.7 per cent, to now being always over 90 per cent and usually above 95 per cent at Federal elections. At the time the legislation was introduced, there was no substantive disagreement in this House about the desirability of having that outcome and, broadly speaking, in the decades intervening there has been quite strong implicit and sometimes explicit support for the continuation of the system as we now know it. Indeed, Lindsay Smith, in his book entitled Compulsory Voting in Australia, commented:</PARA>
<PARA>The reaction of the public has been one of massive approval and insignificant opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>There are of course a number of arguments in favour of Australia's present voting system. I think one of the key arguments is that `democratic government' means or should mean majority rule, which should in turn mean `opinion by a majority of voters'. I have already indicated that voting, in my view, is analogous to a range of other duties incumbent on citizens: giving evidence in court proceedings; jury service; paying rates, et cetera. I regard voting as perhaps the most important or one of the most important civic duties, and yet citizens are not called upon so frequently as to make it appear an irksome burden. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already indicated that there is no compulsion to actually cast a vote. One can attend at the booth and then, having been struck off the roll, one can do basically what one likes. Casting an informal vote of itself seems to me to be a measure of voter attitude which is quite important in how this particular Parliament assesses how it is doing its job. A measure of that is that informal voting system. I do not want to make too much of that point, but I think it is one that should not be ignored. The compulsion to attend has the benefit of having people sit down and think about political issues before they do go and cast their vote. As Plato would have it, it is not a system where only those who have allegedly the intellectual capacity are entitled to vote. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons I shy away from that somewhat elitist view is that in my experience before coming to this place-and I might add since-an awful lot of wisdom and commonsense is vested in people who may not have high levels of education and who, indeed, may not have a particularly sophisticated knowledge of the political process or even of the policies of the day. But there is an intuitive commonsense in many people that should not be discouraged in terms of finding its way or putting its message through the ballot box. </PARA>
<PARA> There are arguments of course against compulsory voting. The argument most often put is that it is an infringement of civil liberties. I think I have addressed in philosophical terms the argument of whether we are actually forcing people to vote. It is clear under our system that we are not doing that. Compulsion cannot ensure a formal or intelligent vote-and it is worth pointing out that nor can any other system. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a range of other issues. I will not go into them in too much detail, but I think it is worth making the point that where it has been alleged that compulsory voting-it should be `attendance', but it is referred to as `compulsory voting'-has become `a sacred cow on the Australian political landscape', perhaps it is. I am usually quite open to debate and I am on this occasion. I think this is an important area for debate, as indeed is the whole electoral system. But when we talk about sacred cows, we certainly should not be stampeded into change. From what I know, there has been little beef about the system over all these years. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the key points, continuing these rather laboured puns, is that-and I think a cursory understanding of the United States political process will tend to confirm this view-the need to provide significant resources to get out the vote does give a disproportionate power to lobby groups and other vested interest groups. I have had a discussion with people from the United States political process, and a very great concern that they have about their own political system is the fact that members of their House of Representatives are in fact full time fund-raisers for the purpose of, in large measure, ensuring that they have the capacity to get the vote out, in their case every couple of years. I think that is a very great danger to this chamber. We have enough problems as it is with the increasing inability of political parties to raise the funds that are really required for running elections of the type that we now experience. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Parer raised the issue of not having an engendered respect for the right to vote because we have made it, in his terms, `an irksome obligation'. In the last few years I have had the opportunity of travelling to different countries as part of delegations looking at the process leading up to elections in those countries. The last country I visited was Taiwan, which obviously has a system moving to a more democratic framework. It is very interesting that at the last election Taiwan very successfully discharged its electoral responsibilities. I think that brings home very clearly and sharply-and it is certainly the case if one has some experience of other political systems throughout the world-the extent to which people in other countries have not the opportunity to participate, and it makes me think a little more deeply about the role of people in our own democratic system and how that ought to be encouraged and in no way, shape or form discouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> The right to vote, the right to participate in democratic processes, in this country is regarded as sacrosanct, and it ought to remain that way. Having said that, I think it is important to restate the point that we should not shy away from debating these issues. The ability to discuss these issues when we have the opportunity will of itself engender support for our democratic process, no matter how that is manifested in particular voting systems. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Australian Labor Party, my own Party, would be, in many respects, advantaged by a move towards non-compulsory attendance. Our Party has been very well organised; it has always had the ability to gather sufficient support and to organise support that would enable it to do relatively better in this area than other political parties. It is also the case that this might infuse not only the Labor Party but also other parties; that is, there would be a clear requirement for people to pay much more attention to recruiting and that can have some very great positives not only for the Labor Party but for all parties. That is why I am not frightened of non-compulsory attendance, in a party political sense. Having said that, I still think we run the risk of encountering the problems that I adverted to earlier. So I do not mind having this debate and I do not think the Labor Party would in any way, shape or form be disadvantaged by the move along these lines. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose another response I have is really one that would often come from the Opposition, not from the Labor Party-that if something is not broken, why fix it? Is there such apparent hostility to our current system? Is there some sort of upsurge in support for change in the community? If there is, then I must be deaf, at least to what my constituents are saying. As is the case with all members of Parliament, I meet hundreds of people a week. For many years now I cannot recall anyone having raised with me the issue of compulsory attendance. People have raised with me the issue of how well or how badly my Party is doing. Sometimes they have been happy and sometimes they have been sad; sometimes they have been supportive and sometimes they have been vitriolic. But in all the issues that have been raised, I can honestly say that no-one has ever raised with me the compelling need to move away from a system that ensures that in this country we have a very commendable turnout. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also worth making the point that around 95 per cent of people turn up to vote; that leaves, by definition, about 5 per cent of people who do not turn up. Is the compulsory nature of attendance so burdensome or is the pain to be suffered by not turning out so significant that that would engender hostility? Again, I suspect not. </PARA>
<PARA> When I first came into Parliament I was on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Reform. One thing which I quite vividly recall is that when there was a discussion-and this was driven by a concern that elderly Australians were finding it difficult to fulfil these requirements-about the desirability of otherwise of having elderly people taken off the roll with a consequent ability for them--</PARA>

Another concern I have is that regardless of which political parties are advantaged or disadvantaged by these changes-and it seems to me that in raising these issues there is at least some consideration given to the party political advantage-we clearly run the risk of some sections of our community not participating. I think that those issues can be readily identified. They will have a different impact across the political spectrum and by and large I think they will compensate for each other. But there are some people in our community who do not have a lot of ability to influence outcomes and I think that the ability to participate in the political process, even though it is often accompanied by complaints and so on, is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am glad that the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) has come into the chamber, because it gives me an opportunity to raise some other electoral matters that went to his predecessor. I want to ask whether he has paid the $250,000 yet. I conclude by saying that I do genuinely come to the table not in any party political sense-although I do concede that that last comment, incited by my friend the Leader of the National Party, might be properly construed that way. But in general terms, the issues are very important. They are not put in a party political sense. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-One of the first tasks that I had when I assumed this ministerial responsibility after the 1990 general election was to consider the implications of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Reform on the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) electoral system. Uppermost in my mind at the time-and I know that this view is shared by the shadow Minister for administrative services, local government and the ACT, Senator Parer-was that the result of the 1989 election within the ACT did not bring a great deal of credit to parliamentary democracy within this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As this Parliament had responsibility for the creation of the ACT electoral system, this Parliament should take some responsibility for rectifying some of the clear deficiencies that were evidenced during the 1989 election here in the ACT. I have to say at the outset that I acted from the point of view of trying to deal with this issue in very much a bipartisan way. A great deal of similar support was provided to me by Senator Parer in those early days. We both took the view that parliamentary democracy, as such, was not particularly well served by what occurred here in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I also acknowledge the point that in 1989, when the first elections were held in the ACT, many people here treated the electoral system with a great deal of contempt. While it is true to say that this system was not one which this Government sought-we were always of the view that single member constituencies were the appropriate model to use within the ACT-we were forced to operate within a system where amendments were forced upon the Government by the Opposition parties within the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, a certain degree of contempt was shown by ACT voters for the electoral system. To some extent, if any lesson has been learned out of the 1989 election here in the ACT, it is that parliamentary democracy is indeed a very fragile thing. In 1989, for example, we saw people in eastern Europe being prepared to die, to put their lives at risk, to have a stake in parliamentary democracy. I hope that as a result of what occurred in 1989-irrespective of what system is eventually used within the ACT-people in the ACT will take this system very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the contributions made by honourable members during this debate. I would like to deal with the comments of the various speakers in order of their contributions. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) had the responsibility in this House for the Opposition views that were obviously supported within the party room today following the shadow Cabinet's consideration of discussions that Senator Parer and I had had in recent months. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that there was a great deal of confusion in 1989 because of the size of the ballot paper; it is true that there was a very large informal vote at the 1989 election; and it is true that it took approximately nine weeks to determine an outcome. In fact, it is for all those reasons that, in seeking to deal with those problems, I sought to look at a way in which it might be possible to resolve those complications and to take into account some of the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that the Government felt it was able to accept. </PARA>
<PARA> In responding to the honourable member for Wannon, I would like to repeat some of the points that many speakers have made during this debate. Clearly, the modified d'Hondt was the Government's third choice. We had this confusion, this large informality and this length of time taken to count the vote as a result of the Opposition's obstructions to the Government's proposals in 1988. The clear intention of the Government all along was to have single member constituencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue that was raised by the honourable member for Wannon referred to the closure of postal votes on election night. I can say that the Government is reasonably relaxed about that proposal, but again, in some of the discussions that were held in a preliminary way before the matter was considered by the shadow Cabinet, I was of the view from Senator Parer's comments that the Opposition wanted such a proposal to be incorporated in the legislation. So, in the bipartisan that way I sought to address this issue, I made that proposal-largely at the instigation of a number of people within the Opposition parties during those discussions last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wannon talked about the difficulties of the scrutiny in 1989. The eight stages of scrutiny that occurred during the 1989 ballot largely resulted from problems associated with the provision of cross-party preferences. These cross-party preferences are now sought again by the Opposition, and yet at the same time the Opposition seeks to complain about the lengthy delays in counting the first election. I think there is a certain inconsistency in the Opposition's views in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) has had a very long and obvious interest in this proposal as his division includes approximately half of the ACT. He went through a great deal of the history of this Bill and pointed to the issues of Opposition obstructionism that I have just outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) raised some interesting points, and I think his reflections upon the nature of parliamentary democracy were very well addressed indeed by my colleague the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee). However, there is one issue that I would like to develop further from the points that were made by the honourable member for Dobell. The honourable member for North Sydney said that the system we are proposing to introduce would in fact favour the big parties. I point out that this is quite untrue because the new system, if it were introduced, would see people elected with a very small proportion of first preference votes. </PARA>
<PARA> As an indication of this, I advise the House that the Australian Electoral Commission applied an analysis to the 1989 ACT election revealing what would have occurred if this new system had been in operation. The results would have been as follows: the Australian Labor Party would have had five candidates elected; the Liberal Party would have had three; the No Self-Government Party would have had two, as would the Residents Rally; and the Abolish Self-Government Coalition would have had one, as would also the Fair Elections Coalition, the Independent Haslem, the ACT Community Party and Bill Mackey. Is that a system that is designed to entrench large parties? I suggest that the views of the honourable member for North Sydney are clearly out of step with the reality of the situation. In that sense, from his comments, I think he also fails to understand that the ACT electoral system based on a d'Hondt system is in fact a form of proportional representation. Clearly, he forgot that in making his comments. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciated the comments of the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) as well because he was a member of the Joint Standing Committee that considered this matter. Again, he took the very sensible view that the system is a compromise. I made the same point in my second reading speech. For the life of me, I cannot see any point in standing up and introducing legislation when we know that it has no chance of passing successfully through both Houses of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the Cabinet decision of 14 September last year was predicated on the notion that this legislation would proceed subject to an assurance that it would enjoy passage through both Houses of Parliament. I have proceeded on that basis because in my discussions with Senator Parer I believed-and still believe, I might say-that his intentions were honourable and that our preliminary discussions certainly had the same objectives in mind, but at the end of the day he was not able to convince his shadow Cabinet and his party room today. I think it is unfortunate that we could not reach the sort of consensus and compromise that the honourable member for Fisher talked about. </PARA>
<PARA> In some respects, those issues that I have just mentioned go to the heart of the comments that the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) responded to during his contribution, and to that extent I simply repeat that there is no point, as far as I am concerned, in putting up some sort of notion, even though the Government believes that single member constituencies are an appropriate electoral vehicle for dealing with the ACT, if we know, given the fact that the Government does not have a majority in the Senate, that that proposition would not be supported. That is not to suggest that we do not, in a philosophical way, support that notion. </PARA>
<PARA> The contribution of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) goes to the heart of his very longstanding interest in public administration in Australia. Indeed, he is on record on a number of occasions, including in some of the private members' debates in this House, as supporting an enhanced position for regional and local government within Australia. I have some sympathy for that view but, probably like the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, I am also realistic enough to know that, given the way in which any State government is likely to follow its own instincts for self-preservation, we are unlikely to see the stage where we will have a very strong federal system, a strong system of regional government and the elimination of State governments. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe, though, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro does, that the people of the ACT probably do want single member constituencies, and I would have been very privileged to have been able to introduce legislation to support that particular contention; but again for the reasons I have outlined that has been impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> Once more the honourable member for Dobell has made a very thoughtful contribution to this debate. Again, his experience as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters came to the fore in his contribution. As always, in a range of debates dealing with electoral matters, his contribution is valued. </PARA>
<PARA> The contribution of the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) was interesting. He is interested for the very same reasons as my colleagues who contributed during this debate, such as the honourable member for Dobell and the honourable member for Fisher-that is, his own very longstanding interest in electoral matters. I do not see any problem with any member of this House, be he a Minister or simply a member, making a contribution on any debate if he has a particular interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that the contribution on the notion of compulsory voting was very thoughtful. I was pleased to hear the Minister acknowledge some work done on the notions of compulsory voting by a very good friend of mine, the late Lindsay Smith, who was a lecturer in politics at the Mitchell College of Advanced Education in Bathurst for a number of years. That sort of contribution from time to time is useful. It was done in a way which allowed honourable members on both sides of this House to think about some of the issues which have been raised. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed in Senator Parer's media commentary today that he indicated that the coalition would support reforms proposed by the all-party parliamentary committee which inquired into the ACT electoral system-namely, the increase in deposits from $100 to $250 to be paid by candidates; the tightening of the requirements for the registration of political parties; and the prevention of individuals from being the registered agent of more than one political party. Those requirements, if adopted by both Houses of Parliament, would certainly strengthen the current position within the ACT, irrespective of the electoral system introduced at the 1992 elections. To that extent I thank the Opposition for the indication that it has no problems with those particular amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The simplified formality rules also come about because of the complications which arose over definitions of formality and informality during the counting of the 1989 election. I pay tribute at this stage to the work of the officers of the Australian Electoral Commission who, in conjunction with my department, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, drafted some of the proposals which are before the House tonight. They played a very important role, and their expertise and knowledge in regard to this particular legislation over a very long period of time have certainly been very useful. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government sincerely hopes that the Opposition may have some second thoughts about its intentions today, as indicated by the Opposition shadow Minister. On no occasion have I sought in any way, during the development of this legislation, to develop something which is going to favour any political party. I repeat that Senator Parer's discussions with me had a very similar objective. Our discussions prior to this decision by the Opposition parties clearly indicated that there was a degree of goodwill which existed between the two of us as far as the development of these proposals was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> On that basis I would in fact ask the Opposition to think seriously about this. The last thing I want to see happen at the February 1992 elections in the ACT is for us to go through a process whereby we have to wait another eight or nine weeks for the Electoral Commission to count the votes under a system which is clearly discredited in the eyes of many people within the ACT and, I would believe, clearly discredited in the view of many people within this House. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is proposing this legislation on that basis. But in concluding I would remind all honourable members that the decision to proceed with this legislation is made on the basis that we hope that there will be a clear indication of bipartisan support when the issue is debated in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Question put:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have received information today that the Australian Government recruiting office has placed advertisements in next Saturday's newspapers for the recruitment into the Australian Public Service of new employees. Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) offices will open at 8 a.m. next Monday and Tuesday to handle the flood of inquiries. In case honourable members want to advise all their constituents in advance about this great employment opportunity, we asked our CES how many jobs were available. The answer was, `Not many'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are not very many jobs available in Australia today. My local CES office, next door to my electorate office, has recorded the second highest increase in unemployment in Australia. It is devastating. On top of that unemployment increase, all of a sudden we have a problem in my electorate with a thing called potato blight. That means that potato producers in a significant area of La Trobe are no longer able to sell their potatoes in New South Wales. </PARA>

The Treasurer (Mr Keating) came in here today and, along with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-and, I believe, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in the other place-offered us all kinds of platitudes about what we are going to do to encourage Australia to become more productive. We are going to do it all in 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996, but we are not going to do anything today, are we?</PARA>
<PARA> Last September one of my constituents, whose name was Petra Cozens, from the Patch in Victoria, was rather indignant. She wrote a letter to the Treasurer and said, `Could you please tell me where our country is now financially, how are we going to overcome our current financial crisis and where will we be in 12 months time?'. That was last September, and it is now March. My constituent has not yet received an answer from the Treasurer. I suggest that the answer that she will receive will be just about as good as the answer that we got on the floor of the House today from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and in that other place from Senator Button. There is not much hope. </PARA>
<PARA> We tell small businesses to pull their socks up, retrench a few more employees and not worry about their sons, just let the high interest rates continue to kill all of their employment and all of their business possibilities in the near future. Australians are hurting. We heard in the debate on the matter of public importance today about how Australians are hurting in the bush. You bet your life they are hurting in the bush! My rural community in La Trobe is hurting badly now. It is devastated. It is an absolutely cruel joke that the Government would stoop so low as to place an advertisement in the newspaper to say, `We're going to increase employment in the public service'. How many jobs will be available? Not many. That is not much hope for our constituents. </PARA>
<PARA> How about some real micro-economic reforms? Why do we not talk about real reform in the labour market? Why do we not do something about really encouraging the productive enterprises in this country to get off their backsides and produce something? We should give them the opportunity to negotiate with their employees to have enterprise agreements and to have voluntary union membership, and let us see whether we can raise productivity 30 per cent, 40 per cent, or 50 per cent or 300 per cent, as the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) described for us last week in his speech to the National Press Club. Would a rise in productivity of 300 per cent not be magnificent? We do not need many of our enterprises to indicate some kind of increase of employment much over 30 per cent for us to be home and hosed. If we do not raise our level of productivity to something like 4 per cent of gross national product we cannot even hold the level of international debt that we have now. How on earth are we going to get it down? At the moment I understand that over 25 per cent of everything that Australia earns goes towards paying interest rates to other countries for the goods and services that we have bought in the past. That is disgusting. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer ought to come back in here now and revise his statement of today and give us some real answers on what he can do to bring Australia out of the depths of the worst recession that we have seen in the last 30 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had the pleasure on Sunday of unveiling the plaque for a 40-bed nursing hostel for aged people in the suburb of Klemzig in South Australia. The site was previously-in fact, it still is-an almond orchard. The organisers had erected a very nice canopy, I suppose one would call it, rather than a marquee. There was a stage. I turned up and there was a nice plaque on a rock and we unveiled it. It is a rectangular site with an access of about half a block from a pleasant side street in a nice suburb. The ceremony was conducted under a very warm sun but we were under the shade and afterwards we were provided with refreshments for which we were all very grateful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the hostel is constructed it is going to be something that the community will be very proud of and the Government is going to be very proud of contributing some of the money for its construction. It is part of the ethnic specific aged nursing care program which this Government has vigorously pursued and will continue to pursue. This particular 40-bed hostel is for Polish Australians who settled in Australia in the 1940s and 1950s. Many of them came to live in the area which is now my electorate. They have built the main Polish club in South Australia, the Dom Polski Polish Community Centre in my electorate. They also have a soccer club there; it is called the Polonia Soccer Club. I am pleased to say that one of my sons, well before he was a medical doctor at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, was awarded the most improved player award for playing one of the underage soccer teams there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was certainly very well deserved. Unfortunately, he did not go on to become an eminent soccer player, but he is doing well for the community anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This generation of Poles came to Australia and worked very hard during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and are now getting elderly and want to be provided with the same kind of nursing home and hostel care as the rest of the community need and get, but they often lose their facility in the English language as they get a bit older and they need specific Polish language treatment, and they get it. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, the Polish community is being replenished by new waves of Polish settlers to this country, particularly during the 1980s when things got a bit difficult in Poland-as they have been since the Second World War-coupled with certain freedoms which allowed them to come to this country. There is not a tremendous shortage of Polish speaking nurses as there is in some of the other smaller ethnic communities. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to report that as part of the program in my seat many of the other ethnic communities have been provided with ethnic specific nursing home or hostel care for their aged, including the Greeks, Italians and Hungarians. We are presently advertising for somebody to construct and run an Asian language ethnic specific nursing home, which will probably be run in Vietnamese or one of the Chinese languages. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular Polish ethnic specific nursing home is being constructed by the Southern Cross Nursing Homes Group, whose president is Peter Taylor-he was there at the unveiling-in conjunction with the Polish community. The total cost of constructing it will be about $2.9m, of which the Commonwealth is providing $1.6m. </PARA>
<PARA> The form of the nursing home is very interesting. It is being designed, I suppose appropriately, by an Australian architect, Sandy Nodze, as he would be known in the place that his surname originally came from-Hungary. He is known in our community as Sandy Nudgee. It is quite an interesting design. It takes the form of a village shape with a village green and a mock spire. Each resident will live in separate hostel units with a common room for them to entertain themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The sod was then turned by a number of people, including myself and the Mayor of Enfield, who is very interested in ethnic communities that are in his town, and it was blessed by a priest of Polish origin. This shows that this Government is not only committed to aged care programs which are diverse and in the community and available to people who require various levels of care, but also committed to the ethnic communities of this country who have done so much to help develop it and now in their aged circumstances deserve all the various forms of care that we provide to English language speaking sectors of the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, 12 March, is the forty-eighth anniversary of the Australian Army Catering Corps, whose training establishment is based in my electorate at Puckapunyal. While it is said that an Army marches on its stomach, the reluctance to form a catering corps, suggested first in 1938, was rather extraordinary. As the corps official history relates, the battle to form the Australian Army Catering Corps was a long and interesting affair involving five years of toil, backstabbing, bureaucratic bungling and endless submissions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason offered was that the Australian Army Service Corps did not want to lose its cooks-not that this was really an issue, since as soon as it trained a cook and it being war time, the cook quickly exchanged his ladle for a rifle. There were never enough tradesmen cooks. </PARA>
<PARA> Defections from the kitchen were also hardly surprising, given the early standard of feeding the troops and the attendant status of the cook. The common view was that all the Army cook could do was boil cabbage, make stew and offer only three choices-take it, wear it or leave it. </PARA>
<PARA> However, eventually on 12 March 1943 under Sir Stanton Hicks, famous for his advocacy of blue boiler peas and reduction of food waste in the Australian Army, the corps was formed. It recognised an important issue that Army cooks and caterers as food specialists are engaged not in menial work but in a task, the correct performance of which is fundamental to military success. </PARA>
<PARA> The corps director, Sir Stanton Hicks, was a remarkable man by all accounts-a reserve officer and also a medical research professor. He set out to provide the Army with palatable food of the highest nutritional value and to raise the status of Army cooks. His experiences are recorded in the book Who Called the Cook a Bastard?. </PARA>
<PARA> During the recent Gulf crisis many people may have wondered how the coalition forces could cope with feeding the influx of 100,000 Iraqi prisoners. Obviously, it requires superb organisation and logic. Sir Stanton Hicks, in a brief early history of the corps, looked at the basic problem of breakfast cereals and wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Cereals may be all right for domestic use but the method of preparation removes the vitamins; two 5-ton trucks are needed to carry one ton of the processed cereal and half a ton of this is cardboard and paper packaging. Is this sound from a tactical standpoint?</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously the answer was no, and that was where the blue boiler peas came in. Their nutrient values were high. `On germinated blue peas alone as a source of vegetable, we could face the most arduous campaign without the least fear of malnutrition', wrote Sir Stanton Hicks. The Army Catering Corps has come a long way from boiled cabbage, bully beef and biscuit-and blue boiler peas-in peacetime at least. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I had the pleasure of attending an Australian Army Catering Corps luncheon at Puckapunyal and was most impressed by the standard of food offered, the huge choice and the manner of presentation. The Corps motto is We Sustain and its charter continues to be `to raise and improve the standard of Army feeding'. In 48 years, the Corps has fed troops on diverse battlefields, from desert to jungle, and looked after civilians in states of emergency. I wish the Corps well as it approaches its half century of providing the sustenance for men and women doing vital and very difficult jobs on behalf of the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a rather daunting prospect to speak on the adjournment debate tonight following the last couple of contributions. I want to speak about something that is very dear to the heart of the sporting public of my electorate of Brisbane. I know that it will be of interest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, with your keen interest in sport. Early in the season as it is, I am pleased to stand here in the House to record that the Brisbane Broncos rugby league team has commenced the 1991 football season with a magnificent victory in the pre-season competition, finalised last weekend, in which the Brisbane Broncos beat a very determined and, I might say, very professional side in Penrith, to complete its pre-season effort in preparation for what will be its first successful launch on the New South Wales premiership-for I am more confident this year than I was last year that we will succeed in achieving the heights of premiership within the competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should say, as this is the first opportunity I have had to raise this matter since the finals last year, that the Brisbane Broncos performed extremely well as a club side last year winning the reserve grade premiership and finishing, in the end, third in the elimination finals-going down to what I must confess was a superior team in the Canberra Raiders in the preliminary final last year. Of course Canberra went on to win the Grand Final last year. </PARA>
<PARA> As with the 1990 season, the Broncos have commenced the 1991 season with a remarkable victory, coming back from a deficit of 16 to 2 part-way into the second quarter. It is a measure of their commitment as a team and their professionalism and dedication that they were able to return from that sort of deficit to win on the final hurdle by 20 points to 16. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to pay some recognition to members of the Penrith side because not only were they finalists last year but also they are a team from good working class backgrounds, with good strong club spirit, who have played very good football in recent years. I know that the honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free) would have shed some tears the other evening when watching the replay but, gentleman as he is, he ensured that a video of that match was available for those of us from Queensland who wished to watch that great victory, and a fine thing it was too. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say, on a more serious note, that I have some concerns about the press reports of disputes between the Brisbane Broncos Club and the Lang Park Trust which administers the Lang Park ground in Brisbane. The Lang Park ground is known to all sports-loving fans throughout the country. It has been the home of many a good game of football and none greater than the State of Origin matches which have been held there. Some have referred to the Lang Park ground as being worth five points to Queensland when it has played at home. I suspect, having been to most of those matches, it is probably worth a few more than five points to the home side. It certainly is a boost to those wearing the maroon jersey to play on the Lang Park field. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pity that the disputes between the Broncos management and the Lang Park Trust have erupted. I earnestly hope, on behalf of not only my electors in Brisbane but also the sports-loving population of Queensland, that those disputes can be sorted out as quickly as possible so that the great game of football can proceed without the problems of administrators having their arguments and that the very talented sports people in the teams can get out there and perform their skills for our collective enjoyment. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I refer to one other side and that is the Gold Coast side-not that I am a great supporter of the Gold Coast side, I must say, but I recognise that one of the greatest footballers I have had the privilege of seeing, and that is Wally Lewis, has now moved to the Gold Coast and is playing with the Gold Coast. I wish him well in his new club venture. Difficult as it will be, in playing with the Gold Coast, to demonstrate his talents, I think that, all in all, it should be recognised that he has been a great player for the code and it should be recognised as such throughout the country. It will, of course, be to no avail in the end: the Broncos will succeed in 1991. </PARA>
