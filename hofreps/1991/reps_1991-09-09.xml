In view of the former Treasurer's repeated denials that he had any prior knowledge of the bail out, what steps has the Prime Minister taken to ask the former Treasurer to explain the discrepancy between the answers he has given to this Parliament since 1987 and the sworn testimony presented to the royal commission? If he has not taken any steps, why not?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In 1990-91 the Federal Government raised nearly $8 billion from petroleum excises, $2.4 billion from other excises, and Customs duties were worth another $3.3 billion. Together with other indirect taxes raised in 1990-91, that is a total of $13.9 billion. I am wondering what programs would need to be cut to cover that sort of hole. To give the House an idea, that is equivalent to all the Government's assistance to the aged and the disabled added together. But that is not the end of the story.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In 1989-90 - in the most recent data available--the States and local governments raised nearly $12 billion from indirect taxes of one sort or another. Given all this, I was interested to note that the National Party wants to abolish all indirect taxes. I can only wonder what process the National Party has in mind for forcing the States and local governments to stop imposing these taxes. Of course, the States and local government would want compensation for giving up their taxes, so the Nationals are suggesting that the Federal Government should chop $25 billion off its outlays. That is a quarter of this Government's Budget. Of course, the Nationals would find another $1 billion for railways in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>  Economics is a bit beyond the Nationals, but even simple arithmetic is beyond them. The Nationals also want income tax to be cut, zone rebates to be increased, and all sorts of other goodies. These people really have very little idea about what government is all about. If they did not ask people to vote for them, it would be funny.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is also interesting to contrast the views of the Nationals with those of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition, in his reply to the Budget, said that the Government should have balanced the Budget and that it did not because it gave away $2 billion in revenue. That $2 billion was made up of tax cuts--something that the coalition allegedly wants--and reductions in tariffs, which is something else that the coalition allegedly wants. When will the Opposition stand up on all these matters?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is directed to the Treasurer. What revenue was raised by the Commonwealth from the taxation of crude oil, LPG and petroleum products in 1990-91? How has this revenue changed over time? What does this mean for those living in rural and regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="876" SPEAKER="Kerin The Hon J.C." NAMEID="QH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WERRIWA" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As I said in response to the earlier questions, total collections are approximately $8 billion, which equates to approximately 2.1 per cent of GDP or 8 per cent of taxation revenue. In 1982-83, total collections were approximately $4.9 billion, which is approximately 3 per cent of GDP and 11 per cent of total taxation revenue. That shows that the total take has been going down as a proportion of GDP, but these figures are gross of rebates. The Commonwealth Government provides the diesel fuel rebate, which benefits agriculture, mining producers, hospitals and nursing homes at an estimated total cost this year of about $920m. Revenue collected, as a proportion of both GDP and total taxation revenue, has dropped significantly because of the tax reforms introduced by this Government--always opposed by the Opposition. Country people recognise that the petroleum pricing system of the Government is fair and, because of the deliberate policy changes of the Government, will remain a fair system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Fisher also asked about the effect on rural and regional Australia. Members of this House might be interested, therefore, in other means of taxing the use of petroleum products. One option categorically rejected by the Government and barely supported by people such as Russell Cooper, Hendy Cowan, Terry Metherell, Denver Beanland and Jeff Kennett is the introduction of a consumption tax. Why is that rejected by the Government? Farmers would have the burden of claiming rebates for the consumption tax, but would still face the impost of the fuel excise.</PARA>
<PARA>  It would seem from its conference at the weekend that the National Party is only committed to the examination of reduction or abolition of excise. So people in country areas and regional areas who rely on their cars would have to pay excise and the consumption tax at the full rate. The National Party needs to realise that the rural and regional areas of this country do not comprise just farmers and graziers. If we give an exemption only to farmers and graziers, we will turn them all into service stations.</PARA>
<PARA>  The task for the Leader of the Opposition when he addresses the National Press Club on 25 September is to explain how the support of the National Party is to be guaranteed by addressing each and every one of the 12 qualifications of support at its conference at the weekend. I think the Opposition Leader also outlined in his speech at that conference the cuts he will make to education, research and development, health, and roads and rail when he rolls over the Nationals and abolishes the petroleum products excise.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It was very noticeable that when we got this question about the implications for women in the Budget there were groans from the other side of the House. It reflects the fact that, when we had that long article in the Bulletin the other day about the policies of the Government, there was not a mention about women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As distinct from the lack of concern of those opposite for the position of Australian women in this place, the Government announced in the Budget a series of changes to family payments that will benefit more than 200,000 Australian families at a cost of $186m in a full year. All payments for children will now be made to the primary carer, which is usually the mother. The biggest gains are for spouses of Jobstart, Newstart and sickness allowance recipients. These women will directly receive benefit payments for their children--whereas previously the payment was generally made to the father--as well as receiving their family allowance.</PARA>
<PARA>  Furthermore, women will continue to get payments for their children through the social security system even though their family circumstances change. This means that families making the transition from unemployment to employment will have the security of knowing that their FAS entitlement will be assessed and paid to them quickly.</PARA>
<PARA>  I remind the House that these measures will benefit over 200,000 families. In other words, it is quite clear that this Government, this side of the House, helps families to meet the costs of their children. By way of contrast, the Opposition would slash the capacity of Australian families to meet the needs of their children.</PARA>
<PARA>  We know from the work that has been done that families on low incomes spend any increased income on basic necessities. About 90 per cent of FAS families use FAS to help pay for everyday essentials related to bringing up children: around 80 per cent of FAS families spend part of their FAS on clothing for their children, over half spend part of their FAS on food, and about 40 per cent spend part of their FAS on home expenses.</PARA>
<PARA>  I know the honourable member will understand and attach the appropriate importance to the fact that FAS is spent on the necessities of life, which would all be subject to tax under a consumption tax proposal. In other words, a consumption tax would slash the capacity of these families to meet their children's needs. It would increase the cost of clothing; it would increase the cost of food; it would increase rents. Yet in those circumstances the shadow Treasurer had the temerity last week, on 5 September, to say that the consumption tax `would be very good for Australian families'. All I can say is that it may be very good for the sorts of families that the shadow Treasurer mixes with, but for the vast majority of ordinary Australian working families it would be a disaster.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6T4">Mr ELLIOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I direct my question to the Minister for Transport and Communications. Has the Minister seen reports claiming that Telecom's sales tax liability is a hidden tax on phone bills? Has the Government monitored the effects of sales tax on Telecom's tariffs? How have consumers fared? Further, does the Government intend to take advice to introduce any other form of tax on subscribers?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="878" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is true that since May 1987 Telecom has had a liability to pay sales tax. That amount in the last financial year was some $375m. It was the view maintained by the Opposition that this had clearly been added into the subscribers' annual charges. What has happened since that was introduced, and since the implementation of price control by this Government, is that telephone charges have fallen by about 8 per cent in real terms. When it is a sales tax levied on the basis of that which is levied on Telecom, it is a sales tax which the management of Telecom chooses how it will deal with. It may choose to pass it on to the consumer; it may choose to take it off its capital program; or it may choose to absorb it against its anticipated profits. But what cannot be sustained is a position that the Opposition suggests, that it has somehow produced, since it has been introduced, an increase in subscriber's charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The honourable member asked me a question about whether or not another form of taxation levied on Telecom might not have a somewhat different impact from that. Let me tell honourable members what a general consumption tax at a rate of 15 per cent levied on Telecom's revenue would be: it would have a $1.3 billion annual impact. If it were levied at a 10 per cent rate it would have a $890m impact. If it were levied at a 22 per cent rate it would have an impact of well over $2 billion. So at the various levies at which the Opposition has managed to discuss this--10 per cent, 15 per cent and 22 per cent--we have a result of between $890m and over $2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>  There would be no issue as far as Telecom management was concerned as to whether or not it would take this on profit. There would be no issue whatsoever, because Telecom would join about another 500,000-plus businesses which would assume new roles in their positions in the Australian society--that of tax collectors. The wholesale tax now, I understand, is collected from about 70,000 locations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am corrected again: 750,000 tax collection agencies, one of which would be Telecom, collecting anywhere between $890m and $2 billion--with an absolute obligation to ensure that that is directly taken from the consumers. What we had from the Opposition front bench was the 1980s show. What were the 1980s all about in taxation right through the Anglo-Saxon world, but resisted here? They were about how one imposed a tax burden on the middle income people of one's nation to free up-- allegedly for investment purposes--opportunities for the wealthy in the various communities. That is what happened in many places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  At the time when the Leader of the Opposition was advising the then Treasurers, the ordinary citizens carried the burden of taxation in this country, and the wealthy evaded it by various means. In those days it was by covert means; now it is suggested that they should be overt, by taxing the ordinary person's consumption to provide income tax relief to the wealthy in this community. That was the 1980s show.</PARA>
<PARA>  The theory is that somehow this benefits business. The theory is that the wealthy will then spend it on productive investment. The evidence is that the wealthy spend it on hobby restaurants, hobby farms and Ferraris. That is what the business of the taxation policy of this coalition is all about.</PARA>

<PARA>  It is very interesting to contrast this approach to that of the Opposition. The Opposition has been going around for some period now saying that its approach to the unemployed is to cut off benefits after nine months. I refer the House to what the Leader of the Opposition said in February 1990 when he was the shadow Treasurer. He challenged the then Treasurer by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Cut off employment benefits after nine months and match our policy. We are saving about $750m from that change.</PARA>
<PARA>In February 1990 he said that $750m would be saved by removing people absolutely from unemployment benefits after nine months. All that has come a little adrift as a result of the National Party conference over the weekend. The National Party said that it would not have a bar of this policy of cutting people off benefits after nine months. Today we have been treated to an exercise in obfuscation on the part of the Opposition as it tries to work out exactly what its policy is.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I take this opportunity to thank the honourable member for Hinkler, chairman of the Caucus resources committee, for his ongoing interest and significant involvement in Government policy in this area. Honourable members will be aware of the controversy that surrounded the introduction and implementation of the petroleum resource rent tax proposals announced in the last Budget. The whole package of reforms announced in that Budget were well received by, in particular, the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association, which responded to the package in this way:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>When we look back from the next century at Australia's oil and gas exploration and production industry, August 1990 will be seen to be the decisive moment.</PARA>
<PARA>The whole package of reforms brought about by this Government, including the deregulation of the liquefied petroleum gas market, tax deductibility for petroleum platform removal, the important initiative of company-wide deductibility which was directed towards ensuring that we had a proper balance between exploration in our mature areas and our frontier areas have been extraordinarily well received--and this, I might repeat, after some initial and significant controversy.</PARA>
<PARA>  It has always been my view that in the determination of public policy one ought to keep one's eye on the ball and the decibel level surrounding these issues should be taken in context. I refer to a Business Review Weekly article which followed up that decision and supported the view that Esso and BHPP would now renew the development phase in Bass Strait heralding, `a new boom in oil exploration'. BHPP's management, quoted as endorsing the reforms, indicated, `We can now begin the task of exploring the other more prospective basins in the southern oceans'.</PARA>
<PARA>  In this House I have referred to the international new ventures survey of 66 international and domestic oil companies by the Robertson Research Group, which ranked Australia as the fourth most favoured host country for exploration expenditure--that is a jump from twentieth in the previous year. I hope that Opposition members will concur with the sentiment that that is an extraordinary result for this country.</PARA>
<PARA>  Just a few days ago an article by Mr Gomez, an acknowledged leader in resource matters in this country, which appeared in the Australian newspaper quoted a paper by Dr Fesharaki, the director of resources programs at the prestigious East West Centre in Honolulu. This gentleman wrote that these reforms were `a remarkable turnaround for the industry'. I will refer to that article because there is no question about the fact that this is important for Australia. In that article of 28 August one of the world's most prominent oil experts praised changes to the resource tax regime saying that it had been responsible for a remarkable turnaround in oil production. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government must be applauded for the implementation of this brave policy, which has proved to be very successful in revitalising the Australian oil industry.</PARA>
<PARA>    . . .           . . . .          . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The outlook for the Australian oil industry is brighter today than it has been in a decade.</PARA>
<PARA>He concluded--as I will--with these comments:</PARA>
<PARA>The changes will help the country's long term trade balance and its energy security and, "it is hoped that other oil producing countries in the region take note of Australia's successful policies".</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question and I note his longstanding commitment to principles of social justice as they relate to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Commonwealth, State and Territory governments are all aware of the tremendous importance of the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. It is true to say that that report is unique in the history of this country and that there has never before been undertaken such a comprehensive inquiry into the conditions experienced by Aboriginal Australians. I also believe that the commitment by the Commonwealth, States and Territories to address the Royal Commission report is one which is shared by both sides of this House. I note the encouraging and supportive comments by the honourable member for Chisholm in relation to the Royal Commission report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I would like to urge that members of this House, and indeed the media, look at the overview and recommendations of that Royal Commission report because they provide a tremendous insight into the problems experienced by Aboriginal people and give a further understanding of what action is required to address those very critical issues of Aboriginal disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased to respond to the honourable member for Moreton by telling him that on 8 July of this year a joint ministerial forum of Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers agreed on how to develop a national response to the 339 recommendations of the Royal Commission by March 1992. Of utmost importance to that joint and national response is a recognition that what is required is a whole-of-government response, that responses simply from the Aboriginal affairs portfolio would not address and would not meet the recommendations of the Royal Commission, and that what we needed was a response that touched upon every aspect of government that impacted on the lives of Aboriginal people-- health, housing, employment, education, police, prisons and, indeed, coronial inquiries. Most importantly, that whole-of-government response and that commitment to a joint national response is shared by the State and Territory governments. One of the first tasks is to determine which of the responses is entirely that of a State or Territory Government, which responses must come entirely from the Commonwealth level and which matters are to be the subject of a joint response.</PARA>
<PARA>  The target date of March 1992 was established to allow detailed consideration of the Royal Commission's recommendations. It could not be the case that any response that was simply cobbled together in an attempt to meet some arbitrary deadline would be adequate to meeting this historic document. One matter which has been recognised at the Commonwealth level is that Aboriginal participation in preparing that joint response is absolutely essential, and the Common- wealth has decided that its initiatives will make proper provision for that Aboriginal participation at all stages.</PARA>
<PARA>  Most new expenditure by governments in response to the Royal Commission will occur from the 1992-1993 financial year following the development of that national response. I take this opportunity to remind all State and Territory governments that earlier initiatives in priority areas are being identified in cooperation with them. Resources for the Commonwealth's initiatives that I have referred to were provided in the Budget, including funds for participation, funds for Commonwealth resources for preparing and coordinating that national response and funds for specific recommendations in relation to law and justice, one of which is accession to the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which my colleague the Attorney-General has already dealt with. Further proposals for Commonwealth action will be considered in this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, I make the point that in relation to the Royal Commission report we have, as a nation, an unprecedented opportunity to change Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal relations in this country and to address the critical issues that I have referred to in relation to Aboriginal disadvantage. I assure the honourable member that the Royal Commission report is not gathering dust in the archives, and will not be allowed to do so.</PARA>

What those opposite are offering their constituents is more paperwork to get the same effective exemption as we now give, and will give as a consequence of the March economic statement. In relation to excise, they offer nothing further because all they are seeking to offer in relation to that great policy statement that was put out and circulated at the National Party Conference at the time is, effectively, to exempt only that component of the goods and services tax that goes onto the excise. As the Treasurer indicated earlier today, they are really giving back to people only that which they put on, at best. Therefore, they have to ask themselves: where is the great gain for the farm sector in this proposition?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In addition to there being no gain, I make the point that the two factors that stand out as clearly as anything are these: that the proposition of a combination of a sales tax and a goods and services tax--of 15 per cent, 22 per cent, 10 per cent or whatever, we do not know--is regressive in its own right because it falls most heavily on low income families, in particular the farm sector. In addition to that, what those opposite are proposing is a flat rate tax, which is also regressive. It means that people on higher incomes will pay less as a proportion--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The incident I have referred to is part of a general failure by the Government to adhere to high standards of public administration. We have to laugh when members of the Government come in here day after day and say that further detail has to be given on this policy or that policy before the Opposition is elected to government. In 1983 this Government was elected with no economic policy, no tax policy and no spending policy. It had only one policy: it had stitched up a deal with the ACTU and it would invite sectional interests into this House to try to set an economic program. In due time, appointed spokesmen for welfare groups, union groups and business groups came into this House to try to tell the Government what it ought to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government took the attitude that its special role in all of this was to cut and weave and wheel and deal and come up with some kind of program out of the submissions of all these sectional interest groups. Some of the sectional interest groups were given more respect than others--none more so than the grandaddy of them all, the ACTU. After all, the centrepiece for the Government--or the Opposition, as it then was--was that it would share power with the ACTU under an accord between the industrial and political wings of organised labour. In the process it would set about subordinating all institutions in Australia to that deal. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, supposed to be independent and above all in setting wages, was effectively jettisoned when it showed signs of independence. When an independent judge gave the Government trouble, the Government effectively abolished the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. That judge was left with a non-job. When the Industrial Relations Commission showed some independence in its April 1991 wage decision, it was warned by the accord partners that they would not eat its vomit. All institutions were subjected to this appetite for power by sectional interests. All were to be put in their place and held in check by sectional interests and their leaders, with the accord partners wheeling, dealing and presiding over all. </PARA>
<PARA>  The high point illustrating this process was the Kirribilli conspiracy of November 1988. A representative of big business, Sir Peter Abeles, and a representative of union power, Bill Kelty, were invited in by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), to concur in dividing up the spoils of government. Who elected Sir Peter Abeles to this job? Who elected Bill Kelty to this job? Who authorised this cabal to divide up government as if it were a personal plaything? What is more, what right did those people have to hold this personal secret affecting millions of lives? What power did it give them over the Government? All through the pilots strike, all through the compensation and all through the use of the RAAF, two men held a secret over this Government, a secret that was a scandal--a scandal that gave them power. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was not until 2 1/2 years after the event that the honourable member for Blaxland spilled this dirty little secret, this shabby little deal, and let the public in on it. I want to know how many other dirty little secrets have been transacted--how many other shameful scandals have been transacted--that have been hidden from the public over the last two to three years. When the Prime Minister was asked to defend this he said that it was defensible because it helped his re-election chances. He said, `I had to win the election and if people had known that Keating was waiting in the wings I would not have won it'. That is what the Prime Minister said. His principle is that any imposition on the public interest is defensible in the name of his personal benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us come to the Burke fiasco. When it was revealed that the Ambassador to Ireland had employed a telephone tapper, had diverted campaign donations into his personal stamp collection and had run up telephone bills during moments of crisis for the corrupt Western Australian Government, what did the Prime Minister do? What action did he take to enforce proper standards for diplomatic appointees? He was frozen to stone. He showed a frenetic inactivity. He came into this place with an explanation that was proved wrong within hours. He came into this place and apologised. He twisted and squirmed on the end of all those unanswerable questions. </PARA>
<PARA>  But I tell honourable members what he did not do: he did not deal with Brian Burke. He</PARA>
<PARA>did not have the guts to stand up and assert proper diplomatic standards for Brian Burke--because he knew what Burke knew. Burke knew a lot of things that were troubling for the Prime Minister. Burke knew about the lunch of 15 June 1987. Burke knew about the $950,000 given in relation to the gold promise. Burke knew that that had not been declared in the electoral returns. Burke knew who had the money out and who had the favours in. The Prime Minister was frozen to paralysis by that deal. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are others. Let us come to the Rothwells rescue. This was a deal where all the mates were involved--Laurie, Alan and Robert. All of them were in Perth on the weekend of 25 October 1987; all raising money to try to save Rothwells; all knowing that, if Rothwells collapsed, the dirty linen would come out; all knowing that a Rothwells failure would uncover their tracks. When Paul Keating was asked about that in Parliament, he said that he knew nothing about it. Strangely, later this year he had a recollection that the late Peter Beckwith had rung him. Was that not fortunate? Now we hear sworn evidence in the Western Australian royal commission that it was not only the late Peter Beckwith who had been on the phone to the former Treasurer but also the late Robert Holmes a Court. Mr Keating is going to die a death of a thousand admissions over this. He is hoping that it will not come out, but it will. It is coming out bit by bit. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we had listened to the Prime Minister after the crash, we would have thought, before the cock had crowed thrice, that he hardly knew these people; that he did not have anything to do with them; that he hardly knew Alan--although if we had listened to him at the time, he had single-handedly won the America's Cup with the Prime Minister; and that he hardly knew Laurie, although he had had Laurie on the National Gallery in 1986 and on the rural and industry council in 1986. Laurie had been working on his Order of Australia prior to the crash. The Prime Minister asks, `Laurie who?'--Laurie, the man whom he took fishing after the 1987 election. They were not fishing for corporate crooks off Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government was never interested in enforcing the corporations law; it was interested in securing those donations. The whole crookery can be summed up in the immortal words of Premier Peter Dowding, who walked in after the Rothwells crash and asked, `Who are we trying to keep out of gaol today?'. Peter Dowding was dealing on behalf of all Labor's mates, all the people who were raising funds for them in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The tragedy is that they fought for Laurie's Order of Australia; for Laurie's job on the National Gallery board; for Laurie's job on the rural council; for Laurie's bank; for Bondie's empire in the move on the Bell Group to get the $1 billion of cash reserves; and they fought for the Holmes a Court empire. They will fight for the jobs of wharfies and for legal privilege for trade unions, but they will not fight for the jobs of one million unemployed Australians. Hawke will fight for his job; Keating will fight for Hawke's job; Dawkins will fight for Kerin's job--none of them will fight for the 1,000 small businesses that are going out of business month by month in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Labor knows only one rule of government. There is only one rule that Labor members operate by and they have operated by only one rule since 1983; that is, punish your enemies, reward your friends. That is what they think government is for. They have a cult of entangling obligations: loyalty to mates, loyalty to factions, loyalty to parties and loyalty to union bosses; but they do not have a concept of the primary duty--that is, the overriding loyalty of a member of parliament, a Minister of the Crown, to the public interest. The loyalty to faction comes well before that. </PARA>
<PARA>  Now we have a Prime Minister who is the prisoner of factions. The loyalty of his Ministers is not to him; it is to the factions they represent. It is widely believed that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) has leaked Cabinet submissions that he made in respect of the Budget. He needs to be either exonerated or dismissed. The Prime Minister cannot exonerate him, because he believes he is guilty; and he cannot dismiss him, because dismissing him would prompt another leadership challenge. The last thing he wants is a catalyst for another leadership challenge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Do not forget that that was a dorothy dixer--he knew the question and he had a written answer. When that bloke gets a real question he will have real trouble. And we have an isolated Prime Minister sitting in the Lodge. Do honourable members know what he does every night? He counts those 66 votes--every one of them. He goes through them every night and says, `Ah, those 66 are still with me. Have I made sure that I have not lost one? How did this decision reflect on those votes? What did it do to the Queenslanders? What did it do to Bill Ludwig? What did it do to the Left?'. He counts every one of those 66 votes. He wants to make sure that he has not lost one of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The words of Keating ring in his ears: `The first leader I tear down will be the one I replace'. That is what he hears as he counts those 66 votes, frozen in the Lodge at night. The Prime Minister has 66 lifelines to the Lodge and he counts them every night. But Australia counts the one million unemployed. Small business counts the cost of oppressive taxation. Employers count the cost of training levies and superannuation levies, and they count the labour shedding that will be necessary to pay for it. Exporters count the cost of lost export industries, the cost of Coronation Hill, and the cost of Wesley Vale. Tasmanians and Territorians count the cost of jobs that this Government has denied them. Australians count the cost of a Labor government that is hopelessly divided, unable to give direction, governing for sectional interest, compromised by scandal--because wherever we look, a deal has been done. </PARA>
<PARA>  The only way Government members look at these things now is in terms of who wins and who loses; whose vote changes; where it goes; what lobby they will put offside now; how they will get this or that sectional interest group back; how they will make sure that they have those last months of government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- Something must have happened to the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) between when he left university and when he entered Parliament, but whatever happened to him during that time had absolutely nothing to do with the standard of debate that he decided he would learn. On serious matters, that has to be just about the most undergraduate speech delivered in this place. What a pathetic piece of work. He comes out with this mad catch-all, spraying it in all sorts of directions, hoping that something will land somewhere that might actually have some effect. It was pathetic.

<PARA>  One wonders at what cost it has been to its own internal stability when the Opposition last week wimped on its opportunity for a censure motion. Opposition members talk about tapes of meetings. I would love to have the tape of the meeting that occurred between about 12 o'clock on Wednesday night and 2 a.m. the next day. When the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), heard a report that somebody had tumbled the fact that they had once thought about a 22 per cent consumption tax, and that was their ultimate objective, they went completely insane. It is recorded in some detail in the Canberra Times over the weekend, so somebody is talking somewhere. But it certainly produced some doozies of press releases the next morning. When I answered a question in this place on the subject, I thought that the press release did not have in it the death touch of somebody who is a professional press agent of a politician--it definitely must have been reflective of the maker himself. Indeed, it was a truly demented performance. Here it is--`Statement by Dr John Hewson, MP'. We are talking here, of course, on the subject matter of this particular debate--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I should not be referring to him as `demented'. I am terribly sorry about that. The statement reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Editors of the Sydney Morning Herald should admit that this story is a total fabrication and should publish an apology and retraction for misleading their readers on this important matter. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the whole tone of it:</PARA>
<PARA>In fact knowledge of these so called details is solely confined to Peter Hartcher--and the Government apparatchik who fed him this line. </PARA>
<PARA>Then there is this:</PARA>
<PARA>Stupid games like this played by the Government with the cooperation of its media mates--</PARA>
<PARA>Peter Hartcher? Peter Hartcher is the media mate of the Government? When it comes to the definition of `deal', there is a sort of normal standard that applies to an expression such as `deal'. A political deal equates to the sort of thing that is done by people in the back rooms of the Liberal Party when favours are exchanged for another particular set of legislative favours. That is what a deal means. A public arrangement or a public negotiation over wages issues which affects the entirety of Australians is not classified as a deal in those circumstances. When the phrase `media mates' is thrown about, it is generally to allege a connection between a set of politicians and a set of people who own the media. </PARA>
<PARA>  The bureau chief of the Canberra press gallery for the Sydney Morning Herald is a media mate? The sloppiness of the language, in terms of political analysis, used by the person who proposed this matter of public importance is amply reflected in the childish attitude adopted by his crystal-jawed Leader of the Opposition to any form of criticism that is directed at him. The statement goes on as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Stupid games. . . played by. . . media mates will not distract attention from either a) the Government's failure to govern and cronic disunity and b) the Coalition's determinations to develop policy in the best interests of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>That is another example of demented rantings by the Leader of the Opposition--demented rantings that are incapable of producing any decent or sensible analysis of where we stand. </PARA>
<PARA>  Then there is another particular performance. This matter of public importance is supposed to be also about public standards and the relationships that exist between Government and other persons who are not actually in the Government. The only lowering of that standard that occurred during the last week in decent relations between members of the Government and each other and other parts of the governing sector was the performance by the Leader of the Opposition--again in full flight--on the subject of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The Weekend Australian had one or two pertinent things to say about that. There are one or two comments that might be quoted from the Weekend Australian's editorial on this:</PARA>
<PARA>And it is not guaranteed that a Hewson Government would be in any better position to judge the wisdom of an interest rates move than the Hewson Opposition. A Coalition government would have to second-guess an independent bank: if the bank was shown to have made the wrong decision, it might then be forced to offset its effects through changes in the arms of policy under direct government control. </PARA>
<PARA>The irony of Dr Hewson's position is that its effect is to undermine the institution which he says he wants to enhance. The Reserve Bank, along with every central bank around the world in the late 1980s was guilty of serious monetary policy miscalculations. This, in turn, has provoked a substantial re-think within the bank, a far greater emphasis on medium-term settings to achieve price stability and growing support for a more independent bank. Mr Fraser, in fact, is reflecting these precise trends in his speeches. . .</PARA>
<PARA>In doing so, Dr Hewson called into question the integrity not just of Mr Fraser but of the institution which he believes can be so much wiser, and so much purer, in its decision making than can the politicians whom he believes set interest rates now. </PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition went on in his little exercise, that wonderfully demented press release that he managed to put out:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no end to this process. If it is OKAY for Bernie Fraser to quietly coerce the banks, already facing non-performing loans of $29 billion, it will be OKAY for the head of DITAC to go and have some `quiet chats' to BHP and to CRA and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a press release from the Leader of the Opposition. This is a press release from somebody who wants to be Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is another interesting feature of this statement. Okay is spelt with a capital O, capital K, capital A and capital Y. First, it is illiterate; second, it contains a telltale element which all members of the Parliament--although perhaps not the new member for Higgins, who has not been around here very long--would know. We, as members of the Parliament, know one thing when we get a piece of correspondence in our offices in which words are either underlined or put in capitals: we know that we have on our hands a letter from a loony. What we do when we get a letter from a loony is to be very careful indeed how we handle it. If we are sensible about it, we will write a one-line reply to the said gentleman or lady, and occasionally we will even do what the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney) has been known to do, which is to send a letter back to him or her stating, `I think you should refer this matter to the Federal Police. Somebody is writing poison-pen letters in your name'. That is the appropriate way to deal with letters from loonies, but letters from loonies now happen to be the standard issue press release of the Leader of the Opposition when he reaches the point that the Weekend Australian is pleased to describe as `Dr Hewson's mysterious obsession'. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Leader of the Opposition has a glass jaw, and there is no question about that. The milk of human kindness does not drip from him when he deals with colleagues, when he deals with public servants and when he deals with the population in general. Nothing is more objectionable to members of the Australian Labor Party than to see members of the Opposition stand up in this place and say that they are concerned about the one million people who are unemployed, because we know the attitudes that underlie that particular view. We know that they have stated publicly that, as far as they are concerned, in the short term, if their plans were implemented, unemployment would rise. They have said that. It is not a misquote from the Labor Party; those opposite have said it. This means that, if they go around claiming that the Labor Party has created approximately 850,000 people on the dole, there is an obligation on them, if that is their position, to say, `But we will create a million'--not to imply somehow that if the public votes for them the public will get a better deal when it comes to the question of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  This goes to the Opposition's attitude to those who are actually on the dole and in a situation of great personal misfortune. It was nice to see that degree of integrity coming from the floor of the National Party Conference over the weekend. They are not very bright, but there was a certain amount of integrity there as they stood up to say, `Now listen, we do know people who are unemployed. We are a bit concerned for them. If you cut them off after nine months, then they will starve'. That was the position that was being put by the ordinary rank and file members of the National Party. However, the Liberal Party says, `Oh, give that the flick. What we will confront you with, ordinary members of the National Party, is the attitude of our glorious Leader--the one who is to be held up as the epitome of decency in interpersonal relationships and in attitudes to the general public'. </PARA>
<PARA>  I go to that wonderfully revealing address that the Leader of the Opposition gave to the National Party in New Zealand. I think the Liberal Party must be about the only force in politics that has ever conceived, in the history of this country, that what this country needs to do is follow New Zealand as some form of example or other. That is a truly unique political position at which it has managed to arrive, but it persists with it. He was over there with his mentors paying obeisance at the altar of the sort of economic system that he wants to provide. In paying due deference and obeisance to his masters, what was it that he had to say?</PARA>

<PARA>Haw-haw. </PARA>
<PARA>I am told that you didn't adopt the same attitude in presenting the last Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Ha, ha! What was the last Budget that was the source of such levity by the Leader of the Opposition? That Budget was one that threw millions more out of work and massively cut their welfare benefits. That was the gift. The people were not given a gift in advance of their speaking; they were given a kick in the lug and then they went out on to the streets and marched. That was them speaking. Haw- haw, says the Leader of the Opposition--what a funny little performance that was. He then goes on to absolutely compound this, so that we have total clarity on what his views are. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am also impressed to see that you do keep in touch with other parts of the electorate--</PARA>
<PARA>the scum, `You do keep in touch with the scum'--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-No, he did not use the word `scum'. He just referred to `other parts of the electorate'; a quick flick, `other parts to have soup kitchens'--other parts of the electorate. That is exactly where the Leader of the Opposition stands because, as far as he is concerned, the problem of the 1980s was that the 1980s free marketeering agenda to which he committed himself was not implemented; the agenda that was implemented in the United States and the United Kingdom was not implemented in this country, and this was a tragedy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The whole position of the Opposition is, `Let's have a 1980s run at just the point of time when people are at least modifying those philosophies in the governing processes'. That is its position. That is what it offers this country, `Let's really cut them loose; let us introduce that agenda whereby ordinary people carry the burden of taxation in this country and other people profit from it who are well off'. There is a theory behind it and the theory is, of course, that they will invest their money wisely and that will, in turn, create jobs, et cetera. There is no evidence, I am afraid, from the experience of the 1980s that that actually follows. There is evidence, from the experience of the 1980s, that when presented with that opportunity, people will spend it on conspicuous personal consumption in a way that offends those who carry the burden of it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition made some play of some alleged statements or whatever by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) at the time of the Rothwells rescue. The honourable member for Blaxland has been clear, and his denial of the particular suggestions made here have been clear. The fact is that the Federal Government in that area was never in the loop in respect of any decisions taken in regard to Rothwells, so there is nothing for the ex-Treasurer to clear, anyway. So the suggestion is fundamentally not believable. </PARA>
<PARA>  There were, however, comments at the time by political leaders on what was an appropriate course of action. Let me say--and I do not use this to demean them--that to create the spirit of the times and the views that were being expressed in support or otherwise of the Western Australian Government in the decisions that it took, clearly a lot of people were drawn into error, and included among those drawn into error was the Federal Opposition, the Federal Liberal Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This matter of public importance is about the failure of the Government to adhere to high standards. I think the contribution from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) indicates the disdain that the Government has for those high standards. He spent 14 minutes talking about things like the goods and services tax, the Reserve Bank of Australia, spelling, unemployment--his unemployment--New Zealand and soup kitchens. He spent 14 minutes talking about those things, and then in one minute made just a glancing reference to the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). The contribution from the Leader of the House indicates the complete contempt that this Government has for trying to have high standards in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Standards need to apply in public life for three reasons: firstly, because our citizens and future generations look to the Parliament and look to executive government and to senior public figures for leadership and behaviour; secondly, many people will treat the law and the obligations of the citizenship casually if they feel our leaders have failed them; and, thirdly, the economy, investment and employment will quickly decline if investors, savers and consumers lose confidence in the way the society functions. Many people in this community feel badly let down by the failure of this Government to adhere to high standards of public administration. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) has detailed the shameless performance of the Government in what has become known as WA Inc., and he has also chronicled the Kirribilli conspiracy with its double dealing, deception and lying. But that is only the beginning. This Government of deals has also been involved with shady transactions in Victoria and South Australia. In time, the role of the failed ex-Treasurer in the State Bank of Victoria and Pyramid fiascos will become known, as will the extent of his interference in the affairs of the State Bank of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government has betrayed the people by the naked ambition of its leaders. We are currently witnessing, in the fight over the leadership of the Australian Labor Party, a gross, selfish and scandalous display of power politics. We are witnessing a leader who will do anything to hold onto power and we are witnessing a challenger whose faction and its managers openly associate with thugs and frauds. It is demonstrably impossible for our citizens to view this power play with other than the greatest contempt. </PARA>
<PARA>  How can high standards be maintained when our citizens look at the Labor Party and see not promotion by merit, but promotion based on the factional system? As a result of the deception and deals by the Government, citizenship and its obligations are degraded in the public mind. When people look to this Government, what do they see? They see deals done with the trade union movement. And I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the so-called accord is not a deal done between the ACTU and the Government; it is a deal done between the ACTU and the Labor Party. When they look at this Government, they see deals with big business mates. </PARA>
<PARA>  As my friend the honourable member for Higgins said, how on earth can we avoid the conclusion that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) put himself completely in the hands of the two witnesses to the Kirribilli conspiracy? When people look at this Government, they see the low standards in the Parliament, where the Government day after day abuses Question Time and where its public administration is so bad that, at the end of the session, it is forced to guillotine 30 or 40 pieces of legislation through the Parliament--every session. The absolute contempt with which this Government treats the Parliament is a further demonstration of its failure to adhere to high standards. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the people of Australia see a former Treasurer who treated the Australian Taxation Office with absolute contempt and pretended to live in Sydney to gain a few extra perks and when they see a Prime Minister who lied to keep power, is it any wonder they would also tend to treat casually their obligations to society?</PARA>
<PARA>  This failure in the Government's standards has led to gross mismanagement of our economy. Consumer confidence, which is a measure of how our citizens feel about the performance of the Government, is now the lowest in a generation. If people are not feeling good about their country and about themselves, there can be no prospect of an economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>  The investment figures in the Budget are phoney. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures on investment suggest a 20 per cent fall, not 11 per cent as forecast in the Budget. Without investment and without an improvement in consumer confidence, there will be no chance of the Government's improving the unemployment situation. Nothing can be more damaging for our society than this unemployment situation perpetrated on the community by this Government's failure to adhere to high standards of public administration. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia faces a bleak and dismal 12 months as public confidence continues to wane. If the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) thinks that unemployment will be 8 or 9 or 10 per cent for two years--as he says--what will the real figures be? The business community continues to shed jobs, and many of our senior business leaders say that retrenchments will continue for many months. We certainly could see unemployment rising to 12 per cent and it may go even higher. The billboards around Australia which say that Labor is not working, and neither are nearly one million Australians, may soon be cruelly out of date. </PARA>
<PARA>  Long term unemployment is now the highest since the 1930s, and the failure of the Government in its standards of public administration will savagely affect the families involved. It is the unemployed who are the greatest testament to the failure of this Government. As the months roll on and as unemployment increases, so will consumer confidence continue to suffer and so will investment continue to fall. This Government, which has created the debt trap for our nation, is in the process of creating an unemployment trap with all the social misery that follows from it. All the deals done by this corrupt Government only serve to emphasise its failure to adhere to high standards of public administration. All these arrangements reached in secret, such as the Kirribilli conspiracy and WA Inc., serve only to degrade further the reputation of this Government in the eyes of the citizens. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government has let down the people of Australia and future generations because of the scandals in Western Australia, Victoria and South Australia, because of the privileges granted to the ACTU, because of its deals done with its mates, and because of all its political appointments. The manifestation of the failure of the Government is falling consumer confidence, declining business investment and rising unemployment. Australia can no longer afford this Government. All the grubby arrangements have now so eroded public confidence in the Government that it is no longer in a position to administer the affairs of the nation. While the leadership struggle continues, while the role of the ex-Treasurer in all the murky arrangements around the country remains unclear, and while the decisions of the Government are based not on high standards of public administration but on the naked power play unfolding before our eyes--while this goes on and while more of the Government's deals come to light--there can be no public confidence in our future. This Government stands condemned for its failure to adhere to high standards of public administration and the damage this has caused to the confidence of the people, to the prospects for economic growth and to unemployment. </PARA>

My problem is when he walks into this Parliament and attacks the rights of people who belong to the Textile Workers Union or the Clothing Trades Union. They can never hope to make the sort of income that the members of the Victorian legal profession make. The honourable member knows it and I know it. He talks about sleazy deals, morality and the difficulties in Victoria. Everybody knows that in Victoria the principal bagman for the Liberal Party for years was John Elliott. At a time when our farmers are desperately in need of a major mercantile operation, where is that operation? Elders fell into Elliott's fold, and that was the last we heard of it in terms of the real role it ought to be playing on behalf of the primary producers of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave-- The tabling of this report is a significant event in the context of Australia's relations with China. For the first time, the Chinese Government, of its own volition, was prepared to open up its judicial and social system to critical review by a foreign state. Until this occurred, the Chinese Government had always maintained that human rights was a matter for domestic policy and therefore not subject to international comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The events of Tiananmen Square in June 1989 and the pro-democracy movement of the same period have obviously set a new agenda--not only for the world in its attitude towards China, but in the manner in which the Chinese Government responds to growing world concern about human rights issues. Having said that, it is important to recall that when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) visited China last year--relatively soon after the events of June 1989--he also raised the issue of human rights. At that time, the Australian Government was less than enthusiastic about the Leader of the Opposition's visit. It was only later that the human rights issue assumed such importance in Australia's foreign policy in regard to China. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nevertheless, it is important to see this issue in the context of the broader, long term relationship between Australia and China--a relationship which must, at all times, be carefully crafted to ensure that there is adequate balance between the interests of China and those of Australia in the pursuit of common goals, which must have as their result the economic and social advancement of our peoples and, above all, the stability of the region.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am unaware of any Australian delegation containing members of this Parliament which has left these shores better prepared. We had the benefit of an in-depth consultation with sinologists, academics and interest groups involved in human rights--in particular, the relations with Tibet. The delegation was hand-picked to ensure that it represented a good balance between parliamentary representation, legal, human rights and diplomatic expertise. The fact that three members of the delegation were fluent Mandarin speakers and one fluent in Tibetan demonstrated clearly to the Chinese and Tibetan authorities that this was not any ordinary delegation, but one which was quite capable of assessing for itself the evidence placed before it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to commend all my colleagues on the delegation--Senator Chris Schacht, Senator Vicki Bourne, Professor Stephen Fitzgerald, Professor Alice Erh-Soon Tay, Mr Chris Sidoti, Mr Jon Sheppard, Dr Richard Rigby and Mr Kevin Garratt--for the professional manner in which the delegation was conducted over what were at times physically exhausting and difficult exercises. I would also like to thank the hundreds of Chinese officials and interlocutors who assisted us on this unique venture. Somewhat to their surprise, they found that we were more interested in asking questions than listening to set piece explanations which undoubtedly assisted us to gain a better understanding of Chinese Government policy and the implementation of its laws, and on their side a better understanding of why the rest of the world questions some of the policies that are conducted by the Chinese Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  Throughout its discussions and contacts during the visit, the delegation pursued lines of inquiry consistent with the agreed objectives and the international human rights policy of the Australian Government. Particular attention was given to the extent of political rights and democratic freedoms now existing in China; the implications of the June 1989 crackdown on political dissent and the fate of political dissidents; the human rights situation in Tibet; Chinese law and practice relating to human rights; judicial procedures and investigative processes; religious freedom; use of the death penalty; and aspects of family planning policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The delegation was particularly interested in the status of civil and political rights in the wake of the pro-democracy movement of mid- 1989. According to Amnesty International, hundreds of political detainees are still being held without charge or trial, including many who were detained following the events of 4 June 1989, even allowing for recent releases. Other prisoners, both before and after June 1989, have been sentenced for counter-revolutionary crimes against the state. Unfortunately, despite our efforts, we were unable to meet any of these detainees, nor assess at first hand their prison conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>  The delegation took the opportunity to urge the Chinese Government to become a party to the major international human rights instruments. We were pleased to be advised that the question of signature and ratification was currently under consideration and that the Party Centre Committee had instructed that human rights must be researched and studied, and, hopefully, as far as we are concerned, applied. </PARA>
<PARA>  The delegation made representations to the Chinese Government on a large number of human rights cases, mostly prisoners of conscience imprisoned following the political dissent of 1989, and the disturbances in Tibet of 1987 to 1990. Many of these cases had been raised previously by the Australian embassy in Beijing. Our representations were received by the Chinese authorities and, for the first time, information was provided on a small number of individuals. Further responses were promised. </PARA>
<PARA>  The delegation also examined, in some detail, the Chinese system of law, which remains relatively undeveloped and therefore quite confusing, both to the Chinese people and to outsiders seeking to deal with China. The legal system includes formal laws passed at national or provincial level, local laws, rules and regulations and large numbers of administrative guidelines and procedures. The greatest difficulty is that many of these laws and guidelines are not public. Often, therefore, a person will not know that he or she has infringed a law until after the infringement has occurred. This deprives people of any sense of certainty in their dealings with the Chinese state apparatus. </PARA>
<PARA>  The delegation accepts that there remain fundamental differences in its interpretations of human rights in China and the perspectives of the Chinese Government. Nevertheless, we emphasised that respect for human rights is not incompatible with social and economic growth, which are China's modern goals; indeed, we argued that respect for human rights is essential if those goals are to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>  Clearly, there are those within China who wish to see an improvement in the way the state treats its citizens, and contacts such as the delegation's visit will constitute an encouragement to those elements. The delegation did not expect to bring about sudden or dramatic change in China through its visit, but it is hopeful that it can contribute to a long term process. </PARA>
<PARA>  The delegation was satisfied that its visit advanced the process of dialogue between Australia and China on human rights issues of mutual concern. A proposal by the delegation to continue the process through the establishment of a standing joint working group on human rights was not accepted by the Chinese authorities but Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji told the delegation that the Chinese Government regarded the channel for ongoing discussion as being both formal and open. The Vice- Premier also invited the delegation to make a further follow-up visit to China. We were satisfied that in accepting the visit and engaging in constructive dialogue, the Chinese Government has acknowledged that human rights issues have a legitimate place on the international agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>  I should also take this occasion to note that the issue was not all one way. During our discussions with the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing we also had lengthy discussions with the senior director of the Consulate Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs concerning the plight of Chinese students either studying in Australia or who had applied to study in Australia. I would like to give the House some statistics relating to this matter. According to the Chinese authorities, at the moment there are 42,000 Chinese students in Australia to be made up of 2,000 State-sponsored students and 40,000 self-funded language students. We were told that new government regulations regarding foreign students and the bankruptcy of many language schools had caused many difficulties for Chinese students in Australia and for Chinese students still in China who had paid deposits which they had subsequently lost. </PARA>
<PARA>  The issue arose as to the extent to which the Australian Government was to be held responsible for the outcome and for compensation to be made payable. I merely want to make the point quite clearly to the House that this was a matter of considerable embarrassment to us in Beijing and it is a matter which the Australian Government undoubtedly must overcome at the first available opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>  I said that I would like to reiterate that Australia's program was an attempt to give bona fide students a way to learn English. I said that unfortunately many people posing as students had used it as a means of illegal immigration. I reminded the Chinese authorities that illegal immigration was a political issue in Australia and that illegal immigrants now exceeded 100,000 in Australia, and said that Australia wants the students to return to China to take part in China's economic construction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Opposition welcomes the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill. I note that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) is in the House, though shortly must leave. There has been a fairly bipartisan approach to the Gulf war commitment and the necessary legislation to put in place provisions which were not originally promised by the Government, although it has ultimately agreed to them, concerning eligibility for new defence home loans assistance for members of the defence forces who served operationally during the Gulf war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Opposition will not oppose this legislation, but I would like to put a number of matters to the House. Firstly, as I have said before, I was privileged to visit our defence forces in the Gulf around Christmas time last year and to visit, specifically, HMAS Sydney and HMAS Brisbane and see first hand their conditions. That was just before the commencement of those hostilities, and I wished them well at that critical time. Certainly, I will never forget all that I saw on that occasion. I will never forget the professionalism of the Australian defence forces' personnel as they faced a very uncertain circumstance at that time. I reiterate my commendation of the contribution made by the Navy, in particular--and all serving personnel, including those on exchange and those from the Army and the Air Force and in other liaison positions--to the Australian commitment to the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, I have since learnt that there were elements of the Air Force in the Gulf. They were there pursuant to the operation of the Hercules squadron. That was not highlighted by the Government throughout the period of the Gulf war. I have looked at some of the statements made. That their service was significant is manifested by the fact that there is at least one Air Force officer walking around this country with a Gulf medal arising from his service in the Gulf, not as a liaison officer at Riyadh or Cyprus, and not in any exchange role, but as a full time officer serving with his RAAF unit. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reason I mention this is to seek an absolute assurance from the Minister in his summing up, and in other comments that might be made here or in the Senate, that everybody is picked up, including those who gave semi-secret service, nevertheless service which has now become evident, while attached with the Royal Australian Air Force in the Gulf. It is important that this dimension, this additional commitment, be recognised by the Parliament quite apart from the service given by all those other units, such as the diving clearance teams. </PARA>
<PARA>  I assume that the provisions of the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill will encompass those from the RAAF. I would be very interested to hear exactly how many from the Royal Australian Air Force qualified for recognition of their Gulf service. I am not aware that the Parliament has been told a great deal about that particular dimension. I salute the role of the RAAF and its Hercules aircraft, as I do the role of the Army, and particularly, as I mentioned, the role of the Navy. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a former shadow Minister for veterans' affairs--a position now held very capably by Senator Jocelyn Newman--I want to say that it was the 1988 coalition veterans' affairs policy which did a lot to bring forward the flexibility and privatisation of the home loans operation for Defence Force personnel. It was a sensible way to go. It was one which, incidentally, the Government resisted for a lengthy period when at all times its written policy was the privatisation of that activity and the Defence Force's home loans corporation. It is now a matter of record that two major banks are now involved in the operation of the Defence Force home loans assistance schemes. Those two banks have picked up the operation with some initial difficulty but now with a general acceptance of these arrangements which make more efficient the delivery of this assistance to personnel who, by virtue of their service for their country, face a good deal of disruption. This is why this legislation is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, there remains the question of the Brisbane battalions, 6 RAR and 8/9 RAR. These are two very important units of the Australian Army. They now face dissolution as a consequence of a decision announced by the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, that we are going to have only four operationally capable battalions in Australia, a reduction of one-third from the existing six. The decision to abolish 6 RAR and 8/9 RAR is wrong in practice, is wrong in theory and is one which the Liberal and National parties reject. I also put it to the House that that decision was going to be worked through over a period of time and we have now learnt that it will now apply, following a very sharp cut in its timetable, from January next year. Of course there is a role for the Army Reserve and the Ready Reserve deployment units and the like, things which the Opposition will monitor very closely, but we still need a minimum core capability in respect of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and in particular for our infantry battalions. </PARA>
<PARA>  Certainly, Australia should not take for granted the stability of its region; Australia should not take for granted the stability of the climate in the region; and Australia should not take for granted the physical stability of the region relating to the earthquake factor, in the knowledge that our friends across the Tasman in New Zealand were rocked in the last few days by a major earthquake with some damage. I extend my sympathy to New Zealand in that regard. In other words, a nation never knows in peacetime or in the lead-up to war--and let us hope that that will not be seen again--whether it will suddenly need operational battalions ready to go, not those which comprise reserves or even ready reserves, but ones on the ground and ready to go with a deployment capability of hours, as in six hours or 12 hours, rather than some longer period. </PARA>
<PARA>  This situation in which we are left with two battalions in Townsville, including the excellent 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, and two battalions in Sydney--that being all in the whole of Australia as far as our Army is concerned--is a matter of considerable concern and one which the Government should think about in terms of the defence capability of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The history of the world and the region written for the 1990s will record the fact that we started in the 1990s talking about peace dividends and peace in our time, and then immediately went through a phase where a large number of nations were involved in war--the Gulf war--when for a lengthy period there was anything but peace in the world. Even as we speak today, notwithstanding all that has happened in Russia, there is the situation in Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not propose to detain the House unduly with comments on this legislation, which is indeed supported by the Liberal and National parties, but I make the point that we will live to rue the day that we slashed the operational capability of the Australian Army from six to four battalions. I find that offensive, regrettable, and it is opposed very much by the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill, of course, will pick up the veterans who have been mentioned and provide a minimum subsidy period of 16 years for members with service in the Middle East operational area, including Iraq and Kuwait. It has a cut-off date of 9 June 1991 for operational service in that area and takes a number of consequential decisions through the Parliament. As such, we support and welcome this legislation, and my colleague Senator Jocelyn Newman will make further comments in detail on this legislation when the matter is debated in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- I appreciate the comments of the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) in support of this legislation. I will not rebut his remarks on the general issue of defence policy, but during the course of my speech I will raise some issues which I am sure will be of interest to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill because in my electorate, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have a large and growing population of service personnel and their families. Figures supplied to me recently show in excess of 2,100 service personnel resident in the Northern Territory, many of whom are accompanied by their families. </PARA>
<PARA>  The defence service homes scheme was established in 1918 as the war service homes scheme for Australian soldiers and their dependants. It was later extended to include World War II, Korea, Malaya, Vietnam and other active service areas. In 1972 benefits were extended to those with qualifying peacetime service, and the scheme was renamed the defence service homes scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1988 the Commonwealth contracted Westpac Banking Corporation as the lender for the scheme and provided an interest subsidy on loans delivered by Westpac. The current Government again took the initiative in May of this year when it announced the Australian defence force home loans scheme administered by the Defence Housing Authority for those who enlisted after May 1985. We now seek to amend that scheme with this Bill; the reason is plain, and I will come to that in a moment. I was rather amused by the assertions of the Leader of the National Party that in fact the changes that were initially made to this legislation were as a result of impetus coming from the Opposition benches. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members will recall, as has been suggested by the Leader of the National Party, the unease that events which transpired in the Middle East earlier this year had on the Australian community. For a period of many months the world watched as the activities of a despot in Iraq seemed to be drawing us into an inevitable conflict. None of us knew what to expect of that conflict. We knew of the reports of super guns, chemical and germ warfare stockpiles and even the possibility of nuclear weapons. We knew then, as we know now, of the horrors of war and of what happens in an armed conflict of that type, and most importantly we could observe the impact in terms of loss of human life--soldiers, sailors, air service personnel, civilians, family members, loved ones and friends. All were lost during the course of this campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>  So we watched and waited with a great deal of anticipation and we participated through our representatives in the United Nations, as time and time again that international body called for an end to the madness, implored Saddam Hussein to withdraw his forces illegally occupying Kuwait, condemned his actions and placed sanctions in an effort to force his withdrawal. We demanded the release of the hostages Hussein had taken and was using to shield his facilities and we saw valiant efforts by international negotiators to obtain their freedom. </PARA>
<PARA>  We all know what happened. The calls made on Saddam Hussein were refused. He scoffed at international justice, and every attempt at reconciliation was rebuffed by this despot. Finally, following the largest military build-up in history, the final sanction was applied and war was waged with Hussein's Iraqi forces. It was into this conflict that Australian service personnel were sent. I note in the speech of the Leader of the National Party that he acknowledged the warships and other elements of the defence forces that were there during that conflict. </PARA>
<PARA>  The important thing for us to acknowledge--and this legislation does that--is that another generation of Australians have experienced that sickening feeling of watching our service personnel go off to war, the sickening feeling of not knowing whether or not they would come back. Another group of young men and women entered a conflict, knowingly and willingly but with trepidation, the outcome of which there was very little doubt but the consequences of which no-one could be sure. That of course is the measure of the duty and discipline and the honour of serving in the defence forces for this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  Over 1,630 Australians served in the Middle East during the conflict with Iraq, on our ships, as medical personnel or fulfilling other roles, as mentioned by the Leader of the National Party. Our personnel came home. They were welcomed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and by the Australian people, and we are, of course, extremely grateful and fortunate that they came home without any dramatic injuries and without loss of life. They had not been harmed, yet they had done their job and they had gone there willingly to serve their country. Whilst there they served with a great deal of distinction and honour, and we are proud of the role they played. </PARA>
<PARA>  But, of course, a grateful nation does not forget; and this Government has not forgotten. The Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill will set in place one of the marks of our gratitude for the risks they took and the way in which they carried out their assigned tasks. The Bill is not aimed just at service personnel who were in the Gulf conflict; it is in fact for all service personnel who have gone on operational service, but it is particularly pertinent to those who served in the Gulf. The amendments will, firstly, waive the requirement for a six-year service period before becoming eligible to enter the scheme for members who transfer from the defence service homes scheme and will have a corresponding waiver under that scheme because they have had operational service. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendments will provide a minimum subsidy period of 16 years for members with service in the Middle East operational area; they will include Iraq and Kuwait in the Middle East operational area and set up a cut- off date of 9 June 1991 for operational service in that area; and, finally, they will ensure that benefits available to persons with operational service, including service in the Middle East operational area, flow on to their widows and widowers. </PARA>
<PARA>  A number of issues are relevant in this context. Whilst there was a great deal of discussion in the Australian community about the merits or otherwise of sending Australian forces into the Middle East, it was abundantly clear that there was a feeling across the community that we should show the appropriate amount of gratitude to those people who served there. No-one--even those who were the most fierce opponents of our involvement--wanted any harm to come to our service men and women and I am sure all of those people will support the measures contained in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think, from a very personal point of view, that another matter is important. I anticipate that an increasing number of people who are currently serving in the defence forces will choose to make their homes in the Northern Territory after they retire from the defence forces. I anticipate that, having made that very important and, I might say, correct decision, they will avail themselves of this scheme in order to purchase properties in the Northern Territory. I know already of armed services personnel who are nearing retirement age--at least in terms of the defence forces--and who are seeking to spend their retirement in the Northern Territory. I encourage them to do so. I think they already appreciate the benefits of living in what is probably--certainly from my point of view--the best part of Australia. They already appreciate the benefits of the friendliness of a community which welcomes the defence forces in a very open and happy way. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst I am on this subject I would like to take the opportunity to refer more generally to the matter of defence housing, particularly as it relates to my electorate. I note in the Commonwealth Public Account, Budget Paper No. 2 circulated by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), that the total amount allocated for defence housing in 1991-92 is $268,245,000. That is an increase of some $20m from the previous year. When added to the amount allocated for defence facilities construction, acquisition and leasing--another $407.5m in 1991-92, giving a combined total of $675.7m--it is easy to see the importance of the defence budget to the construction industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is particularly so in the Northern Territory at a time when the Defence Force presence is being built up with elements of the defence forces moving to the Northern Territory throughout the next decade. In the forthcoming financial year the Department of Defence will spend $47m on capital works in the Northern Territory. I need not point out to anyone in this House--or, indeed, anyone in the Northern Territory--the advantages which will flow to local industry from that capital investment. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I have mentioned previously, a large and growing number of service personnel and their families live happily in the Northern Territory as part of our community. As a result of the deployment of units, including the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, to the Northern Territory our population will grow by an additional 5,000 by the end of this century. That is equal to another small town in the Northern Territory. The Defence Housing Authority already has some 840 houses in Darwin and a further 400 houses at Tindal, including 200 at Katherine east. The Authority owns 31 blocks of vacant land at Palmerston and construction will begin soon on 10 new homes. As a result of the force structure review, a brigade headquarters will be based in Darwin from the mid to late 1990s to command cavalry, armoured, mechanised infantry, aviation and logistic units. </PARA>
<PARA>  The known requirements of this move include the present relocation of an additional 60 families to Darwin by December this year; the need for some 205 houses for members of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment from October 1992; and an additional requirement of approximately 700 houses over the next decade. That of course means a great deal to the Northern Territory construction industry because, as you would appreciate Mr Deputy Speaker, an influx of 5,000 people to a community of 170,000 people will have an enormous impact. The multiplier effects will be felt throughout the community. I have digressed in order to mention some of these points as I do not think we can fail to acknowledge the very great importance of the Defence Force budget to the economy of the Northern Territory and, indeed, the entire country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendments sought through this Bill will give service personnel who qualify additional assistance in buying, building or enlarging their own homes. It extends relief assistance to widows and allows for essential repairs to defence service homes. In extending the benefits to a person who has served this country in the Gulf conflict, we are doing what is expected, indeed demanded, by a country which is grateful to those men and women who served us with such distinction in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a number of aspects which one could go to in the context of this legislation. I think it is pertinent to remind the House--as I have done briefly--of how the home loan benefit can be utilised by Defence Force personnel. We should be reminded that housing loans have increased to $25,000; there is the defence service home loan annual interest rate of 6.85 per cent over a term of 25 years; and it is subsidised by the Government to the market rate, which is currently, as I understand it, around 13.85 per cent. These loans are portable from home to home. A person can buy or build a house, complete or enlarge an existing home, enter a retirement village if that is required, use the loan for essential additional accommodation, for relief assistance for widows, or for essential repairs to the DSH home. </PARA>
<PARA>  I raise that issue because I wonder what the impact on those people would be if one were to impose a goods and services tax. Whilst I expect that all Opposition speakers will support this initiative, I think it is relevant to refer to a document by the Business Council of Australia entitled Some Issues in the Consumption Tax Debate. </PARA>

<PARA>  I refer back to the discussion paper of the Business Council of Australia which is entitled Some Issues in the Consumption Tax Debate. This paper notes that the sales tax on building materials comprised just 1.4 per cent of all sales tax collected. The effective wholesale sales tax rate on the housing sector is estimated to total no more than 7.4 per cent--roughly half, or perhaps one-third, of what will be paid under a consumption tax. That means that the coalition could rely not just on the elimination of sales tax to reduce the costs in the housing sector, but there will have to be large personal or company tax cuts to go on with as well. Eric Risstrom from the Australian Taxpayers Association has noted that it is difficult to see the figures adding up. (Quorum formed)</PARA>

On a number of occasions I have taken the opportunity in this place to ask that question because, although we hear rhetoric--if I can use that word loosely--that indicates that the Government has a concern for veterans, when it comes to action that is translated into legislation, we do not see it. I take the opportunity every time I can to stand up in this place and speak on behalf of the veterans community, because to me it is a very important part of the population. It has been important and it remains important. Other members have already said in this debate how recent events have brought home to us the importance of those who are prepared to go and serve this country at war--to put their lives at risk to preserve the freedom that others have preserved on previous occasions. They are a very important part of the community and deserve great consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In his remarks the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) made the point that recently this House debated a ministerial statement entitled Defence Into The Twenty- First Century. In that paper there were some glaring deficiencies regarding the Government's treatment of defence and, indeed, the suggestion that the blueprint that it presented to us, which was to take us into the twenty- first century, was in many respects deficient. The Opposition said as much in that debate. </PARA>
<PARA>  The relevance of that debate to the Defence Force home loans assistance scheme is that I believe it shows the Government's true colours when it comes to its concern for the veterans community. What greater slap in the face can there be to war veterans than to have a Government in place that is consistently downgrading the importance of the defence of this country? That is an indefensible proposition from the point of view of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  I hope some speakers from the Government side of the House will demonstrate to us that they are concerned about the veterans community, because any veterans who look at what they have done to preserve freedom in this country and who then measure that against the Government's future directions for defence would be very concerned indeed that in laying their lives on the line they have in fact been done a disservice by a government that consistently wants to downgrade the importance of defence. </PARA>
<PARA>  That fact has been demonstrated in the latest Budget. In recent years there has been virtually zero growth in defence in real terms and in the statement Defence Into The Twenty-First Century we have seen a real threat to the future viability of Australia's defence forces. There is the suggestion that the regular component will be downgraded by some 10,000 personnel. We are not quite sure what it will be replaced with--a new idea, a new ready reserve, something that we have not heard of to any extent before. It has been tried in a couple of other countries and has not succeeded there; however, it will work in this country. Overnight, the existing reserve will become the third grade of the Army. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe this is the real test as far as this Government's attitude to the veterans is concerned: what is it doing for defence? In other words, what is it doing to ensure that what the veterans have fought for will be preserved? I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there is indeed some real doubt as to whether this Government has a genuine commitment to veterans affairs and to veterans. I do not say that lightly and I do not reflect, necessarily, on the integrity of the current Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) in this regard. But I do not believe that the runs are on the board. The Government demonstrates a lack of commitment and a lack of concern. </PARA>
<PARA>   The Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990, which we dealt with last year, brought in a new scheme in response to the so-called Cross report. I do not think that there was any doubt at the time that changes were necessary; that there needed to be a number of improvements wrought in the existing scheme for service personnel. There were some very significant changes. However, I say in passing that there was considerable confusion in the interregnum in regard to the two schemes. In fact, that confusion remains. I have many friends in the defence services and I have a significant Army base in my electorate, so I come in contact with defence people frequently. Despite the best efforts of the people involved, the banks and the defence service homes personnel and so on, there remains considerable confusion about the overlapping of the two schemes. That confusion remains despite the best efforts of the people involved to sell the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even a letter from the Chief of the Defence Force was widely circulated, basically as a part of the marketing of the changeover to the scheme. There was a good deal of documentation, for example, a fairly comprehensive document asking, `Which home loan scheme is best for you? Some questions and answers to help you decide'. Yet, despite the best efforts of all these people, there remains a considerable amount of confusion about where we are heading. </PARA>
<PARA>  We note the significant changes between the old scheme and the new scheme. For example, the amount that could be borrowed has been increased. I do not think there is any doubt about that being necessary; the $25,000 is clearly inadequate in today's market. Under the new scheme the amount that may be borrowed increases to $40,000. Both the new scheme and the old scheme allow a maximum repayment period of 25 years. There is no particular problem with that. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, the interest rate subsidy is very complicated under the latest scheme. Under the old scheme, although there was a scale of interest rates, that amounted effectively to a flat 6.85 per cent interest for the entire loan period. But under the new scheme the Government subsidy is 40 per cent of the market interest rate. The serving member is then expected to pay the other 60 per cent. However, the subsidy is available only for 20 of the 25 years of the loan period. I actually have a defence service home loan myself, so I have taken quite an active interest in how it all hangs together. But on that particular point there still remains some confusion. I assume that what is intended is that after the 20 years, if one has a 25-year loan, one will be required to pay the full market interest rate. I cannot read it in any other way. There is confusion in respect of that. </PARA>
<PARA>  The service period necessary to qualify for a loan is also different in respect of the revised scheme that we dealt with last year and the current scheme. The franchise for the new scheme is picked up by the National Australia Bank, whereas the previous scheme remains in the hands of Westpac. There may be an element of confusion in respect of that. The other change that I found very difficult to understand, although I am sure the Minister has a simple answer to it--but I have not yet heard it--is that the old scheme continues to be administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, while the new scheme is administered by the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA>  I put in context the elements of change that we have gone through. Some of the change is certainly for the better; although some, I must say, I have some doubts about. I cannot help feeling in respect of the new interest rate arrangements, for instance, that somehow the veterans are going to be worse off ultimately rather than better off under that arrangement. Of course, the answer to that is that it depends how interest rates move. I have done some calculations in terms of current market rates and it seems to me that veterans will miss out here to some extent, although as interest rates go up and down the subsidy will move one way or the other as well. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, we applauded the availability of the two loans to married eligible members--the $80,000. Incidentally, that did not come without a good deal of pressure from the Opposition and from the veterans community. That was something that the Government was slow to recognise. I make the point again that we have before us legislation which effectively addresses one or two major glaring deficiencies in last year's legislation. However, when we come to this present change, we see that there was no provision in the legislation last year for a war service loan as such. That was pointed out by the Opposition on a number of occasions. It clearly was a glaring oversight or a mistake. It was a serious mistake. </PARA>
<PARA>  The objective of the two schemes, the defence service home loans schemes mark I and mark II, is in part to attract and retain service personnel. Most honourable members would be aware of the difficulties that service personnel face in their daily lives. In many respects theirs is a transient existence. One does not have the opportunity that the average member of the community has to set up home in a particular place. There is, of course, constant dislocation and the consequential pressures on families that that brings with it. I do not think that there is doubt in anyone's minds that those difficulties ought to be recognised by the provision of a scheme such as the one we are talking about today. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, it really goes beyond that--very much beyond that--because we are also talking about rewarding those people who actually go overseas to serve and put their lives at risk for their country. In that sense, a war service loan of some sort is a part of that package. There are other ways in which service personnel are rewarded and given special recognition for that overseas service. As I said before, having come back from Vietnam as a returned serviceman, I had the benefit of a war service loan. Looking back on the experience, I can say that that was certainly an attractive feature of having served one's country in that way--having access to that loan and a number of resettlement benefits as a national serviceman at the time. Certainly, the war service home loan component is something that I valued. Incidentally, it has come in very handy to me in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA>  The current legislation corrects the situation, particularly in respect of those service personnel who served in the Gulf. They were clearly on active service; clearly at risk. We are thankful they all came back. We assume that those service personnel who are still there in the Gulf--there are a significant number--will also come back unharmed by the experience. But notwithstanding that, they were at considerable risk. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has been an element in the community suggesting that those personnel were there for only a short time and were not at risk. I had the pleasure of meeting personnel of both HMAS Sydney and HMAS Brisbane when they came back into Brisbane. In talking to the Navy personnel there it was clear that they were affected by the emotional experience of every moment of the day not knowing whether they might be subject to some sort of air attack or whether they might run into a mine during the night and find themselves in the water. So there was trauma. There needed to be a special recognition of the fact that those people had been on active service. </PARA>
<PARA>  This legislation corrects the situation so that those who served in the Gulf, many of whom enlisted after the operative date for the new scheme, 14 May 1985, will get a war service loan. As the Leader of the National Party, who spoke first for the Opposition in this debate, said, of course we applaud that action, although we say that it is belated. It corrects what was a glaring and serious oversight in the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  In criticising this aspect of the Government's handling of veterans' affairs, amongst other things, we say that this legislation with which we are dealing today would not have been necessary if the Government had heeded the advice of the coalition in our previous debate. But, for some reason which is not any clearer to me today than it was some months back, the Government went ahead without making any special provision for a war service loan for Gulf personnel. The Government has effectively compounded the error--also for reasons which escape me--by failing to include within this legislation provisions for war service loans on an ongoing basis. There is some irony in the fact that we were dealing with the previous legislation at a time when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was down at the docks, waving goodbye to our first contingent of Gulf sailors. </PARA>
<PARA>  Speaking of irony, today we are talking about something that amounts to a quick fix. It does not remedy the fact that under current legislation, for the first time since World War I, Australian service personnel who serve in war are not eligible for a war service loan specifically in recognition of the fact that they are going overseas and putting their lives on the line for their country. I think that is deplorable--it is not even understandable. I hope that the Minister, when he gets the opportunity, will explain to me, and to others in the veteran community who are interested, why the Government is not prepared to entrench in legislation--and why it is not prepared to do it on this occasion--an entitlement to a war service loan for service men and women who serve overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill does fix the situation--and we support that fact--in respect of sailors who served in the Gulf war. We are glad to see that, but it is not before time. We are appalled that the Government did not act sooner in respect of that. When the Government sent our forces away to the Gulf war, there was no assurance that, if they were killed in action, they or their spouses would receive the benefits that they deserved. It was an unsatisfactory situation--we said so at the time--and we are pleased that it is being rectified. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- It is a great honour and pleasure to immediately follow the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), who always has something to say on very important Bills that apply to members of the Defence Force. As may have been gathered from his comments, he is well qualified to speak in this regard, having been a member of our forces in Vietnam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It was also very good to hear the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) speaking loudly and clearly on behalf of the well-being of our defence forces. Both of them know very well the tremendous tragedy that followed the end of the war in Vietnam, in terms of the very delayed recognition of the forces who went to Vietnam. On occasions when I was part of the party welcoming home the groups from the Gulf, I could not help thinking what a contrast it was to the welcome home that those who played a very significant part in Vietnam had to endure--almost climbing over the back fence at night so that nobody knew they were coming home. We hope that that disgrace will never be repeated in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate on the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991. I am delighted that at last the Government has recognised, in a way that is appropriate and fitting for any government of this country, those men and women who saw active service during the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA>  Within the electorate of Macquarie is situated the largest Royal Australian Air Force transport base in Australia, which is staffed by about 3,000 members of the forces. This base, located at Richmond, plays a vital role in the effective functioning of our defence forces. I am proud of the very fine men and women who serve our country at that base in a variety of roles. </PARA>
<PARA>  Earlier this year I was privileged to be a part of the group that welcomed home a number of personnel who served in the Gulf. The welcomes, organised by Air Commodore Stan Clarke and Group Captain Paul Rasmussan of the Richmond RAAF base, were worthy of and fitting for those people who served our country well in the most threatening of circumstances. I pay tribute to them for the very warm way in which that welcome was prepared. They had one of Australia's best military bands present--the operational command headquarters band, which is based at Richmond--playing many appropriate songs, not the least being our national song, to welcome home the troops as they came in proudly under the beautiful Australian flag--under which, they all told me, they were proud to serve. Although it has been said many times before in this House, those who participated in the Australian forces in the Gulf are to be commended for their commitment to our country and for the disciplined and understanding way in which they went about their duties. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill before us this afternoon rectifies a serious problem that was confronting the men and women whom I have just mentioned. When our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was farewelling our troops to the Gulf, he was doing so in full knowledge that for the first time in the history of this nation--since World War I, anyway--those troops would not be eligible for a war service loan on their return home. That was a disgraceful situation and, unfortunately, it proved once again that, even with all the Government's rhetoric on compassion and understanding, it neglects to give adequate consideration to those people who deserve it most--the men and women of our defence forces who are willing to die in the defence of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The defence home loans assistance scheme --or Defence Home Owner, as it has become known--like the old scheme, has been designed to provide members of the Defence Force with assistance in purchasing their own home, recognising the difficulty of doing so while serving. The new scheme departed from the old in that it did not provide for war service. For the first time since World War I, as I have mentioned, personnel who served in a war such as the Gulf war were not eligible for any special consideration. They were to be treated the same as they would be in peacetime. As most of those who served in the Gulf had joined prior to May 1985, they did not have the six years service that would normally have entitled them to take out a loan under the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note that, according to the Australian Defence Force family census of 1991, which arrived on my desk this morning, two-thirds of the Australian defence forces have less than 10 years service, while only 5.8 per cent have completed more than 20 years. In addition, the census showed that approximately 50 per cent of service personnel were married and that 25 per cent of all personnel chose to buy their own home. So the legislation about which we are talking, and these statistics, underscore the fact that this Bill is a very important amendment to existing legislation for most of those who served in the Gulf conflict, mainly because most probably they are at the stage in their lives at which home ownership is a priority. It appears that, when the legislation was originally drafted, no war involvement was envisaged. Therefore, the new loan scheme had no provision for war service, and that is where the problem arose. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased to see that the amendments ensure that benefits are available to persons with operational service, including service in the Middle East operational area, and that these flow on to their wives and widowers. This is a most important aspect of the Bill because it provides the additional security for dependants that one would expect to be written into defence force legislation. Ideally, I would have liked to see the entitlement for war service loans reinstated for all future war service. However, these amendments now before us are, indeed, a step in the right direction. I hope the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) gets the message about bringing them in as a permanent response to the expectations of those serving in the armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA>  I repeat that we can learn a lot from this experience. If the Government is serious about its commitment to the defence forces of this nation, then I would expect that the Minister and his colleagues will formulate an adequate package of benefits for all personnel who serve in future war situations well prior to their departure. There is no reason why arrangements could not be set in place such as occurred with the peacekeeping force in Namibia. Prior to the Australian contingent departing our shores, a complete package of benefits was made known to all personnel. I believe there is no reason why this could not be normal procedure. I again commend it to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is an important principle at stake here and it must not be overlooked. Military service is unique in nature, and service families should be able to enjoy the benefits of the society they are pledged to defend. Furthermore, the nature of the commitment of service members dictates to the Government a moral obligation to support them and their families perhaps more than members of any other group in our community. For far too long there has been a feeling amongst members of the defence community that they and the contribution they make in support of the Australian Defence Force are not valued, either within the service community or in the community generally. They perceive the service hierarchy as generally unsympathetic to the specific and special problems that service life, with its inflexibility in responding to problems, creates for a family. In spite of these perceptions, most people are very proud of their spouse's service career, but they see that career being pursued at a cost to family life that many Australians would not be prepared to tolerate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, as with the Bill before us this afternoon, the Government has a record of responding to crisis situations only-- situations that may become politically embarrassing, or could be politically enhancing, if one were to be cynical. The Government says that service life is unique, but insists that it be dealt with in the rigid Australian Council of Trade Unions accord. It says that it recognises the special demands on service personnel and their families, but its capacity to meet those demands and needs is constrained by its own inflexible industrial relations system. The Government wants to deal with defence personnel within the same system and on the same basis as it deals with waterside workers, which, in the mildest terms, is preposterous. It is the Government's inability or refusal to boost pay and conditions outside the accord which reflects the fundamental failure of its response. The Government's failure to deal with the uniqueness of service life and those problems signifies failure of leadership and failure to restore trust. The Government is driven by minimal public relations concerns and is ad hoc at the very best. </PARA>
<PARA>  To the extent that the Government fails to come to grips with the unique and serious problems within our defence forces, it fails to carry out its first responsibility as a Federal government, which is the defence of the country. When I speak of the very fine men and women at the Richmond RAAF base, I speak of men and women who are very capable technicians and tradesmen, who love their country, who choose to serve it in this way, but who are facing unfair and dangerous workloads and stressful family situations, and too often they see resignation as the only course. Up until recently, the separation rate from the defence forces has been alarming. Year after year, the resignation rate from the Services continued to climb. This is not the first time I have expressed my concern in this area. I have repeatedly expressed concern at the resignation rate and low morale, and I do so again today. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since the Government came to power in 1983, the separation rate has risen steadily from 6,485 in 1983 to a peak of 9,279 in 1989. Only in the last two years has the rate started to come down--and I mention that fact just in case anybody is thinking that I am not aware of it. Over the last 12 years, the only time the rate of separation decreased was at times of recession. The trend that has now appeared will support that fact. I believe it is a sad indictment of the Government when defence personnel choose to remain in the Services for job security only and are not encouraged to stay on for the right reasons. Therefore, one of the reasons why I am pleased to support these very valuable amendments this afternoon is that I hope they are a sign of a turning point for the Government and that it will be more consistent in treating the very dedicated service men and women who are prepared to die for this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I support the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill. Before I turn my remarks to the heart of the legislation, I would like to respond to a few comments made by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), who no doubt has spoken on this matter on many occasions in this House and who could be said by some to have more expertise in this area than me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The honourable member said that the Government was taking action in this area only when a crisis developed and that the Government had not addressed this in a comprehensive manner. He went on to say that the Government should do more and that he had repeatedly expressed concern about separation rates which he considered to be too high. He said that he thought the answer was an increase in the wages or salaries of defence service personnel. I hope I have accurately recounted his comments. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, it is easy for any members in this House--members of the Government or of the Opposition--to highlight a problem. When we think about the amount of money that the Australian Government invests in the training of Defence Force personnel, we would all agree that we ought to try to ensure that separation rates from the defence forces are as low as possible. There is no dispute about that, but the difficulty arises when the honourable member suggests that the answer is simply a wage increase. The honourable member attacked the Govern-ment's wages accord with the ACTU and says that that is the reason why the Government cannot provide the wage increase which he thinks is necessary for our Defence Force personnel. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sometimes it becomes a bit difficult to follow when we hear--as we heard last week--members of the Opposition make speeches on the Budget. We will probably hear a few more of them later tonight. They say that this Government is spending too much money and that the Government's deficit is too high. They say that the Opposition would cut back government spending and would produce a balanced Budget, and not the deficit which we have at the moment. Yet on the very same day, members of the Opposition who have the best of intentions--such as the honourable member for Macquarie--may say that the Government should increase the salaries and wages of Defence Force personnel. Frankly, I do not think the members of the Opposition have sat down and done their sums. They cannot now come into the House and say that Defence Force personnel deserve higher wages, that the submariners deserve better allowances and that the pilots deserve more money to stop them leaving the Air Force and being signed on by the commercial airlines, and later the same day come in here and say that this Government is spending too much money on social security. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The honourable member for Macquarie interjects, `But not on defence'. The honourable member is not only arguing that Defence Force expenditure should be quarantined from the general cut backs, which the Opposition says are necessary in other areas of government expenditure, but he also seems to be arguing that there should be a quite substantial increase in expenditure in the defence area so that the separation rates can be brought down. I suggest that the honourable member should enter some deep negotiations with the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who says he is going to produce a balanced Budget, and other members of the Opposition front bench who say that they intend to cut back government spending because, at the moment, there seems to be a bit of a contradiction between the view put forward by the honourable member and the senior members of the front bench on his side of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The honourable member for Macquarie says that there is no contradiction at all. I would not be surprised at the information he received from the shadow Treasurer because I doubt whether the shadow Treasurer understands the implications of his policy of having a balanced Budget. Cutting back government expenditure by $4.7 billion would have the obvious effect of deepening the recession, delaying the recovery and all of the other consequential effects on the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I will return to the immediate issue before the House; that is, the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991. As honourable members would be aware, this legislation provides for an improved benefit under the Defence Force home loans assistance scheme for those personnel who served during the Gulf war. The Defence Force home loans assistance scheme, commonly known as `Defence Home Loaner', provides a subsidised housing loan of $40,000 for members of the Defence Force who joined after 1985. At the moment, under the Defence Home Loaner, members of the Defence Force who become eligible can receive a subsidy of up to 40 per cent of the average interest rate that would normally apply, which is of substantial benefit to members of the Defence Force who happen to qualify.</PARA>
<PARA>  Before members of the Defence Force are eligible, they must satisfy an initial period of service of six years. That matter is addressed in this legislation. This legislation provides for the elimination of the six-year basic service period which is necessary before members with operational service become eligible for the assistance provided under this scheme. It is very important to understand that the legislation also provides a minimum benefit of 16 years subsidy regardless of the length of service which the defence personnel happen to have provided to the Australian community. This benefit also flows on to the widows or widowers of eligible members, something which deserves the support of both sides of this House. </PARA>
<PARA>  As this legislation deals with matters affecting the provision of subsidised loan assistance to veterans and members of the Defence Force, I wish to raise two issues that affect constituents in my electorate. The first case involves a veteran who had service during World War II. He and his wife were in a position recently where virtually all their life savings were taken away from them due to, I believe, the questionable activities of another person in my electorate. That case is now the subject of legal action before the courts, so I will not go into the finer points at this time.</PARA>
<PARA>  As the result of various actions, the consequences have been that this veteran, a service pensioner, and his wife virtually lost their life savings; in fact, they had to borrow money from their children and a credit union in my electorate simply to live in the house that they own. The only income for him and his wife was the service pension, a very modest income indeed. Because his savings had been appropriated by another person, it meant that he was, and still is, in great financial hardship. As this veteran had taken out a defence service home loan many years ago and paid it off he is now not eligible to obtain assistance under the defence service home loan which presently applies.</PARA>
<PARA>  I think that there is a very strong case in respect of people such as this and other veterans who find themselves in severe financial difficulties for the Minister to have the discretion to instruct the organisations which are now responsible for providing these subsidised loans to provide assistance. I know that these days there is a view amongst the bureaucracy, and sometimes in this chamber, that ministerial discretion should be restricted as far as possible because of various decisions that have been taken by the courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. However, I am certainly aware of a number of cases in my own electorate where veterans, often through no fault of their own, end up in severe financial difficulty and there is no way that they can receive a subsidised home loan to help get them out of difficulty under the legislation as it now stands. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am sure my friend the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) is also aware of cases where veterans have got themselves into financial difficulty through their own actions or actions taken by others which result in them or their widows and children being in severe financial hardship. I think that should be the test. We should give the Minister the discretion to provide subsidised housing loans up to the normal limit to people who end up in these sorts of difficulties. That is something which is obviously not addressed in this legislation, but I hope it will be addressed by the Minister and the Government at an early opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second case I wish to bring to the attention of the House concerns another constituent of mine who currently lives at Gwandalan in my electorate. He and his spouse previously had a subsidised loan under the defence service home loans scheme which they had paid out. They recently sought assistance from the Department to re-finance an existing mortgage. Unfortunately, they were told over the telephone--there is no written record of this--that this loan could not be re-financed because they did not meet the criteria which was set out for hardship assistance under the legislation. After receiving advice from the Vietnam Veterans Association, an organisation which looks after Vietnam veterans on the central coast, my constituent put in a written application and was correctly told that he was ineligible under the definition of the hardship criteria which were currently set. </PARA>
<PARA>  What has infuriated my constituent is that at the time he made the verbal inquiry with the people concerned he was eligible. Due to the financial hardship of my constituent, his spouse then went out and obtained some part time work. That has now raised the combined gross income for the family, which means that on the date of their written application they were no longer eligible. </PARA>
<PARA>  The bureaucracy could say that those people should have put in a written application at the time they were eligible--when the first telephone inquiry was made. We should have enough confidence in our Ministers to give them the discretion to look at the circumstances of cases such as this. A Minister can consider the impact of a refusal to provide a subsidised loan to a family. After weighing up all the issues involved, I think the Minister should have the right to instruct the people concerned to provide the subsidised loan. </PARA>
<PARA>  Ultimately, Ministers are answerable to this Parliament for the decisions they take. If a Minister were to misuse this discretion, which I believe should be given to him by this Parliament, he is answerable to this chamber. I believe that in recent days we have gone too far in restricting the discretion given to Ministers. I have outlined two cases today in broad terms so that the confidentiality of the veterans' applications are not breached. They are examples where there is a case for providing the Minister with greater discretion to assist needy veterans in difficult financial circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>  Having said that, I fully support the legislation which is currently before the House which aims to extend the assistance provided to those members of the Defence Force who served in the Gulf war. That assistance is something which Australia and this Parliament owe to those who served Australia at a time when the world, through the United Nations, argued that action had to be taken against an aggressor. That places an obligation on this Parliament and all Australians to ensure that the veterans who fulfilled their duty are rewarded with the entitlements and benefits to which I think they are entitled. I certainly support the legislation before the House. I am pleased to see that it looks like having the support of both sides of the House this afternoon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-  can assure the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) that the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill has our support because it was the Opposition which forced the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) into introducing this legislation. I am not at all surprised that he is looking for our support. Once again, my colleague Senator Newman has taken the lead in relation to the veterans. It is a crying shame that it is Senator Newman and not the Minister who must be constantly on guard to protect the rights of Australian veterans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In responding to my colleague the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), the honourable member for Dobell regrettably gave an indication that he does not appreciate that the Defence Force is a unique part of the Australian work force. I think it is quite ludicrous that he sought during his speech to minimise the value of our defence forces. I suppose in some respects we should be used to that attitude from the Government because it has sought to minimise the value of a great deal of the things we have taken for granted over a large number of years. To that extent I suppose he is excused for following the Government's line. But I am disappointed he has taken that point of view. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill makes various adjustments to the previous defence home loans assistance scheme. I will not go into the exact details, as no doubt speakers before me have addressed the matter, but I refer to a letter of 25 June 1991 from the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel to Senator Newman. It reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you for your letters of 11 and 19 February 1991 concerning the Australian Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Scheme (ADFHLAS), particularly with regard to Defence Force members on operational service in the Gulf. I apologise for the delay in replying. </PARA>
<PARA>This letter was written on 25 June. The letters that were written to him were dated 11 and 19 February, so I am not at all surprised that he was apologising for his delay in replying. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>As you may by now be aware, the Government has agreed to a revised home loan assistance benefit for members with operational service in the Middle East. This benefit will provide a minimum of 16 year's subsidy with no basic service requirement. In the event of the death of the member, these benefits will pass to the member's spouse. I expect that the necessary legislative amendments will be introduced in the Budget Session. </PARA>
<PARA>For the life of me I cannot work out why--as indicated by my colleague the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), I think it was, during the day--we have had this ludicrous situation in this House, since I have been here, whereby at the end of each session the Government brings in legislation that requires the guillotine.  Surely something such as this could have been addressed far earlier by the Government; it is just absolutely ludicrous. If it is not the Government's fault, I want to know why it is not its fault, and I want to see the person who is responsible brought to account because this goes on time after time. I guarantee that we will see the same thing happen at the end of this session; we will get legislation brought in and it will be guillotined again. It has now gone on for 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill was another classic example where the Opposition, through Senator Newman, had to take the lead role. If Senator Newman had not single-handedly taken over, that portion of the legislation that related to the welfare of our veteran community would not have been introduced. It goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA>  While on this matter, the repatriation private patients scheme has still not been finalised. The Minister boldly stated in glossy brochures--which cost some $200,000 to mail out to the veteran community--that the Government had the wide support of the veteran community. That was not correct. It is not true. The Government did not and still does not have the support of the veteran community. The reason it does not have support is shown by another classic example which we had in Ballarat last week where the State Government is now going to close the Creswick Hospital. </PARA>
<PARA>  With this private patients scheme, the Minister wants to move people into private hospitals in rural areas. The reality is that, if there are no beds in rural areas, the veterans will still have to travel to Melbourne. Perhaps it would be better to keep the larger hospitals in the large metropolitan centres such as Melbourne rather than closing them down and running the risk of ending up with a shortage of beds. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are some members of this House, including the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who are fully aware of what has happened with the hospital system in Victoria: it is absolutely diabolical. In fact, the Director for the Central Highlands Wimmera Region in Ballarat said at a public meeting last Tuesday night in relation to the Creswick Hospital that Victoria could no longer afford the standard of care that it had been used to. What a disgraceful situation. Victoria can no longer afford it. This House should be condemning the State Labor Government for what has happened in the health area; it is inexcusable. </PARA>
<PARA>  Creswick is a very small township but last Tuesday night 1,000 people were prepared to go to a public meeting to address a matter of enormous concern. Right across the health field in Victoria we have seen closures, the closure of wards and a lack of money. The Ballarat Base Hospital is again going through it. There are waiting lists in excess of two or three years. </PARA>
<PARA>  These problems are all tied together. The Minister talks about the private health scheme and getting veterans into it. But, if the beds are not there, where do they go? I think they are quite entitled to say that, although they might have to travel a fair distance, they would prefer an organisation, a facility, to stay where it is--albeit at a further distance--rather than having to consent to a transfer from the repatriation hospitals to the private sector or to the rural public hospitals and run the risk of losing them as well and not having the access that they have had in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Chris Ward, the Chief Executive Officer, and Maree Rodoni, the head nurse, of the Creswick District Hospital, are extremely concerned, and justifiably so, at the shrinkage of services. Time after time services in the rural areas are suffering because of the shrinkages. It is simply not being addressed by those who are making the decisions. It is simply not good enough for government, whether it be the Federal Government or the State Labor Government, to say that it is a matter of finance. I have no doubt that the real reason for this process is that the Labor governments know that the further one moves out of the metropolitan areas the more their support drops off. They know well that they lost the Federal seats of Bendigo and Ballarat at the last election. They know very well that they will lose the seat of Ballarat South in the redistribution when it becomes Ballarat East; the seat will go.  I am deeply concerned that what we are seeing at the moment are funds being directed solely into those areas where the Labor Government thinks it can maximise its vote and retain seats. Quite frankly, that is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA>  We may have disagreements about what the approach should be with veterans, but I am sure there are no honourable members who do not have an active tie-up with the local veteran organisations in their area. At the weekend before last I was fortunate to attend the HMAS Ballarat Association's fiftieth anniversary commissioning reunion. It was a terrific weekend. These people had served on HMAS Ballarat. I have been fortunate enough to have been given a book entitled HMAS Gold-digger or the Mosquito Fleet at Sea. It is a World War II daily diary kept by a sick- berth attendant, Tom McLean, of the Royal Australian Navy corvette HMAS Ballarat from 11 November 1942 to 19 January 1945. HMAS Ballarat was one of a total of 60 auxiliary minesweepers designed, built and commissioned by the Australian Government at a number of Australian dockyards between February 1940 and March 1943. </PARA>
<PARA>  When I was on the Ballarat City Council I used to go down to the reunion. With the number of men on these tiny ships, with what they went through and the conditions which they fought under they showed they were men of extraordinary bravery. During the anniversary weekend, I was given some details of Japanese submarine activity off Australia's east coast in 1942 and 1943. I will not go through the list of merchant ships that were sunk or badly damaged, but I can assure honourable members that at the age of 37, I was quite shocked to learn how close we got during the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA>  If honourable members would like to look at the book I mentioned, they would find it is extremely interesting reading. There were nine merchant ships that were attacked off the Australian coast but not sunk, and 19 that were sunk. I had no idea that that sort of devastation had been caused to our shipping so close to our coastline. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe we have a very great obligation to our veterans because they are a group--by their own admission--who are rapidly ageing. They are getting towards the end of their days. Those are not my words; they are the words from veterans in my community. They say, `We are getting towards the end of it, and all we really want is to be respected for what happened. We do not want to be treated as heroes, but we want to be treated as people who have made a contribution to this country'. I believe--I hope there are no honourable members who would disagree--that they have a very great entitlement. The rest of this nation is in their debt for what was achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>  It gives me no joy to know that only eight months ago we were again required to send Australian men and women into active service. That should be a very timely reminder that despite what we all hope and pray for, that is, the end of armed conflict, the possibility of having to send men and women into active service is just round the corner. There are not too many World War I diggers left, but there are some, and certainly there are Second World War, Vietnam and other veterans from wars we have had recently, and it is essential that not only do we give them respect and dignity for what they did in the past and ensure that they are well cared for, but also that in this House we implement policies that protect those who come later. Hopefully, further conflict will never occur. But it may well occur, so further down the track we may need to provide for veterans of future conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA>  In some respects, that is why this legislation is deficient. As my colleague Senator Newman said, ideally we should provide an entitlement to war service loans for all future war service. But my understanding is that the amendments are specific. Let us never forget that the risk of further conflict is just round the corner, and let us make very sure that the policies and legislation that come out of this House will provide for those people who will be called upon to serve in the event of further conflict ever occurring. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I was interested in the comments of the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) this evening, and I support those concerning ministerial discretion. I believe that this specifically applies as far as our veterans are concerned. I would like to support what he said. I think that Ministers generally are losing control on these matters--which could be discretionary--where personnel are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I am sure that we can all think of instances within our electorates of veterans coming to us at our electorate offices seeking support either for a war service home or for applications for the various entitlements to which, in their opinion, they are entitled. I know that the Department of Defence has tribunals to which veterans can appeal, and a lot of them do if they are actually rejected. I am not certain whether there are actual tribunals involved with war service homes, but if there are not--and even if there are--I believe that there should be a discretion for the Minister of the day to say, `Righto, in this particular case, I believe it ought to be approved'. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are the law-makers in this country, and when we pass an Act of the House that is an Act with which the bureaucracy--the Public Service--has generally to comply. It has to administer that Act, and it does so properly. I suppose that there are instances of ex-service personnel who have had applications rejected feeling that there is a public servant who is actually determining under the Act what the entitlements are. Therefore, I support the honourable member for Dobell. Whichever party is in government, it should look at ensuring, particularly in Veterans' Affairs and Department of Defence matters that we are discussing today, that the Minister has the discretion to decide whether there should be some approval or some consideration. As the honourable member for Dobell said, a Minister is responsible to Parliament and whatever the Minister does or decides, he is answerable for it in this chamber as the representative of the people. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe, as the other speakers in this debate have outlined, that we should give every consideration to our veterans. I believe that housing is one of those important issues that concern the families of service personnel. In my long time in the parliamentary field and also my long time as a representative of an electorate which contains the Williamtown RAAF base and a thousand or more of the personnel working on that base living in it, there have been times when wives or others have approached me regarding these particular matters. I have a fair bit to do with their housing. </PARA>
<PARA>  My mind goes back to when I was a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works from 1981 to 1985 and when we conducted numerous inquiries into the extensions to housing development-- particularly in Darwin and Townsville. I believe that that was the Committee which suggested that the servicemen's wives should have a much greater say in the actual planning and entitlements to housing that servicemen should receive. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was amazed when we went to some of the centres concerned, even in my own electorate, where servicemen used to rent the houses from the New South Wales Housing Commission, to find that they were old homes. They were not in bad condition, certainly, but even the new ones which were being built then were not convenient homes for a housewife. The garages and various sections of the houses were not located or designed in the way that modern homes should be designed for the convenience of families or for particular housewives. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased to say that since the servicemen's wives came in, gave evidence and made their submissions before the Public Works Committee, great changes have been made. It is pleasing to see that new designs have been adopted, which make it much more comfortable for the wives. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has always been accepted--not so much today, but the feeling still exists--that if one joins the Services and is prepared to serve one's country, maybe that is a duty that one should accept, and one should not receive the payment that many people outside receive. These conditions worry me because I believe that the feeling is still there. Thank God we are an island state. We ought to thank the good Lord every night that this country of ours is surrounded with water--unlike the European scene that the EC is so worried about at the present time. However, if we are to be prepared, we need to make sure that our service personnel--men and women--are given the entitlements that they are entitled to so that they can remain in the Services and their expertise can be passed on to the benefit of our defence services. </PARA>
<PARA>  I raise that point because it is important. There is a lot of dislocation of service personnel. Occasionally I visit the Williamtown base and meet certain officers and personnel. When I go back in six months time they and their families have gone; they have been transferred elsewhere in Australia or maybe overseas. The dislocation is a big factor in their lives. </PARA>
<PARA>  Keeping a family together is one of the problems that we have in the Services. Service families have perhaps more children than the average Australian family has. The old Public Works Committee dealt with that factor. Service people are generally family people. We have to think about all these things, not just the Bill before the House. They are associated. The Bill is another development for which I commend the Government. We support the legislation before the House this evening because we think it is a further advance so far as housing for people is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other evening there was an RSL congress in Canberra. The Vietnam veterans met in my home town of Taree a few weeks ago. I am sure that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), would be interested; he is an old Forster identity. We are very proud of him, by the way. Mr Ruxton was at the congress. He is a very controversial person around Australia. Nevertheless, a lot of us agree with the things he says. He has very good principles. He may be a little extremist at times but he fights for those people he represents. That is the important thing. He gave a great address about Australia's defence that impressed everybody at the congress. He was critical only in a practical way. It was good to sit and listen to him at the RSL congress held in Canberra recently. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill is a fairly broad Bill. It widens the scope of the legislation. It brings in those people who served in the Middle East during the Gulf war, those who went to Namibia and many more. It tries to envelop all those people. I hope nobody will be missed out. As careful as we are with legislation, after a period of time we often find that some people are left out. That is one of the reasons why I supported the honourable member for Dobell when he talked about the discretion that a Minister should have. I say to the Minister at the table, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), that I think that is a good idea. Even though there are tribunals, there are cases when he should have the discretion to approve something that he believes a service person should be entitled to. I do not think that is in the legislation. As I said earlier, the Minister is answerable to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since the privatisation of the war service homes division, there have been changes. There is some competition. There is a new scheme that I like. I am pleased to see that Westpac and the National Australia Bank are involved with defence loans. I think I am correct in saying that the war service homes division now has the power to purchase homes--it has been given a certain amount of money--and sell them to private individuals who, in turn, lease them back to the service person for either a five-year or 10-year period. People who would like to live in a town such as Raymond Terrace in my electorate, where there are many service personnel, can purchase a home. They can lease that home back to the service person over a five-year period to give a return of 8 per cent on the investment made. That is a good idea. I have no criticism of that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think we all want to ensure that that scheme is administered properly. That is why I raise the matter here. I have been questioned in my electorate as to whether it is administered properly. There is no finger pointing at anyone but people want to know whether this scheme is being administered properly. I do not know whether those responsible--I believe that they are private individuals--act through agents or not. If so, is a commission received by the agent? All of these things are involved. Is capital gains tax paid by the Department because people are purchasing a home and perhaps selling it again--say, to myself or some other individual? Once a scheme such as this comes to fruition, I advise the Government and the Minister to keep a close eye on it to make sure that it is kept particularly clean. This is very important. The scheme may not come under the portfolio of the Minister at the table; it might come under the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I respect the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and I am sure that he will make this clear. </PARA>
<PARA>  Forty thousand dollars is really not enough for a home loan. Where can one buy a decent home today in any of the areas where a serviceman wishes to a retire or is stationed? The area is generally a built-up area. If people are retiring they will go to the metropolitan area or somewhere on the coast to spend the remainder of their days. They are going to go into territory where the residential value is pretty high. In my electorate, where many servicemen retire, one will not get a decent home under $150,000. It may be more if one wants a better home. I am talking about an average home. If one went to Melbourne, Brisbane or anywhere else one would have trouble purchasing a home for less than that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I know that the amount available for a loan has risen from $25,000 to $40,000. But that amount is not enough for a loan. I think it should be double that. It will not give people an opportunity to buy a decent home, unless they take out a second mortgage or something of the kind. Many of the people we are talking about have suffered problems, health problems particularly. Those who served in the Second World War average about 70 years of age. When people get to that age, they start to have health problems, as do their families. It has probably cost them a lot of money. They might have had business problems after they left the Services and so have to borrow. They might have to borrow more than $40,000. </PARA>
<PARA>  I trust that the Government will update itself more and more to be in line with the value of property. The value of property will not come down. We have hills and hollows with anything, particularly with the value of real estate. It may come down a little but it will go up again. I read in the newspapers the other day that in the Sydney metropolitan area the Real Estate Institute says that the values of homes have gone up a couple of per cent in the last year. These are the homes that we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA>  I raise those particular points. I welcome the legislation. I trust that nobody who should receive assistance will miss out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --in reply--It is a pleasure to close a debate on which there have been some useful contributions from both sides of the chamber, including from my friend the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan), who has just finished speaking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I thank those who have taken part in the debate on the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill and will comment on some of the more substantial points that have been raised in the course of the debate. I begin with the comments that were made by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). In that respect let me say--as I have had occasion to before--that the genuine interest which the Leader of the National Party, as an ex-serviceman himself, takes in the welfare of servicemen is appreciated on all sides of the House. Indeed, that is true of all those who have taken part in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Leader of the National Party referred to the presence of RAAF personnel in the Gulf operational area, and it is true that members of all three services did take part in the campaign although the great bulk were on the naval ships that we sent to the Gulf. The Leader of the National Party asked for an assurance that the RAAF members that he mentioned would be eligible for benefits under the enhanced provisions of this legislation. It is difficult to comment, of course, about individuals and individual circumstances without being able to check on those. However, all defence members who served in the Middle East operational area, which is set out in the legislation, and who were allotted for duty in accordance with the legislation will be eligible for the assistance established under this scheme. That applies, of course, whether they were members of the Navy, Army or Air Force. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Leader of the National Party also asked about the numbers of personnel from the three services who served in the Gulf. I know that the total came to around 1,450, of whom the great bulk were members of the Navy. I will see whether it is possible for details of the split-up between those services to be provided in the course of the debate in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the course of debate in this chamber, Opposition members referred to the fact that the defence force home loans assistance scheme, as introduced, did not specify benefits for active service. Indeed, it was a scheme which, as I said in my remarks introducing the Bill in the first place, was designed essentially against a background of peacetime service. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) referred particularly to the need for an entrenched entitlement to special benefits for war service. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this respect the Government has followed the practice which has been set by all its predecessors; that is, the determination of benefits for Defence Force members involved in any operational commitment or war service has always been a matter for decision in the light of the circumstances at the time. The position has been no different in relation to the Gulf commitment, so that all the special benefits made available to members participating in the commitment--the Gulf allowance, which was individually set, the tax concessions and the award of the Australian Active Service Medal are some examples--were all made as a result of individual decisions by the Government at the time in the light of the circumstances of this particular conflict. And that is going to be the case in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  I understand the sentiment which moves honourable members to suggest that those things should be set down beforehand, but it is simply not the case that any Government can give a commitment to the benefits which might be available in the case of future deployments when those circumstances cannot be predicted, but certainly this Government-- and I am sure any future Government--would reach a decision on the relevant benefits in the same way and bring the same sentiments to bear as has been the case in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Lyne made some well taken points about the need to keep an eye on the details of any new scheme being introduced, and we have had an example here of a need--which I think is recognised in all quarters--for appropriate amendments. He went on to reflect on the adequacy of the $40,000 loan which is the subject of this amendment, for example, and of ADFHLAS as a whole. As honourable members will know, the provisions of this amendment give a subsidy of 16 years interest on the loan of $40,000. The honourable member is right to recall that the previous quantum was $25,000, though given under somewhat different subsidy provisions. As near as we could work out, the $40,000 and a subsidy of 16 years equated to the benefit which was given for operational service under the previous scheme, so in that respect we have been consistent with past practice. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is sometimes thought that home loan assistance has always been sufficient to buy a house at the cost of houses at that particular time, but in fact that is historically not the case. If one goes back to benefits which were given after previous conflicts, the present provisions stack up pretty well. </PARA>
<PARA>  The home loan benefits, of course, are not the only benefits which are provided in the case of people who have participated in the operational service. The list of veterans' benefits is long. This Government has just introduced an excellent replacement for the old Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme. It is a considerable improvement, and I believe it will work with the provisions of the housing scheme we have just amended to make possible a greater degree of home ownership while the member is still serving and to give a greater degree of assurance that that home ownership capability will be available to more of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA>  This amendment makes sure that the provisions in respect of those who participated in the Gulf conflict are as generous, and arguably more so, than those for personnel who have taken part in any other conflict. As such, they are a recognition, which I am sure is shared on both sides of this House, that that kind of service is deserving of tangible reward from a grateful nation. It is in that spirit that I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In the absence of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) overseas, I am responding on behalf of the Liberal and National parties to the Freedom of Information Amendment Bill 1991 which was introduced into this House to amend the Freedom of Information Act. This amendment Bill, the long title of which is, A Bill for an Act to amend the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and for related purposes, is now before us. In many respects, however, it might have been more accurate to have entitled it, A Bill for an Act to restrict the right of access to public information under the Freedom of Information Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Bill was introduced into the Senate where it was passed with minor amendments. Although the Liberal and National parties have strong concerns about a number of provisions found in the Bill, we will not be opposing its passage nor will we be moving any amendments. The deficiencies contained in the Bill will be dealt with by us on our return to government following the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>  The origins of the Bill date back to November 1985 when the Senate asked the former Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs to examine and report on the operation and administration of the Freedom of Information Act. The work was completed on 15 December 1987 by the then recently formed Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. In its report the Committee made 126 recommendations for changes to the administrative and legislative regime that governs the operation of the Freedom of Information Act. However, the Government took nearly two years to respond to the Committee's report. When it did respond, although it accepted most of the Committee's recommendations, it rejected a number of key ones. This rejection of crucial parts of the Committee's conclusions does, in our view, undermine the effectiveness of the recommendations which have been accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>  The focus of the Senate Committee's inquiry was the practical administration and operation of the Freedom of Information Act. The basic premise, as expressed by the Committee and set out by it in paragraph 1.26 of its report, was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to ensure that a maximum amount of information is made publicly available, and that the barest minimum of restriction is placed on the public disclosure of such information. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, however, because the Government rejected some very crucial aspects of the Committee's recommendations the Bill may, in some respects, have the opposite effect to that which was set as the basic premise by the Senate Committee when it examined the Bill and drew up its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to deal with four matters: firstly, the fees and charges imposed on the processing of requests for access to information; secondly, the refusal of requests on the grounds that the granting of access would divert the resources of the relevant agency; thirdly, the obligations that agencies should have to consult with interested third parties before making a final decision to grant access; and, finally, the use that agencies make of the exemption that disclosure would have an adverse effect on the operations of relevant agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will be focusing on, not so much what we find in the Bill, but, rather, what is left out of it and what could have been included in it. I remind the House that the overriding object of the Freedom of Information Act, as set out in subsection 3(1) of the Act, is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to extend as far as possible the right of the Australian community to access to information in the possession of the Government of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>To this end, paragraph 3(1)(b) provides that the Act is intended to create `a general right of access' for all persons. That should be the starting point for considering proposals for amending the Act. We should not be swayed by arguments based on the convenience of the administrators; rather, we must always be mindful of the right of all Australians, as conferred by the Act, to participate in the political process and we must work towards furthering that right in freeing access to government information. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the Senate Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs noted in 1979, there are three underlying justifications for the Freedom of Information Act. They are: firstly, that every individual has a right to know what information is held in government records; secondly, that public scrutiny of government ensures increased accountability; and, thirdly, that access to information increases the level of public participation in the political process. Furthermore, the Freedom of Information Act is an integral part of the far-reaching legislative reforms in the area of administrative law introduced by the Fraser Government. The Act was part of a legislative package designed to make government more open and accountable. The other elements of that package included the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, and the Ombudsman Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA>  In many respects, the Freedom of Information Act is central to the effective administrative review that is available to Australian citizens. Unless people can get access to the documents that detail the manner in which an administrator has handled a matter it is near impossible for them to determine whether to challenge an administrator's decision. In light of the present Government's recent attempts to stifle free speech in respect of political advertising, it is not surprising that its response to the charter of reform laid down by the Senate Committee does little to strengthen or further enhance the right of individuals to participate in public affairs or have available to them information which will enable them to determine whether they should seek a review of administrative decisions made against their interests. </PARA>
<PARA>  In recent years, it has become clear that increased charges for the processing of requests for access to information have contributed to a substantial decline in the number of requests that are being made. There is a strong body of evidence to suggest that the system for imposing charges, which has been in place since 1986, has been used by the administrators to deter people from using the Act. In many cases, due to the absence of a ceiling on charges, the costs claimed for the processing of requests can amount to thousands of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA>   The Legal and Constitutional Committee of the Victorian Parliament noted, in its report of November 1989, that there was, at the Federal level, sufficient evidence to suggest a direct correlation between the imposition of charges and the extent to which there was a decline in the number of requests for information sought under the Act. It was an issue which the Senate Committee also examined and, after considering the evidence put to it, the Senate Committee recommended that ceilings be placed on the maximum charges payable for a request for access. In particular, the Senate Committee recommended that, firstly, in cases where a request was made for access to personal documents, the maximum charge be the application fee plus a two-hour search-retrieval time fee plus a two-hour decision making time fee; and, secondly, in other cases that the maximum charge be the application fee plus a 15-hour search-retrieval time fee plus a 15-hour decision making time fee. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government, no doubt having read the Senate Committee's report, accepted that a ceiling should be placed on charges payable for requests to access to personal documents, but rejected the proposal that a similar limit be placed on other types of requests. Yet so often information sought and obtained in relation to those other types of requests does affect individuals and they can find out their effect only as a consequence of those more general inquiries. Furthermore, those more general inquiries will often enable matters of public interest--matters about which there should be high levels of public accountability--to be exposed and debated publicly, thereby enabling administrators and the executive government to be brought to proper account as a result of that information. </PARA>
<PARA>  Because of the high charges that sometimes can be imposed--indeed, charges that can be imposed without upper limits--sensitive information can effectively be held when in other circumstances it would be made available and should be made available under the general principles of the Act, for it does not satisfy any of those restrictions, which means that the administrators do not have to make the information available. It is only the price of that information that prevents it from being publicly disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA>  We should not lose sight of the fact that if individuals are to have a right to obtain access to government information, the obligation to provide such access should not be denied by unreasonably high pricing policies. The maximum limits on the charges for access would allow for users of the Act to make a reasonable contribution to the operational costs involved and, at the same time, prevent the imposition of unreasonable charges as a means of deterring such a use. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn now to consider clause 15 of the Bill, which repeals section 24 and replaces it with a proposed new section 24 and an additional section 24A. Under the existing Act section 24(1) allows agencies of Ministers to refuse access to documents requested without having to process the request where the giving of access would:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . substantially and unreasonably divert the resources of the agency from its other operations or would interfere substantially and unreasonably with the performance by the Minister of his functions as the case may be . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I stress that in the section are included the words `substantially and unreasonably'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Subsection 24(2) of the Act further provides that access may be refused where it is apparent from the terms of the request that all the documents requested are exempt documents. During the second reading speech the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) said:</PARA>
<PARA>In accordance with the Senate Committee's recommendations, section 24 of the Act is being amended to allow agencies greater scope to refuse to deal with requests which substantially and unreasonably divert the resources of an agency from its other responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Although it is correct to say that the Committee did make certain recommendations about amending section 24--and these were enumerated in recommendations 35 to 42 in its report--it is not correct to say that the Bill implements all these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>  In particular, when the Government responded to the Committee's report in June 1989 it rejected recommendations 36 and 39 by which it was suggested that section 24 be amended to provide that multiple requests not be aggregated for the purposes of section 24 and that, upon appeal from a refusal of access under section 24(2), agencies be required to prove that the documents to which access was refused are in fact exempt. </PARA>
<PARA>  In its response the Government said that it could not accept these recommendations because:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . they would impose a workload on agencies which the workload exceptions are designed to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Attorney-General that section 24 is not designed to avoid imposing on agencies a workload per se, but rather it is designed to avoid imposing on agencies an unreasonable workload. </PARA>
<PARA>  Furthermore, this element is only relevant to situations falling under subsection 24(1). Subsection 24(2), in dealing with refusals to grant access, where it is believed that all of the documents sought are exempt, is not, by its terms, concerned with avoiding the imposition of an unreasonable workload on agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>  In an appeal from a decision to refuse access under subsection 24(2), it is only necessary for agencies to establish that it was apparent from the terms of the request that the documents were exempt. At the time of the decision, the relevant agency need not identify the documents involved, nor does it have to specify the grounds of exemption, but both of these matters must be attended to in any subsequent appeal. </PARA>
<PARA>  After considering the various arguments involved, the Senate Committee at paragraph 7.69 of its report concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA>Where an agency decides to refuse an application under subsection 24(2) as amended in the manner recommended above, and the decision is then subject to review or appeal, the onus should be upon the agency to prove that the document or documents in question are exempt. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a well-balanced, sensible and reasonable conclusion. In the absence of a positive provision requiring agencies to demonstrate that, as a matter of both fact and law, documents requested are exempt by virtue of the provisions found in part IV of the Act, the escape mechanism provided for in clause 15 of the Bill leans far too heavily, in the view of the Opposition parties, in favour of obstructing the proper release of information. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn now to consider the obligations that should be imposed on agencies to consult third parties who may be affected by the release of information. In many cases where a request for access to documents is made, other third parties may be affected by the disclosure of sensitive information contained in these documents. As things stand at the moment, the Act has several provisions designed to overcome situations where disclosure may have an adverse effect on the legitimate interests of a third party. In the first place, many of the exemptions contained in part IV seek to protect third parties. Furthermore, there are provisions requiring agencies to consult with relevant third parties before making a decision to grant access--a process sometimes referred to as `reverse FOI'. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this respect, I refer to section 27 relating to the business affairs of third parties and to section 27A dealing with the personal affairs of an individual. Recognising the problems that can arise through a failure on the part of an agency to undertake adequate consultations with third parties, the Senate Committee made a number of recommendations to widen the obligations on agencies to undertake appropriate consultations and to broaden the rights of review and appeal available to third parties where they contest a decision by an agency to release information. </PARA>
<PARA>  An illustration of the difficulties that arise in this area can be found in proceedings involving the former member for Menzies. In this regard I refer the House to the decision of Deputy President Thompson of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Brown v. Minister for Administrative Services, a decision handed down on 27 July 1990. The applicant, Mr Neil Brown, had sought access to documents which the Minister claimed were exempt under section 43 of the Act because they contained information relating to the business affairs of a third party. On appeal the AAT held that most of the documents were not exempt, but that one document did relate to the financial affairs of a third party. However, at no stage did the Minister refer the matter to the third party concerned, notwithstanding the obligation imposed on him by section 27 of the Act. As a result of this neglect, the Tribunal was forced to remit the matter to the Minister with a direction that the reverse FOI provisions of section 27 be complied with before any decision was made to release the document. </PARA>
<PARA>  The upshot of all this was that the applicant and the Tribunal were put to great inconvenience due to the sloppy and careless administration on the part of the Minister and his officers. In addition, the costs of the proceedings--brought about because the Minister attempted to defend the indefensible--were, of course, ultimately borne by the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA>  The waste of public moneys resulting from needless litigation on the part of the Commonwealth is another topic that needs canvassing in some more appropriate debate. Ironically, the Minister had attempted to withhold a document on the ground that its disclosure may have had an adverse effect on a third party. Apparently it did not occur to the Minister that it might be appropriate, or maybe even his statutory obligation--as was the case--for him to seek the view of the third party. Once again the Government has decided to reject the Senate Committee's recommendation for improving the reverse FOI provisions on the ground that such improvement might involve, to quote from the Government's response, `a resource burden'. Once again I remind the Attorney-General that the Freedom of Information Act is not and should not be designed to cater for the convenience of administrators and the convenience of Ministers who overlook their obligations under the present provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  This leads me to consider the position that the Government has adopted in respect of section 40(1)(d) of the Act, which provides for exemption where a grant of access might `have a substantial adverse effect on the proper and efficient conduct of the operations of an agency'. It is common ground that section 40(1)(d) is misused and abused by administrators in order to frustrate the release of information. In evidence to the Senate Committee, one senior Federal administrator said that section 40(1)(d):</PARA>
<PARA>. . . has become a sort of stand-by clause where frankly you are having trouble finding anything else to use and you feel that it--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the document involved--</PARA>
<PARA>should be exempted. </PARA>
<PARA>Faced with the overwhelming evidence that reliance on this section by agencies seeking to withhold information frustrated the objects of the Act and that the exemptions of part IV offered sufficient protection, the Senate Committee recommended that the section be repealed. Not surprisingly, this Government chose to reject the recommendation, offering no reasons other than suggesting that implementation of the recommendation would, in the words of the Government's response:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . seriously limit the scheme of protection provided by the FOI Act for information which must be withheld in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>The real and overwhelming public interest is not the protection of governments but the right of members of the public to ensure that the workings of government are open and accountable. That is what the Freedom of Information Act is all about. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said in my opening remarks, this Bill will do little to further the right of individuals to participate in public affairs and the right of individuals to obtain information about themselves or about issues in respect of which they have concerns. Fundamental to the workings of open and accountable government is the right to know how governments conduct their affairs. The changes that the Bill will bring about favour bureaucrats at the expense of individual liberty. It will fall to the Liberal and National parties when in government to set the balance right and to ensure that the right to gain access to government information is properly respected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-in reply--I want to respond to a few of the matters raised by the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson). These matters include the question of fees--the refusal on the basis of diverting resources; consultation; and, more generally, more access to freedom of information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  On the first issue, the Government believes that the level of FOI fees and charges is now appropriate. As the honourable member for Sturt would be aware, in 1986 the Act was amended to increase charges. Those amendments were part of a package of measures designed to contain growing costs of the FOI Act. I think it is worth pointing out to honourable members opposite that the FOI charges still recover only a very small proportion of the cost of administering the FOI Act; in fact, the last annual report on the FOI Act by the Attorney-General pointed out that only 3 per cent of the $10m annual cost of the FOI Act is recovered in fees and charges. In practice many agencies do not charge applicants for access to their personal files. The FOI Act contains provisions allowing FOI applicants to seek remission of fees and charges on grounds such as public interest or financial hardship. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Freedom of Information Amendment Bill 1991 improves the applicant's chance of obtaining remission by providing that an applicant who is refused remission by an agency can appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and by allowing applicants to seek remission of application fees. In this area the Government has accepted some of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on FOI charges, including the recommendation that a maximum figure be put on the amount that can be charged to an applicant who seeks access to documents relating to his or her personal affairs. The Government rejected other recommendations on fees and charges made by the Senate Committee because they would reduce the recovery of the cost of the FOI Act and would benefit only those who could afford to pay FOI fees and charges. </PARA>
<PARA>  Clause 19 of the Bill, which repeals section 30 of the FOI Act, does not in any way affect an applicant's right to ask an agency to remit a charge. Proposed new section 29(1)(c) will allow the applicant to contend that the charge should be reduced or not imposed. Proposed new section 29(5) makes it clear that the agency can agree to reduce or not impose a charge for any reason, including public interest or financial hardship. </PARA>
<PARA>  In that regard I must say that I reject the Opposition's views because I think that the balance which we are told will be struck by a Liberal-National Party government is in fact in place. It is interesting to note that once again we have an example of the Opposition saying that there should be more access and less money paid; in fact, this Opposition has a capacity to spend money as if it were going out of fashion and at the same time talks about massive reductions and deficits--something which one finds a bit difficult, if not impossible, to understand. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other point which was raised concerned the refusal of FOI requests on the ground of unreasonable workload. I think that those honourable members opposite know that quite clearly this has to be a factor in the freedom of information area. Since the Act commenced operation in 1982, section 24 has allowed an agency to refuse an FOI request if the agency considered that the request would substantially and unreasonably divert the resources of the agency from its other operations. That has been the case since 1982. Section 24 does not allow refusal of a request merely because it involves a substantial workload; that is not sufficient. The agency must be able to show that the request would unreasonably divert the agency's resources. It is worth noting that the Bill includes safeguards to prevent any abuse by that agency. </PARA>
<PARA>  Proposed new section 24(6) requires agencies to consult with applicants, and applicants must be given a chance to narrow the scope of their request so that it does not unreasonably divert the agency's resources. I find it very difficult to see how one can strike a much better balance than that. The existing section 26 of the FOI Act requires agencies to give the applicant a statement of reasons explaining why processing of the request would be substantial and unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA>  Proposed new sections 55(1) and 57(1) will allow an applicant to challenge the agency's decision as to whether the workload is unreasonable before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Clause 15 extends section 24 to some extent. This also comes back to the Senate Committee recommendations to which the honourable member for Sturt referred. The Senate Committee unanimously recommended that the time spent by an agency in consulting third parties and making a decision on a request be included in calculating the burden of processing a request. The legitimate operations of agencies need to be protected--and I do not see that any argument has been put to the contrary--from unreasonably wide FOI requests. Section 24 provides that protection, but it also provides appropriate safeguards to stop agencies abusing the provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>  In relation to consultation, I think it is worth pointing out for the benefit of those opposite, as the issue has been raised by the honourable member for Sturt, that section 27 does require agencies to consult business where a request is received for documents relating to their affairs. Clause 17 amends section 27 to implement the Senate Committee's recommendations. The Senate Committee recommendations in this regard were that business be consulted whether or not the agency considers that the business might have reasonable grounds to object to disclosure--recommendation 44--that business must be consulted where documents are to be released with business affairs material deleted, and that documents acquire no greater protection from disclosure simply because they have been the subject of consultations with business. </PARA>
<PARA>  In concluding, because of people saying that somehow or other, for reasons not explained, we are making it more difficult to get access to information, I think it is worth putting on record the preliminary statistics on FOI usage in 1990-91, which are an interesting outline of this position. In that period, the total requests amounted to 25,000. The agencies receiving the most requests were Veterans' Affairs, which had 8,998; Social Security, 5,689; Tax, 4,007; and Immigration, 3,920. The number of requests granted in full was 64 per cent; requests granted in part, 32 per cent; and the number of requests refused in that period, 4 per cent. There were 233 applications for internal review and 27 applications to the AAT. The total annual cost of FOI was $10m. The total of charges collected was $493,783. Those are preliminary figures. The final figures on FOI usage for 1990-91 will be provided to the Parliament in the Attorney-General's annual report on the FOI Act later in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill does make some amendments which will cause the Act to operate in a better way. In no way is it attempting to make it more difficult. It certainly is not attempting to make it expensive to a stage at which people are unable to get access to information. In fact, for the reasons that I have set out, the contrary is the position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise, in the absence of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), to respond on behalf of the Liberal and National parties to the Crimes Amendment Bill 1991 and the Crimes (Aviation) Bill 1991, which we are debating cognately. The Crimes Amendment Bill seeks to amend the Crimes Act 1914 to empower the police to search aircraft, vehicles and vessels without warrant in certain emergencies. The Crimes (Aviation) Bill seeks to consolidate the provisions of the four Acts forming part of the aviation crimes package. The Liberal and National parties will not be opposing either Bill at the second reading stage, although we have concerns with some aspects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I will deal first with the Crimes Amendment Bill. Commonwealth legislation currently confers emergency search powers on a wide range of officials, including police, in relation to offences against specific enactments. There are a number of provisions in Commonwealth laws, usually of a revenue nature, which authorise officers without warrant to enter and search places, persons and, in some cases, objects. For example, the Customs Act 1901, the Excise Act 1901 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 all contain such provisions. In recent years, however, the trend appears to be against the inclusion of such provisions, including provisions in their place for the granting of a search warrant by a judicial officer to authorise entry and/or search. </PARA>
<PARA>  Emergency search powers have never been conferred on police in relation to the vast majority of Commonwealth offences. In the past, the police have relied on emergency search powers conferred by State and Territory laws and applied by section 9 of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. </PARA>
<PARA>  A decision in the Adelaide Central District Criminal Court in April last year threw this into doubt. The case of the Crown v. Barritt is an unreported decision of His Honour Judge Greaves. In that case it was held that the general power in the Crimes Act dealing with the issue of a search warrant is an exercise of Commonwealth power in a manner which covers the field so as to leave no room for searches being conducted without warrants. </PARA>
<PARA>  The question in issue was whether the search of a car by a Federal Police officer was lawful. Judge Greaves was of the view that the police officer in this case had no power to search the car without a warrant. A combination of section 9 of the Commonwealth Australian Federal Police Act and section 69 of the South Australian Summary Offences Act did not give the police this power when the Crimes Act covered the field. The judge said that section 10(1) of the Crimes Act concerns itself with any offence against the law of the Commonwealth. Because the section said `any offence against the law of the Commonwealth', the judge concluded that it covered the field, and that State law which authorised search by State police officers in other circumstances did not extend to Federal Police officers when enforcing Federal law. He rejected the proposition that those conditions for which the Commonwealth Act said that there must be a search warrant in relation to all offences under Commonwealth law could be:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . circumvented in a particular State by the operation of s.9(1)(c) of the Australian Federal Police Act just because the local legislature has decided to grant greater powers of search to its local police force for the enforcement of the law of that State. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill is designed to overcome the effect of this decision and to give emergency powers to Federal Police to search aircraft, vehicles and vessels without warrant. The use of the power is limited to public places or places where the public already has access. The police are given power to stop, detain and search a conveyance, which includes an aircraft or ship, if they suspect on reasonable grounds that something relevant to an indictable offence is in, or on, the conveyance. The power is to be used to stop an object from being concealed, lost or destroyed. Further, when an object is found that is relevant to an offence against the Commonwealth or a Territory, it can be seized. The Bill provides that these powers can be used only in circumstances which are so serious or urgent that there is no time to obtain a warrant. Force can be used only where the person in charge of the conveyance has been given a reasonable opportunity to let the search go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>  In considering legislation of this nature, one must strive to balance the competing interests of the citizen to be protected from illegal or irregular invasion of his or her liberties by the authorities and the interests of government in preventing the commission of a crime, or in obtaining evidence to assist the prosecution of offenders. Obviously, there is scope for differences of view on such matters. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Law Reform Commission, in its report on criminal investigation, recommended an emergency search power similar to that in the current Bill. Section 38 of the Proceeds of Crime Act confers a like power, subject to stringent conditions, in relation to tainted property. The Gibbs Committee of Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law, established in 1987, considered this issue in a wider sense, including the search of private premises. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Queensland Law Society, in its submission to that Committee, indicated that there would be exceptional circumstances which would require special provisions for emergency situations. However, it recommended that very strict guidelines would be needed to prevent abuse and that there would need to be accountability and close judicial review. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, in its submission, observed that there could be some delay if the legislation were to require that a warrant be obtained. It was pointed out that even a relatively small delay could lead to loss or destruction of articles, although it was noted that appropriate safeguards would be required and that section 38 of the Proceeds of Crime Act provided an example. </PARA>
<PARA>  By contrast, the Law Society of New South Wales opposes such legislation as a gross and totally unwarranted intrusion upon the rights of innocent citizens. The Australian Capital Territory's magistrates pointed out that in the ACT at least one magistrate is available on 24-hour call every day and that, at least in that Territory, it was difficult to comprehend an emergency situation that would not be met by the normal procedure. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Gibbs Committee, in its interim report to the Government, expressed doubts about the power. The Committee concluded that to enlarge police powers of entry by creating an entirely new power to enter without warrant in an emergency would be a very serious step. Inevitably, there would be differences of opinion as to what was an emergency situation and, while a review after the event by a court might provide some guidance for the future, it would provide, at best, limited satisfaction to the persons involved in the case in point. The Committee recommended that no special provision should be made for searches in an emergency. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, given that the Bill is at odds with the recommendation of the Gibbs Committee, the Opposition recommends that the Government amend the legislation to include a sunset clause so that it can come up again for parliamentary review after a reasonable period of operation, and so that the Parliament can once again consider the arguments that have been put against the introduction of such legislation. If the fears and concerns of those who are opposed to it are justified by the manner in which the legislation is used, then Parliament can take another look at the matter. The inclusion of such a clause would enable the Government to ensure that the legislation achieves its object. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition supports the legislation. We see that there are circumstances where it can be argued that an emergency exists and that there is not time--even with a 24-hour standby magistrate in the ACT--to take the steps to go through those processes before the vehicle or property is damaged, destroyed or disappears in some way. However, we take note of the very real concerns that have been expressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  In these areas, it is always a difficult matter of balance. We think that, in testing whether these emergency powers should be given to the police, there should be that opportunity for Parliament to review the matter automatically, rather than have it come up at the initiative of an executive government at some time when it chooses to bring it before the Parliament again. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn now to the Crimes (Aviation) Bill 1991. This Bill seeks to consolidate the provisions of four Acts of Parliament forming the aviation crimes legislation package. The four Acts to be consolidated are the Crimes (Hijacking of Aircraft) Act 1972, the Civil Aviation (Offenders on International Aircraft) Act 1970, the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973 and the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963. With the passage of this legislation, these four Acts will be repealed. With the exception of the Crimes (Aircraft) Act, the four Acts implement international conventions to which the Commonwealth is a party. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Hague convention is implemented at present by the Crimes (Hijacking of Aircraft) Act. The convention concerns the suppression of unlawful seizure of aircraft and was ratified by Australia on 9 September 1972. The Tokyo convention is implemented under the present law by the Civil Aviation (Offenders on International Aircraft) Act. The convention relates to offences and certain other acts committed on aircraft. Australia acceded to that convention on 22 June 1970. Finally, the Montreal convention and its protocols are implemented under present law by the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act. That convention concerns the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of civil aviation and was ratified by Australia on 12 July 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>  Each of the three conventions to which I have referred is defined more fully in clause 3 of the Bill now before the House which consolidates those three Acts to which I have referred and incorporates the conventions in schedules to the Bill. The fourth Act that is being consolidated applies only within Australia, and it is the Crimes (Aircraft) Act. That Act was the earliest Australian enactment to deal specifically with crime occurring on aircraft. Indeed, by the time Australia became a party to the three conventions to which I have referred, Australian law in the area of crimes on aircraft was already well developed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Crimes (Aircraft) Act contains two principal parts. Part II is concerned with the criminal character and consequences of any act done on board an aircraft in flight. Part III deals with acts affecting specifically the safety of the aircraft or its passengers. The Commonwealth does not have a general legislative power over aviation. Its legislation cannot extend to flights within State boundaries, except to the extent that such legislation may be authorised by section 51 placitum (i), placitum (xxix) and placitum (xxxix) of the Constitution. Flights within Australia which are beyond the Commonwealth's jurisdiction must therefore be regulated by complementary State legislation. Most of the States have enacted complementary legislation which is virtually the same as the Commonwealth Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  I now touch briefly on some of the provisions of the Bill and remind the House of matters that were dealt with when the legislation was introduced. The Bill contains five parts and five schedules. They contain definitions and create a series of offences relating to aircraft, aerodromes, airports and air navigation facilities. The Bill deals with hijacking and other acts of violence on board aircraft. Hijacking is defined and is punishable on conviction by a sentence of life imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The legislation reflects the severe penalties required by The Hague convention for acts against passengers or crew and makes those acts punishable. Division 2 relates to other offences on board aircraft engaged in certain flights. Division 3 of part 2 creates a series of further offences proscribing taking control of an aircraft, the destruction of an aircraft, acts which may prejudice the safe operation of an aircraft, and also threatening to do or make a false statement about any of those things. Part 3 covers the provisions giving effect to the Tokyo convention which forms schedule 4 of the Bill, and part 4 and part 5 of the Bill are really the administrative and procedural measures for the application of the Bill. Part 4 concerns restoring control of the aircraft and dealing with offenders. Part 5 also is mainly administrative. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have summarised those yet again knowing that, when the Bill was introduced into the House, those points were drawn to the attention of the House. But the many thousands of Australians who fly not only within the States but also between States and overseas from this country are, every time they fly, made very conscious of the security mechanisms in place. The terrorist activities of some people have not only made these security measures and mechanisms necessary in airports and on aircraft but have also made it necessary for parliaments to deal with legislation in the way in which we are dealing with this legislation tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is commendable, I believe, that the legislation governing this very important sensitive area involving the security of people who should have the right to travel with the maximum level of safety and minimum level of interference be brought together under one enactment rather than being, as it has been up till now, in four Acts of parliament, three relating to conventions and one initiated before those conventions were adopted worldwide.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Liberal and National parties support the moves being made by the Government. We recognise the importance of the legislation and think it a very wise move to bring it into the one Act of parliament so that people needing to refer to it can identify all aspects of this Parliament's consideration of this law in the one piece of legislation rather than having to search through three or four pieces of legislation. The Opposition supports the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-in reply--I thank the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) for his contribution on both these Bills, the first being the Crimes Amendment Bill. But in particular I thank him for his support for the second Bill, the Crimes (Aviation) Bill. I also thank him particularly, of course, for his comments behind his support, being that the security activities are so obvious in this country as a result of the activities, as he referred to them, particularly of terrorists and persons who are going to cause problems and sometimes disastrous problems to people if these steps are not taken. As the honourable member for Sturt said, people in this country should be able to travel on aircraft with the maximum security. I do not propose to respond in detail other than to indicate that it is pleasing that on some matters we are able to have total bipartisan support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In respect of the first of the Bills, the Crimes Amendment Bill, I would like to pick up one matter that the honourable member for Sturt raised. Before doing so, I would mention that the necessity for this amendment came about for the reasons outlined by the honourable member for Sturt--that is, police previously had relied on emergency search powers conferred by State and Territory laws and applied by section 9 of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. As the honourable member for Sturt pointed out, there was a recent South Australian District Court decision, R v Barritt, which held that section 10 of the Common- wealth Crimes Act covers the field in regard to searches and, accordingly, the police could not rely on section 10 of the AFP Act. That, as outlined, was the reason why it was necessary to make these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Sturt also touched briefly on the safeguards in the Bill because, as he did say, it is a difficult matter of balance in a case like this and there are, of course, many sections in the legislation relating to safeguards. In clause 2, of course, there is the definition of conveyance, and proposed new sections 10A(1)(a), 10A(3), 10A(1) and 10B all deal in detail with safeguards to strike that balance referred to. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, the honourable member for Sturt did then refer to a matter which I think does warrant a specific reply. He mentioned the question of a sunset clause and also dealt with the proposals of this legislation in so far as it relates to the report of the Gibbs Committee of Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law. The Gibbs Committee review, in fact, recently supported the concept of emergency searches in relation to motor vehicles. In its June 1991 fifth interim report, the review noted that comparable powers existed in the United Kingdom and New Zealand and various State jurisdictions. The report noted the very point that was made by the honourable member for Sturt that there is a need for the law to balance the legitimate needs of law enforcement officers against the right of the citizen to the protection of his or her liberty, privacy and dignity. </PARA>
<PARA>  Then citing the New South Wales Law Reform Commission in its discussion paper No. 16 on police powers of arrest and detention, the Committee proposed that the power to stop and search should be exercisable only in a public place or in any other place to which members of the public have ready access and, further, that a vehicle may be detained for the purpose of conducting such a search only for so long as it is reasonable and necessary for the conduct of the search. This has been taken up in proposed sections 10B(b) and (c) of the proposed amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The review Committee further recommended that the powers authorised by this provision should not authorise an officer to damage the vehicle or its contents, except to the extent necessary to open a door, boot, glove box or container, when the person in charge of the vehicle fails to provide a key necessary to open it. That is also picked up in proposed new section 10B(d) in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is worth noting that the only significant aspect of this proposed amendment which differs from the Gibbs report is that it will apply to all indictable offences. The restriction of power in the Gibbs Committee to offences punishable by at least five years imprisonment may go too far and requires proper consideration in the light of the AFP operational experience and other aspects of the report which may mitigate the need to have the provisions applying to all indictable offences; for example, telephone warrants. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to emphasise that I think that point made about the sunset clause is well worth taking on board and, on behalf of the Government, I am able to advise the honourable member for Sturt and all others opposite that this amendment will be reviewed in the context of the Commonwealth response to the Gibbs Committee's recommendation, which should occur within the next 12 months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This is the ninth Budget that has been brought down since my election to this place. It is important that we reflect upon that period. Before I do that, I want to pay particular tribute to the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) on the method of and changes to the Budget presentation. There has been a concept of having a document once a year only in which the Commonwealth lays out $100 billion of its expenditure and its revenue. The mystique arose over the Budget in previous decades--and was maintained--by the idea that there would be surprises, and even the suggestion that in the past some Treasurers of a different persuasion from the current government may have had some advantage financially because of their knowledge of Budget secrets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The fact is that for most of our nine Budgets there have been additional March or May statements. There has been an opening up and bringing forward of Forward Estimates, and much greater public access to the Budget data and economic statistics of the Commonwealth. Technically, the sooner we get to the stage where the Government reports to the nation on more than two occasions--perhaps three or four a year--the better. The sooner we get away from the concept that the Budget has to be shrouded in secrecy, mystery and surprises, the better. The idea that we can predict accurately and maintain forecasts over a 12- month period has been a falsity for a very long time. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us take last year's Budget. Within a short space of time the events of the Middle East emerged. The forecasts that were made by the statisticians and Treasury, whilst well intended, were based on the data of the day--which suddenly changed dramatically. That has been repeated this year when, on the very day the Budget was brought down, unpredictable changes occurred in the Soviet Union. The fact is that no longer does the world move in a slow, sedate way. The changes that occur nowadays are dramatic and often unpredictable. It is just commonsense for governments to start to recognise that they need to cast and recast, check and recheck the projections and predictions more than once a year. </PARA>
<PARA>  It seems to me, from the comments made subsequent to the Budget, that the Treasurer was criticised for being sensible and for not providing the stimulation and the excitement that many of the commentators would have liked the Budget to have. I suspect that is more for their own ends rather than for the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>  In putting this year's Budget into context, it is very important that we hark back to the kinds of changes that have occurred since the Labor Party came to government. They have a marked bearing on the Budget and on the future. I refer to measures such as company tax with franked dividends and dividend imputation where company profits are now taxed once rather than twice; the capital gains tax; the reduction in tax scales with the top scale back from 60c to 47c; the research and development tax write-off; the deregulation of the financial markets, which we had often heard about but had not seen much of in previous decades; the floating of the currency; and of course the establishment of a firm and maintained wages policy via the accord.</PARA>
<PARA>  Those changes have meant that the projections, predictions and forecasts are not necessarily as reliable as one would have thought in previous decades because the effects of those changes have not yet been fully felt. Take, for example, the accrual of superannuation funds. In 1983 there was some $15 billion in Australian long term savings via superannuation. This time last year it was in the vicinity of $120 billion--a sixfold or more increase. By the end of the century it will be between $600 billion and $800 billion. The effect of those savings is yet to be understood and yet to be felt, but they will certainly have an impact. </PARA>
<PARA>  For a country whose record in long term savings has been so poor, such a dramatic change in savings balances is certain to impact. The R&amp; tax write-off in the early years when we first brought it in was not understood well by companies; they did not utilise it all that effectively. Certainly in the last couple of years it has become much more widespread and much more productive. The taxing of capital gains in the same form as other gains is now starting to bear some productivity. All of those things are causing a shift in investment patterns and investment markets. We have some years to go before anybody can predict with any certainty or confidence how any particular stimulus will translate because, fundamentally, all the patterns and figures that we see in historical data relate to a different time, to a different system. </PARA>
<PARA>  In putting that forward, it is important that this Budget be seen not as a single Budget but as a continuing process. The fact is that there are no sudden changes, nor should there be. There are no quick fixes, no sudden dramatic shifts in focus or attention or direction. What is in train in the Australian economy is not something that we should tamper with willy-nilly in looking at the framing of the Budget projections. It is important that we recognise the volatility of the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  The external factors working on Australia have become extremely dramatic and far- reaching, and extremely subjective. One can read article after article which gives a different projection as to whether the world is in growth or recession. One can get extremely differing views from well-respected commentators as to what effect the changes in the political systems in eastern Europe will have on world growth. The effect of recent events in the USSR will certainly impact on world trade. As I said, opinions are very divided on whether that impact will be positive or negative. The likely entry of South Africa into the world resource markets again will have an impact, as will the closing of coalmines in East Germany. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those opposite or many of the commentators may believe they know the implications of all those forces, but I think one would have to be fairly suspicious of such a sense of confidence. The fact is that the world is a moving feast of positives and negatives. The Budget attempts to predict and to project what the effect of the various forces will be over the next 12 months In this context it is somewhat cautious, in my view. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the same time, we have some factors which are very difficult to be confident about in the domestic economy, such as the price of wool over the next 12 months. Again, one reads widely differing estimates and projections put forward, absolutely confidently, by respected commentators. The longer term effects over the next 12 to 18 months of the trade subsidy war between America and Europe and its implications for Australia-- again in the context of the changes in the USSR and eastern Europe--quite frankly are unpredictable. </PARA>
<PARA>  For example, in the 1987-88 period we have seen a dramatic decline in commodity prices in our terms of trade. We have seen them fluctuate in ways that have never happened in history. I suspect that it will continue and, therefore, the potential for an accurate projection over the next 12 months is a very subjective matter. (Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA>  I had not realised that I was offending the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who called the quorum. I would like to see the Treasurer report to this place on a quarterly basis. I would like those reports to be boring and not to excite the media, so that there are no major mysteries, secrets and dramatic announcements. It should be more a regular course of informing the Australian people about what is happening with the projections and forecasts of world affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Regarding our projections over the next 12 months, I have great difficulty in forming strong views in some areas. Firstly, the value of our currency seems to be related more to emotional judgments of the market or of some overseas investors than to the true worth of the costs of production in Australia. Secondly, I have great concerns about the direction of company management in Australia in the last 10 years. Perhaps someone has done the calculations. The shift in the emphasis of boards from engineers to accountants has been disastrous. It has been disappointing that financial managers who were calling for deregulation heavily and strongly for so long then showed how incompetent they were to manage it. </PARA>
<PARA>  A number of companies whose management is engineering based are putting forward proposals to boards and receiving negative answers. That is because many board members are not involved in manufacturing and do not understand industry or how to make commercial industrial judgments. Paper money, speculative profits and entrepreneurial flair seem to be their game, which has been to the great cost of many good companies and many good company managements. </PARA>
<PARA>  One then comes to two key issues, the first being micro-economic reform. We hear a lot about micro-economic reform from those opposite. Our companies have been changing in a most dramatic way. But unless one looks inside one would not know. Very few members of the Liberal and National parties in this place ever visit factories or have ever done so on a consistent basis. If they did, they would realise that we are much better placed than they may wish to project and they would realise that micro-economic reform has been taking place for quite some years in a very productive way. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second issue is our tax system. We are told by the Opposition that it would be good for Australia to increase its inflation rate by 7, 8, 10, or 12 per cent overnight--that will increase the cost of selling a house or buying a house or increase the cost of a nursing home bed per week. We are told that all those things are somehow good for the country. The concept is that it is in our interests to start paying tax on items that we have never paid tax on before. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, for the Opposition to suggest that it can find a way within the tax system that will ensure that such a regressive tax as the proposed consumption tax is corrected through the tax scales is absolutely ludicrous. We have been hearing this almost daily for the past 15 months or so. I find it difficult to accept that, if those opposite had the wit or the capacity to manage the country, it would have taken them 15 months to work out what they mean by the words they use and that they would have reconciled the apparent confusion and contradiction in what they say. The inconsistencies are legion and the contradictions are rife; yet these are the people who want to be in government. </PARA>
<PARA>  If it has taken those opposite so long and they still have so many inconsistencies--as revealed again tonight in the current affairs programs--and have not worked out some of the basics, then the confidence that the country could have in them as a future government would have to be diminished. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget is a continuation of a process. Life for many people is difficult at the moment. To suggest, as the Opposition seems to be suggesting, that the Government could wave its hands and create thousands of jobs overnight is a nonsense and, quite frankly, the people know that. To suggest that the Govern- ment could change a tax system and that somehow Australia would be instantly better off is also a nonsense, and the people understand that. People do not look for magic wands from governments or for quick fixes because in their own lifestyles, living patterns and in the companies they work for they recognise the certainty of what is happening. People want recognition, understanding and support. They are not getting that from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government does understand and recognise what people are facing, hence the $4.7 billion deficit. The Opposition would have zero deficit and 90,000 more people unemployed very quickly. The community does not want some magic formula or some hollow words of how the Government could create jobs overnight. It wants a government with some guts and some courage and some honesty about it. This Budget is very straightforward; it is a dour Budget. It may well be a boring Budget, but it is a very honest Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to address my remarks to that part of the Budget appropriations dealing with education. Specifically, the Appropriation Bills appropriate money to pay for the administration of the Government's unified national system of higher education, the 5,500 public servants attempting to cope with this system and with the Government's schools and training programs, and for the proliferating range of advisory bodies under the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, including those recently established as a result of the Government's White Paper on language and literacy. The Bills also appropriate funding for the Australian National University, the University of Canberra and the Australian Maritime College. They further appropriate money for student assistance schemes, Austudy and Abstudy and assistance for isolated children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In its flurry of media hype, the Government has trumpeted the increases in its spending on education. In putting together this spending, it has been putting together a building under construction without a plan and without a blueprint. It is an expensive exercise in ad hoc decision making. The Government has no strategy for the development of higher education over the 1990s. It is the Liberal-National coalition alone which has put on the public record a clear strategy for higher education over this decade. It is the coalition alone which has presented a vision of what higher education can be and should be if excellence and opportunity are to be increased. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a significant difference between the approach of the Government and the approach of the Opposition. The Government has constructed an over-regulated, over-bureaucratised system of east European proportions ruled by fiat from Canberra. It is a system dependent on bureaucratic and ministerial discretion. It is leading to the decline of higher education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The coalition proposes a vastly different scheme where development will be responsive to the needs of students rather than the whims of politicians and bureaucrats and in which universities will have the independence and the freedom to deal with the problems they now face--many, such as overcrowding, the demoralisation of staff and unmet demand, caused by the Government's own over- regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The coalition will give institutions much greater freedom to determine the courses they will offer, the number of students they will admit, the terms on which they will admit them and the conditions that they will offer to academic staff. There will be a significant strengthening of the student market and a strengthening of the link between success in meeting student demand for courses and institutional funding. We will recognise the right of institutions, at present denied, to offer additional places to Australian undergraduate students, over and above those that the Government finds itself able to fund. We will put the private higher education sector on a more even competitive basis. If there is community interest in funding higher education, it should not be confined to higher education provided in the public sector. The coalition will give to institutions the flexibility to determine staff employment conditions by moving to institution-centred industrial relations. Finally, we will ensure that there are incentives for institutions in the research area to be responsive to developments in the wider economy while maintaining independence in the basic research effort. </PARA>
<PARA>  In short, the strategic judgment that we have made is that there must be a significant deregulation so that higher education institutions can have a greatly expanded capacity to determine their own missions, subject to proper accreditation and a vastly expanded flow of information to the student market and to the community. Only when this occurs-- when resources have greater freedom to move within the system and when a healthy level of competition is put in place amongst institutions--will Australia have the prospect of achieving the diversity that is essential for student opportunity and the excellence which is to make sure that we are well and truly able to take advantage of advances in the frontiers of knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA>  The coalition has set out its strategy for the 1990s in detail. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has so far been unable to present any strategy for higher education for the 1990s. It is no exaggeration to say that a state of crisis exists in higher education in Australia. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and his apprentice, the Minister for Higher Education, have wreaked havoc in the field with their damaging and disruptive process of forced industry restructuring by way of shotgun weddings and financial blackmail. Morale is low, the system is overloaded and bursting at the seams and a looming academic staff shortage is of massive proportions. It is a condemnation of this Government and this destructive duo of Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this Budget the allocation for the running costs for the Department of Employment, Education and Training totals some $534m, with property expenses up some 10 per cent to $100m. In DEET's big spending allocation, the biggest increase in percentage terms-- almost 19 per cent--is lavished on administration costs and portfolio advising. It is manna to the new class, the shamelessly self-serving constituency of Labor's Left. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister for Higher Education is a man of the Left, and presumably a supporter of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), unlike his senior Minister, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training or, more accurately, the Minister for Paul Keating. This arrangement has, regrettably, spilled over into higher education. In the Australian Financial Review of 27 August Steve Lewis writes:</PARA>
<PARA>Higher education also appears to be another sector which has benefited from the Left's new found influence in the Hawke Government, following the former Treasurer, Mr Keating's, failed bid for the Prime Ministership. </PARA>
<PARA>  As one government official said last week, in reference to the Prime Minister's perceived allegiance to the Left, Mr Baldwin was `able to assert his temporary powers'. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say that the Minister for Higher Education received little support from his senior Minister during the Budget deliberations. This was not the only time when the two Ministers diverged. Back in July I outlined to the National Press Club the coalition's plans for deregulation of the academic labour market and to allow universities to negotiate salaries and conditions with staff. This was rejected out of hand by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the Minister for Higher Education. But, in its desperate search for a policy to remedy some of the severe problems in higher education and in keeping with the high level of instability in government policy at present, a Deputy Secretary of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, Mr Paul Hickey, speaking on behalf of the Government at a conference in Darwin and in place of the Minister for Higher Education, who decided not to come to this nationally important conference and debate the Opposition, came out and said that moves towards enterprise bargaining which the Government is planning will soon mean universities negotiating separate pay deals with staff. Mr Hickey expanded at length on enterprise bargaining as the Government sees it:</PARA>
<PARA>At the moment we can really only speculate as to what shape enterprise bargaining might take in the higher education system. Initially its impact might be limited. For example, salary and classification structures and other basic conditions such as recreation and long service leave might remain within the national wage fixing system while flexibility is given to institutions to address particular needs and circumstances. However, it is likely that enterprise bargaining will go well beyond this and in a very short time frame.</PARA>
<PARA>Presumably, Mr Hickey was speaking on behalf of his senior Minister, who evidently had had a change of heart--a road to Damascus conversion. But apparently the junior Minister was not privy to the discussion because on 26 August, after a meeting with a New Zealand Labour Party official, the Minister for Higher Education issued a statement condemning Liberal Party proposals to further deregulate the academic labour market. </PARA>
<PARA>  Who is making policy? Is policy even being made? On the evidence, the answer would have to be in the negative. The Minister for Higher Education promised his new policy for the 1990s in March. It did not appear and it was deferred until June. Again, there was no appearance. Then to the Budget; there was no appearance. Now, according to the Australian Financial Review of 27 August, it is due this month, or next, but further delays are not ruled out. </PARA>
<PARA>  After unprecedented upheaval, the higher education sector is desperately in need of some certainty, and the Government's strategy for the 1990s is eagerly awaited. As Professor Ken McKinnon, President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, was quoted as saying in the Australian Financial Review last week, a statement by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services is urgently needed `to see where he stands'. But why the delay? The answer is to be found in the same piece. Professor McKinnon was also quoted as saying that the Minister had found it `pretty difficult' to come to grips with some of the major higher education issues. We are waiting to see whether the Minister has come to grips with the problems, because at present there is no Government strategy for higher education for this decade in the public arena. </PARA>

We have a Minister out of step with his senior Minister, out of tune with his department, unable to produce a policy and condemned for his failure to understand the issues for which he is ministerially responsible. There is a time-honoured political tradition that if people do not have a policy, or if they do but their opponent has a better one, then they had simply better steal it. It has not gone unnoticed, as Steve Lewis of the Australian Financial Review wrote on 27 August:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In an attempt to steal some of the Opposition's alternative agenda for higher education, the ministerial statement is expected to canvass the possibility of further deregulation of the academic labour market. </PARA>
<PARA>It was flattering for the coalition to have the Government, albeit by stealth, embrace the concept of enterprise bargaining in higher education, but we also find the Government has publicly entertained the option of funding via students or--as Mr Hickey dared to say in his Darwin speech--go the whole hog and use the V-word, `vouchers'. The coalition's policy position on this has been greeted by Professor McKinnon of the Australian Vice- Chancellors Committee, who was quoted in the Australian Financial Review of 3 September as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I don't personally have any difficulty with it--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the coalition's policy--</PARA>
<PARA>provided other issues of access, equity and so on are met. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, the coalition is setting the agenda in the public debate on higher education. This has been acknowledged by a senior government source quoted in the Australian Financial Review on 27 August as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . `the ground has changed remarkably' in higher education this year, causing Mr Baldwin to revise completely the thrust of his statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The draft statement, which we have yet to see, of course, is `very different now', according to this official, from six months ago. That is, quite simply, because the coalition has changed the terms of the public debate on higher education. It is the coalition's publicly announced strategy and the positive response it has aroused which has changed the ground. Unlike the Government, we have marked out a direction. It is a direction which has been endorsed in its main respects by many of the leaders of opinion in the universities who have recognised the failure of the Government's regime. </PARA>
<PARA>  Rigid bureaucratic control is clearly not the answer to producing quality in education, but the Minister for Employment, Education and Training has been the most hands-on Federal Minister for education this country has seen. In all fields of education--primary, secondary and tertiary--this Government has pursued a centralist line that is fundamentally opposed to the key issue of diversity. Quite clearly, the national interest is in educational excellence. Ultimately, excellence in schooling is based on informed parental choice, not on bureaucratic supervision and dictation. In the tertiary system we have seen this take place with the destruction of the binary system, an act of administrative vandalism that will take years to repair and which is still disrupting the functioning of a number of institutions of higher education. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's attitude towards diversity is clearly to be seen in its contempt for private institutions. This Government has failed to provide anything approaching a level playing field for private institutions such as Bond University, which has proceeded without a cent of Federal Government support or an iota of encouragement--in fact, with public condemnation by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Its students are not eligible for Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is a government which feels it has to control every activity. This is very much in evidence in the White Paper on language and literacy, tabled last week, which seeks to abolish the cost effective ethnic schools program and hand it over to the State education systems. Such a proposal overrides the commitment by the Prime Minister before the last election to have the program properly reviewed. No such review has been undertaken. The proposal ignores the vital role of this community based program in language education which provides, at a minimal cost, an authentic cultural and linguistic context for language learning and efficient organisational arrangements which bureaucratic systems find difficult to understand or to match, and the potential for more flexible community demanded programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  This program has had its funding frozen and over the last eight years has had a single increase in allocation of 10 per cent. Yet in this Budget we find a boost not of 10 per cent, not of 20 per cent, but of 30 per cent; in other circumstances, that might be laudable, but in this case this increase is earmarked not for extra student places, extra teachers or more resources but for administrative costs. In the same White Paper we find the bureaucracy begetting a flurry of new government bodies created, presumably, to implement what are in effect its very thin and insubstantial recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Firstly, we have the Australian Language and Literacy Council, yet another advisory body to be tacked onto the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. Several years ago the National Language Institute of Australia was established to oversee implementation of the national policy on language. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training does not like the national policy on language that is so beloved of the Prime Minister. He called the Government's progress in this area a `dog's breakfast' at the Australian Literacy Federation symposium earlier this year. The Prime Minister should have spoken to him about this, but I suppose he did not. </PARA>
<PARA>  Now we have a new body to administer the Minister's language and literacy policy. As is his custom, he has chosen to replace an independent source of advice to the Minister with one submerged in his own department. Once again, regrettably, we can anticipate that bureaucratic imperatives will eclipse the national perspective unless by sheer chance they happen to coincide. </PARA>
<PARA>  Then we have the Asia in Australia Council, which looks suspiciously redundant at conception. It certainly must not turn into a mere vehicle for DITAC, DEET and DFAT people to gather to do what they should already be doing. There is the Asia Education Foundation, which is, admittedly, independent, but it is unlikely to have a big impact on schools. There are already in existence a number of bodies--the Australian Council for Educational Research, the National Languages Institute, whose name was changed in the White Paper--that could be used to have an impact. The Foundation will be a new, small bureaucracy, a new vested interest to look after itself, with the risk that it will lock others out. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has made much of its spending on language and literacy programs, but a careful eye needs to be trained on precisely what the money is being spent on--and precision is one commodity that is scarce in this White Paper. To start at the very basic level, where is an acceptable definition of `literacy'? The Paper defines it as:</PARA>
<PARA>the ability to read and use written information and to write appropriately, in a range of contexts. </PARA>
<PARA>Very enlightening!</PARA>
<PARA>  The coalition has long had as a policy plank the establishment of a national monitoring program as a better means of knowing what our children are learning and how well they are learning. The Government has resolutely refused to move in this direction. In the White Paper it adopts some of this rhetoric; we shall have to see whether it in fact delivers on the performance. It is significant that the White Paper does not tell us what form any assessments of literacy will take, but it notes:</PARA>
<PARA>They are likely to include a range of assessments appropriate for different literacy contexts. Uniform or standardised national testing which would not respond to a variety of literacy achievements will not be an outcome. </PARA>
<PARA>We are left blissfully uninformed as to whether there is going to be any effective monitoring process at all. This imprecision is remarkably consistent in its manifestation throughout the White Paper. It tells next to nothing about what is being gained for the expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>  The White Paper started off as a somewhat fatter Green Paper, but after an avalanche of hostile submissions to the Government it was stripped back to the rather thin document that was finally presented to us, with all of the lack of substance to which I have referred. Education and the implications for Australia's immediate future are matters which are simply too important to be left to a discredited, unworkable, inefficient, centralised system that would have done pre-1989 eastern Europe proud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I take this opportunity in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1991-92 to discuss the Government's commitment in the Budget to overseas aid and the Opposition's confusion in relation to our international trading relations and humanitarian obligations. I will also touch briefly on the Opposition's confusion in regard to the significant superannuation initiative contained in the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  My home town of Mount Isa was host to the 1991 Cattlemen's Union conference a fortnight ago. I am pleased to say that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) delivered the keynote address at the conference. He spoke about the Budget and international trade developments, as both are of obvious importance to the cattle industry. He also spoke about the momentous events unfolding in the Soviet Union, as they will affect international trade and thus the cattle industry and, ultimately, all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think it is fair to say that this Government has dragged Australia out of the fortress mentality of the 1960s and 1970s so that all economic and social decisions are now made in the context of the global scene. We are a nation of 17 million people competing with ever-depleting resources in a world of about 5 1/2 billion people. We are not, and cannot expect to be, major players on the inter- national scene, but fortunately for us there are world markets that want to buy our cattle, wool, wheat and other primary products. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have sensibly used our overseas aid program to assist our Asia-Pacific neighbours to develop their economies and cement strong trading relationships with Australia. We cannot make Japan or the US buy our beef or, indeed, expect our Asian neighbours to count us in on regional deals. We cannot expect other countries to buy our products if we inhibit our trading partners selling into Australia with a regime of high tariffs. We have had to free up our trade barriers in order to stay in the game. We are a major agricultural exporting nation and our prosperity derives largely from our ability to sell a range of goods and services abroad. We need a freer, less protected international trading environment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The gradual phasing down of tariffs is part of the Government's strategy of promoting an environment in which industries operate as efficiently as possible. This process has not been easy. Micro-economic reform of the magnitude undertaken by this Government cannot be implemented overnight. Of course, many people do not like change. This Government has insisted upon a process of consultation every step of the way. I believe the Hawke Labor Government has brought an international perspective to Australian politics that is, and always has been, patently lacking on the other side of this House. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) also spoke at the Cattlemen's Union conference in Mount Isa. We heard his standard `bash the Government' speech with the usual hyperbole and heavy talk about abolishing the accord and cutting people off unemployment benefits after nine months--yet again confirmed by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) on the ABC television program the 7.30 Report--as he preached to the converted about his plans for labour market reform, or sacrifice the workers; about consumption tax, make the workers pay; and spending cuts, make those already disadvantaged pay. He talked of the need for `hard headed decisions' and `fundamental change' and `quantum leaps'. He wants to do it `all at midnight, one point in time'. There was no talk of consultation or graduated reform. It would appear that the Opposition Leader wants it all to happen at once. </PARA>
<PARA>  But what does he want to happen? As usual, there was no real detail about his plans for labour market reform or a consumption tax--no figures, no formula; indeed, no substance. But I guess we on this side of the House get used to that. (Quorum formed) What disturbed me most, and what should disturb all Australians, was the Opposition Leader's answer to a question from the floor about where the Opposition spending cuts would come from. At the top of his list was overseas aid, followed by funding to Aboriginal agencies, and then welfare cuts generally. The honourable member for Wentworth even reminded his receptive audience of employers and landowners of his plan at the last election to cut off unemployment benefits after nine months. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to concentrate here on the item at the top of the Opposition hit list: overseas aid. The message that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and people on welfare can take from the Opposition Leader's speech is all too clear. Here we had the new look coalition leader--younger, better educated, the quantum leaper--and what is he doing? He is sticking to the same old conservative panacea for economic woes--he wants to cut overseas aid. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe it shows just how confused the Leader of the Opposition is when he talks about the need to recognise the importance of the Asia-Pacific region. In his speech in Mount Isa the Leader of the Opposition said that the Asia-Pacific region will be the fastest growing region in the world. He wants us to get in there. How incredibly short-sighted is the man who notes that in 40 years time the Asia-Pacific market will be more than twice the size of the American and European markets added together, who calls on us to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . act now to make sure we get the best market circumstances we can down the track. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Then, 30 minutes later, he tells the same audience that the first casualty of his spending cuts would be overseas aid. Of course, our aid program is fundamentally driven by humanitarian concerns, but there are also foreign policy and commercial interests at play. By undertaking a variety of activities aimed at promoting sustainable growth in developing countries, Australia's aid program promotes increased trade opportunities for this country. Australian consultants manage development cooperation projects overseas and Australian industries benefit from purchases in Australia by international organisations to which Australia contributes. Development cooperation activities help to open up new markets for Australian firms, thereby establishing sound bases for future trade relationships. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australian development cooperation is concentrated in the countries in our region. The Leader of the Opposition may be surprised to learn that countries in the South East Asian region and the South Pacific are important partners in Australia's development cooperation relationship. Of the 60 per cent of the 1991-92 aid program that is spent on development cooperation, three-quarters of it goes to South East Asia, Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific. Reflecting the historical relationship between the two countries, PNG continues to be the largest recipient of Australian development assistance. I guess it is no coincidence that some 75 per cent of the total Australian aid budget to PNG is generated back to Australia by expenditure in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this Budget it is estimated that Australia will spend a total of $1,314m on development cooperation activities. This represents an increase in real terms of about one per cent on expenditure in the previous year. I must say that it is a commendable increase that all Australians should be proud of. There is no better way to get in at the ground level to make sure that we can get the best market circumstances down the track than to have Australian companies actually there in the marketplace; having Australian companies building bridges and being the flagships for Australian industry. The aid program enables us to develop lasting trade relationships with developing nations so that in 40 years time we will be in the best market circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that the Leader of the Opposition is obviously confused. He contradicts himself. He talks about acting now so that we can be in the best market circumstance down the track, but what he plans to do is to cut aid to developing nations, which is a proven means of establishing lasting, mutually beneficial trading relationships. Also, there is contradiction and confusion on the other side of this House concerning international free trade. While the Leader of the Opposition seems to be in favour of free trade, some of his buddies in the National Party are not so sure. In fact, some of the Queensland coalition members are actively trying to raise the phoenix of protectionism from the ashes. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the Prime Minister spoke to the 400 men and women at the Cattlemen's Union conference, he spoke about international trade because beef producers are, indeed, international traders. Of course, we sell most of our beef to overseas markets, mainly the US, Japan and Korea. As the Prime Minister told the Cattlemen's Union conference:</PARA>
<PARA>The common agricultural policy of the EC, the EEP policy instigated by the US to combat it, and to a lesser scale, the import restrictions in Japan, Korea and other countries, all add up to an intolerable situation for Australian primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, he is right, especially as a fundamental provision of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is that trade between its signatories must be conducted on a non- discriminatory basis. Despite the anomalies, we must remain committed to the GATT process. We must remain opposed to deals that perpetuate the gross waste of the world's scarce resources that presently occurs. The gradual phasing down of tariffs is part of the Government's strategy of meeting our obligations under the GATT and of promoting an environment in which industries operate as efficiently as possible. Obviously, reduced tariffs expose some Australian primary producers to more intense competition from overseas imports. </PARA>
<PARA>  Now some farming groups are coming out and demanding that the US be brought into line. There is talk that we should snub President Bush when he visits later this year or that we should threaten the US with the closing down of its military bases on our shores. Attractive as these ideas may be, the political reality is that one of the consequences of opening up our economy, floating the dollar and freeing up foreign exchange is that some of our primary producers are more vulnerable to overseas imports in the short term. It is also the political reality, as I said before, that the US has been our largest export market since the mid-1960s and that the Europeans are more to blame for the current trade war than the US. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is an economic reality that the trade war cannot go on for ever. In the meantime, the Government is concerned that Australian industries should not be subject to unfair competition from imports. Mechanisms are available through the Customs Tariff (Anti- Dumping) Act to protect Australian industry against dumped or subsidised imports where they cause or threaten to cause material injury. In order to ensure fair treatment of our exports in foreign markets, these mechanisms are consistent with international rules and procedures on anti-dumping and countervailing duties. Australia's anti-dumping procedures are currently undergoing a thorough review which will be finalised by the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The latest target of the protectionist backlash is the Australian system of tariff preferences. Australia became the first country to introduce a system of tariff preferences for developing countries in 1966 when we sought a special waiver by the GATT to permit us to institute a non-reciprocal preferential system under which specified manufactured and semi- manufactured goods could be imported from developing countries free of duty or at reduced rates of duty, subject to quota limitations on imports at the preferential rate. </PARA>
<PARA>  The philosophy of the special tariff system is very similar to that which underlies our overseas aid program, as I have already discussed. The system is aimed at enabling us to establish long term and mutually beneficial trading relations with developing countries. Our preferential tariff system is under constant review. In October 1989 special tariff status was extended to Poland and Hungary to encourage the far-reaching reforms in the political and economic spheres that were in train in both those countries. More recently, in the March industry statement, it was announced that from 1 July 1992 the preferential tariff arrangements for Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea will be adjusted for tariff items which are phasing down. Tariff rates for these countries will remain fixed at the 1 July 1991 rate until the general rate is reduced to the same level during the general phasing down of tariff cuts. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, the system is flexible. Recently in Queensland, on his very successful trip the Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) agreed to look into the preferential rate system in developing countries that have better manufactured facilities than those in Australia. The Minister also stressed that where the rural sector was faced with competition from imports from countries enjoying developing status, it should reasonably consider forging links with the manufacturing sector here to move into export markets with value added produce. In other words, we have to stop exporting primary products like wool, grain, mangoes, copper or woodchips and buying back woollen textiles, breakfast cereals, mango chutney, piping or paper. We have to make the most of our excellent primary industry base and we have to do the processing. Australians have to profit from value adding, not our competitors. </PARA>
<PARA>  All these issues are relevant to the GATT process. There is no international issue more pressing than the success of the Uruguay Round of the GATT for the future of the Australian economy. Of course, the Prime Minister has asked the Leader of the Opposition to join the Government in sending a bipartisan mission to Europe to be led by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett). </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said, this Government is committed to the GATT process and to our participation in the international economy. We are committed for humanitarian, security and economic reasons to our developing trading partners and proudly assist them via our overseas aid program and the system of preferential tariffs. I believe that continuing commitment is reflected in this Budget. In contrast, the Opposition, led by the quantum leaping Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), remains riddled with contradiction and confusion about our relations with developing nations--a state of confusion that understandably will be of great concern to our Asian- Pacific neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA>  As my colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) said last week, this Federal Budget is about providing restraint with equity, and extending our overseas aid program reflects that process on an international level. Other budgetary measures, such as the implementation of a north Australian social justice strategy and the superannuation guarantee levy, reflect that process at home. </PARA>
<PARA>  In relation to this latter aspect, I commend the comments made in the House last week by my colleague the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis)--and I am glad he is here tonight--when he so succinctly put the Government's budgetary position in relation to superannuation. He said, and I agree with him, that what we are saying to those employers who have not honoured their obligations under Australian industrial law is that they will now be required to do so. Those employers who have already been paying the 3 per cent award will not be affected. The bottom line is that superannuation will ensure equity for all Australians in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even the Leader of the Opposition begrudgingly admitted in Mount Isa that the average worker was being disadvantaged without superannuation when he said this--and I quote from his speech where he is talking about the average PAYE taxpayer:</PARA>
<PARA>They don't have the opportunity of all the tax rorts that are available to the rich: exploiting the superannuation area, cheating on the fringe benefits system, embarking on negative gearing, they don't have these opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>It is hard to believe, but the Opposition Leader actually said this to an audience of self-employed landowners in Mount Isa. He acknowledged that the current superannuation scheme benefits the rich and it goes without saying that anything that benefits the rich is at the expense of the poor. This Budget addresses this inequity in the most equitable way possible, by requiring employers to pay 3 per cent superannuation coverage to assure security in retirement for all Australians and not just the rich minority. If the Leader of the Opposition really meant what he said in Mount Isa, he would endorse wholeheartedly the Government's positive moves in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>  The 1991-92 Budget is an appropriate budget for the current economic climate. It continues our commitment to fostering trading relations with our neighbours in the Asia- Pacific region and the superannuation component ensures that in the decades to come, when we reap the benefits of solid trading relationships with our neighbours, all retired Australians will be able to reap the benefits of superannuation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I was very pleased to hear that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls), did not wish to use the Australian joint defence facility arrangements with the United States as a bargaining chip. I point out to the honourable member that in fact the bases are not American; they are very much joint facilities. It does not do the argument any good to describe them as American bases in Australia because it only plays to the extreme left views of some supporters of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Even a casual glance at the media and other informed reporting of the latest Budget will show that it has been received with downright coolness at best and, from some of the more respected analysts and commentators, with considerable anxiety. I was somewhat amused by one of the leading economics writers who attempted to divert our attention from the Budget by making what I regard as the novel suggestion that the Budget no longer has any great importance. He tried to convince us that its pre-eminence has been substantially eroded by such factors as the rise of monetarist polices, the increased use of fiscal policy for long term and structural changes and the fact that this has moved the centre of economic policy making from Canberra to the Reserve Bank in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA>  These might be valid points in themselves but I believe that that writer is quite incorrect to suggest that when taken together they constitute the demise of the Budget. The article that I am referring to was headed, `Why the Budget ain't a Big Deal'. But the political pain and embarrassment already suffered by the Hawke Government from this very inadequate Budget are proof by themselves that, in fact, the Budget is a big deal. </PARA>
<PARA>  We all know that the Budget is, or should be, the major national instrument through which the government of the day draws up an economic and social balance sheet of where we are at and presents a prospectus for the coming year and beyond--hopefully where we are going to. The Budget is correctly regarded by the Australian public as an opportunity for the Government to report to the nation, to announce important policy changes, to summarise the state of the nation and, above all, to show all of us that it is firmly at the helm with sound and forward- looking economic management. In short, one of the most important of the Budget's objectives is to provide Australians with a vision--a vision that identifies the country's problems and offers convincing solutions and that gives Australians confidence about their future. I would suggest that this is the single greatest failing of the Budget that we are debating. </PARA>
<PARA>  Such a failing in the nation's annual Budget or blueprint is never acceptable. But it becomes a disaster when the only response that this Government can offer at this time, when we are in the worst recession in 50 years, is a Budget that has been so aptly described as `steady as she goes'. Steady as she goes-- with unemployment heading towards one million people, bankruptcies at close to depression levels, consumer and business confidence seriously eroded and our structural problems well identified and acknowledged! Ordinary Australians and the business community alike wanted, needed and deserved a vision for the future. What have they got? They have got very little indeed. Other people can see the need for such a vision. For example, the Australian Chamber of Commerce spoke of the Budget's lack of vision and complained that it failed to provide clear targets in critical areas such as investment, manufacturing development, et cetera. One of Australia's most respect businessmen, Mr Brian Loton, said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have, temporarily I hope, lost our sense of direction. We are unclear about the way forward. </PARA>
<PARA>Even Labor's colleagues and friends are sufficiently concerned to go public. For example, Mr Deputy Speaker, your own colleague, the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr, has made several recent attacks on Federal Labor policies, one of which referred specifically to its lack of vision. The Victorian Treasurer, Mr Roper, is also concerned and considers the Budget to have foreshadowed unacceptably low levels of business investment `which are not a recipe for us coming out of this recession into recovery'. </PARA>
<PARA>  The common thread through all these comments and much of the media reporting is a concern that the Budget does not properly address our pressing structural problems and that there is no sense of direction or purpose. Despite all the signposts showing this, the Government cannot or will not read them. </PARA>
<PARA>  But there is no secret about the direction in which these signposts are pointing; in fact, quite the reverse. There has been widespread community discussion and consensus about what ails this country. I detect a willingness, even a desire, amongst Australians to make a start down the difficult road of readjustment. Of course, people in different walks of life express it the way they see it. But the heart of it, when one strips it all away, is nearly always the same: it is a lack of confidence that the Hawke Government has the political will and the management skills necessary to take Australia through the remainder of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>  Ask a young man in my electorate of Warringah who has just been laid off work where he thinks we should be going. He will tell us. Ask members of the small business community, or what is left of it; they will tell us what is needed. So will manufacturers, exporters, scientists and all the other people who make up society. But, unfortunately, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) does not know. It seems it is too soon for the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) to have found out what it is all about. Obviously the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), does not know or we would not be in the mess we are in. It always fascinates me to see the accolades that some people pour on the former Treasurer. Yet here we are in the worst recession for 50 years and he is still described by some of his supporters as the greatest Treasurer of the Western world. We are in the greatest mess that most people can remember. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will mention just a few figures to demonstrate the gloomy state of business investment. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show a 9 per cent fall in business investment in 1990-91. That followed a 7 per cent fall in the previous year and a 6 per cent fall in the year before that. So over the last three years we have had a 6 per cent fall, a 7 per cent fall and now a 9 per cent fall. However, the more telling statistic is that business investment fell to $29.5 billion in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us just consider what that means for our future. The respected BIS-Shrapnel organisation has calculated that we need $44 billion of investments annually to create the capacity necessary to reduce the current account deficit to zero and to stabilise debt. That is a level of investment almost 50 per cent greater than today's levels. Put that need against the Budget estimate of a further 9 per cent fall in investment in the fiscal year 1991-92 and at last we have some understanding of the concern felt by so many of our informed commentators. We are going backwards at the very time that this Government should be remoulding Australia into new directions and offering policies that will return this country to long term economic prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA>  Investment is such a central consideration at this time that I return to it again. I stress that total investment in terms of gross domestic product is now at its lowest level in more than 30 years. It is predicted in the Budget Papers to fall even further in the coming year. Yet what do we find? This Government accepts such an alarming trend with a `steady as she goes' Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last year the Economic Planning Advisory Council estimated that Australia needed to invest between 23 per cent and 27 per cent of national output to achieve a modest 3 per cent rate of economic growth. In the March quarter of 1991 total investment achieved only 21.5 per cent of GDP--and it is falling. Put quite simply, two respected organisations, the Economic Planning Advisory Council and BIS-Shrapnel, are in broad agreement that the present and expected rate of investment is not sufficient to achieve and maintain even a</PARA>
<PARA>modest rate of economic growth. If we add to that the urgent need to achieve international competitiveness with improved productivity, it is clear that Australia did not need a steady as she goes Budget but a blueprint which would encourage the business community towards historically high levels of selective investment and, preferably, equity investment at that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think it could be truly said that the Hawke Government has put the cart before the horse--or, more accurately, that the ACTU has put the cart before the horse, and this Government has been silly enough to try to drive it away. What we need is investment that will return Australia to world competitiveness, with those benefits flowing onto the work force by way of higher real wages and conditions such as superannuation. Instead, the ACTU has forced through premature and unaffordable superannuation concessions that will stall the process of recovery, add to job reductions and contribute to a continuing decline in our standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, the ACTU's bullying creates the very climate that we should be avoiding; a climate that will make this country less and less attractive for investors, both domestic and foreign; and a climate that will lock us into structural shortcomings and almost inevitably contribute to economic backwardness and to the honourable member for Blaxland's famous banana republic status. </PARA>
<PARA>  We must not lose sight of the fact, as has this Government, that the other side of the investment coin is savings. Our national savings are simply too low to sustain the investment program needed for this country over the next decade or two. Savings can be generated from both public and private sources. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note how few commentators have discussed the implications of this Budget's return to deficit. From a zero public sector borrowing requirement, promised for this year in the 1990 Budget, the actual requirements in 1991-92 will probably be in excess of $15 billion. What does that say about the honourable member for Blaxland's economic management? This borrowing requirement will put pressures on the national stock of savings and it raises questions about the extent to which this will flow on to interest rates and foreign debt. These pressures will occur at a time when domestic savings are at a record low level. This weakness will be an important determinant of the pace of sustainable economic recovery through the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is very little difference between a person and a country when it comes to saving. If a person does not save, that person either resorts to credit or does without. A country is no different--Australia is no different. If we do not save, we must either borrow or do without. If the country has already borrowed up to its limit--and we have--we must either start saving or go without. These are the simple options which face Australia today. Goodness knows, there is room for a new start to be made.</PARA>
<PARA>  Household savings, as a percentage of GDP, have fallen from 17 per cent in 1975 to less than 4 per cent in 1991. What an achievement for this Government! We have literally run out of both savings and credit. I suggest that this country has nowhere to go except into a more responsible and modest lifestyle. I know that that might sound insensitive to the hundreds of thousands of unemployed people, and to the many others who have to use their savings just to survive in these difficult times. I want to reassure those people that I am talking of Australia as a nation. Governments must save, so must businesses, and if possible so must all of us. It is the accumulation of all those savings that will finance essential investments. </PARA>
<PARA>  Where was the leadership in this Budget to encourage higher domestic savings? It has been suggested that the Government's move towards compulsory national occupational superannuation will compensate and even reverse these falling savings trends. But there is strong evidence to suggest that this is not so. Recent work by Access Economics suggests exactly the opposite--that the particular occupational superannuation model being introduced by the Hawke Government may well result in a lowering of investment. If this is correct, not only are we back to the horse and cart problem to which I referred earlier in my speech, but it makes it more and more likely that the ACTU has sold the Government an ass instead of a horse. </PARA>
<PARA>  The underlying problem of this Budget is that nothing has been done to address the key issues, such as a structural imbalance in the current account and an inadequate performance from the manufacturing and exporting sector. That poor performance can be traced back to a succession of inappropriate and failed policies, a fact which has been admitted publicly by the Minister responsible for industry development, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). </PARA>
<PARA>  As BIS-Schrapnel has stated in its recent report, Long Term Forecasts, Australia is fast approaching, if not already in, a debt trap, where any improvement in the balance of goods and services is more than offset by continuing escalation of the debt servicing component of the current account deficit. It joins with many other analysts in recommending that the Government should be giving active encouragement to selective investments which address themselves to the structural changes needed to rebuild our manufacturing sector and encourage import competing and exporting industries. The weight of opinion is overwhelming for a determined policy move in that direction. It is the failure of this Government to take such action that will lead to its demise. Instead, the Government gives us a Budget that is soft on economics and hard on politics; a Budget which, regrettably, is more a reflection of the Government's preoccupation in fending off the honourable member for Blaxland's brutally ambitious assault on the prime ministership than it is of sound economic management. </PARA>
<PARA>  But I believe the malaise goes much deeper than that--right to the quality of the advice that this Government is receiving from its own analysts. Let us look, for example, at the latest annual report of the Reserve Bank. Under the title The Focus of Policy, it gives considerable attention to inflation and interest rates, but manages to condense Australia's structural problems into a single concluding sentence:</PARA>
<PARA>If. . . a low level of inflation can be sustained, Australia will be better placed to tackle other necessary structural changes. </PARA>
<PARA>What are those necessary structural changes? A search of the other chapters of the report shows only this:</PARA>
<PARA>The structural changes and improvements in work practices which businesses and government instrumentalities have implemented during recent years should contribute in this regard--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, to rising living standards--</PARA>
<PARA>as throughput rises during the upswing. </PARA>
<PARA>It also states:</PARA>
<PARA>The successful application of such an approach--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, low inflation, related wage claims and the timing of changes in monetary policy-</PARA>
<PARA>offers the best chance for Australia to regain the status of a low-inflation, low-interest rate and high- growth economy. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Reserve Bank really considers those comments to adequately address Australia's structural problems, I feel some compassion for the Treasurer at the quality and professionalism of the advice he is receiving from the Reserve Bank--or perhaps at its motives. </PARA>
<PARA>  The overwhelming weight of informed opinion, and the instincts of ordinary Australians, tell me that this is a Budget that failed to provide the economic leadership and management so desperately needed in these difficult times. With nearly one million people unemployed, bankruptcies nearing depression proportions, and a collapse in business confidence, this Government has turned its back on its responsibilities and, unfortunately, on the Australian people. It may find that such contempt will be repaid by the Australian people turning their backs on the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have spoken at some length on the failure of the present Hawke Government to provide the nation with a sense of direction and a real vision for the future. I do not think there is any doubt about that. If one looks at the total response to the Budget, there is one overwhelming impression--that it did not provide the necessary vision and leadership. While it is undeniable that the business community must have a defined and predictable framework within which to makes its investment decisions, it is also clear that the business community has an important contribution to make to the achievement of the national vision. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the early 1980s the business community had enormous--indeed, unparalleled--opportunities to contribute to Australia's economic development. That it failed to respond as well as it might to those opportunities is due in part to the economic and regulatory framework provided by the honourable member for Blaxland, and also to the ethos and ethics of the corporate sector. I believe that the corporate sector of the economy, including the professional sector, was found wanting in this most important area of corporate and business ethics. There was not the commitment to proper dealings that there should have been. There was not the commitment to the proper protection of other people's resources that we came to expect in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>  There was, and has been, an absolute breakdown in trust between the people and those administering their assets, mainly in the form of savings. We cannot require the Government to provide all the vision. What we need in this country is for government and all Australians--whether they be working for somebody else or providing the opportunities for other people to have meaningful employment--to be working together with that common vision. If we fail in that development, we will have failed a very great nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- When the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) delivered his Budget Speech on 20 August, he outlined the Government's direction not only for the coming fiscal year but also for a number of years ahead. This Budget continues the Government's strong commitment to providing social justice for all Australians and to creating an economic environment where hard won reforms can be maintained and built upon to provide lasting benefits for our country and our people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There can be no argument that the conditions under which this Budget was framed were among the most difficult that have been faced by any government for many years. It would be easy to take the soft options, to ignore the need for careful, balanced management of the recovery from the recession--and, yes, the signs are continuing to show that the recovery is under way. However, this Government has never been one to turn away from its obligations. This Government has not shied away from making the more difficult decisions which have been necessary in the long term interests of the country as a whole, and this Government has never ignored the difficulties that face average Australians. All decisions have been weighted by the need to lessen the impact on these people wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Appropriation Bill (No. 1) continues that theme; that is, an ongoing dedication to the initiatives that matter most to Australians--the people issues. As the Treasurer said in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA>Government and economic management is not some remote clinical exercise . . . Government is about people. This Budget is about people. </PARA>
<PARA>The people of Australia need to know that their children will have affordable and equitable access to education and training to enable them to acquire the skills and knowledge needed to compete in tomorrow's world--a world of rapidly changing technology and a highly competitive labour market. This Budget provides the following allocations: $2,500m for schools, including $2.5m for continuation of the students at risk program and $3.2m for the good schools strategy; $420m for TAFE funding, including $216m for capital works, $163m in recurrent funding and about $40m to help fund 10,000 new pre-vocational training places; and $200m extra for higher education, with $53m extra for capital works and an additional $9m built into base funding to assist with enrolments expected in 1992 on top of the 13,000 new places to be created. </PARA>
<PARA>  Funding for education and training is not enough, however, if people cannot afford to pay for their children to participate in these opportunities. This Budget addresses this problem as well with increased spending on Austudy, which is the student assistance scheme. A total of $1,255m will be spent on Austudy in 1991-92, which is an increase of $232m on last year. This will provide assistance for about 45,000 extra students in 1991- 92. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Abstudy program for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders is also expected to assist around 52,000 students in the coming year. The increase in the number of beneficiaries has been caused by a number of factors, including higher than expected enrolments in the tertiary education sector; higher retention rates for years 11 and 12, which were originally approximately 53 per cent in 1987 and are expected to exceed 70 per cent this year; improved marketing and information materials, leading to increasing numbers of eligible secondary students who are applying under the scheme; increased program recognition, as the program has the highest level of recognition among the 15 to 24-year-old age group of all government programs directed towards youth; and increased recognition on the part of students of the benefits of completing appropriate education and/or training before entering the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA>  These achievements in education in a practical and tuition sense clearly show which side of politics has the people side of decisions in mind when planning an education framework. I add that the Austudy program has been extremely successful since its commencement in 1987. It is expected that more than 445,000 students and their families will receive assistance in 1991-92. This represents a significant increase over the previous year, with the money provided for Austudy in this Bill catering for the higher than expected increase in the number of students receiving assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>  There were also a number of major changes announced in the Budget to improve the access to these support payments, thereby assisting to reduce the burden on Australian families. People also need assistance to gain entry to the work force. This is particularly so for disadvantaged groups such as the long term unemployed, the young, workers with literacy and language difficulties, and those people in low skill employment areas who may face the prospect of losing their jobs and who, without assistance, would have little chance of gaining other employment. This Government recognises the needs of these people. Unlike the Opposition, it is not content to throw them on the unemployment scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget will increase spending on labour market programs by $199m in 1991-92 to provide constructive assistance to workers and employers, to counter the effects of the recession, and to build Australia's skills base. Newstart, the Government's new pro-active employment assistance program, will receive approximately a third of this funding to enable it to meet its objective of providing training and employment-directed support for the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The very successful employment training scheme, Skillshare, will also receive extra funding to continue and expand the very beneficial programs that are run by various centres throughout Australia. There are three Skillshare projects operating in my electorate. Without a doubt, they have shown that this program is the most successful and cost- effective form of employment training and assistance ever devised. </PARA>
<PARA>  Great success has been achieved in practical courses conducted jointly between the Ipswich TAFE and local Skillshare funded units, such as YUPI--the young unemployed people of Ipswich. Some of these courses include a successful catering outlet called Tuckerbox, which is a restaurant and a canoe hire service operating at Lake Ivanhoe, north of Ipswich, in an effort to raise more money for courses. Importantly, the job placement rate on completion of courses is in the range of 80 per cent to 90 per cent in most instances, which is testimony to the Government's push for practical skills training as the necessary ingredient for preparing Australia for long term work force stability. </PARA>
<PARA>  The success of this program lies in its ability to combine the aspirations of the local community, employers and prospective employees into effective employment-oriented training. The three Skillshare projects in my electorate, through a coordinated and cooperative approach to employment training, have successfully placed many people into active, full time employment. Some people have been placed after a long break from the work force. There is no doubt that, over the coming year, we will see many more people assisted in obtaining rewarding full time employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another group which suffer labour market disadvantages are the Aboriginal people. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as a group, are disproportionately represented in the ranks of the unemployed, up to four times higher than the level attributed to the general community. Apart from access to the mainstream employment training and assistance programs, the Federal Government continues to place a high priority on programs to assist Aboriginal people in their efforts to gain self-sufficiency and greater financial security. </PARA>
<PARA>  One program that is achieving outstanding results is the community development employment projects scheme, better known as CDEP. Under this program, Aboriginal communities give up their entitlements to the Job Search allowance and Newstart, and participants receive wages for working on community projects. The scheme currently involves more than 18,000 people in 166 communities. Because of the success of this program, the Government has agreed to expand the scheme significantly to boost Aboriginal employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget provides an allocation of $194.9m to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission for CDEP in 1991-92. This funding for CDEP will be complemented by $96.5m which has been allocated to the Department of Employment, Education and Training for Aboriginal employment programs. The DEET allocation includes funding for recruitment and career development strategies that are directed towards Aborigines in the Australian Public Service and towards increasing Aboriginal employment in local government. CDEP is helping to overcome the public perception of Aboriginal people waiting around for public hand-outs. It is showing that Aboriginal people are not only prepared to work for their income but also that they prefer to do so. They are prepared to forgo benefits and instead will work for the good of themselves and their communities. </PARA>
<PARA>  In recent times, as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, I have had the opportunity to visit a number of communities. I have seen at first hand the success of the CDEP program. I am sure that it has most certainly been welcomed by the Aboriginal people, together with the increased allocation announced in the Budget. This program really shows that the Aboriginal people are prepared to stand up and work for themselves in a program whereby they stand to benefit most. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some of my colleagues who have visited some of these communities during the last couple of weeks--particularly communities such as Aurukun and others on Cape York-- realise the need for an ongoing program such as CDEP. It has been extremely successful, and I am sure that when the increases in funding filter through, much greater benefit will be derived by those communities. There are real difficulties being experienced in those communities, particularly through unemployment. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are dedicated to the improvement of their own lifestyle. The improvement in living conditions that the CDEP program will provide will certainly help them a great deal as time goes on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Some time ago I received a letter from the Victorian Farmers Federation regarding the 1991 Budget and the Government's poor response to rural issues, particularly in providing financially stricken farmers with better access to Department of Social Security benefit programs. Although the Budget temporarily addressed a number of issues including the assets test problem by modifying the family allowance supplement, it failed to target two key areas which the Victorian Farmers Federation is concerned about: firstly, the Job Search allowance and, secondly, Austudy. I want to address just a few comments to the House about the Job Search allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is totally inequitable that a farmer's spouse who is actively seeking work is not eligible for the Job Search allowance, even though the family may have virtually no income. The assets test limit for Job Search allowance is $157,500 and, realistically, there are very few viable farms worth less than this. By implication, the Government is saying that it expects farm families with low incomes to sell the farm to provide themselves with income support. This is not desirable, and the Government has to have a very hard look at the situation. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a number of reasons why this is not desirable. Firstly, many farm assets are not divisible or saleable in the current economic climate. Secondly, for those that are, the selling of part of a farm would mean making the remaining farm enterprise a non- viable unit. Thirdly, there are very few jobs available to a farmer who is able to sell the farm as a whole. There are practically no jobs in many rural areas throughout my electorate. Fourthly, this expedient of selling the farm reduces economic activity within a region and certainly within a nation. Fifthly, a farm is sold together with the home on it, so selling the farm means selling the home--and the reluctance of many farm families to take this step is very understandable. Were the Government to impose this requirement on unemployed urban families, just imagine the outcry.</PARA>
<PARA>  Unlike other groups, the main asset of the farm family is not the home. Whilst it may be appropriate to apply the $157,500 threshold to other groups and to exclude the home from asset calculations, for farm families it is more appropriate to adopt the discounting practice used by the Department of Education, Employment and Training programs for Austudy. Consequently, the Victorian Farmers Federation has recommended that, for the purpose of determining eligibility for Job Search allowance, business assets for farm families be discounted by 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  I make these remarks on behalf of Mr Alec Arbuthnot, President of the Victorian Farmers Federation, who drew this matter to my attention. I hope that the Government does take note of this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- Yesterday afternoon I had the pleasure of attending within my electorate the official opening of a Wilston Village road and shop development. It was opened by the Brisbane Lord Mayor, the right honourable Alderman Jim Soorley. The development represents one of those small but important plans to enhance quality of life in Brisbane's inner urban area, and in many ways fits in with the sorts of commitments that were announced in the Federal Budget a short time ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The development in Wilston, which has been on the drawing boards for 18 months and which was officially opened yesterday, has provided a rejuvenation for a small suburban shopping centre. It has added to the character of the area, and has enhanced the pride which local residents feel and have demonstrated in their suburb. Yesterday, walking around a crowd of some 400 or 500 people who were there at any one time--in fact, I understand some 3,000 local residents were at the opening through the day--one could observe that those people were enjoying the opportunity to mix in a carnival atmosphere, to talk with neighbours and to talk with those people whom they seldom get a chance to discuss things with but often bump into at local shops and at local schools and sporting activities with their children. </PARA>
<PARA>  This development represents a major achievement for the local community because it was an initiative of local residents in association with their local alderman, David Hinchliffe. He has done a wonderful job in bringing together the aspirations of that community and seeing them through to the project's completion on Sunday. In fact, the project was assisted by Federal Government funding which enabled the development of the street to occur. But none of it would have been possible without the contribution of a number of key local residents. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr David Kelly, who is secretary of the Wilston Business Association and one of the local pharmacists, played a major role in coordinating the activities of the local business community, which not only took the opportunity to enjoy extra trading on that Sunday but which also has provided a facelift to the shopping strip that was once indicative of the sorts of small shopping strips that existed within inner suburban areas that were finding it hard to get along in difficult times. That facelift has seen an enhancement in trade in that area. </PARA>
<PARA>  Lyn Pearuril, one of the fair committee organisers, worked tirelessly and was one of the very happy faces to see on the day as she went around welcoming guests and, I am sure, enjoying the outcome of her hard work. Importantly, David Lane, an architect with the firm Thompson, Adsett and Partners, provided his own and, I understand, some of the firm's skill in drawing up the plans that led to the development of that area, which is now one of the most beautiful small shopping strips on the north side of Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA>  This development gives an insight into the sorts of things which can be done without great cost to develop inner city living to provide an improvement in local community self-respect and to return once again to the inner suburbs a quality of life for families which has been slowly but surely evaporating over the last 30 or 40 years. In Queensland, I believe we have in the Goss Government a progressive State Labor Government keen to take advantage of the opportunities which the Federal Government has provided with the better cities program, and of course with the new Brisbane City Council, led by Alderman Jim Soorley, we have the opportunity to ensure that Brisbane becomes a leader in that program. </PARA>
<PARA>  I might add that in the Federal division of Brisbane, with State members such as the honourable Pat Comben, who was at the opening on Sunday, we have a team of local, State and Commonwealth government representatives keen to ensure that the quality of life in our inner suburban areas is enhanced. With the Government's initiatives for a better cities program, we now have the funding and opportunity to do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish to discuss a matter which I believe is of the utmost national importance, a matter which should be the immediate concern of every member of the House. I refer, of course, to the enormity of the economic problems now confronting the nation. In particular, I refer to the now desperate plight of small business people, the unemployed and much of the farming sector. These people are suffering appallingly not only from the effects of the recession we had to have but also from high interest rates, rapacious creditors and a system which has protected the Skases and Bonds of the community whilst crucifying those who have no friends in high places and who are the most vulnerable to the slings and arrows of outrageous government neglect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government claims that unemployment is just under 10 per cent. In my electorate of Dunkley unemployment is at least 15 per cent, while youth unemployment is at least double the adult rate. A similar sorry state of affairs exists in many other parts of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recent months have seen an alarming rise in the number of bankruptcies and business collapses of one kind or another. The statistics do not in themselves reveal the magnitude of the human tragedy that is manifested in the destruction of families and by suicide and despair. The disastrous high interest rate policy has shattered confidence and turned dreams into nightmares. As soon as interest rates are eased imports will literally flood in unless the productive base is protected--that is, import replacement industries are protected. The policies of this Government have left much of Australia's productive sector a wasteland. Only the top companies are relatively secure, as they can operate globally and borrow at international rates. Yet even they are departing the country to reinvest elsewhere. BHP is spending most of its development funds overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government has betrayed the trust of the nation, but it can halt the destruction. Unless action is taken now, poverty caused by unemployment and bankruptcy will spread. Already the nation is on the verge of experiencing a second wave of business collapses caused by the recession, caused by high interest rates and caused by banks attempting to make their traditional customers pick up the bill for the banks' lending excesses of the 1980s. A person investing $100,000 in a bank today would be lucky to get 10 per cent interest. If he borrowed $100,000 from the bank he would pay 16 per cent interest. This is probably the highest marginal interest rate in our history. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australians are grasping at straws. The nation needs a moratorium on debt. There must be an end to the destruction of small business and farmers. A moratorium is essential. We must act to protect the productive base needed for economic recovery. There must be an end to the loss of the nation's intellectual property. The Australian Securities Commission has acknowledged that the nation has already lost 20 per cent of its intellectual property. The consequences of a loss of that magnitude can only be imagined. If Australia is ever to truly become the clever country it is imperative that its intellectual assets are safeguarded. It is the intellectual property that will be the basis of its economic recovery; it is currently being obliterated. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has already, to some extent, recognised the gravity of Australia's position by freezing the assets of unlisted property trusts. In announcing the freeze, the Government has created a precedent which shows it has the power to act without legislation. My plea is on behalf of the forgotten people who have no voice in the corridors of power. I ask the Government to stop debating the leadership issue and concentrate on two problems: firstly, the horrendous levels of unemployment and the poverty that inevitably results from it; and, secondly, the nation's shrinking number of wealth producers. </PARA>
<PARA>  I ask the Government to immediately, that is, this week, introduce a moratorium on debt. Stop the loss of farms; stop the closing of businesses; and stop the ever-increasing dole queues. Unless a moratorium is called now I fear the 1930s Depression will pale into insignificance alongside the 1991-92 depression. My plea is for a moratorium now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-First, I have a few quick comments in response to my friend the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford). I am not sure what he means by his call for a moratorium on debt. I do not know whether he means that no-one should be allowed to use Mastercard or Bankcard or any other credit card to purchase goods from today onwards, or whether he means that no bank should be allowed to lend any money to any of the companies that it might have been intending to help. When he calls for assistance to the unemployed, perhaps he could persuade the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to stop attacking this Government when it lowers interest rates and brings down a Budget with a deficit of $4.7 billion, which will of course expand the economy and result in the recession ending sooner, rather than a balanced Budget, which his Leader has been advocating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I rose to speak not about the state of the economy but about a matter affecting a constituent of mine, a Mr J. Morgan of Wyong, who lives in a mobile home park in my electorate. He has a very serious health problem which affects his breathing. As a result, he has to have an air conditioner and an oxygen machine running at least 14 hours a day. As you would expect, Mr Speaker, this results in an amount of approximately $150 a quarter in extra electricity costs for Mr Morgan. </PARA>
<PARA>  He was initially advised by staff at Gosford hospital that he would be entitled to a 50 per cent rebate on his electricity account. When my office examined this matter it found that he was not entitled to this rebate because he lives in a mobile home park. If Mr Morgan lived in an ordinary dwelling or a home unit he would be entitled to the rebate, which of course is subsidised by the New South Wales Government. Unfortunately, Sydney Electricity, a statutory authority of the New South Wales Government, has a policy that, unless it has a separate meter for a customer who applies for a medical rebate, it refuses to provide the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Despite the fact that the caravan park owner has installed separate meters for every resident in the mobile home park, Sydney Electricity says it will not trust the meters installed by the mobile home park owner; it will believe only meters installed by Sydney Electricity. I would like to quote from a letter which I received from a Mr B.A. Ferguson of Sydney Electricity. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>I would advise that for Electricity Supply Authorities to grant rebates on electricity accounts, Government authorisation is required. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to medical rebates on electricity accounts County Councils were advised by the Government, in 1986, that this authorisation was being extended to cover the use of oxygen concentrators. </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to quote the exact wording issued by the Minister at that time. Mr Ferguson continues:</PARA>
<PARA>To fulfil this requirement the Authority must issue an account to the premises in which the oxygen concentrator is used. </PARA>
<PARA>In the case of Mr Morgan, the caravan park is not separately wired or metered for individual tenants and Sydney Electricity issues one account to the proprietor of the park who in turn charges the individual van occupants for electricity usage. </PARA>
<PARA>To allow rebates to park proprietors for subsequent passing on to eligible persons would remove any control Electricity Supply Authorities have in ensuring that rebates are granted in accordance with the strict guidelines laid down. </PARA>
<PARA>In the circumstances, I regret that Sydney Electricity is unable to accede to your request to grant rebates to caravan parks where the sites are not separately metered for individual tenants. </PARA>
<PARA>That really is a terrible attack on the rights of residents of caravan parks and mobile home villages. Mr Speaker, you would be aware of the tens of thousands of people in New South Wales alone who would be affected by that decision. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fact that these people need oxygen concentrators or dialysis machines or other types of medical equipment should entitle them to this 50 per cent medical rebate. The fact that the Greiner Government refuses to extend this concession to the residents of mobile home parks and caravan parks who are not separately metered by Sydney Electricity warrants serious review by the New South Wales Minister for Energy. </PARA>
<PARA>  When I wrote to the Minister for Planning and Minister for Energy of New South Wales, Mr Webster, he advised me that he had had a review of this matter and that he had now sent that off to a parliamentary committee of the New South Wales Parliament. He said that it would be later this year that he would get to make a decision on it. I would appeal to Mr Webster to forget about a review by another parliamentary committee. He should make a decision now to ensure that these medical rebates are extended to all residents of New South Wales who have a separate meter, whether that meter happens to be owned by Sydney Electricity or the owner of a caravan park or mobile home village. </PARA>
<PARA>  People such as Mr Morgan should be entitled to receive the rebate so that they have every opportunity to ensure that their health is not affected by decisions of the Greiner Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish tonight to speak regarding the appalling state of respite care for children and adults with special needs. This Government has been responsible for the almost total disintegration of services to the disabled in our community and, in particular, within my electorate of La Trobe. Families who for many years have relied on services provided through their local municipality via the home and community care program and funded by the Federal Government are now at the end of their tether. Drastic cuts to funding for respite care have resulted in reduced hours being available and heavily increased burdens being placed on family members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Respite care has been a relief valve for the carers who have made a lifetime commitment to tending their special needs person, child or adult. It is not practical nor desirable for special needs people to be tossed around from one carer to another--from an experienced carer to an inexperienced carer. Nor is it desirable for a special needs child to be placed, on a regular basis, with new and different carers who may have no knowledge of, and be unfamiliar with, that child's particular disability. </PARA>
<PARA>  Caring for a special needs child or adult requires special people with special skills. It is essential that a relationship is allowed, and indeed is encouraged, to develop between the special needs person and the respite care giver. My constituent Mrs Pendlebury of Mt Evelyn has written to me requesting my assistance in obtaining a better deal for respite care. Her letter says:</PARA>
<PARA>As a mother of a disabled child I wish to bring to your attention the shortfall in funding for respite care. I myself have been refused respite care on a number of occasions. This leaves me with an awkward situation of who will care for my child? Will it be someone who is unfamiliar with and who has no knowledge of his disability and no experience in caring for a special needs child?</PARA>
<PARA>The respite care program states that `the programme aims to enhance the quality of life and independence of those at risk people and their carers'. This is not happening. How can I enjoy a quality of life if I am worrying about the care of my child?</PARA>
<PARA>Please help us to get more funding for respite care. </PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Pendlebury is not alone in her need and yet the drastic cuts to respite care that have occurred have isolated her from a proper respite care program which is so essential for the whole family. My constituent Carol Kriss, who lives in Montrose, has been fighting for many years for a better deal for the physically and mentally disabled and those who care for them. Mrs Kriss has a Down's syndrome child--a really lovely little girl but a child who requires constant adult supervision and attention. Mrs Kriss is a sole parent who, under great difficulties, has attempted to become financially independent and become a producer for society rather than a taker. But Mrs Kriss has time and time again run headfirst into the bureaucracy, with its unbending nature with which we are all so familiar. </PARA>
<PARA>  All honourable members should be familiar with the poverty trap that exists for sole parents who must care for their children at the same time they might try to enter or re-enter the work force. The poverty trap associated with the sole parent benefit makes life very difficult for anyone--but particularly for women who want to work and also need to care for their dependent children. Imagine the even greater difficulties experienced by a sole parent with a disabled child. Not only must Mrs Kriss pay for very expensive child-care in order for her to work--expensive because of the nature of caring for a disabled child--but she is under constant pressure when at home due to the arduous nature of her burden. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mrs Kriss loves both her children, but she reckons, and I agree, that every once in a while it would be nice to have a break from the constant care associated with a special needs child. Respite care through the home and community care funding arrangements is a particularly valuable service of social responsibility which we in this place must support. I call on this Government to demonstrate in a meaningful and practical manner its absolute commitment to an adequate respite care program for my constituents. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --Today is the eightieth birthday of John Grey Gorton, one of our most interesting Prime Ministers and certainly one of the most independent, freewheeling and controversial. He came to the prime ministership unexpectedly, after the death of Harold Holt. John McEwen, then the Leader of the Country Party, vetoed the succession of the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Billy McMahon. John Gorton, backed by a group of senators, defeated Paul Hasluck to become the Federal Liberal Party leader. He served as Prime Minister from January 1968 to March 1971. He left the prime ministership on his own vote. When his Party was evenly divided against him, he cast the decisive vote against himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  He had a very unconventional background. He grew up in rural Victoria, attended Geelong Grammar and then, ultimately, read history at Oxford University--although he was a most unlikely Oxonian in style. As many would know, he become a citrus farmer in the north-west of Victoria and served very gallantly in World War II in the Royal Australian Air Force; he suffered a number of grievous injuries as a result of crashes and his face had to be reconstructed. </PARA>
<PARA>  He was active in local government and then was one of the nineteen-forty-niners elected to the Senate from Victoria when Sir Robert Menzies took office, defeating the Chifley Government. He became a senator in 1950, he was a backbencher for a long time and then had a remarkably rapid rise from the back bench to become the first leader of his Party to come from the Senate. For a brief period after he resigned as a senator, he was not a member of either House. He then contested the vacant seat of Higgins--vacant because of the death of Harold Holt--and he held that seat until his retirement in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA>  As Prime Minister, he did a great deal to break down the hysterical Cold War rhetoric which had marked and dominated politics in Australia for about 25 years--the idea that the election of a Labor Government would cause a national disaster, that there would be a Red revolution and foreign invasion, that the pile of skulls once so familiar in DLP election advertisements would actually be seen in our public places, and that Catholic schools would be burnt down, perhaps with their pupils inside them. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those of us who were involved in politics either in the centre or out at the periphery all grew up with this crazy-talk rhetoric 25 to 30 years ago. We owe a great deal to John Gorton, particularly in the 1969 election. He said to his Party managers, his minders, `I don't believe all this nonsense'. They said `Yes, but it has been useful in the past'. He said, `It may have been very useful in the past, it may do a lot to whip up votes, but I just do not believe in it and I cannot bring myself to say it'. </PARA>
<PARA>  It meant that after 1969 the issues of foreign policy--and to a large extent education policy, particularly the bitterly divisive issue of State aid--simply disappeared. It is almost impossible to think of a future Federal election where we will have a kind of political gang warfare on the issue of foreign policy. We have an era of bipartisanship, put together by Whitlam and by Gorton. I think both of them deserve credit for that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also have a great regard for Gorton's role in reviving a degree of national feeling--not a stupid chauvinism, but a sense that we were not just a derivative culture where everything was to be derived from Great Britain, a sense that we could stand on our own feet. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am particularly grateful for the role John Gorton played in reviving the Australian film industry--an area, again, that Whitlam took up and followed through. To the extent that we have a film industry and, I would say, a fairly lively television industry--certainly at the programming end, although, financially, its rewards are not too abundant--we owe that to John Gorton. He is a great Australian. He showed his concern for the parliamentary system when he indicated his support for Gough Whitlam in 1975 because of his opposition to the Kerr coup of that year. He is a great Australian and I am sure that all members of this House will want to pay him tribute on his eightieth birthday. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Nine R&amp; Corporations and four Councils currently exist under the Primary Industries and Energy R&amp; Act 1989 (PIERD Act) to manage portfolio rural R&amp;. In addition, the Australian Meat and Live-stock R&amp; Corporation (now called the Meat Research Corporation), the Horticultural R&amp; Corporation and the Dried Fruits Research Council were already in existence before the passage of that Act. The corporation model was chosen to increase the participation of end-users in all stages of the R&amp; process and encourage closer co-operation between industries, researchers and commercial institutions. The objective is to increase the competitiveness of primary industries through increased efficiency and profitability of industries in this sector.</PARA>
<PARA>  Most portfolio R&amp; is funded through a combination of industry levies and Government contributions which match industry R&amp; expenditure dollar for dollar to a maximum of 0.5% gross value of production of the commodity. The Land and Water Resources R&amp; Corporation and the Rural Industries R&amp; Corporation are predominantly Government funded as they cover largely public good research.</PARA>
<PARA>  Separate R&amp; Corporations have been established in the dairy, pig, sugar, grape and wine, cotton, wool and grains industries. The Rural Industries R&amp; Corporation (RIRDC) covers multi- industry and small industry R&amp;. Separate R&amp; Councils operate under the umbrella of RIRDC in the honeybee, egg, chicken meat and tobacco industries. Action is under way to establish a Rice Research Fund under RIRDC management and a Forestry R&amp; Corporation proposed for January 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) The sixteen rural R&amp; Corporations and Councils in the portfolio cover the following industries:</PARA>
<PARA>    Grains--grain legumes, oilseeds, wheat, barley, triticale</PARA>
<PARA>  The Grains R&amp; Corporation covers grain legumes, oilseeds, wheat, barley and triticale research, which were formerly handled by separate Research Councils (or in the case of triticale, the Australian Special Rural Research Council). Leviable grain legumes are lupins, field peas, faba beans, chickpeas, mung beans, pigeon peas, peanuts and navy beans. Leviable oilseeds are sunflower, safflower, soyabeans, rapeseed and linseed.</PARA>
<PARA>  Cotton</PARA>
<PARA>  The Cotton Research and Development Corporation, replaced the Cotton Research Council on 1 October 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>  Grape &amp;Wine</PARA>
<PARA>  The Grape and Wine Research Council, established under the Rural Industries Research Act 1985, administered grape and wine research until it was replaced on 2 July 1991 by the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>  Dried Fruits</PARA>
<PARA>  The Dried Fruits Research Council was established under the Rural Industries Research Act 1985. The dried fruits industry is seeking the establishment of an R&amp; Council under RIRDC.</PARA>
<PARA>  Sugar</PARA>
<PARA>  The Sugar Research and Development Corporation replaced the Sugar Research Council on 1 October 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>  Horticulture</PARA>
<PARA>  The Horticultural R&amp; Corporation undertakes horticultural R&amp;. Leviable horticultural commodities are apples and pears, nashi, nursery products, citrus, potatoes and avocados. Other horticultural industries make voluntary contributions towards R&amp;.</PARA>
<PARA>  Small And Emerging Rural Industries</PARA>
<PARA>  The Rural Industries R&amp; Corporation covers small and emerging industry research as well as multi-industry R&amp;. It conducts research in such industries as pasture seeds, goat fibres, cashews, coffee, rice and sorghum. Leviable industries are pasture seeds, comprising certified seeds of clover, medic and lucerne cultivars, and goat fibres.</PARA>
<PARA>  Meat and Live-stock</PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Meat and Live-stock R&amp; Corporation, established in 1987, was renamed the Meat Research Corporation on 1 July 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>  Dairy</PARA>
<PARA>  The Dairy R&amp; Corporation, responsible for dairy industry research, replaced the Dairy Research Council on 1 April 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>  Wool</PARA>
<PARA>  The Wool R&amp; Council was replaced by the Wool R&amp; Corporation, administered under the PIERD Act 1989, on 1 July 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>  Pigs</PARA>
<PARA>  The Pig R&amp; Corporation came into operation on 2 July 1990 to oversee pig research.</PARA>
<PARA>  Honeybees</PARA>
<PARA>  The Honeybee R&amp; Council, established under RIRDC's umbrella, replaced the Honey Research Council on 2 July 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>  Eggs</PARA>
<PARA>  The Egg Industry R&amp; Council, established under RIRDC's umbrella, replaced the Egg Research Council on 2 July 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>  Chicken Meat</PARA>
<PARA>  The Chicken Meat R&amp; Council, established under RIRDC's umbrella, replaced the Poultry Research Council on 2 July 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>  Tobacco</PARA>
<PARA>  The Tobacco R&amp; Council, established under RIRDC's umbrella, replaced the Tobacco Research Council on 1 August 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>  Land and Water</PARA>
<PARA>  The Land and Water Resources R&amp; Corporation was established on 3 July 1990 to carry out the R&amp; aspects of land and water management previously handled within the Department. It is responsible for integrating research into soil and water conservation and the environmental and ecological aspects of forests and woodland management.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Grains--grain legumes, oilseeds, wheat, barley, triticale</PARA>
<PARA>  Grain Legumes</PARA>
<PARA>  Based on the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economic's (ABARE's) May 1991 forecast for 1990/91 Australian production of grain legumes, industry levy contributions to the GRDC Trust Fund are expected to be approximately $1.93 million in 1990-91. This is $68,000 above the Department's estimate contained in the 1990-91 Budget Papers.</PARA>
<PARA>  Oilseeds</PARA>
<PARA>  Based on ABARE's May 1991 forecast for 1990/91 Australian oilseed production, industry levy contributions to the GRDC Trust Fund are expected to be approximately $525,000 in 1990-91. This is $56,000 above the Department's estimate contained in the 1990-91 Budget Papers.</PARA>
<PARA>  Wheat</PARA>
<PARA>  The 1990-91 wheat industry research contribution to R&amp; is $10.94 million. The levy estimate was revised down from $13.14 million in December 1990 to $10.69 million in March 1991 to account for falling wheat prices as it is an ad valorem levy.</PARA>
<PARA>  Barley</PARA>
<PARA>  Based on ABARE's May 1991 estimate, industry contributions for barley research in 1990-91 are now expected to reach $2.559 million compared with $1.780 million estimated in the 1990-91 Budget Papers. This reflects an increase in ABARE forecast production from 3510kt to 3968kt and an increase in the levy rate from $0.52/tonne to $0.75/tonne as requested by the Grains Council of Australia, effective from 1 November 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>  Triticale</PARA>
<PARA>  Industry contributions for triticale research will increase from the original estimate of $109,000 to $116,000, reflecting a slight increase in forecast production.</PARA>
<PARA>  Cotton</PARA>
<PARA>  Based on ABARE's May 1991 forecast for 1990- 91 Australian raw cotton production, industry levy contributions to the Cotton R&amp; Corporation Trust Fund are expected to be approximately $2.517 million in 1990-91. This is $275,000 above the Department's estimate contained in the 1990-91 Budget Papers.</PARA>
<PARA>  Grape and Wine</PARA>
<PARA>  The 1990-91 estimate for industry contributions to the Grape &amp;Wine R&amp; Corporation are now expected to be approximately $1.00 million. This is a revision down from the December 1990 estimate of $1,100,000 due to a decrease in 1990- 91 production. Accordingly, industry contributions to research for 1990-91 are expected to decline due to seasonal factors.</PARA>
<PARA>  Dried Fruits</PARA>
<PARA>  The 1990-91 estimate for industry contributions for dried fruits research remains unchanged at $463,000.</PARA>
<PARA>  Sugar</PARA>
<PARA>  The forward estimate in Budget Related Paper 10 was $1.620 million. The revised estimate, as at November 1990 was $1.519 million. The estimate at June 1991, based on ABARE figures, was $1.512 million.</PARA>
<PARA>  Horticulture</PARA>
<PARA>  Receipts to date indicate that the 1990-91 estimate is likely to be higher than the actual levy contributions received due to a smaller than expected apple crop, non-implementation of an expected levy increase for apples and pears and lower than expected nursery returns. However, total industry contributions to the Corporation will be significantly higher than this figure as it does not take into account voluntary contributions, paid directly to the Corporation of about $2 million. Voluntary contributions are up on estimate and should balance the reduction in levy returns.</PARA>
<PARA>  Rural Industries--pasture seeds, goat fibres</PARA>
<PARA>  Pasture Seeds</PARA>
<PARA>  1990-91 industry contributions to research will probably be slightly below original estimates with decreased production volumes due to drought conditions. As industry levy contributions to the scheme did not begin until 1989-90, expenditure on research has only just commenced.</PARA>
<PARA>  Goat Fibres</PARA>
<PARA>  Lower than expected volumes and prices of goat fibres is expected to result in a small shortfall in budgeted research funds for 1990-91. However, sales of currently stockpiled goat fibre accompanying any increase in prices would recover this shortfall.</PARA>
<PARA>  Meat and Livestock</PARA>
<PARA>  The 1990-91 estimate of industry contributions for R&amp; programs is currently expected to be $14.09 million compared with the budget estimate of $14.43 million.</PARA>
<PARA>  Dairy</PARA>
<PARA>  The research levy for the Dairy R&amp; Corporation is collected on a per kg milk fat basis. Milk production is expected to remain in the range 6.1--6.3 bl and the levy income will hold relatively stable. The Corporation expects to finish the 1990- 91 year close to budget, although it is possible that unforeseen delays with some projects could lead to under expenditure of some $0.5 million. This will have a consequential impact on the demand for matching funds. However, any under expenditure that results will not be related to falls in levy income.</PARA>
<PARA>  Wool</PARA>
<PARA>  The current estimate of industry contribution to wool research in 1990-91 is $14.2 million dollars. This compares with the 1990-91 Budget estimate of $17.1 million. This expected shortfall is primarily a result of a fall in wool prices arising from the suspension of the Minimum Reserve Price Scheme for wool.</PARA>
<PARA>  In 1990-91 the apportionment of the wool tax going to R&amp; was 0.35%. In 1991-92 the apportionment is 0.5%. However, it is estimated that the increased tax rate and matching Government contribution that it will attract will be insufficient to compensate for the expected decline in wool prices and wool production.</PARA>
<PARA>  Intensive Livestock Industries--Pig, Honey, Eggs, Chicken Meat</PARA>
<PARA>  Industry contributions are expected to meet or exceed 1990-91 estimates for rural research.</PARA>
<PARA>  Tobacco</PARA>
<PARA>  The 1990-91 estimate for tobacco industry levy contributions to the Tobacco R&amp; Council Trust Fund, as provided for in the 1990-91 Budget Papers remains unchanged. The estimate is based on the national tobacco leaf quota, the level of which is established the year before the crop is harvested.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) The wool, wheat, tobacco, sugar, grape and wine, pasture seeds and goat fibre industries are expected to have reduced industry contributions to research due to declining prices or volumes of sales.</PARA>
<PARA>  Wool, Pasture Seeds and Goat Fibre</PARA>
<PARA>  See answers to question 3.</PARA>
<PARA>  Wheat</PARA>
<PARA>  The expected wheat industry contribution to research in 1991-92 of $10.12 million is below the 1990-91 contribution of $10.94 million due to the effect of declining prices on the ad valorem levy.</PARA>
<PARA>  Tobacco</PARA>
<PARA>  Unless industry increases the levy rates on tobacco leaf, the industry contribution could decline in absolute terms from $729,000 in 1990-91 to around $700,000 in 1995-96 due to reduced consumption of tobacco products and hence reduced demand for domestic leaf.</PARA>
<PARA>  Sugar</PARA>
<PARA>  Industry contributions to research are based on production levels, not price or volume of sales. 1990-91 levy receipts for the sugar industry were lower than originally expected because of lower than expected production. 1991-92 levy receipts are estimated to be lower than the figure provided for forward and revised estimates because of forecast reduced production levels. ABARE is currently forecasting 1991-92 sugar cane production at 28.095 million tonnes cf a previous forecast of 30 million tonnes. On this basis, levy receipts would total $1.686 million cf the previous estimate of $1.8 million.</PARA>
<PARA>  Grape and Wine</PARA>
<PARA>  1990-91 levy receipts for the grape and wine industry are expected to be lower than originally expected due to lower than expected production. As a result of industry agreement to levy rate increases, levy receipts are estimated to be $1,430,000 in 1991-92 and $1,540,000 in 1992-93 (lower than the figure provided for forward and revised estimates because of a revision to the long term production estimate for the industry).</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) The Government's matching contribution in 1990-91 is not expected to be affected due to any reduction in industry contributions. This reflects the fact that in the first instance the Government's matching contribution is determined by the level of expenditure (not the level of industry contributions) by the rural industry research funding body for a given commodity. Funding decisions and contractual obligations are already in place for the current financial year, so expenditure levels and hence Government matching funding are unlikely to be affected.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is expected that for the next financial year funding bodies will maintain their expenditure at a level substantially consistent with their forward estimates of expenditure and hence Government matching funding will remain as estimated.</PARA>
<PARA>  Expenditure levels are not expected to be greatly affected by a one-off reduction in industry contributions because each funding body maintains a reserve of funds at a prudent level (typically a minimum of 50% of the following year's estimated budget) to provide for any unforeseen need that may occur due to irregular receipts from industry resulting from poor seasons or other factors that reduce industry contributions below those estimated.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) Table 1 shows the total funds available for research in 1991-92 by Corporations and Councils in each rural commodity where projected figures are available, including industry and Government contributions. 1991-92 contributions for some corporations or councils may not cover all R&amp; costs and may be supplemented from reserve funds.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) Table 2 outlines information on industry and Government research for each commodity over the past five years. Figures are in 1990-91 constant dollars.</PARA>
<PARA>  (8) Grains--grain legumes, oilseeds, wheat, barley, triticale</PARA>
<PARA>  Grain Legumes</PARA>
<PARA>  It is not expected that the research levy for grain legumes will be affected by declining prices or falling volumes, hence financial resources are not expected to be affected in 1991-92. Given the favourable price outlook for most grain legumes relative to other grains, 1991-92 production of grain legumes could be expected to increase, thus ensuring there is no decline in funds available for research.</PARA>
<PARA>  Oilseeds</PARA>
<PARA>  It is estimated that the industry contribution to oilseeds research will increase slightly reflecting forecast increases in winter oilseed production exceeding declines in summer production. Therefore, financial resources available are not expected to be adversely affected in 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA>  Wheat</PARA>
<PARA>  It is expected that the price decline experienced by the wheat industry during the last season will not continue throughout 1991-92. The GRDC expects expenditure on wheat-related research this year to be around $24.351 million. This means that about $2.520 million will be drawn from the reserves available for wheat research.</PARA>
<PARA>  However, the reserve funds available were built up through excess funding over expenditure during seasons when production/prices were high and are specifically available to be used when funds decline because of low production/prices.</PARA>
<PARA>  Barley</PARA>
<PARA>  Financial resources for barley are expected to increase in 1991-92 reflecting increased industry contributions for 1990-91 due to an increase in levy rate.</PARA>
<PARA>  Cotton</PARA>
<PARA>  Financial resources available are not expected to be adversely affected in 1991-92. This reflects a forecast increase in domestic raw cotton output and a foreshadowed increase in the levy from $1.50 per bale to $1.75 per bale. Therefore combined Commonwealth/industry funds available for research in 1991- 92 could be $5.55 million.</PARA>
<PARA>  Grape and Wine</PARA>
<PARA>  Lower than expected production in 1990-91 is expected to lead to a total industry contribution for grape and wine research of approximately $1.0 million. With the Commonwealth matching expected to be of a similar order, around $1.9 million should be available for grape and wine research in 1991-92. In spite of the lower 1990-91 production, the GWRDC has approved a research program totalling $2.5 million in 1991-92 (approximately $300,000 lower than originally forecast). This involves the use of reserves in the Trust Fund and is aimed at maintaining an adequate level of research. Account has been taken of the foreshadowed levy rate increases in 1991-92 and 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA>  Dried Fruits</PARA>
<PARA>  While prices for dried fruit in 1991-92 are likely to be down slightly, this will be more than offset by the increase in production. It is not expected therefore that funds for research will decline.</PARA>
<PARA>  Sugar</PARA>
<PARA>  1991-92 sugar cane levy receipts were forecast to increase over previous years based on an ABARE forecast of an increase in production. The figure provided for revised estimates was $1.800 million. This has since been revised on the basis of a more recent production estimate to $1.686 million. The 1991-92 research program will draw on some reserve funds.</PARA>
<PARA>  Horticulture</PARA>
<PARA>  A 70% increase in financial resources are expected to be available for research and development in 1991-92. Increased funds will come from levy rate increases, new levy paying industries and higher levels of voluntary industry contributions.</PARA>
<PARA>  Rural Industries--pasture seeds, goat fibres</PARA>
<PARA>  There will be no impact from produce sales on available research funds for these industries as new programs for these small industries are supported by RIRDC's core funding. RIRDC is expected to expand its research program in 1991-92 by approximately 50%.</PARA>
<PARA>  Meat and Livestock</PARA>
<PARA>  It is not predicted that there will be any decline in either prices or volume of leviable meat or livestock in 1991-2.</PARA>
<PARA>  Dairy</PARA>
<PARA>  As the Dairy R&amp; Corporation levy is collected on a per kg milk fat basis and as milk production is expected to remain in the range 6.1--6.3 billion litres in 1991-92, levy income will remain stable. The DRDC will have no difficulty maintaining its research program in 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA>  Wool</PARA>
<PARA>  A $2.9 million shortfall in industry contributions to wool research in 1990-91 will result from the fall in wool prices following the suspension of the Minimum Reserve Price Scheme. In 1991-92 the proposed increased tax rate, from 0.35% to 0.5%, and matching Government contribution that it will attract will be insufficient to compensate for the decline in wool prices and expected decline in production. The WRDC estimates that the industry contribution to research in 1991-92 will be $13.3 million.</PARA>
<PARA>  The total revenue available to wool research in 1991-92 is estimated to be $32.3 million, $13.3 million from industry with an equal amount from Government, $4.6 million in interest earnings and $1.0 million from other sources, such as royalties. Estimated expenditure in 1991-92 will be $53.7 million, much higher than estimated revenue, resulting in a rundown of reserves which were built up through the mid 1980s. Estimated reserves at 1 July 1991 are $59.6 million. The research effort in 1990-91 was not affected by declining wool prices due to the presence of substantial reserves.</PARA>
<PARA>  Pigs, Honey, Eggs, Chicken Meat</PARA>
<PARA>  In these industries it is not anticipated that research activities will be curtailed or be subject to declining Government or industry contributions. Both Government and industry contributions are expected to increase in 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA>  Tobacco</PARA>
<PARA>  An expected decline in volumes over time will have no impact on tobacco in 1991-92 as the quota in that year has been maintained at previous levels.</PARA>
<PARA>  (9) No R&amp; Corporations or Councils have curtailed or withdrawn research programs in 1990- 91 due to lack of financial resources.</PARA>
<PARA>  However, the proposed reduction in the GRDC National Wheat Committee's funding of research projects in 1991-92 (advised in June 1991 after the Senate Estimates had been provided), while possibly triggered by the declining income in levies, is a result of a desire to maintain the level of reserve funds.</PARA>
<PARA>  (10) Currently no R&amp; Corporations or Councils envisage reducing or withdrawing specific research programs in 1991-92 other than wool and grams.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Wool R&amp; Council had planned to reduce research expenditure by a nominal 770 in 1991-2. The Wool R&amp; Corporation, which replaced the WRDC on 1 July 1991, may review this proposal. The proposed cutback in research funding will be achieved by funding fewer new projects and is not expected to necessitate the termination of current projects before their scheduled completion.</PARA>
<PARA>  The GRDC has advised that in respect of wheat research in 1991-92, cuts to the funding of continuing projects will average around 19.3%. However, total expenditure on wheat research in 1991-91 is only expected to decline by 9.3% from the level of 1990-91. It is proposed that new projects will be funded to the sum of around $1.7 million.</PARA>
<PARA>  (11) As indicated in the answer to part (10) above, the wool research effort may be affected by declining funds in the next few years. The other industries which expect to be affected are the wheat and tobacco industries.</PARA>
<PARA>  Total Government and industry contributions to wheat research in 1991-92 are estimated to decrease by around only 0.21% ($46,000) on 1990-91. It is therefore reasonable to say that research efforts have not been significantly affected by any decline in Government or industry contributions, but an average cut to the funding of continuing projects of around 19.3% has been imposed by the GRDC in order to maintain reserves.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Government contribution to tobacco research for 1991-92 and subsequent years will be $314,000 less than applied previously, reflecting the Government's May 1989 decision to terminate the special matching arrangements for tobacco and to apply the standard ceiling to matching funds of 0.5% of GVP. Research expenditure in 1991-92 will be above the level of 1990-91, drawing on reserve funds. The impact on research efforts after 1991-92 will depend on industry decisions on the future level of the research levy.</PARA>
<PARA>  (12) Funding of State rural research by R&amp; Corporations and Councils is presented in Table 3.</PARA>
<PARA>  Parts (13)--(16) are answered together.</PARA>
<PARA>  Legislation provides for this type of research and R&amp; Corporations actively encourage syndicated research efforts. The nature and benefits of syndicated research will depend on the industry and issues being addressed:</PARA>
<PARA>  Crops R&amp; Corporations</PARA>
<PARA>  Due to the nature of research undertaken within the crops commodities industries, it is not unusual for Commonwealth (usually CSIRO) or State (Departments of Agriculture) agencies to be jointly involved in projects with other sectors of the industry such as growers, tertiary institutions and private research bodies.</PARA>
<PARA>  This has been reinforced by the establishment of the various R&amp; Corporations particularly during the last twelve months to provide for, inter alia, more efficient use of available resources. In this regard, as in the past, support is available for syndicated research proposals, whether they be regionally or nationally oriented, if the Corporations feel that they are consistent with their objectives and priorities.</PARA>
<PARA>  Rural Industries R&amp; Corporation</PARA>
<PARA>  The RIRDC funds syndicated research with both State and Federal research bodies. The Corporation sees considerable opportunities to continue these activities, however, they are difficult to establish and administer. More regionally oriented</PARA>
<PARA>and focused research could be provided by properly designed syndicated research projects.</PARA>
<PARA>  Dairy R&amp; Corporation</PARA>
<PARA>  The DRDC is encouraging the concept of syndicated research. In fact the PIERD Act has a special provision enabling research contributions directly from dairy co-operatives. The DRDC is currently developing a proposal for a syndicated cheese starter centre funded by levy and co-operative contributors. Further, the DRDC is developing a proposal for a quality centre through which industry members can seek advice or research on their quality problems.</PARA>
<PARA>  Wool R&amp; Council</PARA>
<PARA>  The WRDC funds a number of jointly funded projects with State departments and the CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA>  Intensive Livestock R&amp; Corporations/ Councils</PARA>
<PARA>  These research bodies also fund syndicated research across commodities where there are mutual benefits. For instance the Chicken Meat and Egg R&amp; Councils conduct joint research projects in a number of areas, and the Chicken Meat R&amp; Council and Grains R&amp; Corporation also co-operate in jointly funding some research.</PARA>
<PARA>  Land and Water Resources R&amp; Corporation</PARA>
<PARA>  The LWRRDC funds syndicated research efforts at State and Federal levels, involving agencies such as the CSIRO. There is considerable scope for funding such syndicated research. The LWRRDC emphasises that the current close involvement of the resource user or the managing agency is essential in the planning of projects and their implementation. The LWRRDC will actively seek to increase funding of interdisciplinary research and expand collaborative work.</PARA>
<PARA>  Properly designed syndicated rural research projects are currently funded by the LWRRDC. They are designed to achieve strategic objectives and are not necessarily regionally oriented. The Partnership Research Program supports research which has the financial support and involvement of State and Federal agencies and rural industry and grower groups.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CF4">Mr Campbell</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 14 May 1991:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Was the so called Fletcher Jones Initiative a scheme to sell one million bales of wool to the USA to produce blends for the production of slacks in North America for that market.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Did the initiative (a) result in the sale of about 2000 bales and (b) cost the International Wool Secretariat (IWS) more than $70 million, approximately $430 per kilogram sold; if not, what are the figures.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Are there grounds for concern about the competence and ethics of the IWS and the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC).</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="973" SPEAKER="Crean The Hon S.F." NAMEID="DT4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KALGOORLIE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I assume that the question is a reference to the allocation by the IWS of funds during 1990-91 for the development of a new program to target the `middle market' in response to erosion of wool's share of that market segment--which represents approximately 40% of the total apparel market. Approximately 30% of the funds, or $20 million, were allocated to the depressed United States market where erosion of the middle market had been severe. To a very large extent this represented a diversion of funds from existing `value building programs'.</PARA>
<PARA>  It would not be accurate to describe the program as the initiative of any single individual. The IWS is working closely with the AWC on the program. Men's trousers, women's separates and knitwear for both men and women have been targeted for the US program. Target partners have been selected including apparel manufacturers, mills and retailers. Both new and existing IWS contacts have been targeted, including short staple mills which normally handle cotton and synthetic fibres.</PARA>
<PARA>  Emphasis during 1990-91 was on negotiating with partners and establishing their specific needs.   Assistance is being provided with product development and sourcing, and developing or locating fabrics which meet the performance and aesthetic requirements of customers at a reasonable price.</PARA>
<PARA>  For 1991-92 approximately $8 million has been provisionally allocated for the US program, which will include promotion of products in stores through displays and brochures, as well as joint advertising.</PARA>
<PARA>  Early indications are that a shift in resources to the volume sector of the market is being effective. While it is too early to judge in any precise way the impact of the program on wool consumption, the increase in wool consumption in targeted areas in the USA resulting from the program would appear at this stage to be of the order of 20,000 to 30,000 bales in 1990-91, and 30,000-40,000 bales in a full year. In addition to increases in wool consumption in the targeted areas (eg wool blends, etc) it may be expected that there will be flow-on benefits to other sectors of the market as well.</PARA>
