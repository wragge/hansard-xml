<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having taken a few moments to recover from that overwhelming reception, it gives me great pleasure to be able to speak this morning on Appropriation Bill (No. 5), which is for the appropriation of moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1990-91 under Appropriation Acts Nos 1, 2 and 3 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one mentions `unavoidable expenditures' and additionals to the appropriations, one could perhaps spend the whole debate wondering why it was necessary and why they are unavoidable. A number of other speakers have, of course, taken that approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I wish to speak on the additional gross estimate of $278.2m that is being sought by the Defence portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No. 4). The total Defence outlays are estimated to increase by a net figure of $181m, when account is taken of all transactions contributing to the Defence function, including offsets provided from increased revenues and a reduction in the provision of contingent salary and related increases. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the main objectives of our defence forces in relation to the additional estimated funds that are required under this Bill. I am talking in terms of the general aims and objects of each of our defence forces, irrespective of these particular appropriations but in terms of the Budget overall. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the prime objectives of our naval defence force is to provide a maritime force capable of conducting effective maritime operations in the pursuit of Australia's interests, using Regular and Reserve forces and expanding, or having the capacity to expand, in a timely manner against a warning of more substantial conflict. That statement is one of the prime concerns of past reports-the Dibb report, the White Paper and so on. We on this side of the House have become increasingly aware, in particular, of the Government's lack of attention on that point: of having the capacity to expand in a timely manner against warning of more substantial conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> The prime objective of our Army defence force is to provide land forces capable of conducting effective land operations in the pursuit of Australia's security interests, using both Regular and Reserve forces, and being able to expand in a timely manner against warning of more substantial conflicts and the resolution of high risk terrorist incidents in support of all our civil authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> I did hear a definition recently that an army is a body of men gathered together to correct the mistakes of politicians. I sincerely hope that in the light of the budgetary cuts and the points that are being emphasised in this debate, and with the seemingly rapid deterioration in terms of Government policy with regard to the defence forces, such a thing will never become reality in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> An army subprogram of individual training for both regulars and reservists is also to be developed. There is the need for the Government to provide more funding for the cadet organisations throughout this country. I know that the reintroduction of national service, of which a lot of people in this country would be very much in favour, is beyond the resources of the Government and the country at the moment; but certainly it is within the power of the Government to give more support to the cadet organisations around the country. In my own electorate there is a flourishing cadet corps at Katoomba, where, believe it or not, there is a long waiting list of young people wanting to become members of that cadet corps. It has recently been provided by the New South Wales Government with a very good venue in which to conduct its training. </PARA>
<PARA> The corps had to look for an alternative venue because in the Federal Government's selling-off program, the ideal set-up at Katoomba-the drill hall that was owned by the Defence Department-was sold off by the Federal Government as part of its revenue collecting exercise to help balance the budget. I would like to commend Mr Ollie Hume, one of the driving forces behind the cadet corps in Katoomba, for the work he has done. It will be of tremendous assistance in promoting a good, healthy group of young people in that part of Australia. There are very good flourishing cadet corps in many other parts of this nation. I do commend to the Government the provision of more support and funding to that very worthy cause. </PARA>
<PARA> The prime objective of the air Defence Force is to provide an Air Force that is capable of strategic and tactical operations as an independent, joint and combined force, including the supply of maritime and land operations in the pursuit of Australia's defence and internal security. Further development is necessary to meet higher levels of conflict should Australia's strategic circumstances deteriorate over the longer term. This is also high on the Air Force agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to Australia's extensive northern coastline, its significant maritime interests and its relatively small manpower force, we need a strategy of defence in much greater depth. This dictates the need to operate in the sea and air approaches to this country. Air capabilities are vital in this regard. The Royal Australian Air Force also has an important role to play in conducting maritime surveillance patrols in our areas of interest, protecting shipping, offshore territories and resources, providing air lifts and offensive air support to the other services, contributing to cooperative activities with countries in our region, and providing assistance to civilians in times of crisis and natural disasters. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate there is the very large RAAF transport base at Richmond. Every time there is a crisis in terms of floods, drought and so on, such as the floods at Nyngan and in other parts of Australia, a substantial part is played by the men and women at the base and their aircraft in alleviating the tremendous problems that confront people in those crises. I commend the commanders and the personnel at the Richmond base for the excellent way they perform their duties and for their willingness to spend long hours, as they do, in carrying them out without overtime. No members of the regular Defence Force are paid overtime. There is time off in lieu, but they are prepared quite willingly to spend a great number of hours working in those areas of need that confront us from time to time. That objective is one of the very fine objectives that are achieved by the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> The prime objectives of our defence forces that I have just outlined will be impossible to achieve in the light of the current problems that confront us with regard to our present defence capabilities. Our peacetime defence forces need to be kept at a high level of readiness if we are to have a credible deterrent. Our forces that went to the Gulf had to learn many of their warfare skills along the way-if that can be believed. Equipment was fitted onto the ships in a great rush, and the technicians and operators of the new equipment were fundamentally self-taught. </PARA>
<PARA> This parallels with the experience of our soldiers at the beginning of World War II, who stuffed cigarette papers into their bandoliers and who had to train with pieces of wood because of the shortage of rifles and ammunition. I sincerely hope that such situations and circumstances will not be the case today should we in this country be confronted with aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> We should reflect on the lessons learned from our previous wars, and remember that one of these lessons has to be the importance of maintaining a well-equipped and well-trained Defence Force so that we may deter any aggressor and allow our country to remain at peace. This is the desire throughout this country. No matter where one goes, when one talks to ordinary Australian people it is apparent that they are very concerned about the reports in the media-which are, in many instances, true-about the lack of confidence that is felt generally with regard to the capabilities and the effectiveness of our defence forces at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> One major concern is the strength in numbers of our defence forces. The strength of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) continues to fall. It is now at its lowest level since 1979. It is expected that proposed drastic changes in Force structure will slash these figures dramatically. The crucial test will be whether the new strength and structure will leave the ADF with the capacity to carry out its role in the defence of Australia. The low level of strength at the moment has left many key units and formations seriously depleted. Is it any wonder that we are seeing large amounts of money being appropriated at this time in addition to those which were already budgeted for?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government now faces a fundamental problem in dealing with the legacy left by the former Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley). I point out that I do not consider it to be his fault, as I think that he really fought hard in Cabinet for money to fund many of the projects which were dear to his heart, but he failed. He did achieve quite a lot, but not enough. The predicament of meeting the defence budget, particularly at a time of economic stringency and given the very large commitments to capital expenditure which have grown year by year since 1983, is indeed a cause for great concern. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing to gain by honourable members on the other side getting up and saying, `What did you do?' and, `What were your achievements when you were in power?'. We are talking about the situation that confronts us now and the needs that are occurring now. The mobility of armed forces throughout the world is quite different, and the needs are quite different in terms of the responses that need to be made. We need to look at these situations with regard to what we can do now. That is a very important point. We ought not to get bogged down in debates about who did what, who did not do what and so on. The finger can be pointed at both sides in terms of deficiencies in this regard. We need to really concentrate on the current situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fall in wastage rates, to which I referred earlier and which was an inevitable result of the current recession-one notices that when we get a downturn in the economy, the separation rate within the armed forces decreases as a natural result-the numbers leaving the forces remain comparatively high. Even with the euphoria generated by the Gulf commitment, speculation concerning further cuts has left morale very low, and I mean low. I do not want anybody to get up and say that morale is not low, because it is low. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past two weeks I have spoken with and been in the company of dozens of men from all the defence forces. For example, I attended the El Alamein Firepower Day; while I did not go around and solicit from people whether their morale was high or not-which I never do-it is not hard to pick up very quickly that morale is low. Even at Anzac Day services, at which many of the regular forces personnel were present, expressions about the decline of morale in the defence forces were made. This morale problem is real and we ought not deny it; we ought to be doing things to build morale up rather than just seemingly turning a blind eye to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Defence Association recently expressed its concern at reports in the media about proposals regarding substantial cuts to the regular defence forces.  The reports include: a cut overall of 10,000 regular personnel, or 14 per cent of the total force; the reduction of the Army's combat strength of two of its six infantry battalions; and the closure of bases such as the Richmond RAAF base and the Australian Air Command at Glenbrook. All these rumours are floating around and appearing in newspapers; usually such rumours are a very clear indication of the Government's intentions. I know the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) will make a statement on 6 June; it will be very interesting to hear what he has to say on that occasion. I hope the plans will not take into account the serious cuts in expenditure, such as the closing of the important base at Richmond and the efficient administrative centre at Glenbrook. </PARA>
<PARA> The Association accepts, and indeed has highlighted for some years, that there is a substantial degree of manpower misuse in the ADF. No-one is denying that; there will have to be a rationalisation. However, at the same time key units are seriously under strength. Proposals to cut regular defence manpower by a raw figure of 10,000 do not make much sense at all. At the same time the combat elements of the force, especially the Army, are already 18 per cent below authorised strength according to a reply to a question on notice by the Minister for Defence in March this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's commitment to the Middle East war, while admirable in rhetorical terms, was approximately one-tenth of what a country of Australia's population and wealth might have been expected to contribute. While it was essentially symbolic, and will attract equally symbolic rewards, the fact remains that the basic level of manning and training left the Government with almost no option but to limit the commitment to two warships and a supply ship. It may have been possible to contribute some combat aircraft, but no credible ground forces could have been provided in less than six months. That is almost hard to believe. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context it is worth pointing out that a fundamental measure of defence capability is sustainability. In manpower and equipment terms this means that a defence force must provide an inventory of equipment and personnel roughly three times larger than it needs to maintain in combat. This allows for replacements, resting and repair. We do not enjoy that situation in this country. I would like to quote from a speech made by the United States Ambassador, Mel Sembler, at the National Press Club in Canberra in April 1991:</PARA>
<PARA>I think that the Gulf War has taught us several important lessons-and two of them definitely relate to security in the Pacific. The first lesson tells all our friends and allies in the region that we keep our commitments. </PARA>
<PARA>We must say `thank you' to the United States for that. The speech continues:</PARA>
<PARA>We can be counted on. The second shows that concerned nations can stay together in a common cause to support the rule of law against an outlaw like Saddam Hussein. This gives credence to our emerging Pacific security concept of ``co-operative vigilance.''</PARA>
<PARA> Under this concept we see a growing partnership where all parties provide adequate contributions to common defence needs and show a credible degree of self-sufficiency. It is a call for greater intra-regional responsibility sharing. </PARA>
<PARA>There are very serious doubts about our degree of self-sufficiency and our ability to defend this country in a time of crisis. Only a little over a month ago the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Funnell, stated that the Air Force was losing its technological edge and that we did not know what was going on in the vital air-sea gap to the north. The Gulf war has confirmed warnings made last year by Australia's chief defence men that the ending of the Cold War could lead to instability and uncertainty in our region. The Cold War strategy of superpower patronage had restrained many would-be troublemakers like Saddam Hussein. They warned the Government in a direct and indirect way that this situation had to be dealt with in a very strong way in terms of a greater commitment by the Government to our defence forces generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I mention that on El Alamein Day last week I had the great honour and privilege of being only one of two members of parliament, despite the fact that 40 were invited, to attend that firepower day. Again, this is cause for a great deal of demoralisation in the forces. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91, I want to address the level of foreign investment in Australia. It is a topic which is raised with me from time to time by many branch members of the Australian Labor Party. Many of them have fears about the level of foreign investment in Australia and those fears often become more particular: they worry about the level of Japanese investment in Australia. I will cite some figures which indicate the level of foreign ownership, control and investment in Australia and also try to delve into the whole question of Australian sovereignty and capital accumulation. The figures I will cite are from the Foreign Investment Review Board report of 1989-90 which was tabled only in the last couple of days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a great deal of irrational fear about the level of foreign investment in Australia, but there is also a rational argument about the degree of control which Australians do or do not have over their own industry. It seems to me that there are a couple of questions to be focused on. There is the question of whether Australia has a sufficiently wide spread of trading partners. For instance, do we trade too heavily with a single entity such as Japan? Should we not attempt to spread that trade more widely?</PARA>
<PARA> I noted in the speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the Japan Chamber of Commerce in Tokyo on 20 September 1990 that he said that the two-way exchange of goods between Australia and Japan last year was worth $23 billion. He also illustrated the nature of the exchange-that Australia had been a supplier of essential commodities, mainly coal, iron ore, aluminium and liquefied natural gas, and that increasingly we are becoming a provider of quality foodstuffs. In exchange for this, the Japanese, characteristically of course, as manufacturers, have supplied a diversity of sophisticated goods, mainly motor vehicles, manufacturing and telecommunications equipment, electrical goods and computers. </PARA>
<PARA> So there is that question of whether our trade is too narrowly based and therefore we become dependent upon another nation because of the narrowness of the trade. The other question concerns that often more spectacular form of foreign investment-the degree of ownership by foreigners of Australian companies. I must admit that, particularly in Queensland and in some sensitive regional areas such as the Gold Coast and Cairns, there has been a degree of hysteria about the degree of foreign ownership, particularly Japanese ownership on the Gold Coast and in the Cairns region. </PARA>
<PARA> Some governments from time to time have chosen to use that anti-foreign investment, anti-Japanese investment card; and they do so to their own detriment, in my view. In improving the living standards of Australians, the name of the game is capital accumulation. If Australians cannot accumulate sufficient capital of their own, they must seek to borrow that capital from others or they must seek investors who will buy part of our industry to help us develop that industry. The only alternative is to choke off investment and development. At the end of the day, having sought Australian investment in any number of industries, if investment is not there, if we have not accumulated sufficient capital of our own, we must seek that capital from others who have, for whatever reason, been able to accumulate it. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say to those of the far left of the political spectrum that there is a Marxist definition of capital as `dead labour'. In other words, capital is nothing more than the fruits of the generations of workers' labour that has gone on beforehand. It is not easily accumulated and it has to be marshalled very well and very intelligently if it is to be built upon. Some of my branch members and any number of Queenslanders have to take this broader view that Australians do have choices, but that some of those choices are not easy ones. If we do not have sufficient Australian capital by which to develop our own industries, then we ought to seek foreign investment. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that there are clear figures in the Foreign Investment Review Board's report that indicate that, on the one hand, the spread of investment in Australia has not narrowed in the last number of years and, on the other hand, the degree of foreign ownership in various industries has not increased. I want to cite those figures. </PARA>
<PARA> The report shows the level of foreign investment in Australia by country from 1984-85 to 1988-89 in billion dollars. The second largest investor in 1984-85 was the United Kingdom at $26 billion; in 1988-89 the UK was the largest investor at $47 billion. Next ranked in 1988-89 was the United States (US); it invested nearly $47 billion. In 1984-85, it was the largest investor in Australia, at nearly $27 billion. Third ranked is Japan, which in 1984-85 invested $16 billion and in 1988-89 invested $33 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The rankings of our sources of foreign capital-that is, the UK, US and Japan-have remained reasonably stable over that period of five years from 1984 to 1989. Our key supplying nations for capital are still the UK and the US, and they are likely to remain so for some time. The level of Japanese investment certainly has picked up, but, as I say, I do not find any reason to worry about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go to a further set of statistics on foreign ownership and control in Australia. These are at table 3.6 in the Foreign Investment Review Board report of 1989-90. Foreign ownership is cited by industry sector, by per cent, for selected years. For instance, in 1972-73 the total foreign ownership in mining was 49.5 per cent, with, by definition, Australian ownership of 50.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in the level of investment in mining during that time was phenomenal, and the degree of Australian ownership in mining increased. In 1984-85 the Australian ownership percentage was 55.3, while total foreign ownership was 44.7. In that decade and a half of growth in one of our key sectors-that is, the mining industry-Australian ownership lifted from 50.5 per cent to 55.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In mineral processing the situation was somewhat reversed. In 1972-73 the total foreign ownership level was 39.7 per cent and Australian ownership 60.3 per cent, but by 1981-82 the degree of foreign ownership was 46.3 per cent and Australian ownership was 53.7 per cent. So in that sense of comparing Australian ownership with foreign ownership we have slipped. To give a further illustration, in 1972-73 the total level of foreign ownership in manufacturing was 31.2 per cent and Australian ownership was 68.8 per cent, and by 1986-87 total foreign ownership was 30.9 per cent and Australian ownership was 69.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> These figures tend to indicate that there has been a stability in the proportions of Australian and foreign ownership, at least in those three key sectors. There are a whole series of other sectors in the statistics which generally indicate the same sorts of movements-either some improvement in the proportion of Australian ownership or a stability in the level of Australian ownership in Australian industry. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr JOHNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have those figures in this report. If the honourable member would like to bring them to the chamber and quote them, he might do so. I guess the statistics illustrate some of the fears that honourable members opposite as well as some of the members in Australian Labor Party branches have about foreign ownership per se. What is the problem? If we cannot accumulate the capital, and we want to continue to develop Australian industry, we will need foreign ownership. The only question is: under what circumstances do we use it? Do we allow foreigners to take up ownership-equity-of our Australian industry, or do we simply continue to borrow the money? We did go through a binge, a phase of borrowing, and now we are in a situation in which much of the private sector is beholden to foreign capital inasmuch as we have to repay a lot of those loans. We do not at this stage have the productive capacity to repay easily. I am sure that as we come out of the recession we will have that capacity. We should not confuse a short term recession with this broader question that I am illustrating of the level of foreign ownership in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tourism has been a particularly sore point amongst Queenslanders. In the Gold Coast and Cairns areas in particular we can see the degree, level and importance of Japanese ownership. It seems to me that at times the Queensland Government has prodded along to some degree that fear of Japanese ownership and investment. There is a joint study now by the Queensland Government and the Commonwealth Government into the question of foreign ownership in tourism.</PARA>
<PARA> Already we have some figures that suggest that amongst the five-star accommodation sector of the tourist industry there is about 49 per cent foreign ownership. If we measure the total amount of accommodation available in the tourist industry, we find that the level of foreign ownership is running at less than 20 per cent. The most spectacular and obvious level of the market is 49 per cent foreign owned, but the entire Australian tourist industry, so far as we can measure it in terms of beds available, is only 20 per cent owned by foreigners. Again, we should put the figures in perspective.</PARA>
<PARA> I know that from time to time the Queensland Government has reacted to the sensitivities of Queenslanders, especially about Japanese investment, but the Queensland Government needs to remember that it cannot want and ask for foreign investment-especially Japanese investment-and, at the same time, play on the worst prejudices of some Queenslanders. It can play the game straight and say, `We need that investment', and perhaps monitor where the investments are made; but it cannot play a dual game and say, `Well, we're not too keen on Japanese investment' when on the Gold Coast and then, in front of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, open the doors and say, `We love you, we want your money'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is that sort of doublespeak which worries me considerably, because the Commonwealth Government has never played that double game. We have consistently argued the case for the need for foreign investment, and consistently sought to defend that case even in the worst circumstances amongst the most prejudiced of Australians, and we will continue to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that there was an opportunity, certainly in Queensland on the Gold Coast, where not only Japan but also any number of other nations were interested in the concept of the multifunction polis (MFP) which was, in a sense, to be a science city. It was clear from the Australian studies of the multifunction polis that the Gold Coast would be the key and prime location. I must say that I was very disappointed indeed that the Queensland Government, for whatever public reasons it gave, did not wish the MFP to go ahead on the Gold Coast. It did not wish it to go ahead on the Gold Coast for the very basic reason that it was scared of the anti-Japanese reaction. It seems to me that we do not play politics like that in Australia in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Queenslanders were sick to death of being treated as children under the Bjelke-Petersen regime. The new Labor Government in Queensland is bound to treat Queenslanders as intelligent adults, and it should never play to those base prejudices of some people who reside on the Gold Coast who would prefer the wealth that comes with foreign investment, but who do not want that foreign capital to come from a particular source. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that I have wrongly interpreted what occurred over the decision on the MFP. I have investigated it fairly carefully and it seems to me that a very fresh, young and perhaps immature State Government was, if you like, forced to make a decision that it might not necessarily make a couple of years down the track when it feels more relaxed, more settled, more in control and more able to sell the tough proposition. The tough proposition is that, if other Australians have undertaken a study which suggests that a multifunction polis should be located on the Gold Coast, then we actually go ahead and support that proposition despite some very loud objections from a very base section of the Australian electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I say to my branch members and other supporters of the Australian Labor Party that I am very pleased that a number of the questions they asked me about foreign investments are now couched in far saner terms than they once were 10 and perhaps 15 years ago; that Australians now realise that, as part of our integration with the international community, we will draw in a great deal of foreign capital; and that the only question is how quickly and how well we can repay our debts when we borrow, and how quickly and how well we can learn from our partners who might invest with us. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Prime Minister has now said a number of times to the Japanese that we do now wish to spread the nature of Japanese investment particularly throughout Australian industry. We realise that much of their investment is centred in real estate and tourism. I can understand that. But for me that is a means of opening their eyes to Australian industry. It does not mean that that is all they want to do in Australia. But the Japanese are learning about Australian industry, and it is our job to teach them a little more about how well Australian industry operates and how they may assist us. </PARA>
<PARA> I again refer to a section from the Prime Minister's speech of September 1990 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is time for you-</PARA>
<PARA>the Japanese-</PARA>
<PARA>to be more creative in your approach to investment in Australia and to joint ventures with us. Together we could become productive partners in increasing the value-added component of Australian exports and expanding our export-oriented manufactures and services. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the Prime Minister is right. We do want more from our relationship with the Japanese and other foreign investments, but we do not want to turn off the tap. We should never give in to those people who, based on prejudice, would seek to ruin Australian industry because they do not happen to like the source of our foreign investment and they do not happen to like what they perceive to be a loss of control by Australians over our industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some parts of the speech just made by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) interested me. There is no doubt that we do need to get more from our foreign relations. One thing I will say, though, is that this Government has been very lax in trying to seek reciprocity in access. When one looks at difficulties with countries like Japan, one needs to remember that we seem to approach most of our foreign relations in more of a subservient role than I believe is appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think a great deal could be done, for example, to secure access for our manufactured exports into the Japanese market, to secure the same rights of selling and owning property and operating in that market as they enjoy here. It is no use accepting the Japanese response unless of course there is that access. The reality is that there are all sorts of hedges and restraints, as all of us know. The first thing we have to do in looking at our relations with Japan-and in general terms I agree with the honourable member-is that we need to be far more aggressive in our approach. </PARA>
<PARA> One of my concerns on the wider subject which I wish to address is that there seems to be among some people the view that the world owes us a living. I think the world is becoming an extraordinarily difficult marketplace, wherever one looks. There is no doubt that the downturn in the economy, the recession that we are suffering here, is not unique. We do need to remember that an analysis of the economic pattern in Australia, as distinct from the circumstances in 1981, 1982 and 1983 about which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and others seek to berate us so often, shows that in this instance we have led the world into the recession. It is not the product of our following, it is not a product of our being able to maintain proper economic approaches towards management; it has been a matter of the world in this instance actually going into recession after Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer trying to talk up the economy. We should remember that we cannot talk up the economy if the international environment in which we operate is on the downturn. It is this attitude to so many subjects which concerns me. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I address the core of my concern this morning, I wish to commend the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster). Sadly we have very few debates on defence issues in this place. I am most concerned at what I see as the result of the force structure review which is to be announced by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) in the other place early next month. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three aspects of it. Firstly, the geopolitical situation, not just on an economic basis but on a political basis, is changing. The world in which we live is far more fragile than it has been, in my view, almost since the end of confrontation. I think that is probably the most appropriate time to refer to, although the problems in Vietnam, and of course Korea, were after the Malaysian confrontation period. We need to understand what is happening in Bougainville. The Honiara accord seems to be at an end. We have enormous problems with predicting the outcome of events in the Pacific countries. We certainly have residual difficulties in knowing where the Philippines is heading. </PARA>
<PARA> All this is happening at a time when the Americans, as a result of the changed world geopolitical situation, are saying that they can reduce their military strength. Indeed, I thought it quite ridiculous for the Prime Minister to take the initiative he did on the North West Cape. There is no doubt that that facility is of tremendous use to Australia, but it has been a backup facility to the Americans. For the Prime Minister to say that we are automatically going to take it over puts a defence expense on the Australian Government at a time when those funds need to be looked at within the allocation of funds here. </PARA>
<PARA> The geopolitical situation is changing. There has been no real reappraisal of the White Paper produced by the Government in 1987, and that 1987 White Paper has never been funded by this Government-either by the previous Minister for Defence or by the present Minister for Defence. The Government, for all that it pretends to have developed self-sufficiency of our Defence Force, knows that that is not so. We are not self-sufficient; we are less self-sufficient. Anyone looking at our commitment in the Gulf would realise that to be true; indeed, the very nature of our commitment was that we could only operate as part of an American force. For us to believe that we are now more self-sufficient is wrong, and yet that is the direction that all of us accept we should take. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have to look at funding and the application of funds. I am not too sure whether a great deal more could be done in revamping the management structures within the Australian Defence Force. The Government has done nothing about that. If it is going to look at the Australian Defence Force structure review, it ought to be looking at management and not just pruning bases and cutting back funding of projects such as our F111s, one of the projects that I am told may be at risk. If that were so, it would be dangerous in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the Government does, now that it has committed itself to major construction programs in Australia on the submarines and on the frigates, for all that I have reservation about the original commitments, there must be no reduction in the funding for those programs or it will do irreparable damage to Australia. I commend the honourable member for Macquarie and share many of his concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> The main subject of my concern this morning and the reason for my wishing to speak is that I am very worried about the state of Australia. I think that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the shadow Minister for industrial relations, employment and training, has been registering most effectively an alternate industrial relations policy to be pursued. We need to understand that the elements that produce wealth in Australia are extraordinarily under threat. </PARA>
<PARA> I opened by referring to my worry about the economic markets in which we sell. I am equally concerned about the climate of production, the costs of production and the way in which the Government seems to ignore the penalties which, in particular I think, flow through the constraints of our industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter because my main worry is that the Government is seeking more than ever to pursue the compromises, the so-called consensus approach, which are representative of the accord-not with the community, not with concern about the costs of production or passing on benefits where there is an improvement of productivity across the board, but by simply addressing how to share the spoils between the employers and the employees and allowing for some rise in wage levels to accommodate the accord relationship between the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all, one element that must be addressed is the facilitation of voluntary unionism. There is no doubt that at the moment the closed shop environment which is listed in so many theatres is impossible. It is not a basis from which we are going to be able to secure a real competitive environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, let me stress that the world does not owe us a living. The nations that surround us geographically are processing and proceeding in developing their secondary industry at a far greater rate than we are. Their transport systems are more efficient. Day by day we see comparisons in the waterfront handling capacity of Singapore and other Asian ports to those in Australia. We are not going to succeed in reaching their level of productivity by the present compromise negotiated by the Prime Minister in his all night session the other night. Frankly, the result of that was not to achieve the productivity improvements we need on the waterfront, but merely to satisfy some of the differing elements within the Labor movement, within the Australian Labor Party, within the trade union movement, and with a single group of monopoly waterfront employers. </PARA>
<PARA> People need to remember that if we are going to look at the waterfront we should be looking at not just improving the conditions of productivity by the employees. As far as I am concerned many of those in the stevedoring industry too need to have their productivity significantly improved and their management improved apart from anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> I see no reason why there should not be a greater percentage of handling of individual goods imported and exported by those who are in fact the shippers of those goods. I think the exporters and importers tend to be the element largely neglected in the compromise agreement reached on the waterfront. My concern in the wider economic scene is that the world market is deteriorating, the world economy is in recession, and Australia is changing its ball game far too slowly to compete. </PARA>
<PARA> My particular worry is that, in the rural sector of Australia at a time when we are not addressing the infrastructure reforms that we should, we are finding that there is an increasing drought bearing down on much of our productive industry. Before coming to the drought-and I have spoken briefly about industrial relations and macroeconomic reform-let me say that, in my view, the Government has gone entirely the wrong way in trying to secure the competitive advantage we need. At the moment we have not done anywhere near enough to contain Federal Government spending and Federal Government programs. We have not pursued privatisation, even in the legislation introduced in the House yesterday by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley). We are not looking at trying to establish the most effective marketplace;  we are trying to reach compromises to satisfy existing vested interests. </PARA>
<PARA> We have an enormous number of vested interests in Australia-in the employee field, in the management field and in the education field. My colleague the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who is the shadow Minister sitting at the table, knows that there are enormous problems, not in trying to throw aside those vested interests but in trying to determine the most efficient way by which we can establish a more equal playing field for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> What I believe we have done in macro-economic reform is really just pursue a far too narrow vision of how we can pursue greater fiscal restraint and improve managerial operations. We have got to address that. But with increasing corporate failures, with the difficulties of the entrepreneurs, and with the general disgrace, which applies not just to those who are presently before royal commissions and the courts but flows right across the board, I am afraid that Australia's industry and its reputation are down the gurgler. In the international perspective we are in the worst position that I can recall, simply because in past days we have had a large number of Australians whose reputations have been high. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening in Australia at the moment is that we have besmirched our reputation, we have besmirched our credibility; and the Government does not seem to understand that all this flows through. When it does, we have to be even more dramatic and more significant in the changes made in economic and government policy and in the overall programs that are pursued-and we are not doing that. We are not responding to the national disgrace that the Brian Burkes are bringing on us at the moment. That is not to say that Brian Burke is necessarily guilty of all the matters that have been alleged, but certainly there is little doubt that the Government's attitude towards Brian Burke as Ambassador for Australia to Ireland and the Holy See is reflected in its approach on so many other issues. Sadly, it is not just in politics; it is in business and it is in corporate affairs, and all that is reflected in the failure of small business and in the failure of the rural sector, which I want to address for a few moments. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that all these things are happening before we come to the drought. This morning's Australian Financial Review says that the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has already assessed the consequence of the increasingly dry conditions around Australia. I notice that the Bureau has produced some preliminary assessments. I can assure the readers of this morning's media that it is not just a 25 per cent reduction in wheat production that is being faced: already 60 per cent of New South Wales is drought declared. Within the southern winter rainfall zone there is increasing concern about the present lateness of autumn rain. In spite of the fact that there was so much rain in about half of Queensland through the summer months, about half of Queensland is moving into drought conditions. It is true that, if we get rain within six weeks, perhaps general circumstances could change. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I wanted to refer to the drought because it, like the aspects of micro- and macro-economic operations and like the geopolitical situation we are facing, needs to be viewed against what is happening in particular industries and against the climate which, I see, is not being redressed by present Government policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Government was elected there have been a number of fundamental changes which are not being taken into account, when you look at just how profitability in individual sectors-certainly in the rural area-operates. Let me just refer to a few. There is the higher cost of meat inspection charges: it is now 100 per cent. That is a direct cost in killing that goes back to the producers. The abolition of superphosphate subsidies, something that is not in contention on this side of the House, is a cost as far as the producers are concerned. Reduction in wool promotion, the changes in the tax treatment of livestock, natural increases in valuations, the failure to maintain real expenditure on roads, the difficulties there have been in fundamental changes to depreciation allowances-and we all know the cry so many in business put in for changes to investment allowances-the increases in levies and charges, the changes in the incidence of sales tax, and the cost of indirect taxes-all these things bear down on so many of the productive industries. We have the increase in fuel excise and we have the reductions in assistance for those in the education sector, including means testing, cuts in isolated children's programs, and cuts in the assistance provided to university and educational residential systems. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the problems in the sugar industry, debated in this House the other week. We have the fundamental cuts to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. When all these are put together, they start to represent a change in the environment within which business is operating. I am particularly speaking at the moment, of course, of the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not saying that any of those need necessarily have been wrong in isolation, but I am saying that what is happening is that the world environment is changing and the marketplace itself is getting harder, but the Government is not pursuing the correct macro- and micro-economic programs, which is adding to the costs of each of our productive industries in a way that makes life very difficult for them. </PARA>
<PARA> People need to understand that there are elements in this that have far more profound implications than perhaps the Government itself has realised. One of the difficulties is Australian asset prices-the degree to which, because of the way in which our markets and industries have operated, the structure of our financial system has been predicated on values given, assets held, and equity in residential property, commercial property and, of course, on government paper. All those elements reflect some sort of security. In national terms we talk about our security being in the overseas reserves we hold. We know how our overseas debt has risen, but it is not just a matter of looking at that. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty with the present climate in Australia is that the value of all those assets is declining. Part of the problem that I see in the present trend in government management is that nobody has addressed the difficulty of what is going to happen when the residential property, the commercial property, the rural property and the equity are all trending down, so that the assets which back the financial advances to business are no longer there. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the rural sector, I was talking to the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) earlier this week. I do not think there is a more difficult productive area in Australia than the western plains of New South Wales. We heard the other day, in his speech on a matter of public importance, extraordinarily distressing letters about families who were withdrawing their children from school because they cannot afford to give them an education. We are hearing of banks having to foreclose properties. </PARA>
<PARA> I was horrified the other day-I had better not identify the school-when the principal of a school said to me how distressed he had been that morning to hear that the head boy at his school had just received a call from his parents saying that the banks had foreclosed on their property and the family was forced to walk out with nothing. That is not an unusual event, but it is a real event-it is happening. As far as I am concerned, it is happening because progressively the worldwide environment within which we are operating is not one within which we are going to find it easy to compete. Our own marketplace is losing its competitive edge and it is losing its asset edge, and that double whammy is creating an impossible circumstance for those who are trying to generate the wealth upon which this country's living standards depend. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning from that, let me spend two minutes on the recovery plan that the Minister called for the wool industry. I commend Sir William Vines and his colleagues for the recommendations they have produced. But everything the Government has done, both in its reaction to the Vines Committee and even in its earlier supplementary payments scheme, has failed to address the fundamental problems of the declining value of the assets from which people are going to fund their operations, the difficult world environment in which we operate, and our failure to achieve a truly competitive edge. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is not just the trade union movement. I have suggested that we have to address our macro-economic and micro-economic programs urgently and dramatically; I have suggested that we have to address the challenge of voluntary trade unionism; and I have suggested that the policies that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has enunciated must be pursued. But the Government has to realise, with some sensitivity, that it is responsible for the disabilities that arise from what it does. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, why the devil could the supplementary payments scheme to which I referred not have been implemented simply by reducing the present levy paid by woolgrowers? That would have got rid of all that administrative burden. If the Government is going to provide $300m, it could have done that by reducing the levy on wools to be sold between now and 30 June. That would have got money straight through to the woolgrowers and got rid of the administrative costs. It would have achieved the same result. </PARA>
<PARA> The same thing is happening with the recovery plan for the wool industry. We have a whole lot of nuances in this recovery plan which are going to lead to more bureaucratic intervention and less efficiency. We have to understand that the climate within Australia at the moment is critical; the drought is accentuating that situation. As I mentioned, at the beginning of the 1980s Australia lagged behind the world going into depression, but now Australia is leading it. I am afraid that the Government's programs in approaching these questions are totally wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91, Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1990-91, and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1990-91 provide for additional estimates for a wide range of activities not previously budgeted for. They include $32.2m as a contribution to the cost of deployment of Australian naval vessels and personnel to the Persian Gulf task force. As honourable members would be aware, this contribution is only a portion of the total cost of our involvement in that conflict and in its repercussions in terms of reconstruction of property and the restoration and establishment of human rights for the peoples of the region. I have heard estimates of $100,000m, but have no way of ascertaining their accuracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The human and environmental damage arising from the war will undoubtedly cost us all dearly, irrespective of the monetary value of that cost. For instance, the tragedy of the Kurdish refugees as a by-product of the Gulf conflict cannot be ignored, and I am sure is not ignored, by this House. Their plight, both within and without Iraq, is impossible to ignore. The assistance of the international community is essential to help resolve their difficulties. However, it can be claimed that their difficulties have been exacerbated by the conflict. Whilst their situation was not at all satisfactory before the war, thousands of Kurds were killed during the bombing and many more died in Iraq as a consequence of the attempts to overthrow Saddam Hussein after his defeat in Kuwait. Even more died while fleeing to Iran or Turkey. Mention has been made in this place of the difficulties encountered by them in the mountains-the cold and hunger, and the sickness. I know that most Australians' hearts would have been torn by the sight of these people on television. </PARA>
<PARA> The plight of the Kurds is a tragedy of immense proportions which will not easily or quickly be resolved. In the meantime, continuation of aid is imperative, and I support absolutely the Government's commitment in this regard. These appropriation Bills provide for the financial support of $1m specifically for the Kurds and $5m for humanitarian aid in total. The announcement in recent days of the dispatch of more Australian Defence Force personnel to assist with medical, dental and water purification needs of Kurdish refugees from the war and postwar retaliations is an indication of the continuing nature of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not to say that Australia should ignore calls for such aid or that the Government should be miserly in its response. I think the Government has responded ably and adequately to this need and will continue to do so as other needs arise. Our involvement in the conflict demands our continuing contribution to the resettlement and reconstruction which will follow. I simply make the point that the costs of war are many and varied, and any realistic assessment of them cannot be confined to the money amounts associated with the commitment of personnel, equipment, provisions and arms. The cost in human terms is overwhelming, even in a short war, as the Gulf war has been termed. Mercifully, it was one in which no Australian lives were lost. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also appropriate in the context of this debate to mention the relative merits of deficit budgeting and surplus budgeting by government as a means of influencing macroeconomic outcomes. In recent years in this country and elsewhere in the world there has been a great deal of emphasis on the importance of obtaining and maintaining a surplus in order to assist-particularly in our case-current account imbalances. The floating of the dollar exposed the Australian economy to greater scrutiny at an international level and, as a consequence, what we do in Australia affects our currency level which in turn affects our ability to export products and to reduce our current account. </PARA>
<PARA> A recession demands some adjustment to the surplus Budget policy, as government has an important role to play in kick-starting the economy again at a time when business is reluctant, if not afraid, to commit its resources to the types of expansion which are essential to achieve recovery in the shorter term rather than the longer term. The importance of getting the economy going quickly rather than slowly is obviously needed in human as well as capital terms. People who lose jobs are unable to get jobs again for quite a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> The psychology of the community is absolutely crucial to this process of recovery. People require positive action on the part of government to encourage them to take advantage of those opportunities which present themselves. I think in the context of business this is important because it is not as if there are no opportunities available. With interest rates dropping and with businesses becoming available, some people are in the fortunate position of having capital to expend, but quite obviously and understandably they are reluctant to do so in the absence of other fairly firm action on the part of government. That shows the importance of the March industry statement, because it has helped people to understand the Government's thrust in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> As the first sector of the economy to be affected by the recession, the housing and building industries are also the first to feel the effects of the recovery. Accordingly, public expenditure in the housing sector is an important element of the Government's approach to stimulation of the economy through assistance to industry on a broad front. At the meeting of housing and planning Ministers some weeks ago, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) offered to bring forward Commonwealth-State housing agreement funds for the next financial year. Not surprisingly under the circumstances, the States accepted this offer by the Federal Government, and a total of $842m will be made available to them in two parcels, one from 1 July and the second from 1 October, to allow building of housing to commence considerably earlier than would otherwise have been the case. I think this sort of flexibility on the part of the Commonwealth is crucial to the recovery of the State economies and the economy of Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> With housing it is essential to remember also that the benefits are not just an improvement in our employment prospects or an improvement in our economic prospects; they include also the provision of an important infrastructure resource in the form of houses for Australians. The housing that we are talking about is housing for low income earners, those who are most in need in our society at all times, especially in a recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Employment stimulation across the industrial spectrum should take place in the months ahead. The industry statement contained a number of valuable measures which were designed to halt the loss of employment and to ensure the retention of apprentices during the course of the downturn. I make mention here, as I have elsewhere, and as many other honourable members have done, of the step to assist employers to retain people in jobs when their firm has been affected by the downturn. That will be by way of the payment of unemployment benefits so that people can be retained in jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very important, I thank the honourable member for Throsby. I think it is crucial because people in those circumstances who have lost their jobs are often unskilled and they would have to undergo quite intensive training in order to regain a job. Through this scheme they are able to obtain that training on the job, whilst staying in a job where they know the people and, hopefully, where the employer understands their capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe job creation schemes and community employment projects have an important role to play. These sorts of schemes have come into some question in recent times because of the upsurge in the economy when there was no obvious need for them to continue. I think that where these can be conducted in conjunction with approved training schemes, local government or other forums in the economy, they should be encouraged so that skilling and reskilling of the unemployed can go hand in hand with the experience and esteem of having a job. Of course, if we can associate such employment with training, we are actually ensuring that when the economy does pick up people will be in a position to use their skills to fill the needs in the economy for those skills. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Labor Government was in office in New Zealand I led a delegation to that country, along with some of my colleagues in this House and from the other place. It was quite obvious that, although the New Zealand Government was making a lot of decisions to do with rationalising and deregulating its economy, it did not appear that these measures were being taken in conjunction with positive employment programs. </PARA>
<PARA> That, together with the low infrastructure or manufacturing base of New Zealand, had a large impact on the number of people who became jobless as a consequence of the changes occurring in their economy. This was at a time when the economy of New Zealand was considerably more robust than it is at present. The demonstrations which are occurring in New Zealand at the moment have a number of underlying causes which include social welfare cuts, the extreme controversy concerning industrial relations and, of course, joblessness. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of industrial relations controversy, I was interested in the views expressed by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) about voluntary unionism. We cannot simply say that we should have voluntary unionism in Australia and expect that to mean that everything in the garden will be rosy-that all employers will be happy and that all employees will choose not to be members of unions. Union membership in Australia is largely voluntary. The Opposition continually raises the percentages in this area and says that the majority of people are not members of unions. That being the case, it is very difficult to sustain an argument which says that we have compulsory unionism in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Unions in Australia have achieved considerable gains for their members over time. These gains have been distributed to the wider work force via the central mechanism of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Let us make no mistake: abolition of the centralised wage determination system will not advantage the powerful unions or their members-they do not need that system to achieve their wage rises. Discussion of enterprise bargaining should always be seen in the context that those in a powerful position in the economy whose skills are required will always be able to make demands on employers and have those demands met because the economy, at whatever rate it is working, will need their skills. They are masters in determining their capacity to bargain on those skills-that is their job, after all. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who would be most detrimentally affected by a change in the arbitration system would be those who are not members of unions or who are not members of strong or militant unions-that is, ordinary working Australians. Another group which would be detrimentally affected by a substantial change in this area would be small business. Small business people do not have the capacity to withstand union claims, or even employee claims if those claims were to be based on the withdrawal of labour. </PARA>
<PARA> If the arbitration system is abolished, increases will not flow on to ordinary people. As a consequence, those ordinary workers who may not be members of unions now will seek union membership because the unions will be needed in order to give them protection in the workplace. It is a simple scenario which I think people overlook-especially in the Australian context where the centralised wage system has, in fact, given people a great deal of protection, ensured a flow-on of wage increases and reduced the amount of militancy in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that small business will also suffer because there will be no certainty in wage outcomes. That is one of the things that the Commission and the accord, through the Government and union negotiations, have ensured for Australian business-particularly for those smaller businesses which are not in a position to pay more than the award wage and which do not have the capacity to become involved in independent discussions or enterprise bargaining. They simply rely on knowing that there will be a regular wage required and that there will be fairly regular increases to that wage as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA> The lack of certainty in wage outcomes would affect those people probably more than it would affect the larger companies, which can pass on their costs more easily to the public or remove their costs from profit for which small business does not always have a great margin. When I say `small business', of course, I mean those businesses which are operating at the margin, of which there are a large number in Australia and they employ a great many people. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst being a strong supporter of unions, I think that greater militancy in the work force would flow from a radical change in the present industrial relations and arbitration arrangements. Confrontation would affect small business in another way, also, in that there would be a reduction in the cooperation which is very much needed in order to run a small business-that is, the cooperation between the employer and employees. Employees would see themselves as having to fight their employer in order to get gains in wages, or see themselves as being disillusioned or disadvantaged if the employer refused what they considered to be a reasonable request for an increase in wages. </PARA>
<PARA> To a large degree this would ruin the camaraderie which does exist between employers and employees in many small workplaces where, in fact, there is very little distinction in a managerial sense, and the manager often gets his hands dirty-it is not unlike the farms, really. Those things have to be looked at. I think that farms would also be affected in that way because the workers would feel that they had been disadvantaged by the existing system. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of small business, I also wish to mention the fact that the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) visited Perth recently and was the guest-not at my invitation, but at the invitation of the Morley and Districts Business Association-at a breakfast in Bayswater. Of course, breakfast is about the only meal of the day for which small business people can actually get away in order to talk about policy and other issues. The Minister was very well received and it was obvious from the discussion at that breakfast that the Beddall report Small Business in Australia-Challenges, Problems and Opportunities, which was brought down in this House in January 1990 by the Minister, was very well-received and had been well read by the participants at the breakfast. </PARA>
<PARA> The report had the support of these small business people in terms of its major thrust and also in terms of most of its recommendations. The support for the implementation of these recommendations was, therefore, very strong from small business people that I spoke to elsewhere and at that forum. The Minister was able to assure people that these recommendations are being implemented in a continuing fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> The links with schools and training establishments was another point which was raised at that meeting. Many of these small business people find that the employees they get from the schools need to have a little more specific training in order to make them most useful to small business. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not to say that young people leaving school are unable to take up the challenges provided in small business, but I think some of them will either be able to establish their own small businesses or will be able to make a more productive contribution to small business quickly if they receive some training at the school level. It is obvious from the discussions we had that some schools in the area have actually undertaken small business courses so that older students who may be contemplating a career in that area are able to skill themselves as much as possible before leaving school. That also means they will be able to come to grips with budgeting, accounts and those sorts of areas where they can be of value to an employer. With the current wage structure, it is important that young people leaving school have as many skills as possible in order to encourage their employment. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting that most students referred to in the discussions were from lower socio-economic backgrounds; their background was seen in a positive light by some people as these kids were actually very much aware of what had to be done and how one had to survive. They were those cluey kids who are able to cope in an employment situation. I thought that was very encouraging because in this place we often hear that many people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds-particularly children-lack skills that would enable them to get on in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> The links with schools are obviously helping the small business community and the students. I also think these students will not have to repeat the lessons they learned in the latter years of their schooling should they choose to go on to a training institution and follow through their own natural inclination perhaps to become small business people themselves. In discussion about our economy it is crucial to consider always the plight of unemployed people, and as a consequence my thoughts are never far from ways to assist them to obtain skills, and I think the Government is in the same mode. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been quite entertained by the contributions made by some Government members during the course of debate this morning. I cannot help but mention one or two things. I was quite astounded to hear the contribution made by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) and his spirited-and I use that word loosely-defence of the Government's foreign investment policy. I hope he is listening because he was wrong on just about every count. Contrary to what he suggested, Australians are concerned about the selling off of the family silver, the selling off of the farm, the selling off of all our best real estate and industries and so on. Why is that happening? The defence of that by the honourable member for Petrie was pathetic when we really look at why this selling off is happening. It is because of, and simply is another example of, the failure of this Government to take action to foster the kinds of foreign investments we need in this country. The fact that we have such appallingly low levels of savings in this country is also a direct product of the economic mismanagement this country has experienced over the past eight years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my view the position of the honourable member for Petrie on foreign investment is totally indefensible. It is even interesting that it should come from someone in the Australian Labor Party. He acknowledges that many honourable members on his side of the House would completely disagree with him; I would like to think there will be a number on our side. We do have choices in this matter: this is our country and Australia belongs to Australians. We are standing by while this Government, acting in desperation, is attempting to sell off this country. The Government has no right and no mandate to do that. I believe most Australians are concerned. Speaking specifically for my electorate, which I guess bears the brunt of this, people on the Gold Coast recognise the benefits it has for them, but the great majority of my constituents nevertheless have expressed concern to me about the direction foreign investment has taken under this Government. They are concerned about it and I am articulating that concern on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it clear to the honourable member for Petrie that most Australians-perhaps not him-are genuinely concerned about the direction foreign investment has taken under this Government. It is a laissez-faire policy, where everything goes-`Open the doors; we need everything we can get to try to balance the books'. Despite those policies the Government has still failed to balance the books and we now see an enormous net debt of $130 billion. That debt is almost totally beyond our capacity to repay within the foreseeable future. It could be 50 or 100 years before we pay back that debt, if ever we do so, and in the meantime we are saddled with an interest bill that will shortly become totally unmanageable. In fact, at the present rate we could find ourselves with a net foreign debt of some $200 billion by the year 2000. It is an enormous problem. </PARA>

<PARA> That contribution was another desperate attempt to salvage some credibility for a Government which is totally discredited in the eyes of the vast majority of the Australian people at this time. I notice that the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) is staying in the House for the time being, and I will refer to her contribution shortly. I cannot help but mention, because this is a wide-ranging debate-and I want to speak specifically to some matters raised in Appropriation Bill (No. 4), Appropriation Bill (No. 5) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2)-that it is unbelievable that the Government should even contemplate putting the Treasurer (Mr Keating) up as Prime Minister. That is an example of the absolute desperation which exists on the other side of the House. Here we have a Treasurer who has a 6 per cent popularity rating. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. If the 12 March statement to which the honourable member for Cowan alluded is an example of a kick, I would be amazed if it were anything other than a bit of a flick pass. It is State of Origin day, so perhaps the analogy is appropriate-it was a flick pass and did nothing to address the real problems actually facing Australia. In a way it was a sick joke, which has already failed. I note that the debate on the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has been taken off the daily program. We have not heard anything more about it; it has faded into oblivion. I suppose one could say that it has been consigned to the scrap heap of prime ministerial rhetoric.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of honourable members in this House have referred to the recent waterfront deal in this debate. It really was the coup de grace for the 12 March industry statement given by the Prime Minister. That statement was supposed to give direction and leadership to this country. I suppose in a way the waterfront deal is the icing on the cake. If ever we were to need evidence of the inability of this Prime Minister to provide the real leadership this country needs in devastating times, the 12 March statement was an example of inability to give leadership. The waterfront deal, which was done last week with the mates who feature predominantly in this place each day, is further, final and conclusive evidence of the Prime Minister's total inability to come to grips with the problems facing this country. The Prime Minister is unable to deliver leadership when this country is crying out desperately for that sort of leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> Having made those comments-as I say, somewhat motivated by having listened to contributions from Government members who, almost out of desperation, were attempting to salvage some credibility-let me turn to the Appropriation Bills that we are dealing with today. I take honourable members back for a moment to the Budget that was presented last year by the Treasurer. This was not the one that would bring home the bacon. It did not get that billing, but nevertheless it was to produce an $8 billion surplus. On Budget night and on a number of occasions subsequently, we heard what a terrific job the world's greatest Treasurer-I remind the House that that was a mantle that he inherited from the Treasurer of Mexico-was doing. He was to bring down this Budget with an $8 billion surplus. What do we find as we deal with these Appropriation Bills? On the Treasurer's own admission most of that surplus has dissipated to the point where we could very well see a deficit occur, simply because of the Government's mismanagement. I refer to the enormous addition to unemployment benefit costs and the companies that are failing every day around the country and are unable to pay tax. That is another indictment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The circumstances were different. If the honourable member for the Northern Territory wants to debate that issue, he can make a contribution. Is this not embarrassing for Government members? If I were sitting where they are, I would feel the same way. I understand how they feel. After the next election when they are sitting on the opposition side and we are sitting on the government side, we could take great delight in reminding them-although, in a sense, I hope we do not do what they have done-day after day of the ineptitude with which they have run the country since 1983. On almost every measure we find ineptitude or an inability to manage properly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Budget that was presented last year predicted an unemployment rate of 7.25 per cent. What is the figure across the country now? The unemployment rate is approaching 10 per cent. I do not believe that that figure tells even half the story. It may well be that in real terms the unemployment rate is actually very much higher than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Of real concern, of course, is the fact that we have within that unemployment pool an enormous number of young people. In my electorate, 25 per cent of people between the ages of 15 and 19 cannot get a job. That figure, of course, is based on an Australian Bureau of Statistics sampling. We are not allowed to have the Commonwealth Employment Service figures. The Treasurer will not release those figures because, I imagine, they would be a devastating indictment on this Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot get any data or information from the Commonwealth Employment Service for my electorate. I have been told it is not available; it is not to be released. Why is that so? I can only assume that the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures which show youth unemployment at 25 per cent are vastly understated. I challenge the Government to tell us today what the true unemployment figure in this country is. I suggest that it certainly will be higher than the approximate figure at the moment of 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Even those unemployment figures tell only half the story. We can think about the hardship that has been suffered by people whose businesses have gone broke, who have been forced onto unemployment benefits for the first time in their lives, who are having marital hardship and breakup because of the enormous stress that this Government has created for them. I remind the Government again that on the Treasurer's own admission this is the recession that we had to have, and it has created all of this hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it astonishing to hear the Treasurer almost boasting about inflation. He has found one measure on which to hang his hat, that is, a falling inflation rate. I put it to honourable members that in this recession, which is the worst recession we have had since the 1930s-and I suspect that in some respects it is worse than the recession at that time in terms of falling asset values and other measures; the whole asset base of this country will be completely decimated by the time we come out of this recession-we should not only be seeing, in these terms, falling inflation, but we could well expect to see deflation when things are as they are. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think the Treasurer can take any comfort whatsoever from lower inflation figures. In fact, I suggest that they are only a temporary aberration and that it will be very difficult to keep the lid on inflation once we manage to turn this economy around. That is a job which those on the other side will not have to do. The job will be left to us. We will have to pick up the pieces. We will turn things around. We will spend plenty of time in this place over the next couple of years talking about how we will do that. We have the policies, and we will have the policies in place to turn this country around and get Australia moving again. But anything is possible in the meantime. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills that we are debating-and I return to the topic that we are debating today-appropriate an additional $1 billion from Consolidated Revenue. I understand that this is expected to be partly offset by savings of $270m odd on expenditure authorised by the previous Appropriation Acts. I am interested in looking at Appropriation Bill (No. 4) which in part seeks an additional $28.7m for the Government's student financial assistance scheme, which is called Austudy. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) in his second reading speech said that this additional funding was necessary because it reflected the increasing number of recipients in the latter half of 1990, together with an anticipated increase during the first half of 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Austudy is a scheme which costs the Government $1.1 billion per annum. We are being asked now to appropriate additional funds to this scheme yet, if ever we needed evidence of gross mismanagement and gross inefficiency, we have only to look at the Department of Employment, Education and Training-administered, I remind the House, by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). </PARA>
<PARA> I recently took part in a study that was carried out by the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, of which I am a member, into the effectiveness of Austudy, the Government's student financial assistance scheme. During our investigations we found that this scheme was being managed very badly. We were asked to consider an Auditor-General's report into Austudy which contained 124 recommendations covering most aspects of Austudy administration since the inception of the scheme in 1987. That was the starting point. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest concern that we had ultimately about the scheme, having interviewed a wide cross-section of the Australian community, was that there were no indicators as to the effectiveness of the program. The program effectively had no clear statement of objectives, and there had not been a proper assessment carried out of its effectiveness in any case. I suppose that if a program does not have objectives, it is pretty hard ultimately to judge whether the program has been effective. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we have over $1 billion of expenditure going into a program without any indication of whether it was being effective in meeting its objectives. The Committee, of course, recommended firstly that the Government should as a matter of urgency develop clear policy objectives for student financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the Minister's portfolio, not only do we find Austudy, but we find one Dawkins disaster after another. The poor administration of Austudy is only the tip of the iceberg. I could go on for hours, given the time. For example, there are the forced amalgamations that continue to damage diversity and opportunity in higher education and the Government's inability to meet the demand for tertiary places. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is too clever by half, in a way. He decided that the Government would encourage kids to stay at school and he stands up here and tells us about the great job the Government has done in improving retention rates-and it has improved retention rates; nobody can quite say why, but let us assume that there is some reason for that. All those kids having stayed at school, they now want to go to university when they leave school. What do we find? There are no university places for them. One would have thought that that was pretty simple, but we find that over 20,000 qualified students in Australia are missing out on university places. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own State of Queensland the situation is endemic. Even the Premier, Wayne Goss, says that he is fed up with the Minister and does not want to have anything to do with him. The Gold Coast University College of Griffith University has facilities for about 700 students and we have about 2,000 students attending the college. But the piece de resistance of the administration of the Department is, of course, the training guarantee levy, the regulatory solution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose that I should say something in passing about some of the comments, and sometimes rubbish, that the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) has just been telling us about in this House. I was just reminded by the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) that everything is being done by this Government to look at the question of extending Austudy in remote areas and rural areas. It is quite incorrect for the honourable member for McPherson to criticise the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). I think the Minister's achievements in this area are very well known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was very interested when the honourable member for McPherson was complaining about the so-called sale of our property and so forth to overseas companies. I remember-he may not, because he was not here in this House at that time-his former leader, and I think that was the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) at that time, wanting to completely abolish the Foreign Investment Review Board. That is one of the major curbs that we have on the sale to people from overseas of assets owned by the Australian public and by Australians. It was those opposite who wanted to abolish the Foreign Investment Review Board. I do not know what their policy is now, of course, because it changes so often-simply to suit the times and depending on opinion polls. But I do not want to waste my time speaking on matters raised by the honourable member for McPherson. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the Appropriation Bill (No. 4), the Appropriation Bill (No. 5) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2). In particular, I wish to look at an area where the Government has found it necessary to seek additional provisions beyond the appropriations made for 1991 under the Appropriation Acts Nos 1, 2 and 3. This area is the health area. In the time that I have, I would like to talk about a growing area of health care that I feel deserves to be mentioned in this place. I refer to diversional therapy. </PARA>
<PARA> Diversional therapy is a relatively new form of health care that has developed in our health system over the past couple of decades. If we wanted to go back further, we could trace the beginnings of diversional therapy, even though under another name, back to the days of World War II, when Miss Leila Bloore recognised the need for more than medical rehabilitation for soldiers returning from the war and provided them with diversional activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Diversional Therapy Association in its formal sense was established in Sydney in 1976. The Diversional Therapy Association of Queensland, my home State, being somewhat parochial, is of more interest to me. That was officially inaugurated on 12 October 1985. By October 1990, the membership in Queensland had grown to some 260-plus members. Diversional therapy groups in Queensland have been established in Cairns; Townsville; Caloundra; the Redlands district, which is in my electorate of Bowman; the Gold Coast; Toowoomba; Warwick; Ipswich; Maryborough; Gympie; Redcliffe; and Chermside. </PARA>
<PARA> What is diversional therapy? `Diversional' means to deflect and divert negative thoughts, actions and attitudes to positive feelings of well-being. It sounds simple, and in many ways it is. But it is also very effective. Diversional therapy provides leisure and recreational activities which are designed to enhance the psychological, spiritual, social and physical well-being of individuals within community settings and health care facilities. The diversional therapist motivates people through activities toward a fuller, more purposeful life. </PARA>
<PARA> Diversional therapists deal with a wide range of client types. Amongst them are: physically able and mentally able; physically able, but with a degree of dementia; physically disabled and mentally alert; physically and mentally disabled; frail aged; psycho-geriatric; those with Alzheimer's disease; intellectually disabled; those with visual or hearing loss; terminally ill; and, basically, all types of medical ailments. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, diversional therapy is client centred and recognises that leisure and recreational experiences are the right of all individuals and should be positive and valuable, ensuring opportunities for clients to pursue existing interests, acquire new skills and participate in their choice of activities. A wide variety of experience is appropriate to their interests and needs. Diversional therapy recognises the need to divert people away from illness, diverting them away from being institutionalised and diverting them away from confusion. A great deal of diversional therapy is conducted with our senior citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> But why such an emphasis on senior citizens? Why do they need stimulation? They certainly seemed stimulated enough when I was recently trying to explain the new deeming provisions to them! The answer, I guess, is easy to see when we stand back a little-stand back and stand still. Standing still is something we find very hard to do these days. We are always on the go. Constant change has become part of our daily lives. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us stand back a moment and see how much adjusting our senior citizens have had to do during their lifetime. It can best be demonstrated through reading a passage from a book I recently launched in Brisbane with my very good friend Haydn Sargent, a very popular talkback announcer in Brisbane. It was at a diversional therapy seminar and the book, co-authored by Wendy Butler and Margaret Stephens, was called Never Too Old to Learn. The passage went something like this:</PARA>
<PARA>Senior citizens of today are the children of the First World War and the Great Depression of the 1930s. They were here before penicillin, polio shots, antibiotics, heart transplants and replacement parts, before frozen food, plastic, nylon, dacron, radar, fluorescent lights, credit cards, ball point pens and thongs. </PARA>
<PARA> They listened to the wireless, not the radio. They played records on the gramophone, not discs on the stereo. TV and video were things undreamed of. For them `time sharing' meant togetherness and not spending one week of the year at Great Keppel. Computers were unimagined; hardware was something you bought if you wanted to fix the fence and software was a word yet to be invented. </PARA>
<PARA> They came before pantihose and drip dry clothes, before sinkerators and dishwashers, freezers and electric blankets. They lived before men wore long hair and earrings in their left ear and before women wore trousers and earrings in their nose; not to mention the shaved heads, the unwashed look, clothes bought with designer rips and tears, haircuts that once would have led to law suits and inventions that would have left Mandrake speechless. In those days the girls wore Peter Pan collars, hats and gloves and the men raised their hats to the ladies. </PARA>
<PARA> They lived without DDT, EEGs, vitamin pills, disposable nappies. They didn't walk in fear of stepping on a dirty hypodermic during their family day at the beach. They weren't decaffeinated or polyunsaturated and they did not watch their cholesterol. Macdonald was the vowel-singing old bloke who owned a farm and not a chain of burger joints. Fast food was what you ate during Lent; passive smoking was havin' a fag lyin' down; grass you mowed not smoked; coke you drank not sniffed and pot was something you cooked in. </PARA>
<PARA>In short, things are certainly not what they used to be. It is no wonder that so many of our senior citizens now feel somewhat dislocated. Peggy Skehan, a diversional therapist at the Brisbane seminar, said this to me the other day:</PARA>
<PARA>Imagine being old, frail, lost in a wilderness of uncertainty, not knowing what is going to happen next. If in a days work I can break through and get a smile from such a client . . . then that is the most precious moment of the day. Our main aim in our work is to give quality of life to those in their declining years; rather than simply sustaining life. </PARA>
<PARA>The main thing for staff to understand is the importance of doing things with residents instead of doing things for them. Diversional therapists are used more and more in the following places: nursing homes, hostels, retirement villages, day care and respite care centres, community centres, hospitals, rehabilitation and psychiatric units, special children's services, services offered by the Royal Blind Society, and multiple sclerosis, Red Cross and intellectually handicapped associations. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland the headquarters of the Diversional Therapists Association is based at Carindale, which is very close to my electorate. The Executive Director is Shirley Dredge, the President is Nina Grey, and the Secretary is Patricia Price. Unfortunately, there is still limited training in a professionally recognised capacity for diversional therapists. Nina and Shirley told me that the Cumberland College of Health Scientists at Lidcombe, New South Wales, is the only institution in Australia that runs a full time two-year associate diploma course. This situation can surely be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland the Diversional Therapy Association offers a basic introduction course through the Ithaca technical and further education college, which consists of 18 hours of theory plus eight hours of practical training. This is augmented substantially via a whole swag of workshops and seminars right throughout the year, plus 10 newsletters each year. </PARA>
<PARA> I am interested in this area of diversional therapy because I feel that in the long term this approach to health care could contribute to a general reduction in overall health costs. There is no doubt that people with a positive self-image rely less on traditional forms of medication to help them through the day in their declining years than people who have developed a negative outlook on the hand that has been dealt to them in the card game of life. </PARA>
<PARA> Being from an ethnic background, I come from a culture where family is very important. I mentioned that in my maiden speech many years ago. If all else fails, we can rely on our family. I am not talking about immediate family; I am talking about extended family, no matter how remote the relationship. It makes me sad today to see situations where young people often seem to take little long term interest in the future welfare of their parents. It makes me just as sad to see an increasing number of parents apparently taking little long term interest in their children. </PARA>
<PARA> Times are indeed changing. The fabric of our society is changing. That cultural glue that once bound us together with the instinctive drive to protect our own has now somewhat been diluted, perhaps even contaminated. As a society, we seem to have embarked on a lifestyle course that has eroded our feeling of collective responsibility and built into our psyche the modern-day imperative of looking after No. 1. I think that is very sad. I am sure you would agree with me, Mr Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA> I was equally saddened when I read a report recently that my own cultural group, the Italians, have fallen victim to the decade of greed and the modern concept of individuality at any cost. Italian divorce rates have increased by over 200 per cent in past years. No-one, it seems, is now safe. In many ways-some small, some large-we are all suffering from various forms of cultural dislocation. This has probably hit the aged community with more impact than any other section of our community. Therefore, I believe that there is a need, more than ever before, for forms of diversional therapy to put as much positiveness back in life as is possible. It is too easy to be cynical, and in the long term being cynical is never constructive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Diversional Therapy Association makes it quite clear that it is only part of the overall health care team. Its work complements the excellent work done by others in the field. The moneys raised by this Appropriation Bill will help finance this excellent work. </PARA>
<PARA> In the remainder of the time that I have, I would like to cover a few other health areas that relate particularly to my own electorate-organisations that I know something about in detail, organisations that I believe deserve to be given some credit for the fine work that they do. Not only do they use government funds and funds from other sources to do excellent work, but also their organisations are very cost efficient. In these days, when the welfare dollar is very limited, it then needs to be targeted and that is obviously a very good thing. </PARA>
<PARA> In a previous speech delivered to this House on 9 April I mentioned the fine work of an organisation known as BABI, Bayside Adolescent Boarding Inc., whose work in the area of homeless youth drew Brian Burdekin, the Human Rights Commissioner, to make the comment that BABI should be used as a national model when it came to dealing with the growing problem of youth homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA> Owing to my limited time in that speech I failed to mention the people involved in BABI who are carrying on the good fight against this modern social disease. I wish to take a moment to place acknowledgment of their fine work on the public record. Alan Prisley is the dynamic coordinator of BABI and Claude Huddy, a personal friend of mine and a Commonwealth Employment Service manager, is president of the management committee. Vice-President of the management committee is Pat Jefferies and the secretary is Zillah Bunn, the well-respected and long-serving senior mistress of the Wynnum High School, also in my electorate. The treasurer is Andy McIntyre, with other committee members being June Harrison, Kath McLean, Alan Prisley, David Rolls and Maureen Cooper. </PARA>
<PARA> BABI has three hard-working and compassionate social workers in the person of Mary Guenthroth, Beverley Griffiths and Louise Herrod. Robyn Pattison doubles as both a youth worker and office worker and complements the team effort that is central to the BABI spirit. </PARA>

<PARA> Other groups in my electorate that do excellent work in the health and community area are BIN and WIN. BIN is the Bayside Interagency Network and WIN is the Wynnum Information Centre. The Bayside Interagency Network evolved out of community need during the mid-1980s. The organisation was formed to encourage all community groups in the bayside district to work together for the benefit of the area. It is now a subcommittee of the Wynnum-Manly and district committee on the ageing and BIN is made up of service clubs, government and community organisations. On last count, there were some 50 groups within the bayside area involved in BIN. </PARA>
<PARA> Meetings of BIN are always extremely well attended and there is a general feeling within the local community that BIN is a major success story. BIN's existence has made life easier for every group in the area. It has provided coordination among groups, which has reduced duplication of services, while at the same time enhancing limited resources by ready referal from one group to another when dealing with related matters. </PARA>
<PARA> BIN has produced a bayside resource manual which is an extremely valuable document. It contains information and contact numbers on all emergency services, Aboriginal services, advocacy services, aged services and information on accommodation, alcohol, drugs and gambling. It also contains information on bereavement, child-care, churches, counselling and disabled persons services. Education, employment, health care, home care, hospitals and essential services are covered. Legal assistance, migrant services, mental health, prisoner services and self-help therapy groups are listed in detail. Information on senior citizens, social and community groups, veterinary services, welfare assistance, women's groups and youth services conclude a resource document that has proved to be of immense value to people who live in my electorate. With these sorts of services there is a great saving to government and to government departments because there is so much volunteer work being done. Surely that has something to do with appropriation debates, although indirectly. </PARA>
<PARA> BIN is not restricting itself to a coordinating role alone. Moves are under way to establish a crisis shelter for 10- to 17-year-olds who are in desperate need for overnight accommodation. There are many other ideas in the melting pot which can do nothing but benefit the bayside area of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> The executive of BIN needs to be congratulated on its fine work. Cathy Bavage from Wynnum family day care is a hard-working chairperson. David Jones from community corrections is the treasurer and Julie Christensen, my own electorate secretary, is the secretary of BIN. Other members of the committee are: Marie Lynham from the Department of Family Services; Pam Loynes from my own Department, the Department of Social Security; Marie Stokes, whose wonderful work I have placed on record previously in this place; Theo Gard, who has done magnificent work with the disadvantaged youth at the pioneer centre; and last but not least, Clive Ayre, minister of the local Uniting Church. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already stated that the Bayside Interagency Network is a subcommittee of the Wynnum-Manly and district committee on the ageing, but there is another organisation within BIN that is quickly growing in importance and finding its place within the growing web of support systems that do such a wonderful job in my electorate. In 1988 BIN conducted a survey to ascertain the developing needs of the bayside community. One of the identifying needs was that an information centre, or citizens advice bureau, be opened in the district to allow access of information to residents. The information centre was trialled on a one day a week basis at the Church of England hall, but it soon became obvious, through demand, that the service needed to be extended and be available on a daily basis. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end the committee, which is now officially known as the Wynnum Information Centre Committee, approached the Brisbane City Council for the use of one of the shops in the civic centre in Wynnum central. This was recently approved by the council, a council which, I might add, Mr Deputy Speaker-and you would know about this-has had dramatic changes of fortune over the past weeks. People power it seems is alive and well at least in the State of Queensland, even though our place on the wheel of political fortune always seems to be at odds with what is happening in the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing is for sure-over recent years Queenslanders have become very discerning in many ways and quite shrewd in developing ways of getting the funding dollar to stretch as far as possible. What BIN and the Wynnum Information Centre are doing is smart. The people who serve on both committees are intelligent and very committed to making life a little easier for those who find themselves at any kind of disadvantage due to the changing lifestyles of modern society. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wynnum Information Centre, which has a working committee comprising several of the BIN executive plus Dianne Bagnall and Pat Lewis representing the community, will provide information on a wide range of services in the bayside area. This will include sporting activities, places of interest, business services, community services, welfare agencies and entertainment venues. The Wynnum Information Centre requires only a few thousand dollars recurrent funding to cover day-to-day expenses. Most of that is raised through public donations, but the amount of good to the community that this money buys is way beyond a few thousand dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> I am proud of the way that both these organisations operate within my electorate. They do a marvellous job and do not simply wait around for government grants before they try to rectify problems encountered in the community. As members of the community they know that they have a responsibility to that community. These people do not sit in their armchairs complaining about how tough life is. They are out there doing something, helping people, supporting people and generally contributing towards the destiny of the area in which they live. </PARA>
<PARA> I am proud of the work that these people do in my electorate. They rarely seek the limelight. They are quiet achievers who meet obstacles every day in pursuit of their beliefs. But they do not give up; they persevere. I place on record in this place that the bayside community in my electorate would be a much worse place to live in if it were not for people like them. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that in the health and community services area, this Government has an unequalled reputation. There is no doubt that we do care. But we need not only a government that cares, but also people in the communities themselves that care, and the organisations that I have mentioned in this debate are fine examples of that caring. Unlike those opposite, we place prime importance on the social, mental and physical health of all Australians. The problems faced in health are always challenging. We strive to overcome them. We strive to make life better, even in small ways, for as many people as we can who have chosen to live in this great country. We have to think positively and not be dragged down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the February 1991 Business Council of Australia summit on `Our Competitive Future', Professor Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is the capacity to innovate and improve over long periods of time in ways that are valued in foreign markets that determines competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will be aware that it is no longer good enough for any sector in Australia to set its standards of performance internally. Rather, we must endeavour to achieve international best practice in our work, our rates of taxation and our overall environment for business to operate in. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end, a brief examination of the relationship between Australia and our fifth largest trading partner, Taiwan, could give a lead and a guide as to the way in which Australia should change its policy direction in the next two decades. Australia and Taiwan have populations of 17 1/2 million and 20 million people respectively, but Taiwan's population density per square kilometre is 100 times greater. Therefore, pressure is placed on the landmass and environment in Taiwan to a degree unknown in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Asian neighbour has made great progress over the past 40 years. From an agriculturally based economy in 1950, it has developed to become a major exporter of technologically sophisticated electronics and plastics as well as textiles and footwear. The growth in exports of personal computers over the past few years provides a good example of how the Taiwanese have raised their productivity and their technical efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The balance of trade between our two nations is difficult to assess because of the widely differing methods of calculation, but it appears that Australia accounts for about 3 per cent of Taiwan's imports and 2 per cent of Taiwan's exports. Australia's growth rate in the two-way trade of 17 per cent per annum, however, is not enough for us to keep pace with other nations trading with Taiwan. At the present time, unfortunately, we are only of marginal importance in this part of East Asia, at least when compared to Japan and the United States. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VH4">Mr McARTHUR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes they are, as the honourable member for Lyne says. Nevertheless, it is possible to open the window of opportunity. Our goal is to increase the proportion of our trade with the four tigers-Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong. These rapidly developing industrialised countries are creating the wealth and capacity to trade with Australia, which is mutually beneficial to both parties. Australia is rich in natural resources, and the four tigers have big populations with an increasing consumer potential which has a capacity to pay for Australian products which are predominantly agricultural and mineral.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government claims to place great store on our economic performance. Yet Australia has severe structural problems including a centralised wage fixing system, a transport infrastructure that performs at levels below that of other nations and high unemployment, at 9.2 per cent of the work force. Inflation in Australia, whilst declining from the 6.2 per cent as forecast by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), is still high by Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development standards. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast Taiwan has managed to contain inflation below 3 per cent for much of the 1980s. Although inflation has since risen to almost 6 per cent, the Taiwanese gross domestic product increased by 5.5 per cent in 1990. In 1990-91 Australia's growth in gross domestic product is forecast at a mere 1.9 per cent-a very interesting comparison compared to Taiwan's tremendous progress. All this is from a country which started out with few resources 40 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The persistent surpluses gathered each year in Taiwan have facilitated structural change and the more efficient use of resources. This is largely due to the Taiwanese Government encouraging the private sector to continually innovate and export. It recognises that economic growth will achieve an increase in living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast the Australian Government has been forced continually to revise downwards its original prediction of a $8 billion surplus in 1990-91 because of `the recession we had to have', which has reduced the revenue and increased expenditure, especially for those unfortunate unemployed Australians who have had to bear the brunt of the Treasurer's high interest rate policy. The Opposition believes that the experiences of Taiwan over the past few years could become an example of economic progress for Australia to emulate. </PARA>
<PARA> Taiwan has fostered a climate in which people know that it is absolutely essential to foster an export culture. Its people vigorously pursue goals of international competitiveness, specialisation, efficiency and economies of scale to bring about the creation of greater national wealth which, in turn, improves individual standards of living in Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Taiwan is not alone in this. The other three tigers of the region-Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong-have a similar reputation. Taiwan's people recognise that they must be world class in every area of endeavour. Barriers to some of their exports, such as clothing and footwear, have been overcome by sheer persistence. Their exporters have followed a quality first policy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, understandably, much concern in the Australian community about the levels of protection afforded by other nations to their producers. Taiwan continues to protect its agricultural commodities, but the level of protection is about to be reduced from 26 per cent to 18 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Ross Garnaut's report clearly indicated that the freeing up of world trade would be in every nation's interest in making more goods and services available at lower costs, thereby increasing standards of living in the world. Since 1947 the average tariff on manufactured goods throughout the world has fallen from 40 per cent to about 5 per cent in 1990. As a result of trade liberalisation, the volume of world trade has expanded over that period by an incredible 500 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worthy of note that the economies which have grown the slowest through the 1980s, such as those of Latin America and Africa, believe in high levels of protection. Australia's average level of protection remains at about 12 per cent. This compares unfavourably with Japan's average level of tariff protection of 2.4 per cent. The United States of America is 3.5 per cent, with Germany being only 1.3 per cent. It is worth noting that there is virtually no protection in Hong Kong and Singapore. These countries have achieved rapid rates of economic growth because of their positive attitudes towards exports and by competing on world markets in terms of quality and price. </PARA>
<PARA> Economic growth is further encouraged in Taiwan by keeping taxation rates relatively low. Income tax on average weekly earnings is typically around 8 per cent for the single worker in Taiwan as against 22 per cent in Australia. Of course, a value added tax of 5 per cent is also struck in Taiwan but other taxes are broadly similar to Australia, being levied at three levels of government, such as ours. The lower tax rates in Taiwan provide an incentive to work. </PARA>
<PARA> Taiwan's broadly based consumption tax encourages national savings. This is demonstrated by one in four Taiwanese investing directly in their own share market. Only one in 10 Australians invest directly in the Australian share market-a very invidious comparison between the two nations' attitude towards investment and their capacity to make this investment. Not only are taxation rates lower for individuals, company tax rates are also less onerous, with the highest rate in Taiwan being about 25 per cent. Tax holidays of up to five years for productive enterprises are also granted. This concession covers a wide spectrum of industries, from agricultural to transportation. These tax rates give an incentive for companies to invest in Taiwan, which encourages its growth and makes it more internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Taiwanese have managed to foster a work ethic which has resulted in rapid growth in the gross national product to about $US7,990 per capita in the year to December 1990. This has facilitated improvements in education, health and transport. </PARA>
<PARA> As with all economies, there are some down sides in Taiwan. In particular, the pressures of a high population and the desire to industrialise have led to the problems of pollution due to emissions from factories. Taiwan cannot afford the problem of acid rain that has caused so many difficulties in Europe. These troubles are now being addressed by the adoption of the `polluter pays' principle. It is worthy of note that the environmental lobby in Australia has opposed this concept even as it steadily finds favour in other countries around the world. I commend to the House the principle of giving the user incentives to minimise pollution. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the current Taiwanese six-year plan, $US110 billion is to be spent on public infrastructure projects-principally transportation and electricity generation. This represents a large increase on the levels of spending in this area over recent years. Taiwan's spending will be targeted to increase national wealth producing capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Australian of 1 May, the Labor left wing made a plea for increased public spending in areas such as public housing. The difference between Australia and Taiwan is that Australia has a net foreign debt of $130 billion. More housing being created in Australia will not make it more competitive on an international basis. The Taiwanese know that they must live within their means. It is not for nothing that they have built up the world's second highest foreign exchange reserves of $A90 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> In another place, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) takes pride in the Australian Government's relations with other countries. In a speech to the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents Club on 22 April 1991, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have been conducting an energetic, independent foreign policy in the region . . . built around, but not confined to, some high profile initiatives like Asia Pacific economic co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet it was the Opposition, for instance, that proposed well in advance of the Government's recent announcement that the Far East Trading Co. be granted permission to call itself the Taipei Trade and Cultural Office. This name change more truly reflected the role of this organisation in fostering links between our two nations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has also long called for the commencement of direct air links between Taiwan and Australia. I am pleased to see that progress is finally being made in this area. It must, however, be of concern that Canada has a start of a number of months over Australia as direct flights between Taipei and Vancouver commenced in January. Of course, Canada beating us to the gun is nothing new. A possible area of export revenue for Australia to Taiwan is uranium sales, with nuclear power supplying just under half of Taiwan's electricity requirements. Canada recognises that, with appropriate safeguards in place, the export of uranium is desirable and has therefore secured 30 per cent of the world market despite having only 10 per cent of known world reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government, beholden to a deeply-held but outdated creed, as yet has been unable to abandon its three-mines policy. Australia has 30 per cent of the world reserves, yet only 10 per cent of the sales-a remarkable comparison with the Canadian situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the Industry Commission in its recent report, Mining and Minerals Processing in Australia, has recommended that the three-mines uranium policy be abandoned. I note that the Australian Labor Party annual conference will be having a look at that. We will be interested to see the debates that take place between the left wing and some of the more rational members of the Government in trying to come to grips with the remarkable situation of the Government's three-mines policy. The Commission believes that the Government's intervention in the uranium industry should be limited to ensuring adequate safeguards with respect to the mining, processing, transporting and use of uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that the intention of the Taiwan Power Co. to spend $10m on a feasibility study into a joint coalmining venture in the Hunter Valley is to be applauded. Our comparative advantage lies in industries such as mining and agriculture, although that is not to discourage downstream processing in Australia which will add export dollars. The Opposition is nevertheless concerned that Taiwan and Australia have such little apparent interest in investing in each other's economies. The latest available figures indicate that the Taiwanese investment in Australia stands at $150m, with Australian investment in Taiwan being $133m. Even if the Taiwan Power Co. project proceeds, investment by Taiwan in Australia will be only about $400m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that the property and business sectors would benefit from an increase in these levels and that the growing internationalisation of economies means that we will find it much harder to stand alone. The Taiwanese, in liberating monetary controls and reducing protection have shown that they recognise this. We do, however, need to take a leaf out of their book and not only support, within reason, foreign investment, but also develop an export culture. Our share of output going to exports needs to rise further.</PARA>
<PARA> The reason that the Opposition has so strongly argued the case for micro-economic reform in Australia is that, unless our ports, land transport systems and industrial relations practices are modified, we shall indeed be overtaken by Taiwan in terms of gross domestic product per capita by the year 2,000, as predicted by the head of economics at Singapore University. </PARA>
<PARA> As an optimist, I believe Australians can rise to the challenge, but we need the Government to show the lead. The Hewson government will address these issues and provide the leadership and example to reinvigorate Australia. The Hewson government will change Australian attitudes to reverse Australia's decline to a Third World country. </PARA>
<PARA> The example of Taiwan is one worthy of study. Only with radical changes to industrial relations, micro-economic reform as it affects Australian industry, and the introduction of a broadly based consumption tax will Australia begin to compete with our Asian neighbours, such as Taiwan. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The appropriations that I wish to speak to today concern the Department of Employment, Education and Training. In particular, I refer to the further $12.9m for trade training and the additional $28.7m for Austudy, which reflect an increase in the number of students in our higher education institutions and also the higher retention rates in our secondary schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we are to be really fair dinkum about our whole education system and about getting value from those appropriations, and indeed all appropriations for education, employment and training, we need to be begin at the beginning. A sensible person driving a car along a road when the oil light comes on will stop at the nearest garage and top up. Sensible people do not wait until the engine seizes up. Why? It is pretty simple-it is cheaper. It is using one's commonsense because it is more effective to apply preventative measures. </PARA>
<PARA> The nation's approach to the investment in human capital-a rather cold term, but referring to investment in education-should be no different. In the March industry statement, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made several fundamental statements concerning our education system and he announced the good schools strategy, the foundation block for all further education success. The Prime Minister made three fundamental comments, which I will quote. The first comment reads:</PARA>
<PARA>If we get the basics right in these critical years we need not set limits on our prospects. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, he states:</PARA>
<PARA>Quite simply, unless we give our young people the motivation and the opportunity to bring out the best in themselves through education, we shall never be able to bring out the best in ourselves as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA>And we will never become a tiger anywhere, let alone Asia. Lastly, he says:</PARA>
<PARA>The foundation of a clever country is its education system. </PARA>
<PARA>The Hawke Labor Government's cooperative efforts with the States and Territories in school education over the past four years has focused upon curriculum, quality of teaching, duplication and resource issues-a synthesis, rather than an analytical approach. The good schools strategy moves the search for excellence and best practice in our schools into the actual schools themselves. It is the first time any government in this nation has focused education into the big picture, better described as `good schooling' rather than `good schools'. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Times Educational Supplement in April 1986, the findings of a major British four-year longitudinal education study on good schooling was published. Its findings are most pertinent to Australia. The study found that more than any other factor, the single most powerful determinant of a person's future success was the quality of schooling received by children between the ages of seven and 11. It found that the quality of schooling was far more important than a child's race, religion, gender, or ethnic or socio-economic background. </PARA>
<PARA> The good schools strategy announced on 12 March allocated a sum of $10.5m over the next three years to involve people at the chalkface-school principals, parents, teachers and the local community-in identifying what constitutes a good school. Unfortunately, I did not read anywhere any reference to the most important group of all-the children themselves, some six or seven million of them in our total population of 17 million. The strategy, agreed to in principle by State and Territory education Ministers, will be all about identifying best practice, organisation and structure in the nation's 10,000 schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) has indicated that those Australians directly involved in school education are best placed to identify best practice. I could not agree more. The Minister has also acknowledged that there are many factors that contribute to making a school outstanding, from the dedication of principals and teachers to the way a school is organised, to the involvement of school councils. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the good schools strategy, once best practice has been identified its application will be promoted in other schools across the nation. The primary goal-and let us remember that word primary-is to improve the quality of education in all schools by identifying excellence in individual school communities. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the strategy, the Government intends to use international Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development research and experience. But if we are to be truly internationally competitive, we will need to assume international leadership and establish our schools as the world's best. As such, we need to have the confidence to develop our own uniquely Australian way. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic foundation in our education system is our primary school, a basic fact ignored by many educational bureaucrats in this country. Without doubt, that is where the good schooling strategy should begin. Also without doubt, the best teaching practice is in our primary schools. It certainly will not be found in academia, where often the quality of teaching leaves a lot to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA> The good schooling strategy should begin where our schools' practices are strongest-in our primary schools. Certainly, higher education, technical and further education and secondary schools have significantly more resources, but that is often where the strength stops. I recently asked a school principal to ask the children in her school, first, what they thought a good school was and, secondly, what they would learn in a good school. Basically, the first question I asked was wrong because it was about a good school rather than good schooling. When asked what would happen in a perfect school, the kids said quite interesting things. </PARA>
<PARA> The kids said that in a good school they would learn new things that they did not already know. They would not choose the easy things to learn but would try to learn something that they did not know and go over it with a teacher. They wanted to learn new things every day because they felt that the more they learnt, the cleverer they would be. The bright kids would teach the less bright. Teachers would understand kids' problems and would listen to and care about them. The perfect school would have many children in a classroom, with three or four teachers. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that some of those comments may, in fact, be what children think adults want to hear, but the major thrust of what they are saying is pretty clear. These kids, aged five to 11, think that education should be a cooperative venture, which should be exciting, inventive and an exploration of alternatives and possibilities. They think that it should affirm high quality relationships between the participants and that education excellence takes place in an environment that stimulates. They think that education requires high teacher morale and that education is more successful when influenced by groups of teachers rather than individuals. Any school that stated its philosophy in those terms would certainly at least have an idea of the direction in which good schooling would go. The direction, we note, is stated by the most important people in the schooling process, the kids themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Taking the lead from those children, what is good schooling? Good schooling operates within the parameters of several frameworks, but I believe it can be described in very simple terms and those simple terms are best formed by asking questions. Why educate? What does one educate? How does one educate? When does one educate? With whom does one educate? For whom does one educate? With what does one educate? How does one measure the success of education, and what does one do then? The translation of those simple questions can accommodate anything and everything that does and should happen in good schooling in just six major considerations. Why? Obviously a set of beliefs, a rationale, a philosophy, a policy. With and for whom? Relationships, personnel. What, how and when? Curriculum, programs, scheduling, methodology. With what? Resources, organisation, procedures. Measure of success? Assessment, reconciliation of educational theory and practice. What then? Evaluation and future planning. </PARA>
<PARA> What those children were saying is a pretty sound basis for a primary school or, indeed, any sector of education. Remember what they were saying. They were saying education is a cooperative venture; education is the impact of mind upon mind; education is the exploration of alternatives; and education is a `you and me' relationship. The children quite clearly said that education is a people business and that the quality of the relationships developed between teachers, parents and children largely determine the success or otherwise of good schooling. The kids were also pretty clear that they needed to be influenced by more than just one teacher; in fact, they were suggesting three or four. The kids know that a mix of different teachers will be more successful. </PARA>
<PARA> The following is my interpretation, but if I went back to those kids I am pretty confident they would not disagree. Kids know intuitively that groups possessing different people roles will work more successfully than individuals. Kids know intuitively that they will need different kinds of people to guide their education. They need a mix of the roles of ideas, process and task people. This does not mean that one can simply categorise people into one or the other. It means that in certain circumstances and dependent upon motivation, commitment, interest and expertise, people will tend to play more of one role than another. Of course, one role is not intrinsically more important than another. </PARA>
<PARA> Good schools will have ideas people who have the ability to recognise, receive and create ideas. Good schools will have process people who possess the ability to devise with others appropriate means to implement ideas. Good schools will have task people who possess the ability to persevere and commit themselves to carrying out the idea and the process. </PARA>
<PARA> Ideas people are essential to good schooling. They provide the vision and the direction. When ideas are first mooted, they are not always clearly stated or understood by others. This is often a root cause of conflict and ideas and task people often clash. This place is a splendid example of that. The necessary process and understanding is not always clear to either group. Ideas people have short fuses and they show it. They dream, they love to argue ideas. They do not personalise things. Task people, on the other hand, often personalise those ideas without fully understanding the reasons why. </PARA>
<PARA> Process people are essential to good schooling. They provide the means to implement ideas successfully. They restate and rework the idea with others into a more acceptable and understood form without losing the intent of the idea. They need to be extremely sensitive to others and skilled in group dynamics. They are often caring, patient and good listeners. They can get frustrated, but seldom show it. They practise and love to be involved with others. They bridge the often very large gap between the thinking of ideas and task people. </PARA>
<PARA> Task people are also essential to good schooling. They implement ideas and processes. They plan, organise, complete and review work. They are achievers and are often impatient. They, too, have a short fuse but they seldom show it. They love to succeed individually. </PARA>
<PARA> Good schools will be made up of personnel that have all of those roles, but kids need to be influenced by all three roles, not just one on a year at a time basis, as most of our schools are organised. If the preferred ideas, processes and tasks of individuals can be identified within the school and the differences understood, the school or, indeed, any organisation, even this place, has the potential to capitalise on the skills and talents that are available. If one does not know where one is going and why, with whom one is going and how, one will more than likely end up somewhere else. The pity of all that is that one probably will not realise it. </PARA>
<PARA> Good schooling will be judged by many criteria, some pertinent, some not. However, the most important criterion is the quality of educational programs that are offered to students. The kids know that for educational programs to be successful they need the input of groups of teachers. The kids know that no matter how good or popular a teacher is, there are no teachers in the world who possess the skills, talents and interests to cope with a primary school curriculum. </PARA>
<PARA> In a primary school, good schooling will often have a `broad fields' approach to curriculum. There may be four, five, six or seven areas. I will give four as an example. I point out the following example just to show how silly, illogical and impossible the expectations placed upon teachers are in the foundation years of our education system. In a broad fields approach to curriculum there would probably be about four major subject areas: language arts, mathematics, environmental studies, and expressive arts. Remember when kids said they would like more than one teacher? In all the 25 years I was involved in education I never saw one teacher who was capable in all four areas. Most teachers had expertise in one area; quite often in two areas; very, very seldom in three areas; but never in four areas. Basically, all our primary schools are organised with one teacher and 30 children, year in, year out. I do not think it is terribly difficult actually to prove that teachers are seldom good at more than two subject areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take the most important area-language arts. It includes reading, writing, listening, speaking, handwriting, spelling, poetry, library skills, literature-in other words, all forms of communication. There are two major aspects involved in communication-the processes of transmitting and receiving. Essential transmission skills that give messages are speaking and writing. Essential receiving skills to receive messages are listening and reading. The prime function of a language arts program-literacy-is to give children the skills to relate to others and to understand all the reasons for the messages given or received, be they in a verbal, written or non-verbal form. Obviously, a language arts program would be enhanced by the study of a foreign or community language. We have one million people in this country who are functionally illiterate at an adult level. Something has gone wrong somewhere.</PARA>
<PARA> Mathematics in a primary school includes number and space, measurement, problem solving, geometry, logic, graphing, money, and keyboard skills. There are two major aspects of mathematics. They can be loosely described as order and spirit. Order is the knowledge of tables and computational skills in addition, subtraction, division and multiplication, and order assumes some sort of sequence. Unfortunately, in many of our schools that is where mathematics, or more accurately arithmetic, begins and stops. Remember the kids again? They want new stuff, excitement and challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> Spirit in mathematics is thinking, logic, curiosity, and problem solving, and spirit does not necessarily assume sequence. Some skills are not necessarily prerequisite to others. Most teachers in primary schools cope with the order, but only a few even recognise the spirit. Some children need order to find the spirit. Some children need spirit to find the order, and some children need differing proportions of both. </PARA>
<PARA> In a primary school, the subject of environmental studies includes history, geography, social studies, health, science, Aboriginal studies and religious education. The framework for environmental studies can be seen as a never-ending series of concentric circles, each one adding more understanding of the world in which we all live. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth area, an expressive arts program, includes music, physical education, arts, crafts, drama and dance. Expressive arts is the living interpretation of people's past, contemporary and future life. They are studies of the developing skills of all the active, the seen, the heard, the thought and the felt in our senses. Expressive arts is an area much misunderstood, often undervalued and, broadly speaking, done very badly in the majority of our primary schools. Done well, the expressive arts program actually strengthens academic areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that I point out the wide diversity of the primary school curriculum is that there is an assumption in our society from parents, teachers, principals and bureaucrats that the deployment of one teacher and 30 kids on a yearly basis is a pretty sound organisational practice. The allocation of one teacher each year never has and never will cope with the diversity of modern curriculum demands, yet it remains the basic organisational practice in nearly all our primary schools. Why? It has never worked. It does not work. Please do not think I am having a go at primary school teachers because nothing could be further from the truth. They are, by the proverbial country mile, the best teachers in the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are really serious about being internationally competitive, they need to be the best teachers in the world and they need to be operative at the beginning of the formal education system-in the primary school. It is impossible for a primary school teacher to implement a total educational program, let alone all the other factors, to fulfil the expectations put on them. No individual primary school teacher can cope with the demands of an educational program that effectively implements for kids language arts, mathematics, environmental studies and expressive arts. When will we all stop kidding ourselves?</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I acknowledge that I have only scratched the surface of the good schooling strategy. It has come from the most important group in the education process, the kids themselves. Obviously there are many other areas to be considered by the good schooling strategy, for instance, the quality of teacher training. Who in fact teaches the teachers? I applaud the Government on this initiative. But for this project to be successful, at least the following three factors will need to be taken into account: we should involve the children; we should be talking about good schooling, not just good schools; and we should begin with the nation's best schools, our primary schools, and start from a position of strength, not weakness. The good schooling strategy provides an opportunity for the nation to really test its commitment to long term structural change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the Appropriation Bill (No. 4), the Appropriation Bill (No. 5) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) cover many areas of government funding, I wish to deal today with funding for road transport infrastructure in tied and untied grants to the States for road maintenance, road upgrading and provision of new national highways and arterial roads. I note in the House that $32m is to be appropriated for payment to the bankrupt State of Victoria in lieu of petroleum royalties. The Hawke-Keating, Keating-Hawke, Keating-Keating Labor Government has an appalling record on road funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last decade since the Australian Labor Party came to power, spending on roads throughout this nation, which is so dependent on a good road network, has been effectively cut in real terms by 30 per cent. The people of this nation are fed up with paying increased fuel excise without the corresponding increase in improved condition of the roads they use. In the last coalition Budget of 1982-83, 88 per cent of fuel excise revenue was spent on roads. Today it is a paltry 26.8 per cent. The people of Australia are being ripped off by a government that is taking more and more in fuel excise revenue and spending less and less of that excise on roads for which the revenue is taken. It is not simply a case of user pays; rather, the motorist pays and pays for roads that do not eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only has this Federal Government much to answer for in terms of letting our road transport infrastructure run down, but so also does our State Labor Government in the destitute State of Victoria for both decreased road funding and for using the road funding issue for pork-barrelling during State election campaigns. A major municipality within my electorate of La Trobe is the city of Berwick, which I point out to honourable members is the fastest growing municipality in the State of Victoria. This growth has not just been a natural occurrence; it has been encouraged by State Government planning which has set aside for urban development large tracts of what was rural agricultural land. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, the State Government has purchased substantial hectares within the city of Berwick confines for development of a combination of low cost public and private housing. The growth, therefore, within the city of Berwick is, to a very large extent, driven by government planning processes and that growth is rapidly turning what was once a sleepy rural community into another largely dormitory suburb to the south-east of the major centre of Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to put the issues which I intend to raise regarding roads within the city of Berwick, it is important to state clearly that since Berwick became a city in its own right in October 1973 the city administration has been known throughout the State of Victoria-indeed, I would trust, throughout Australia-as an administration of great competence and excellence. Many of the councillors of that city since formation have also been of very high quality and have included many forward thinking individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> The scene that I am setting is that of a municipality with excellent administration and good councillors representing a broad section of community interests and concern. Berwick has approached its role in the local community in a very balanced manner, addressing in a modern way the needs of the community for capital infrastructure, for community facilities including sport and roads, and at the same time addressing many of the social needs of the city's rapidly expanding population. Berwick's financial management has been excellent and programs are diverse and are seen to be meeting community needs.</PARA>
<PARA> Berwick's founding city engineer, Mr Max Pawsey, showed exceptional foresight and engineering competence. In the very early years of the newly formed city, his efforts towards developing local planning, as well as encouraging initial State Government planning for the growth that he could see would inevitably occur, have been significant factors with respect to the availability of public land within the city to cater for spectacular growth. However, Mr Pawsey's insistence that roads within the city, particularly roads running east-west, would in the future become a tremendous bottleneck was to some extent unheeded. Today we are starting to pay the price. There are only two significant east-west roads through the municipality. They are Heatherton Road, which is a minor road in the northern and less populated area of the municipality, and Princes Highway, which is a major feeder road to the entire south-east of Victoria, including Gippsland and the La Trobe Valley. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Victorian and Federal governments have realised that Princes Highway, as the major artery through the south-east, required major upgrading in order to bypass many small towns which acted to dramatically slow through freight and private transport. Many hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent in bypassing towns such as Berwick Village, Pakenham, Morwell, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of Highway No. 1 we are producing within the city of Berwick an unbelievable bottleneck to through traffic by not linking the Mulgrave Freeway or south-eastern arterial, whatever honourable members want to call it, with that portion of Princes Highway which bypasses the village of Berwick and then continues down to Gippsland. As Berwick expands, access roads continue to be built to feed on to Princes Highway for both new freight from new industrial development to the south of Princes Highway, as well as private motor vehicles. Increasing traffic is exacerbated through both housing and industrial development. Any person who travels on our roads knows the major impediment to traffic flows caused by traffic lights and the chaos that frequently occurs through start-stop traffic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Like most people in this building, I watched his press conference this morning and his struggle and failure to defend the totally untenable position of his Government in relation to Ambassador Brian Burke. How on earth can he allow Brian Burke to remain as an ambassador for another day?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I had on a number of occasions outlined the reasoning of the Government. I will go through it in the sequence which is relevant. In the first place, of course, what the Leader of the Opposition wanted, screeched for, demanded in every conceivable way, is that on the basis of allegations before Mr Burke had appeared we should stand Mr Burke down. I gave my reasons then and have, on a number of occasions, asked whether the Leader of the Opposition would clarify his position on this matter. He never has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said that, as far as this Government was concerned, it was no principle of this Government that the mere making of allegations was sufficient to stand down a person from public office. I have asked the Leader of the Opposition on a number of occasions to state unequivocally whether that is his position. We are still awaiting the reply from the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the events which have succeeded that, I have made it clear in this place-and I made it clear again in the press conference to which the Leader of the Opposition refers-that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, has at all points in this matter sought and acted upon advice from his Department.</PARA>
<PARA> The advice of that Department has been that, while certain actions of the ambassador have been unwise and improper, the advice as of today still stands: nothing at this point has been revealed which would require the ambassador to be stood down. The Minister has acted on that advice and I have supported the Minister in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA> May I finally say that on this matter of standards there is an enormous degree of hypocrisy on the part of the parties opposite. It goes to the question of royal commissions. I remind this House that on 12 September 1981 letters patent were issued to Mr Justice Woodward to inquire into the Australian meat industry. Specific areas of inquiry were included in those terms of reference, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>Whether such allegations were dealt with in a manner that was adequate and effective.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Government of the Liberal and National parties set up a royal commission with a specific term of reference as to whether such allegations were dealt with in a manner that was adequate and effective. The royal commissioner presented his report on 17 October 1982, and this is what the royal commissioner found in regard to that specific term of reference which had been laid down by the Government for the royal commissioner to inquire into:</PARA>
<PARA>I am bound to record my view that the Minister did not deal with these allegations adequately and effectively.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is a specific term of reference: was it dealt with adequately and effectively? There was a specific finding by the royal commissioner that it was not so done.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister tendered his resignation. What was the attitude of honourable members opposite? They attacked the royal commissioner. Indeed, the Prime Minister at the time, Mr Fraser, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Some aspects of that report make me very, very angry indeed.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to be critical of the adverse finding concerning Nixon. In Parliament on 21 September he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot accept that the one adverse finding against the Minister has been substantiated. I unequivocally reject it.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have Opposition members on this occasion saying in regard to a mere allegation or statement that the man involved should be dismissed, but when they were in government they set up a royal commission to investigate on a particular term of reference, there was a specific finding from the royal commissioner that that term of reference led to the conclusion that the Minister did not meet the standards required, and what did they do? They attacked the royal commissioner and rejected the proposition in the finding from the royal commissioner. So honourable members opposite should not suggest in this place or outside it that they have some standard of propriety which is beyond criticism.</PARA>

I did see the editorial and I was somewhat taken aback by it because on Monday Senator Ray and I announced that the Australian Defence Force would be sending a specialist humanitarian aid team to northern Iraq to assist Kurdish refugees in the appalling conditions in which they are now living, and which I think we have all seen on television.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The team is designed to provide basic medical care, field hygiene and water purification facilities, with the cost of the initial deployment, which is over $3m, being met by the Department of Defence out of its existing resources. The decision to send that team was taken precisely because it will make a significant and material difference and contribution to the alleviation of suffering in the region. The article to which my colleague refers is correct in saying that the relief effort is being improvised daily, but that is why a small team of specially trained personnel will be so effective.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That team will be able to be deployed as required in the area and repositioned as the situation unfolds. It is not restricted to any particular area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the most basic requirements of the refugees is clean water. There is an acute shortage of facilities to provide clean water, and such facilities are essential if we are going to prevent epidemics, escalating infant mortality and suffering on a tragic scale. The Sydney Morning Herald editorial made no mention of the water purification units, the field shower unit and the preventive medicine components of the team. We are providing that assistance because it is desperately needed. We also have some of the best technology in the world for purifying water in the field. The two water purification teams being sent can each provide 7,500 litres of purified water every hour from a thoroughly contaminated source. The field shower unit can shower 80 personnel an hour using water on a continuous basis.</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that since the decision was made we have been advised by our representatives abroad that the ADF presence has been enthusiastically received as `a considerable enhancement of our ability to provide humanitarian aid'. The composition of the team was described as being extremely good. The point is that our assistance is highly practical, guaranteed to meet the most pressing needs of the refugees and, along with other government initiatives, is precisely targeted. The potential for that aid to go astray is minimal. We needed to act quickly because every delay was being measured in deaths, diseases and human suffering.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by offering the observations of another newspaper from my home city which I believe much better reflects the standards by which this operation should be judged. The editorial in the Adelaide News of yesterday stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The ability to respond swiftly to an emergency, particularly in the provision of basic health and communications, is a test as worthy of an army as any battle and would provide maximum value for the defence tax dollar.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has made his position on this quite clear at all points. There have been two considerations in the mind of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and they were appropriately in his mind. One is that stream of events which involved allegations against Ambassador Burke. He, as I have done myself, has at all points said, in that respect, that the making of allegations was not something upon which the Ambassador should be displaced from his position. That remains a position of this side of the House. Unfortunately, it is not a position of principle which has been embraced, as it should be, by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Would the Minister advise the House of the progress of negotiations on the national benchmark salary for Australian teachers? Is the Minister aware of calls for an increase in teachers' salaries of up to 40 per cent? What would be the fiscal implications of such an increase?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide for his question and his continuing interest in this important area. I am delighted to advise the House that on 12 April the Ministers for education from the States and the Commonwealth, meeting as the Australian Education Council, agreed to a new benchmark salary for teachers of $38,000, which is the level to which teachers can expect to aspire within the normal promotional scale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This represents a number of important developments as far as the teaching profession is concerned. In the first instance, it means that for the first time we have a national approach to the remuneration of teachers, and we have a national salary structure regardless of whether teachers work in a particular State or in the government system as opposed to the non-government system.</PARA>
<PARA> As well, we have set the scene for the introduction of a totally new provision within the teaching profession of the advanced skilled teacher. This means that the best teachers can aspire to far better salaries than they have become used to in recent times. Indeed, in some States teachers will be able to receive salaries 30 per cent in excess of the maximum salary to which they would have been entitled under the old arrangement. I think this gives long overdue recognition to the important place of teachers within our society and provides an opportunity for recruiting and holding some of our best people within the teaching profession.</PARA>
<PARA> It was therefore with some surprise that I noticed on 18 April, just a few days later, that the honourable member for Bennelong had decided to bungle his way into this area, proposing that teachers salaries should be increased across-the-board by 40 per cent according to, in his words, some strict new performance standards. This reveals either a degree of ignorance on the part of the honourable member or a degree of stupidity on his part which really defies imagination.</PARA>
<PARA> We have been engaged, for something in excess of a year, in painstakingly negotiating, not just with the States but also with the teachers union, a totally new approach to the remuneration of teachers which has, as I said, seen opportunities for increases of 30 per cent for the best teachers within Australia and at the same time the establishment of a national project on the quality of teaching and learning, which will not only go into questions of such things as teacher education but also go into areas such as the way in which schools work and the work practices within the schools to try to ensure there is a better way to provide for the education of the nation's children.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, within this context the honourable member for Bennelong says there should be an across-the-board increase of 40 per cent. This means either an additional cost to the taxpayer of some $2.5 billion in terms of additional wage bills for education ministries within Australia or, as he would say, it should be paid within the existing budget for schools. In other words, as he said in one of his radio interviews:</PARA>
<PARA>You can always afford to pay someone 40 per cent more if they work 40 per cent harder and 40 per cent more effectively.</PARA>
<PARA>How on earth can one expect teachers to work 40 per cent harder unless one intends to increase class sizes by 40 per cent? In other words, the honourable member for Bennelong is advocating that in this country class sizes should increase from, say, 30 to something like 42. This is the way in which he intends to do something about improving the moral of the teaching profession and improving the quality of education within the education system. This demonstrates more clearly than ever that once again we have a party in opposition which not only has no education policy, because all we know from the Opposition in relation to government schools is that basically it wants to get out of that area, but also has no wages policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has no conception of the way in which one can bring about improvements in the wages and salaries of the Australian work force in the context of trying to improve the way in which the job is done. We just have this glib and totally destructive suggestion from the Opposition that if one can force the work force into some changed conduct or behaviour, that is the way one is going to bring about the difficult process of reform.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, page B105. Senator Evans said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I think it is an unfair question to the officers. I will describe my own state of mind. My own state of mind was that, after the weekend and a combination of circumstances that had developed over the weekend, by that time it was in the best interests of the Department and Australia's national interest abroad that there be a resignation in the decorous way that the resignation was in fact conducted, simply because it was manifestly going to be very difficult in purely physical terms for Mr Burke to devote the time necessary for the job; because the nature of the material that was out on the public record by then was such that it was unquestionably likely to generate a much greater degree of media attention in Dublin than had been the case previously, thus creating some difficulties in terms of that other criterion I mentioned in the Parliament some days earlier; and, generally, because any arrangement that involved an open-ended extension of special leave and so on to enable Mr Burke to stay in Australia to deal with these matters would have created, over time, an unsatisfactory situation in terms of the handling of the job in Dublin.</PARA>
<PARA>It is all very well to do it on a two-, three- or four-month basis with the charge d'affaires, but clearly it was important that the situation be resolved in a way that had a greater degree of clarity and certainty about it with a finite timeframe around it. For all those reasons, I formed the judgment by Monday that it was probably appropriate that this course be taken. For that reason, I responded favourably to the judgment the Department made that the resignation should be treated, in effect, similarly in terms of its consequences, as a termination. I think it was a proper judgment to make in those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hill then interjected:</PARA>
<PARA>You therefore reached the stage that, if Mr Burke had not resigned, his contract would have been terminated and thus you would have been obliged to pay this sum of money.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Banks for his question and recognise in the question his concern for the people in the western suburbs, particularly his electorate. Because of the pollution in western Sydney his concern is shared by many other honourable members on this side of the House. I note also with concern the New South Wales Government's response, so-called, to the concerns that have been expressed by many thousands of people who are suffering as a result of this pollution. Claims have been made by Mr Moore, the New South Wales Minister for the Environment, that the pollution was due to unique seasonal factors. But, worse, Mr Peter Collins, the New South Wales Minister for Health, now claims that there is no link between Sydney's air pollution and asthma. That was clearly expressed in his press conference yesterday when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The message must go out, that whatever problems may be caused by the pollution, and certainly nobody in Sydney would take any joy from the pollution we've suffered over the last couple of days-whatever those problems, they do not exacerbate asthma. I would have no hesitation as Health Minister to state that publicly . . . asthma is not related to pollution, it's related to other factors.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think many people would really believe that. If Mr Greiner or Mr Collins need any more evidence of why they should take firm action, they should only heed the advice of their own Health Department. The deputy chief health officer of the Health Department of New South Wales, Dr Gavin Frost, said in March that high incidence of photochemical smog worsened chest infections, particularly over winter. He said it was worse for people who had chronic lung diseases such as asthma and bronchitis and as pollution worsened so did the effect on the lungs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Only today there are reports of a study from the University of Birmingham where evidence shows a clear link between smog and respiratory diseases. It is not good enough for the New South Wales Government to say that it will do something after the election. The New South Wales Government has known for a long time that air pollution in Sydney's western suburbs is among the worst in Australia. That was clearly indicated in a leaked report from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in March this year. That report recommended a major reassessment of housing development plans for the west and the south-west of Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That CSIRO report also clearly found that the State Pollution Control Commission had severely underestimated pollution levels for years. It is very clear that the real issue here is the inability of the New South Wales Government to address the design and make-up of our cities as well as the pollution levels. It is also now clear that the health status of families is affected by the design of our cities. What is needed is an integrated approach to build better cities. The basis of that approach is better data and better monitoring, particularly of environmental health indicators. In New South Wales we have to look more closely at the planning of housing, transport and employment needs to make this data work.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Carr has demanded a halt to north-west development until the Greiner Government can actually tell the people what is the cost of pollution and what are the effects that it has on health. The New South Wales Government cannot even begin to make that assessment until it deals with the matter of underestimation of pollution control. There are four million people in Sydney who need more than empty promises of a meeting or summit after an election. They want action now.</PARA>

<PARA>Is that not a terrible thing? This is what he had done-he had played an important role in Western Australia's success in developing markets in all those countries. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>* It has been essentially as a result of Mr Hancock's efforts that Australian exports to Romania have grown so rapidly in recent years and there are good prospects for substantial sales of iron ore to Czechoslovakia and Hungary as well. The Soviet Union has also been discussing possible involvement in the development and processing of iron ore and manganese deposits in WA.</PARA>
<PARA> - Mr Hancock has set up a company together with BHP, the Eastern Pilbara Iron Ore Company Pty Ltd, to service these potential markets.</PARA>
<PARA>* As you know, Mr Hancock has an aversion to the involvement of Government (Federal or State) in his business dealings. The fact that Mr Burke was an exception for Mr Hancock in this regard and Mr Burke's own policy of keeping the Federal Government informed of important developments in Western Australia's trade relations with Eastern Europe have been invaluable for this Department.</PARA>
<PARA>There is the assessment with regard to what had happened-it was invaluable for this Department. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>2. Mr Burke has expressed his interest in maintaining some involvement in Eastern European trade matters. He believes there could be occasions in the future when his past contacts could be helpful in promoting particular projects or commercial deals.</PARA>
<PARA>* He stresses that any such involvement would be infrequent (he anticipates travelling to Eastern Europe once or twice each year) and only in response to specific requests from commercial or other interests.</PARA>
<PARA>3. We consider that some form of ongoing involvement by Mr Burke in Eastern European trade matters could indeed prove beneficial. His contacts could help provide continued high-level access to decision-makers in those countries and it seems likely that Mr Hancock, in particular, would welcome it.</PARA>
<PARA>There is the positive, but what do we get quoted? The next bit, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>4. On the negative side, the arrangement would be unusual and not in accord with traditional diplomatic practice.</PARA>
<PARA>That is all we have had read. Paragraph 4 continues as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Burke is accredited as Ambassador to Ireland and The Holy See. There are other Australian Ambassadors accredited to Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and the USSR who are responsible for the development of political and commercial relations with their countries of accreditation. Involvement of Mr Burke could impact on their credibility with host Governments. Should Mr Burke be involved, he could not be regarded as Ambassador but ``official of the Australian Government'' with all the implications of such status.</PARA>
<PARA>* We consider, however-</PARA>
<PARA>having put the positive, the negative follows-</PARA>
<PARA> that because of his past position Mr Burke could make a special contribution to Australia's trade with East Europe and that given the size of the potential trade involved this unusual arrangement would be justified, particularly since any visits to East Europe would be occasional and for very specific purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>5. In the interests of sound policy formulation, we would ask Mr Burke to clear with us and the relevant Australian Embassy in advance any proposed travel or other initiative. Any travel would be subject to funds being available and Commonwealth responsibility would be limited to travel by Mr Burke alone.</PARA>
<PARA>6. Mr Burke has sought approval to agree to a request from Mr Hancock that he join Mr Hancock in Geneva on 12 September for a meeting with Soviet representatives on various commercial prospects.</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>Unless you see any reasons against, that Mr Burke be advised that his proposal for his continued involvement in relevant trade matters relating to Eastern Europe and the USSR is acceptable, on the basis of the conditions listed above.</PARA>
<PARA>It then has the notation of the Minister as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>A difficult and sensitive one. Mr Burke rang me about this today. Agree on the basis proposed, and on the basis that our local reps are not only contacted for advance clearance, but also kept informed of progress of his activities and interests.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WD4">Ms FATIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I was disappointed this morning to see the editorial in today's Australian. Far from being an intrusion into couples' private lives, as is stated in the editorial, the Bittman research is consistent with our obligations under the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention 156, `Workers With Family Responsibilities'. Honourable members on the other side might groan, but it really is quite significant to a number of people and their lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's ratification of ILO 156 came into effect on 30 March this year. Arising out of this ratification, Australia has a commitment to enable workers with family responsibilities who are employed or who wish to be employed to do so without discrimination and, as far as possible, without conflict with their family responsibilities. The study Juggling Time, which I launched in Sydney on Monday of this week, looks at the relationship between women's paid employment and their unpaid work in the home. One of its most significant findings is that women do 70 per cent of the unpaid work in the home and that, regardless of how many paid hours of work women do, men's contribution in the home remains the same. Also, when a woman marries, her workload increases by 60 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The editorial also criticises the practice of targeting prenatal classes to stimulate greater discussion and planning about working families sharing responsibilities. The study reveals that a new mother's hours of unpaid work increase by 91 per cent after the birth of her first child-that is, 56 hours per week-while, correspondingly, on average new fathers do not increase their workload at all. If that mother is in the work force, she begins to share that incredible load that comes upon her at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly important that patterns of sharing are established at the time of the first child. The study is a small part of the Government's community education campaign aimed at encouraging greater opportunities for women and men to combine successfully family and work. In particular, the campaign focuses on the double load women workers with family responsibilities face due to the inequitable division of domestic labour. The education campaign aims for long term change. The Government supports and encourages the recognition of all unpaid work done in the home. We want the community to hear about different models of distribution of unpaid work. It wants to encourage sharing of household responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is looking at a wide range of measures to assist workers with family responsibilities. If we do not address the issue of women's double load, such pressures will take their toll by affecting the quality of family life, the health and well-being of women and their employment opportunities and social choices.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that the call by the honourable member for Tangney for the expulsion of a member comes strangely from a party which is supposed to extol the principles of allowing some divergence of opinion within a party organisation. May I say-and I say this directly to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie-that I was deeply disappointed when I had brought to my attention within the last couple of days the letter which he sent out on this matter because he is saying that the policy of the Government in regard to immigration is something with which he disagrees. I am disappointed in that because I believe the immigration policy of the Government, both now and from the time it has been in office, is an appropriate one; I think it is a correct policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that in some discussion I will seek to have with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie I will be able to persuade him of the error of his assessment. I do not think that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would claim that he is infal- lible. Some of my colleagues on the front bench doubt that. I have found that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is capable of being persuaded to another point of view, and I will attempt to do it. As far as I am concerned, we are proud of the immigration policy that we have adopted.</PARA>
<PARA> Generally speaking, in regard to the area of immigration, with some exceptions that I would rather forget, there has been broadly a bipartisan position, which in this country is as it should be. In that regard, we have attempted since 1983, when we have had the responsibility for this important strand of decision making that affects not just now, but the very future fabric of our country, to blend into those decisions the appropriate considerations which go, as you know, Mr Speaker, to, firstly, what is the economic capacity of the country to absorb a given level of intake. That must always be a relevant consideration. We have taken that into account. Then the various elements are, as you know, Mr Speaker, the question of building up the skill levels in this country, the question of family reunion, the question of bringing in particular skills in the business area and, of course, always throughout the program, a very strong humanitarian component which has-I pay tribute to the other side-been a measure of the policy of those opposite as well as ours.</PARA>
<PARA> In this area, when we try to blend all those components to get a total aggregate figure for the annual intake, it is inevitable that there can be differences of opinion as to whether it is exactly right. Men and women of goodwill can have different views and different positions as to whether they have it exactly right. I reject the assessment that has been made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. As I say, I will attempt in conversation to persuade him of the error of his ways.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Community Services and Health aware that the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne has closed down its outpatient clinic and, in its stead, opened a number of private clinics, so that now patients who were formerly public patients are forced to be private patients and have to claim their treatment through Medicare? Is this a case of cost shifting? If so, what does the Government intend to do about it?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3241" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the policy adopted by the Royal Children's Hospital to impose charges for many of the outpatient services provided by the hospital. This move by the Royal Children's Hospital is, in my view, a blatant piece of cost shifting, an attempt by the hospital to get the Commonwealth to pick up the tab for its patients by forcing them to become private patients and claim on Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following discussions between my Department and Victorian health officials, I understand that the Victorian officials, recognising that it may be a breach of the Medicare hospital agreement between the Commonwealth and Victoria, are taking up the matter with the hospital. There is no doubt in my mind that the practice proposed by the hospital is a breach of the Medicare agreement in that Victoria is not maintaining the outpatient services it undertook to maintain when it signed the Medicare agreement in 1989. Accordingly, unless Victoria ensures that the hospital rectifies this breach promptly, the Federal Government will have no alternative but to invoke the penalty provisions of the Medicare agreement-in this case an appropriate deduction of Victoria's base funding grant equivalent to the costs of the transfer to Commonwealth outlays through increased Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth contributes something of the order of $3.5 billion each year to the nation's health system. That is done on the basis of principles which have been agreed to between the Commonwealth and the States. They are agreements that are capable of review; indeed, in terms of the current national health strategy, again on the basis of some consultation with the States, there is determination to address any issues that may exist around questions of hospital funding.</PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that what is proposed by the Royal Children's Hospital is really privatisation. Essentially, privatisation is not only a shifting of the cost, in this case from the State to the Commonwealth, but essentially in principle an attempt to shift from the Government a cost across to the family.</PARA>
<PARA> That is why, when I referred to the Opposition yesterday, I did not do it lightly. The reality is that when the Leader of the Opposition said, as he said clearly in a press conference the other day, that `in principle personal financial responsibility originating with a family and targeting of welfare are key elements of our approach', he was making a serious point. He was entitled to be taken seriously, because philosophically what he was suggesting was that privatisation is at the heart of Opposition policy. Of course, going with privatisation, when that becomes the heart of the policy, certain consequences follow. In the same press conference, the Leader of the Opposition referred to $3 billion worth of cuts, a billion from welfare, and presumably additional cuts in terms of health.</PARA>

The Royal Children's Hospital proposes effectively to privatise its outpatients, that is, to shift essentially towards families' responsibility in terms of health care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The day before yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition indicated that that was fundamental to his understanding of what the Opposition's policy was all about, that is, that shift to family responsibility. It goes with that proposition that, if that objective is to be achieved, then clearly the overall level of expenditure will not be sustained. What the Leader of the Opposition indicated was that it was his intention to cut-and that was made clear during the last election-something of the order of $3 billion out of the expenditure, so that privatisation and then that commitment to make--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing order 145 says that an answer shall be relevant to the question. The point I wish to make to you, Mr Speaker, is that the question was a specific one relating to activities at a hospital in Victoria, and the Minister was asked whether he felt that that activity was a shift of expenditure responsibility from that hospital to the Commonwealth Government. We have now had a lecture about some shift of responsibility onto families. Since when has the Commonwealth Government been a family? I suggest to you that he is not relevant in answering the question and that, if he is unable to be so, you must ask him to bring his answer to a close.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that anywhere else except in this chamber the Opposition is prepared to defend propositions such as privatisation, $3 billion worth of cuts and a consumption tax. It is my view that those three elements are the essence of the Opposition's social policy. I think it is not unreasonable to refer to them as I see them. In the case of the Royal Children's Hospital, it is a move essentially to privatise. Frankly, if the Opposition was capable of getting out a single policy in the area of social policy, we could debate it in this Parliament. But as it is incapable of reaching agreement between its four previous spokespersons, we can only intuit what its policy is: the Opposition is simply incapable of arguing it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether it will come as a surprise or not to the honourable gentleman when I say no, I did not hear the program. I do not particularly go out of my way to chase up the statements of Senator Walsh. I intend no particular disrespect to the honourable senator in saying that. In all the things I do have to read, that is really not near the top of my priority list.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The substance of the question from the honourable member, however, is to do with the decision with regard to Kakadu and the report we have from the Resource Assessment Commission. Because I think the honourable gentleman is serious about the substance of his question, let me say that obviously we will be studying that final report of the Resource Assessment Commission very closely with a view to making a decision on that matter by early next month.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not going to be something that will be delayed for a long period, but I would hope the honourable gentleman would agree that the issues involved are of very considerable importance. It does seem to me from the way that he framed his question that he thinks there is only one consideration involved, and that is: what is available to Australia in terms of earnings from what can be produced out of a mine at Coronation Hill?</PARA>
<PARA> I happen to believe that is an important consideration, but I also happen to believe that there are other considerations that have properly to be taken into account. There are the considerations of the attitudes and the beliefs of the Aboriginal people in the area. There is the question of the possible adverse environmental impact of mining there. I am quite prepared to say to the honourable gentleman that I have not made up my mind on this issue. I believe that the strands of issues have to be taken into account. I do assert that there is more than the one consideration that has to be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA> If that was the only consideration involved, there would be no need for a Resource Assessment Commission and an ecologically sustainable development process, but life is not as simple as that. I believe that the people of Australia do not want this Government simply to approach these issues with a one-dimensional view. I do not think the people of Australia take the attitude that all that the Government has to do is to look at some balance sheet and say, `Yes, if you dig up here or if you cut down there, there at the bottom of that line is a figure'. They certainly want us to take those things into account, and we will, but we will also take into account the other relevant considerations. We will make what I would regard as a decision within a reasonable amount of time, taking all of those factors into account, by the beginning of next month.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question and for his interest in Antarctica. In fact, he went to Antarctica earlier this year. In the House yesterday the Prime Minister gave details of the very considerable progress being made towards achieving this comprehensive protection of the areas of Antarctica. I want to join in with my congratulations on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not only will mining be prohibited, but also the proposed protocol will greatly enhance our obligations as Treaty partners to the protection of that environment of Antarctica. The draft protocol provides for science research to have priority over other activities permitted in Antarctica, but it will impose upon us very considerable obligations in relation to the protection of the environment and we will have to go through environmental assessments.</PARA>
<PARA> There will be three stages of assessment. One of them is an informal process which will operate on proposals which will have little or no impact on the environment; then there will be a more detailed proposal that would operate for proposals which would have minor or transitory impact; but activities involving the highest risk to the environment will be scrutinised by an international committee for environmental protection.</PARA>
<PARA> This draft protocol, in fact, refers to mining in only a few lines, but it also has a number of annexures which deserve consideration by all members of this House because they impose further obligations upon us. They not only outline the environmental impact procedures, but also state the obligations in relation to conservation of flora and fauna in terms of marine pollution, and waste minimisation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I seek on behalf of the House some information from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) in relation to the remainder of this session. According to the published information, after this week there are three scheduled sitting weeks. I would like an indication from the Minister as to how much legislation is yet to be introduced to be dealt with during the remainder of the session and, if there is an inordinate amount of legislation to be introduced, rather than resorting to using the guillotine as he has done on previous occasions will he arrange for the House to sit longer so that we can deal with the legislation in an appropriate way?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we will probably do both. We cannot foreshadow exactly the situation in which we will find ourselves. Obviously there may be some advantages in having an extended guillotine that allows fairly full debate but still keeps matters batting up to the Senate at a reasonable pace. I think the Macklin motion cuts in on 7 June. Therefore we do have to clear an awful lot before 7 June.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the honourable member's description of our having messed it up again, let me go through a couple of reasons why it is, because I agree that we have had to operate a guillotine very heavily. There are several reasons for this and it is worthwhile contemplating them. I have attempted an analysis of them and we find ourselves, in terms of preparation of legislation, in a position not much different from that of the Opposition when it was in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are sitting as many days as we did when the Opposition was in government and this year, on the scheduled timetable and the likely additions as we come back to deal with the Senate, we will probably sit a good deal more than its average. The point is this: since we started this two-week on, two-week off formula and added to it private members' Thursday we have substantially deprived Government-and rightly-of a considerable amount of control of the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> In previous times, the tendency was to get one of the two Thursdays partially devoted in the morning to private members' business, with the other Thursday available for General Business when motions could be considered for part of the morning. The generality was that at the beginning of the sessions those motions were entertained. Towards the end of the sessions, they were dispensed with. </PARA>
<PARA> My firm conviction is that we should not do that. The reform that we have introduced, which gives over control of this Parliament from 9.30 a.m. until 2 p.m. every Thursday, should not be interfered with by the Executive and honourable members should be allowed to continue to have that time. It makes an enormous dent, if we look at past practice as opposed to past opportunity-effectively close to a day a fortnight-on the time available to debate legislation in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member does not agree with me, he should do his own analysis. It amounts to about one day a fortnight on which we could try to debate and deal with matters in this place. That accumulates over the period of time that we sit-we normally sit for about 10 weeks-effectively to an extra week and a bit that would otherwise be available to Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, there was the regular suspension of the 11 o'clock rule under the Opposition's particular mode of practice. In those days, in a four-week period, there were nine days of sittings, albeit for shorter hours, as opposed to what is effectively, under us, seven days of sittings with longer hours. When honourable members opposite had nine days of sittings with shorter hours of course they were in a much better position to extend those out to lengthy days. That is the situation in which we find ourselves in the control of our business. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that honourable members will want to consider this from time to time in the future, if that is how they want their business conducted. In my opinion, there is no doubt that both the General Business Thursday and the two weeks on, two weeks off with longer hours as opposed to three weeks on with allegedly shorter hours, but which often ended up as longer hours, does in fact enable the average member of parliament to devote a great deal more time to his duties. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem that we confront with the guillotine is not solely a product of a problem common to most governments, that is, draftsmen in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel insisting on holidays-and it is not terribly easy to recruit to the Office, with the current comparison of Public Service and legal salaries-but involves the enormous difficulty in operating now without a guillotine. That difficulty is further impacted on by the practice over the last few years of operating the Macklin proposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that we can fit any extra sittings in between now and when the Macklin proposition applies. We will have to get a deal of legislation through. I am not sure how many Bills remain, but it is a substantial number and there are more, on average, than we are now dealing with in a week. There is no doubt about that at all. Therefore, the likelihood of a guillotine is substantial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The likelihood of us being called back to deal with subsequent consideration of that material when it comes back to us from the Senate is very high. I would anticipate that occurring somewhere in June or-although I would try to avoid this and a lot will depend on the Senate-perhaps even in July. I know that will not be a terribly popular decision with members, but it may be necessary, determined by how the Senate chooses to deal with our legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, I ask the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) whether he would ascertain for the House the number of Bills that are yet to be introduced. He has indicated that there is a considerable number, but that he does not know how many. It would be helpful to the House to be informed, say, tomorrow of the number of Bills yet to be introduced and dealt with before the House rises for the winter recess.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, I would like quickly to make the point in this debate, because it is an issue that concerns me, that every year, irrespective of the party in political power, we run into this log jam of legislation at the end of a session. I happen to hold the view that it is a bureaucratic conspiracy that neither the Government nor the Opposition is given the time by the departments to properly consider the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the last two or three weeks that we have been sitting, we have dealt with very little legislation because legislation has not been in the House. I put it to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and to those on my side of politics that it is time that we changed that rule and told the bureaucracy to get its legislation in place for the beginning of the session so that it is possible for the Government, the Opposition and the people of Australia to have a good look at it, and then allocate what is appropriate time to speak to it. We have recently had 20 or 30 speakers for quite small pieces of legislation and at the end will get one or two speakers for quite serious legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is time to bring out the facts rather than the fiction associated with the Coronation Hill project, and I bring forward this matter of public importance to do so on the basis that many facets must be taken into account in obtaining the right decision from the Government-the decision to proceed with the Coronation Hill project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I bring forward this matter of public importance supported by my colleagues in the Liberal and National parties, and particularly by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), who will go into more details in respect of the important Aboriginal aspects which pertain to the Coronation Hill project. The coalition has always recognised that they are very important Aboriginal aspects which should be seen in perspective and properly dealt with. I have every confidence that the honourable member for Chisholm will detail that agenda in his supporting remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> In turning to the facts, let us begin with fact No. 1. Coronation Hill is not a greenfield mining site. It has been mined repeatedly before. There have been mines operating in 12 different locations in the vicinity of Coronation Hill. That includes workings on Coronation Hill itself and nearby El Sharana. For a period of about 10 years mining proceeded from one end of Coronation Hill, which included the extraction of some 25,000 tonnes of ore from the old Coronation Hill, or part thereof, disturbing a surface area of something a great deal less than a quarter of the Parliamentary Triangle. So honourable members might get it in correct perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> The new mine-the Coronation Hill project now proposed-would involve an area of surface disturbance of about one square kilometre, located again at Coronation Hill. It will be many kilometres from the northern wetlands area and important and sensitive parts of the Kakadu National Park, including the Jim Jim Falls, Obiri Rock and other areas that are in Kakadu National Park proper. </PARA>
<PARA> One can understand why the public is confused about the Coronation Hill project. Every time it comes up on television we see footage of areas a great distance from the Coronation Hill project, far beyond the conservation zone relating to those beautiful and delightful scenes that exist. Those who have had the privilege of going to the northern parts of Kakadu National Park would have seen that they are delightful scenes. They should be in a national park; they are in a national park. Coronation Hill has nothing to do with that particular agenda. I say loudly and clearly: let us get fact No. 1 established-it is not a greenfield mining site; it has been mined and explored by degrees before. Some 12 mines have operated in the area, with thousands of tonnes of ore being extracted. All of that has happened without, as luck would have it, any great and untoward disasters occurring. Quite the contrary, it has proceeded without great damage to the environment or to the spiritual well-being of Australians in the area and beyond. When we see the issue in that perspective perhaps we can then start to examine the true value of this Coronation Hill project. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us move on to fact No. 2. It has now been verified several times that the Coronation Hill mine will have little impact on the environment. I quote from the Resource Assessment Commission report:</PARA>
<PARA>A single mine, properly managed and monitored, would have a small and geographically limited direct impact on the known biological resources of the conservation zone. </PARA>
<PARA>I further quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA>It is unlikely to have an impact on these biological resources in Kakadu National Park. </PARA>
<PARA> A single mine, such as that proposed for Coronation Hill is unlikely-</PARA>
<PARA>honourable members should note these words-</PARA>
<PARA>to present significant risks to the sustainability of the ecology of Kakadu National Park. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, on the environmental front it is clear. My colleague the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) has discussed this in more detail and will continue to do so in the effective way that he does. It has cleared the environmental hurdle not once but twice. It has cleared the Northern Territory environmental hurdles and it has gone on to clear the hurdles associated with the Federal level of government, and they are quite substantial hurdles. This is fully recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me point out to the House some of the legislation enacted just to get this project up. Honourable members might like to know that at the Commonwealth level there is a welter of Acts: the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, the Australian Heritage Commission Act, the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act, the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Amendment Act, the Lands Acquisition Act, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and World Heritage Properties Conservation Act. There are eight pieces of legislation at the Federal level before this one project can get under way. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we look at the Northern Territory level, and more than double the number of Acts are involved with this one project. Let us compare that with a lesson from Mali in western Africa where environmental considerations are taken into account as well. I refer to BHP's Syama gold project. Just note the following dates: April 1987, agreement with the Malian Government to explore the area; June 1988, reserves established; December 1988, feasibility study accepted by the Malian mines department and related environmental and other departments; February 1989, production permit approved; December 1989-2 1/2 years later-mine construction complete, and the first gold pour took place from that particular mine. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, six years later there is still no fundamental determination on Coronation Hill, although the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today has set himself a timetable. Let the House not forget it. The Prime Minister today has set himself the timetable that by early June we will have an announcement on Coronation Hill. I will remind him of that, and I remind him that the Macklin cut-in date is apparently Friday, 7 June. That now seems also to be the cut-off date for compliance with the Prime Minister's undertaking to be decisive, once and for all, on the matter of Coronation Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from the fact that the environmental hurdles have been crossed, we then have the economic facts relating to this project. The Resource Assessment Commission (RAC) keeps on speaking of a mere $82m in its failure to calculate properly. Even in accordance with the Federal Government's model, it is around $200m that is truly involved with this project, and even more than that in terms of export income. I point out to the House that there are significant resources of gold, platinum and palladium. There is also, as I am sure the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) agrees, a reasonable expectation of increased resources, as is often the case when a mine proceeds in a particular area. Significantly, it is Australia's only known substantial resource of platinum and palladium. </PARA>
<PARA> What are those two items used for? They are used in the battle to comply with standards, to make progress with regard to the world's problems associated with greenhouse gases. They are, in a sense, pro-environment products. The greenies, in their wisdom, in battling against this project and delaying it at every turn, with the complicity of members of this Government, are in fact reducing Australia's capability to produce two products-platinum and palladium-which make a positive contribution to the battle against greenhouse gases through the use of particular devices relating to motor vehicles and others. I think that is an important point. </PARA>
<PARA> On the economic front, let me make it very clear that it has been assessed by independent sources-not the companies involved, not the joint venturers-that this would generate no less than 630 new jobs nationally. Have we reached a stage where we can afford to be dismissive of 630 jobs, when we have the unemployment figures coming out tomorrow? We had a period of record unemployment and record contraction in employment, yet this Government fiddles when action is required. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that on the economic front Coronation Hill stacks up, quite apart from the environmental front and quite apart from the precedent which exists. </PARA>
<PARA> Fact No. 4 is that it is really a litmus test, notwithstanding what the Prime Minister said at the Australian Mining Industry Council dinner last week. The mining world and many others around the world are watching closely to see whether in this non-election year the Government can stay the course. The Government does not have a Federal election or a Northern Territory election to do battle with, and yet it still cannot mount the courage to proceed with a decisive decision on Coronation Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> I am drawn to some comments by Senator Walsh. I do not always agree with Senator Walsh-I can understand that the Prime Minister, who used to take a lot of notice of Senator Walsh's words, no longer hangs on his every word-but he writes a pretty tidy column in the Australian Financial Review and I am attracted to some of his comments. I am attracted to some of the comments he made last night. He said in effect that the mining industry will regard this as a litmus test. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>If after all of this time and the Government having once shifted the goal posts after the ball was kicked, as we did in 1989, if the Government does not allow Coronation Hill to proceed on the terms that I have suggested, it will be regarded as a litmus test by the mining industry, regardless of what the Prime Minister had in his mind at that time . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very clear cut statement from Senator Walsh and it is one with which I agree. The truth of the matter is that the mining network of the world is watching this decision as it is watching the uranium policy mining decision. It cannot understand Australia's illogical approach to these critical issues. It is bitterly disappointed with Australia's approach to those issues and it is massively shifting offshore with a number of key decisions: for example, where is Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd drilling this month? It is drilling in the middle of Burma-a long way from Australia-as part of a major and costly exploration program in preference to drilling somewhere else in Australia. There are still many areas of great prospectivity which we have not yet tackled in Australia which could boost our oil resources. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this is really a litmus test. This requires from the Government a positive and firm decision, and the sooner the better. The Government has delayed and delayed the decision. It has created additional hurdles. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has pointed out, the first hurdle was the Northern Territory environmental considerations. When one reads in the report and sees first-hand the extent of the damage to the country by buffaloes, as confirmed by Professor Skidmore, it really is very ordinary country. It qualified and managed to meet those criteria at the Northern Territory level. </PARA>
<PARA> The second hurdle was the Commonwealth imposition of certain environmental considerations and the RAC report process. It has even qualified on that hurdle. The third hurdle is now the Aboriginal side of the equation. I do not happen to belong to the brigade of the believers of `dig it up or cut it down'. There must be a very sensitive and careful consideration of those environmental criteria, of the Aboriginal aspects and the like. But that is no excuse for failing to reach the ultimate decision required of the Government, given all the studies that have been made into Coronation Hill and in the interests of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> It really is now or never if we want a vigorous economy, an economy where there is leadership from the Prime Minister, leadership from this Government; rather than the horrific rural economic recession we have already exacerbated by the policies of this Government, and the overall recession leading to the loss of jobs in every State at this time-more so in Victoria. It is now or never on the question of whether we are going to have an economy that progresses through this difficult and competitive decade of the 1990s; or whether we are going to revert to a cottage economy with candle power. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there is a better way forward. It requires some hard decision making by this Government, but the Government has no more excuses for not acting with regard to Coronation Hill. It has report after report on which it can base its action. It must now move quickly and make those decisions. It must bring to an end the two-year interregnum, the cynical ploy, the political posturing, involving the RAC. Act now, act quickly, act decisively in the interests of all Australians in relation to Coronation Hill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has put forward a rather tortuously expressed matter of public importance (MPI) which ends up with the words `litmus test'-I am not quite sure what of. In any case, I would like to start with a confession: I have not seen the report. I see that the Leader of the National Party has a copy and no doubt he sat up all night reading it. I grabbed a briefing as I came out of my office. I have been in Dubbo this morning. I see from the departmental briefing that the first recommendation is that the inquiry recommends that the Australian Government makes decisions relating to the use of the zone's resources as soon as possible. It looks as though the Leader of the National Party has actually read that. Today, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that we will be dealing with it as soon as possible. I do not know what point there is in the MPI.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not surprised to receive a matter of public importance on this issue. The feverish emphasis of the matter of public importance is indicative of the fever now prevalent in the Opposition ranks. Let us be perfectly clear what this matter of public importance is about. It is not about, as some members of the Opposition would have us believe, just mining. It is not even about the development of a particular mine. I know that is strange for some of the Neanderthal economists opposite, and I know it is strange for some of the thrill seekers in the press gallery. </PARA>
<PARA> The real issue involved in this Government's consideration of mining at Coronation Hill is: how is the national interest best advanced and what are the circumstances and conditions which guarantee the advancement of the national interest? The national interest is broader than just the revenue generated by a particular project, although that is a very important consideration. The national interest is broader than just the issues of employment and investment, although these are important considerations. The national interest is broader than the environmental implications of a single project, although that is also an important consideration. The national interest is broader than the interests, in this case, of the Jawoyn people, although, to my mind, that is a critically important consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The national interest is best served by understanding, assessing and integrating all these considerations. A critical component in making a balanced, consistent and sensible decision on extraordinarily complex resource issues-issues which are more than one dimensional-has been the establishment of the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC). </PARA>
<PARA> Being instrumental in the establishment of the Resource Assessment Commission, I can honestly tell this House that my view has never been that the RAC should take the decisions which properly are to be taken by government. Rather, the RAC's whole function and purpose is to provide the Government with a fulsome analysis on environmental, cultural, social, industrial, economic or other aspects of resources and their uses. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the Leader of the National Party when he talks about the fact that the general public has been hoodwinked to some degree. When we get a Coronation Hill story on the television, we see some footage of these beautiful areas-policy by pictures and slogans. Many people have been into that for a long time in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I also agree with the Leader of the National Party when he says that this area has been mined before. I will just make two very important qualifications. An area does not have to be beautiful to be of environmental value. One of the side benefits in the RAC studies of this area has been the studies done by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation on wildlife and parrots. There is a lot in that area that is of supreme environmental quality. The other qualification is that because an area has been mined it does not necessarily-I emphasise the word `necessarily'-mean that it should continue to be mined. Let us be quite precise about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I must emphasise that the establishment of the RAC will not and cannot lead to decisions made independently of the Cabinet process. Governments make decisions on the basis of the best possible information. The RAC was set up to assemble information which should not be challengeable regardless of where a particular public attitude is coming from. We have the paradigm of economics and the paradigm of ecology. That is what the RAC has been set up to do. It is my view that it will achieve that status and the standing that the Industry Commission has achieved through the enormous role it has played in industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In this view I differ profoundly from the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who formed the view in the second reading debate on the Resource Assessment Commission Bill 1989 that the establishment of the RAC would usurp the responsibility of government. I have never been of that view. </PARA>
<PARA> It is sensible to remind the House of the policy principles which will guide the operation of the RAC. These principles are: firstly, there should be an integrated approach to conservation and development by taking both aspects into account at an early stage. Secondly, resource use decisions should seek to optimise the net benefits to the community from the nation's resources having regard to efficiency of resource use, environmental considerations and an equitable distribution of the return on resources. Thirdly, Commonwealth decisions, policies and management regimes may provide for additional uses that are compatible with the primary purpose values of the area, recognising that in some cases both conservation and development interests can be accommodated concurrently or sequentially, and in other cases choices must be made between alternative uses or combinations of uses. </PARA>
<PARA> Those principles have not changed. Rather, they have been put into effect in a proper and serious fashion by the Government when it decided to refer the Coronation Hill issue to the RAC. It is crystal clear to me, although obviously not to the Opposition, that complex issues require detailed analysis. That is why the RAC was established. That is why the issue of mining at Coronation Hill was referred to the RAC. That is why the Government now is in a position where the issue, for so long a contentious and divisive issue, can be resolved in a concrete, substantial and final way. That is the Government's approach. We believe in open inquiry. We believe in testing arguments against analysis. We believe in receiving and listening to the best possible advice. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that is difficult for the Opposition to comprehend. The Opposition, holding as it does to the Neanderthal school of economics, believes in none of these principles that I have just enunciated. Therefore, I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that the Leader of the National Party misses the point completely in his wording of the matter of public importance. He refers to the lengthy politicisation and `procrastinisation'-I think that is a new word-over this important project. He completely misses the point. Detailed analysis is not procrastination. Detailed analysis is not politicisation. It is a new-found habit, apparently, of the Leader of the National Party to detract from and deride the serious work done by serious professional officers of the Commonwealth Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> He recently said that, if this is the best that could be produced by the bureaucrats from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the Australian Wool Corporation and the International Wool Secretariat, then perhaps a 15 per cent reduction in the size and salaries of the bureaucracy was needed, attacking people who cannot hit back. He made that clear in a more recent radio show, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I'm not reaching a viewpoint that there is another agenda operating out of Canberra out of the bureaucracies of Canberra, indeed perhaps even Minister Kerin to somehow bring about a greed of agony and adjustment in the bush at far too faster rate and this wool plan yesterday is an example of that. </PARA>
<PARA>Maybe he has covered himself, but I think he is attacking bureaucrats. Attacking bureaucrats is an ugly habit and it does him no credit whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> What he is suggesting is that the efforts of professional scientists, economists, biologists and geologists are merely procrastination. I reject that implication. The reason I reject it is the reason which has been a guiding principle to me in approaching policy issues. That principle has been that facts and analysis beat the socks off prejudice and ill-thought through opinion. I enjoin the Leader of the National Party to adopt that principle as a matter of habit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Resource Assessment Commission has presented the Commonwealth with a series of options. They are, firstly, mining to proceed at Coronation Hill and the remainder of the conservation zone to become part of Kakadu National Park; second, mining to proceed at Coronation Hill and the remainder of the conservation zone to remain a conservation zone, but no further mineral exploration to be permitted until experience at Coronation Hill has been evaluated; third, mining to proceed at Coronation Hill and further mineral exploration to be permitted in the remainder of the conservation zone, with any proposals for additional mines to include assessments of the cumulative, cultural and environmental impacts of such proposals, assessment of their economic significance and evaluation of experience at Coronation Hill; fourth, mining not to proceed at Coronation Hill, but further mineral exploration to be permitted in the remainder of the conservation zone, with any proposals for mining to be considered when more detailed information is available about the mineral resources of the zone, including assessments of the impact of such proposals on the cultural and natural environment and assessment of their economic significance; fifth, mining and exploration not to be permitted at Coronation Hill or elsewhere in the conservation zone-the whole of the zone to become part of the Kakadu National Park; sixth, no mining or exploration in the conservation zone unless Aboriginal custodians request it; and, lastly, the conservation zone to remain a conservation zone, but no further exploration or mining to be permitted until the outcome of the Kakadu stage 3 land claim is known. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the seven options put before us, and there is also a series of recommendations that I do not have time to read into Hansard. But these are very sensible recommendations. After all this inquiry, if one looks at these recommendations and the knowledge behind them, one will see, I think, that the RAC is well on the way to becoming a body that is going to soon have the sort of status in Australian policy making that I have always hoped that it would achieve. It is setting forward clear options. Some of those options could be boiled down so that we could be looking at three or four options. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister says that we will be looking at this, probably in June. We are picking up the first recommendation, which is:</PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry recommends the Australian Government make decisions relating to the use of the zone's resources as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister said that we will. In addition, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) has received an Aboriginal heritage report on the Kakadu conservation zone by Mr Justice Stewart. The two reports will be considered in tandem by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us make it clear that this discussion will not set the future parameters for future Government policy in relation to mining projects or other issues. The issues central to Coronation Hill-environmental, economic and Aboriginal issues-simply do not apply to the overwhelming majority of mining projects in this country. That is why I reject the argument that Coronation Hill should be considered as a litmus test for the future of mining development in this country, if that is the sort of litmus test that the Leader of the National Party is referring to. That is also the reason why I reject the efforts by the Leader of the National Party to portray it as such. </PARA>
<PARA> The leaders and the decision makers of the mining industry understand these issues better than does the Leader of the National Party. They will continue to make their commercial decisions on the basis of commercial returns. They will continue to assess world markets, world prices, the cost of investment and the cost of production. That, more than anything else, will drive development in the mineral sector in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that all industries have to adjust to the legitimate concerns of the community to deal with environmental issues. That is why we now have the ecologically sustainable development process, and that is something for the long term. That is something in which all groups are participating, and participating constructively and competently. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who believes that the attitudes of Australians are unchanging about the environment and resource use is, quite frankly, a mug. Australians want a clean environment. They want a legacy to be left for their children. If it is not believed that attitudes have not changed, talk to anyone under 30 today. They do not want to see the practices of the past continued as though the practices of the past were perfectly satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been among this Government's achievements that it has administered economic, resources, rural and environmental policy with a view to the long term. The decision which this Government will take on Coronation Hill will be seen within that context. It will be taken with a view to the long term. It will be taken after the most exhaustive analysis, and it will be right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Coronation Hill is insignificant geographically, so much so that it hardly rates a mention on any map of the Northern Territory. Yet this insignificant geographical site has been catapulted into public prominence because of dithering, duplicity and political expediency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this matter of public importance I am going to develop two points. The first is that this decision, which comes to us now after a delay of two years simply because of political expediency before the last election, has the potential to stop any mining project anywhere in Australia under section 10(4) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. Secondly, this duplicity, this dithering and this political expediency have been at the expense of the Jawoyn Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA> The view I will expand on is based very firmly on the belief that, in remote and much of rural Australia, the only opportunity the majority of Aboriginal people have for any sort of independent economic future, free of welfare dependency, is through the benefits that mining will bring their communities. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point I want to make is the effect of section 10(4) of the report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) by Mr Justice Stewart. To get the full sense of this, we really have to compare the two reports. The Resource Assessment Commission report is a lengthy document which canvasses all the views and could even be called balanced. The second report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is quite different. It is hardline, it is in totally different language and it is very explicit. The two are quite inconsistent with each other. </PARA>
<PARA> The report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs says that the conservation zone could be put in danger even by putting it in the national park, and this would be against the Act. Mr Justice Stewart has broken totally new ground because, essentially, what he is saying is that a significant or sacred site can be defined very, very broadly. This was never the intention of the original Act. In the second reading speech of the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), when he introduced the legislation seven years ago, he said quite specifically:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill speaks of significant Aboriginal areas and defines area to include a site. The use of the word area rather than site will allow flexibility . . . . It is not meant to close off a huge area and will not be administered in that way. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet what we have here from the report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is the very clear implication that the entire Sickness Country, an area of 3,500 to 4,000 square kilometres, is out of bounds. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members think this is a one-off situation, that there will be no further Bula sites around Australia, and that Aboriginal culture operates in a vacuum and is a static quantity that does not change over time, they are very wrong, because the interpretation of this Act means that any area of significance, no matter how trivial to Aboriginal people, can be declared a sacred site. No-one denies that sites associated with ceremonies or traditional customs still used today, and areas adjacent to and associated with those sacred sites, are of profound importance to Aboriginal people and must be offered protection. An example known to anyone visiting the escarpment at Kakadu is Mount Brockman. The operators of the Ranger uranium mine nearby know that uranium is there and say quite openly that it will never be mined. </PARA>
<PARA> The notion of Sickness Country, which has only come into the custody of the Jawoyn people this century, probably late this century, and the notion of the gold being the blood of Bula-a notion that is not even a decade old-show that Aboriginal tradition is in a constantly changing state of flux. So, firstly, by defining the Act so broadly as to include anything and, secondly, by having no particular reference point in time for the Act to apply means that over time, even over very short spaces of time, changes can occur in response to pressures on Aboriginal people and those changes can alter the entire playing field for one of our most important industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has totally missed the point that, if one procrastinates, dithers and takes years to come to a clear position, Aboriginal tradition and culture can change even in that time. Attitudes will harden and pressures will be brought to bear on Aboriginal people that may totally change the whole scene in just a couple of years. That is what has happened here. The interim report of Mr Justice Stewart was quite inadequate when it described the contradictions in evidence from Jawoyn people as being both minute and apparent. He left those two words out of his final report. </PARA>
<PARA> His contradictions include such things as the fact that six years ago two of the three senior elders were as strongly pro-mining as they are today anti-mining and that in 1985 the most senior traditional elder said to Bob Ellis of the Sacred Sites Protection Authority, when taken aside, that mining could still go ahead. In 1968, when the sacred sites were first signposted to protect them, the Aboriginal people did not even bother to go up the valley where Coronation Hill existed, because there was nothing there. The contradictions were neither minute nor apparent. But it is not the nature of the contradictions I am concerned about, because people have the right to change their minds over time. I am concerned that this whole process over a prolonged period has hardened attitudes rather than seeking to resolve the differences, and all this has been caused by simple inactivity and procrastination. </PARA>
<PARA> This was put very well by the Australian Labor Party senator from the Northern Territory, Bob Collins, who stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It is with some resignation that I note that the debate on this matter is proceeding along familiar lines. The environment groups have formed a formal alliance with the Jawoyn working party. This alliance has simply confirmed that the groups will accept no quarter on the issue. There will be no tacit support from these groups for any compromise solution, nor did I ever think there could be. The key players who are now running this debate are well known to me. A small number of them are consummate ratbags. All of them are running on an agenda that has nothing whatever to do with the long term interests of the Jawoyn community. The Jawoyn people are simply convenient cannon fodder for them in this battle and they will happily fight it down to the last Aborigine. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a senator and Minister from the Government's own Party. Then, in recent days, he expanded on the pressure put on Jawoyn people by this dithering and delaying on the Government's side of politics. On the issue of pressure, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Pressure is always applied, consciously or unconsciously, when people raise the mining issue in discussion with Aboriginal people . . . The commission is happy to accept it has got a splinter of the true cross, in terms of information, while considering of little significance the information obtained by-</PARA>
<PARA>other people. He pointed out that the Jawoyn people in recent years have been under increasing `pressure' from the anti-mining green lobby. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is damned in Justice Stewart's own report. On page 159 of that report, he states:</PARA>
<PARA>The past and future role of Commonwealth agencies in serving the Jawoyn community may be an issue that the Australian Government will wish to consider. Within the Katherine region, initiatives under the Aboriginal Employment Development Policy seem to be having very little impact . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So for all the lofty rhetoric, the Government has failed where it really matters to the Jawoyn people. It has failed in delivering any meaningful improvement in services on the ground; it has failed in improving their quality of life in any meaningful way; it has left them to be manipulated, and to have their attitudes harden. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has now given this issue very little possibility of resolution, whereas three years ago all this could have been fixed quite simply before the attitudes had hardened. Aboriginal people can change their views over time. Anthropologist Erich Kolig has pointed out that Aborigines have shown themselves to be willing to set aside dogma in the pursuit of a better opportunity. This is a significant strand of opinion in current Jawoyn thought, so it is vital that a decision be taken quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vital that no more damage is done to Jawoyn people, and it is vital that they be allowed to talk directly to the joint venture to see whether they have any common ground in this issue. As it is now, the Government has left them exactly where they were five years ago-in poverty, dependent on welfare, with little hope and little future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of the Kakadu conservation zone first has to be understood as a particularly complex one. For an Opposition to call for a resolution and decision by the Government is a reasonable thing to ask, except that when it says it wants an answer, it means it wants an answer to go ahead and mine Coronation Hill. That is okay; that is the Opposition's point of view. But do not confuse that request with the essential request of the Government and the response by Mr Justice Stewart, which is that these matters are the various matters which must be considered in the question of whether or not mining should take place at Coronation Hill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are debating here a mine site, sitting within a conservation zone, sitting within a national park, overlaid by Aboriginal land and heritage claims. One can understand the complexity of the debate. What I wish to do is to draw to the attention of those who will read Hansard or are interested in the debate the sorts of options that Mr Justice Stewart has arrived at. They are not all yes/no options. That needs to be appreciated. There are, in essence, as the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) has pointed out, two reports under consideration by the Government. The first is a report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) on the Kakadu conservation zone, on the question most importantly of the particular significance of this site to the Aborigines-to the Jawoyn people-and Mr Justice Stewart finds:</PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, I report that the Minister could be satisfied in concluding that the area of the Conservation Zone is a significant Aboriginal area under section 10 (1) (b) (i) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government must take account of this recommendation. Much more importantly, it must take account of its own legislation. It is our legislation and we have to take account of it and make a decision within the bounds of it, otherwise we will be taken to court. </PARA>
<PARA> I note in passing that Mr Justice Stewart comments that the Jawoyn people's views had evolved to this point in time, and he notes that they may continue to evolve on the question of whether or not they would allow mining at Coronation Hill. That is the sort of question that the honourable member for Chisholm has raised and he is right to raise it. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs goes to the extent of the possible injury to, or desecration of, the area. In concluding his remarks he states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Minister could be satisfied that a threat of injury to or desecration of the Conservation Zone exists if the Commonwealth Government takes decisions that are likely to lead to one or more of the following:</PARA>
<PARA>He then talks about mineral exploration or mining occurring in the conservation zone. That is one report arising out of the Resource Assessment Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report goes to the question of options and whether or not there should be mining. There are seven options in all. I hope that people read all seven of them because three of the options talk about mining proceeding at Coronation Hill, but there are two other options which talk about stopping the mining and two further options which talk about making the mining subject to, in the first instance, the request of the Aboriginal custodians or, in the second instance, the outcome of the Kakadu stage 3 land claim. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish simply to run through the benefits and losses that occur under the most important of those seven options. The Government has before it now the best evidence possible upon which it can make a decision about the future use of the conservation zone. It needs to add weight to the evidence and it must rate the veracity of the evidence which Justice Stewart lays before the Government. He has done no more and no less than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Option A is essentially the go-ahead for mining. Justice Stewart says this about that go-ahead option:</PARA>
<PARA>Mining to proceed at Coronation Hill and the remainder of the Conservation Zone to become part of Kakadu National Park. </PARA>
<PARA>The benefits of that option are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>* National and regional economic benefits, including employment of some Aboriginal people and payment of royalties and other monies to the Jawoyn. </PARA>
<PARA>* Better understanding of the geological processes that formed the Coronation Hill ore body, possibly leading to similar discoveries elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>* Incorporation in Kakadu National Park of that part of the Zone that is of greatest archaeological and biological significance-the Scinto Plateau. </PARA>
<PARA>* Possible contribution of mining infrastructure to recreation and tourism potential of the Zone. </PARA>
<PARA>* Some tourists may visit the area to see the mine. </PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand, in this whole question of balance there are also the losses. They are:</PARA>
<PARA>* Adverse impact on the cultural and religious values of many Jawoyn people. </PARA>
<PARA>* Possible legal action over mining of a sacred site. </PARA>
<PARA>* Some recreational uses of the area may be curtailed during period of mining and some tourists could be permanently discouraged from visiting the area. </PARA>
<PARA>* Some (unquantifiable) risk associated with unknown elements of the fauna and flora. </PARA>
<PARA>* Loss of `whole catchment' concept of conservation. </PARA>
<PARA>* Loss of public confidence in national park integrity. </PARA>
<PARA>* Possible adverse effect on nomination for World Heritage listing of Kakadu National Park. </PARA>
<PARA>All of those matters have to be weighed, even under option A which is, essentially, the go-ahead option. The total stopper option is option E, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Mining and exploration not to be permitted at Coronation Hill or elsewhere in the Zone, the whole of the Zone to become part of Kakadu National Park. </PARA>
<PARA>The benefits of that option are:</PARA>
<PARA>* Incorporation in Kakadu National Park of the entire catchment of the South Alligator River, apart from that part in Arnhem Land and the Koongarra mineral lease, as recommended by the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>* In accordance with the wishes of the Jawoyn custodians of the area and of many Jawoyn people. </PARA>
<PARA>* Enhanced confidence of Aboriginal people in the attitude of the non-Aboriginal community to their beliefs. </PARA>
<PARA>* No risk of mining-induced effects on the environmental and cultural values of the area. </PARA>
<PARA>* Subject to land claim outcome, royalty payments to the Jawoyn from national park income. </PARA>
<PARA>* Increased confidence on the part of those in the community concerned with preservation of national park values. </PARA>
<PARA>* Increased standing among elements of the international community. </PARA>
<PARA>* In accord with international and national definitions of national parks. </PARA>
<PARA>Arraigned against those benefits are the following losses:</PARA>
<PARA>* Loss of economic benefits from mining and associated employment and royalty benefits for Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA>* Loss of opportunity to understand the geology of the mineral deposits in the Zone. </PARA>
<PARA>* The possibility of adverse effects on investor confidence in the mineral industry. </PARA>
<PARA>So option A, the total go-ahead option, has a series of costs and benefits and option E, the total stopper, has a series of costs and benefits. I will not go through option D in detail. It canvasses the following:</PARA>
<PARA>Mining not to proceed at Coronation Hill but further mineral exploration to be permitted in the remainder of the Zone,</PARA>
<PARA>That is not a real option. If the mining industry is knocked back on Coronation Hill I do not think it will bother with any further exploration in the zone itself. I do not see that option D is at all realistic. However, option F is an interesting and very difficult one. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>No mining or exploration in the Conservation Zone until the Aboriginal custodians request it. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government could opt to pass the decision about mining to the Aboriginal people themselves. Of course, that would place a significant amount of pressure on the Jawoyn community, and it is a matter that has to be handled extremely carefully. Nevertheless, the benefit that might arise from this option is that at least it will enable the Jawoyn to weigh up for themselves the balance between their cultural and religious beliefs and the benefits and losses of mining. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand-and the honourable member for Chisholm is quite right-the Jawoyn people have waited for some considerable time now, and have already been under a considerable amount of pressure whilst awaiting a decision on this. The great and major loss that might accrue under option F is that they would be placed under further considerable pressure and further lobbying, if you like, from both the Northern Lands Council and the mining community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a difficult decision. We are now at a point where the Cabinet will make its decision. I applaud the efforts of the Resource Assessment Commission. I know that the Government, on the basis of the best evidence now available to it, will make the correct decision for all Australians. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The first report I have just tabled deals with stage 1 of the redevelopment of the Singleton military area in New South Wales. The limit-of-cost estimate for the work is $29.3m at November 1990 prices. The works referred to the Committee comprise: living facilities for 198 staff and 552 students; working facilities for depot company headquarters; redevelopment of roads and provision of car parking; construction of new range control buildings; extension of area engineering services; site works; and furniture and fittings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Singleton military area was acquired during the Second World War and some facilities from that time are still in use. Temporary facilities were constructed in 1965. In 1989 the Headquarters Infantry Centre was set up, comprising some of the corps functions previously performed in Canberra, the School of Infantry, and various support units. Many of these units work in temporary dilapidated buildings. Much of the living accommodation is below services' scales and standards of accommodation. Staff and students currently use six different messes in two different areas of the base. This is very wasteful in its use of manpower and maintenance funds. The Singleton range is intensively used and is relatively small when compared with other military ranges. Range control buildings are near the centre of the range, inhibiting optimum utilisation of the facilities. In particular, entry cannot be effectively controlled. </PARA>
<PARA> The works recommended by the Committee form stage 1 of a plan to redevelop the whole Singleton military area. It is currently the Army's highest priority because of the emphasis on improving living-in accommodation for all personnel. The Committee took particular note of the energy conservation measures proposed by Australian Construction Services for these works. It reiterates its belief, first expressed in its report on the redevelopment of Cabarlah in Queensland, that it should receive copies of analyses carried out on all projects referred to it to ensure the efficient energy conservation measures are included. Australian Construction Services intends to call tenders in a number of small contracts which should ensure a significant proportion of the work is attractive to local contractors. Australian Construction Services will also consult with the local Commonwealth Employment Office about the approximate numbers and mix of labour required for the project. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was impressed by the Army's `good neighbour' policy which is designed to minimise the impact of noise pollution and to ensure that complaints received are promptly investigated and followed up. The base clearly has a good relationship with the local community; it is also clear that there is strong support for the proposal in the Singleton area. The Singleton Shire Council stressed the need for the Army to acquire and maintain an adequate buffer zone around the base. The Council has placed zoning controls to prevent encroachment by large numbers of very small landowners, and has pointed to the need for consultation about subdivision proposals in the vicinity of the base. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Committee is aware that defence policy prevents funds being spent on museums, it recommends that the Department of Defence examine ways of providing upgraded facilities for the Infantry Museum at Singleton. The Committee would like to thank personnel at Singleton for the work that went into its visit on 31 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report I tabled deals with stage 1 of the redevelopment of the Myambat supply depot in New South Wales. The limit-of-cost estimate for the work is $34.4m at July 1990 prices. The works referred to the Committee comprise the construction of 30 earth-covered explosive storehouses with associated road works; the construction and extension of living and working accommodation; the upgrading of the sewerage system and the water supply, and the upgrading of the railway siding. The Army's wholesale ammunition holdings are stored in five depots in eastern Australia. They were established during the Second World War. Many of the explosives warehouses are not suitable for the storage of the most hazardous types of ammunition in accordance with the United Nations-North Atlantic Treaty Organisation principles. Many living and working facilities are inadequate and constitute a repair and maintenance liability. </PARA>
<PARA> Studies have recommended that in the medium term the Army should reduce its national wholesale depots from five to two: Myambat and Wallangarra in Queensland. The Committee is concerned about this decision because Myambat is in a relatively isolated location. The Committee believes a study should be done of the costs and benefits of retaining Wallangarra as a second national wholesale depot, and that it should receive a copy of the results of this study. The Committee was told that energy consumption for the proposed buildings will not be great compared with many military establishments. I have already referred, in my comments on the Singleton report, to the Committee's belief that it should receive copies of the analyses of energy usage on all projects referred to it. The same recommendation has been made in the report on Myambat. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted the work done by Army personnel at Myambat to sustain a good relationship with the local community. It believes it would be worthwhile to hold another public meeting to explain all the impacts the proposed works will have on that community. Rosemount Estates winery raised a number of concerns with the Committee, including the inclusion of land in the safety arc from the depot, the adverse impact of the destruction of explosives, the location of the sewerage plant and fires being started in the depot. Defence will advice Rosemount of the results of computer modelling which will determine the location of the safety arc. It has also ceased demolishing the explosives causing Rosemount's problems. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works is satisfied that the sewerage plant is in a suitable location. While there have been fires in the past depot staff take measures to reduce their causes and to deal effectively with those which start. Nevertheless, the Committee has recommended that Defence continue to resolve outstanding issues with the winery. </PARA>
<PARA> Works in this project will provide the most urgently needed facilities and engineering services. The project has been divided into two phases and a further stage will be undertaken when funding is available to complete the redevelopment of Myambat. The Committee would like to thank the personnel at Myambat for the work which went into its visit on 30 January 1991. I commend both reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Departure Tax Act 1978 to provide that the rate of departure tax be increased from $10 to $20 with effect from 1 August 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to increase departure tax to $20 follows the announcement by the Government in December last year to increase by $23m funding for the promotion of Australia as a tourist destination. The increase in departure tax will serve to offset this additional tourist promotion expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased promotion will allow Australia to capitalise on recent growth in tourism and will lead to significant job creation. It is estimated that 8,700 jobs are created for every 10 per cent increase in international visitor arrivals. Australia's departure tax will remain on a par with similar taxes collected in a number of other countries. The proposal to increase the rate of departure tax to $20 is expected to double the revenue generated by departure tax and, allowing for tourist growth, is likely to result in an increase in revenue of approximately $35m in 1991-92 and $37m in each subsequent year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will make a number of miscellaneous amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 to tidy up the legislation. Some of these will shorten the administrative decision process, consistent with the Government's micro-economic reform initiative. The Bill will enable the joint authorities to delegate jointly to Commonwealth and State or Northern Territory officials the more routine administrative decisions that they are required to make under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that only decisions that do not diverge from established policy will be delegated. If there is any disagreement between the two officials involved on any matter to be decided, the matter must be referred back to Ministers for a decision. This amendment will streamline the administration of the offshore petroleum legislation without weakening ministerial authority over decisions made under the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also replace the requirement for holders of offshore petroleum titles to lodge securities with a mandatory requirement for titleholders to take out insurance against potential liabilities arising from their operations. Currently, the requirements for insurance while usually attached as a condition of grant or renewal of a title are not mandatory. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will reduce the administration costs borne by industry while ensuring that the community is well protected against any liabilities arising out of offshore petroleum operations. While we never have had a major spill from petroleum exploitation operations in this country, this action will ensure that, in the unlikely case that an oil spill does occur, environmental clean-up costs will be fully met by the operators and their insurers. </PARA>
<PARA> Seismic surveying undertaken by contractors on a speculative basis over offshore areas not held under a petroleum title is a valuable means of encouraging exploration. It encourages exploration companies to express interest in, and to bid for, exploration permits over these vacant areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Such action can only enhance the offshore search for petroleum in Australia. This Bill will provide an additional incentive for such operations by giving the designated authority the discretion to extend the confidentiality period for the basic information collected in such operations to up to five years prior to providing public access to the information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Great Barrier Reef is a national treasure which all responsible Australian governments must manage and protect from damage for all time. This Government has made it clear that there will be no exploration for petroleum in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park or the coastal area extending up to the low water mark. </PARA>
<PARA> Exploration in the five petroleum exploration permits, granted under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, has been inactive since 1971 and operations were formally suspended in 1974. Given the Government's commitment to a total ban on petroleum exploration in the park, continuation of the five permits was seen as anachronistic. The Government therefore announced its determination to terminate the permits on 26 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the two companies with permits in the Great Barrier Reef region, Chevron, has favourably responded to our request and agreed to voluntarily surrender its four exploration permits in the area which were held by its subsidiary, Keydrill Australia Inc. This action demonstrates-I am sure the House will agree-Chevron's standing as an environmentally concerned corporate citizen. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will enable the Government to terminate the remaining permit in the region, Q/11P. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment to section 130 of the Act is proposed to clarify an ambiguity that currently exists with respect to domestic gas phase royalties obtained from the North West Shelf project. The change is specifically intended to define that category of royalty that the Commonwealth agreed to transfer to Western Australia to ensure the long term viability of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) export phase of the North West Shelf project. </PARA>
<PARA> As it is currently drafted, no distinction is made in the legislation between Commonwealth royalties obtained from the domestic gas and LNG phases of the project. This ambiguity has been drawn to the attention of the Western Australian Government and it has indicated that it has no concerns in principle with the change. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also clarifies two minor possible ambiguities in the Act. First, a more precise definition of exploring for petroleum will ensure that all relevant operations are covered by the Act. Another amendment will clarify the obligations of a holder of an access authority to affected titleholders. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill will remove minor inconsistencies and overlap between the Act and the Crimes Act 1914 which have occurred because of amendments to the Crimes Act 1914. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 132 of the Act, which is now redundant because of recent amendments to the Crimes Act 1914, will be repealed. Other amendments will extend the scope of offences dealt with in sections 133 and 135 of the Act to cover inchoate offences. Another amendment to section 84 of the Act will remove an inconsistency with other parts of the Act by requiring that a person knowingly provides false or misleading information in the test for offences under the section. </PARA>
<PARA> None of the amendments have any significant financial impact although the amendment to section 130 of the Act may have the effect of deferring minimal payments of royalty to Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House, and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Act 1967 to enable the efficient and correct determination of royalties from those areas subject to offshore petroleum royalties. Royalty is collected on a calendar month basis and is shared between the Commonwealth and the respective adjacent State. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the Government's decision last year to extend the coverage of the resource rent tax legislation to the Bass Strait region, the North West Shelf project, Australia's largest resource development, is the only producing region subject to the scope of this legislation. The Government's decision not to extend resource rent tax to the North West Shelf project was in recognition of the vast sums of financing involved in the infrastructure associated with the development, and the sensitivity surrounding the export phase of the project. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments are intended to clarify a number of matters of detail which are not specifically addressed by the legislation and give legislative support to administrative practices. They will, therefore, not add any further administrative burden on either government or the petroleum producers. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will allow for an interim royalty to be paid by the producers in circumstances where full agreement on royalty arrangements has yet to be finalised between the parties. On finalisation of the royalty agreement, adjustments to the interim royalty paid will be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will also enable any royalty payment that has been made by the producers to be considered as an interim payment until such time as the full details of the royalty calculation have been verified and accepted. The current provisions provide insufficient time to satisfactorily verify the information submitted by the producers, resulting in the potential for incorrect royalty payments to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the amendments will facilitate the adjustment to royalty in cases of overpayment or underpayment arising from the incorrect application or interpretation of an agreed or determined procedure contained within a royalty agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will not result in any additional administrative and compliance costs, but will provide added clarity of and certainty in the provisions. The impact of the proposed amendments is expected to be revenue neutral. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In September of 1988 the then Victorian transport Minister, Mr Jim Kennan, issued a media release which read, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>`This year's State Budget allocation to Berwick City was $1.04 million for main roads and $188,800 for local roads. </PARA>
<PARA>The increased allocation for construction and maintenance of local roads reflects the Government's commitment to developing a local roads infrastructure in this fast developing area', Mr Kennan said. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kennan said major works to improve the Princes Highway would begin this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>He said Phillip Huggins, ALP candidate for Berwick, had pointed out community concerns about possible future traffic problems on the highway between the Mulgrave Freeway and the Berwick bypass. As a result of Mr Huggins' representations, the Road Construction Authority has brought forward the start of widening works between Hallam and Berwick by twelve months and they will now begin next year, he said. </PARA>
<PARA>The provision of on-off ramps on the bypass at the Berwick-Cranbourne road will begin during this year and be completed in 1990. Mr Kennan said the $2.5 million project would greatly improve access to the freeway from Berwick township. </PARA>
<PARA>It is incumbent upon me to point out to the House and to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, that the Australian Labor Party candidate, Mr Huggins, lost the election of 1988 to the sitting Liberal member, the Hon. Rob Maclellan. The obvious pork-barrelling by the State Labor Government just prior to the 1988 election has unfortunately not brought home the bacon. On 20 September 1988 Mr Kennan wrote a letter to Mr Max Pawsey, the City Engineer, stating that the Berwick bypass on-off ramps:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . with an estimated cost of $2.5 million, are being investigated by the Road Construction Authority for commencement of preliminary works in the current financial year. Major works will commence in 1989/90, with completion expected in the following year. </PARA>
<PARA>The on-off ramps were commenced not in 1988-89 but in 1990-91. Minimum expenditure has been made and several weeks ago the contractors vacated the site and removed all site establishment, including the toilets. There is nothing there to show any progress except two pylons and some minor abutment works. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer honourable members to a media release issued by the Minister for Land Transport on 2 July 1990. The title of that press release was `Extra Lanes to Ease Traffic Flow at Berwick'. That media release read, in part, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government has agreed to fund the construction of extra traffic lanes on the Princes Highway to alleviate traffic congestion between Berwick and Narre Warren, south-east of Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Minister for Land Transport, Bob Brown, said a third lane would be built in each direction along a 4.7km section of the Princes Highway west of Berwick and westerly on-off ramps would be located at the Clyde Road/Princes Highway intersection. </PARA>
<PARA>Work is under way and will be completed next year at an estimated cost of $11.5 million, Mr Brown said. </PARA>
<PARA>A visit to the City of Berwick by Mr Brown in February of 1990 was part of the Federal election campaign to retain for the Labor Party the seat of La Trobe, which I now hold. It was another rolling of the pork barrel-perhaps a little repetitious. In late November 1989, the former member for La Trobe, Mr Peter Milton, contacted both the Minister for Land Transport and the then State transport Minister, Mr Kennan, to vigorously complain about the fact that the State Government had not honoured its pork-barrelling commitments from the 1988 State election and that Berwick was suffering. Among other things, Mr Milton was quoted in the local newspaper as making the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . although the roads corporation-</PARA>
<PARA>I note that Victoria keeps changing the name for its road construction authority-</PARA>
<PARA>had assured him the work would be finished within three years, he was unhappy that work due for completion this financial year would not be done. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Milton said: `I am particularly concerned that the construction of run-off ramps into Brentwood Estate be finished as soon as possible.'</PARA>
<PARA>Berwick desperately needs the Princes Highway to have a third lane from the Hallam hotel to the Princes Freeway at Berwick on both sides of the highway, and off-road ramps are needed to cater for Brentwood traffic at the freeway interchange with Berwick-Cranbourne Road. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Milton's efforts for intervention by the Federal Minister were appropriate, because the State Government road funding pork-barrelling promises had not been kept and the then member for La Trobe was under some pressure to hold his seat. I have to say that the former member's concerns regarding traffic bottlenecks and traffic flow were well justified, but the antics displayed at the time and the subsequent media release by the Federal Minister have not in fact achieved success. Mr Huggins did not win the State seat of Berwick, which was held by the Hon. Rob Maclellan. Mr Milton did not retain his Federal seat of La Trobe, which was won by me. We heard promises, promises-but then words are cheap, are they not?</PARA>
<PARA> Now we see that the works on the Princes Highway have been further delayed and the on-off ramps have disappeared. Perhaps the tooth fairy came and took away my on-off ramps. But then perhaps she took away the workers as well. The problem I have is that I gave away fairy stories a number of years ago, and I tend to doubt all that. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the State Government is deferring Federal Government funds intended for a specific road construction project to areas where it feels it might gain or retain a State seat. The redistributed State seat of Berwick, which is to be contested, I believe, by the failed former Treasurer of the State of Victoria, the Hon. Rob Jolly, needs only a 4.3 per cent swing to give the seat to the Liberal Party. It is my view that Mr Jolly has Buckley's hope of holding Berwick and I would think the Australian Labor Party sees that particular electoral situation in the same light. That being the case, somebody is playing funny games with Federal road funding dollars in order to win or retain some other State seat for the failed Labor Party that has bankrupted the State of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> With all that by way of background, I now turn the attention of the House to a critical bottleneck between the Mulgrave Freeway and the Princes Highway bypass of the village of Berwick which is to be nominally known as the Hallam-Narre Warren bypass, which is also fast becoming another political football which the Government does not want to know about. </PARA>
<PARA> In October 1990 an economic valuation report of the Hallam-Narre Warren bypass was prepared for the City of Berwick by expert consultants. In November 1990 that evaluation report was made available to me in order to assist me in making representations to State and Federal Ministers for a listing of the project as a priority road. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem we have is that this huge blockade in a major national transport artery has become another buck-passing exercise where no-one in either government wants to take responsibility and no-one wishes to give priority. From the evaluation report it is clear that if there were to be a review of Victoria's national roads program, the demonstrated priority, according to the Commonwealth criterion, of the bypass would be higher than that of projects such as the western bypass, the eastern arterial and the Greensborough bypass. I note, for the sake of honourable members and the Minister, that the Hallam-Narre Warren bypass has not yet been included in any forward strategy reports sent to the Commonwealth Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the current recession-the one we had to have-it is imperative that road projects be pursued that will provide positive economic benefits not only to Victoria but also to Australia as a whole. Having a State that is on the downward slide economically is not beneficial to the productive health of the nation as a whole. The Hallam-Narre Warren bypass has potentially higher returns to Victoria than almost any other road project, and consequently has the potential to assist in the stimulation of the national economy. The five-year lead time for such a project makes the early inclusion of the bypass in Commonwealth and Victorian priority listings most urgent. The role of the bypass is to link the production areas of the growth corridor and beyond to Gippsland and to the interstate distribution system which is focused on the metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA> The bypass has the potential to reduce distribution costs for manufacturing and primary industry and facilitate tourism and release capacity on the Princess Highway east for local shopper and business traffic between Dandenong, Fountain Gate and Berwick. The Princess Highway to the east of Melbourne concurrently serves high volumes of commercial, interstate tourist and export production, including power, oil and paper industries in the Latrobe Valley; export and import replacement in the manufacturing sector; agricultural products, including fresh vegetables and dairy products; and international and interstate tourism to Mount Baw Baw, the Gippsland Lakes, Tasmania, via the Sea Cat, and other attractions. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed Hallam-Narre Warren bypass would not only serve to promote these interests but would also provide an opportunity for a system of express commuter buses to serve the residents of the growth corridor who cannot reach the already overloaded and unreliable rail system. This factor will be of critical importance as the south-eastern growth corridor becomes developed and population levels move towards the 400,000 mark in the next 30 years. It is expected that traffic levels will grow from the present 40,000 vehicles a day to about 70,000 by the end of the decade. The thought of a 12-hour peak period on the Princess Highway is horrendous. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated cost of the proposed bypass is in the vicinity of $57m in today's dollars. The anticipated construction period would indicate the project could be completed by the turn of the century. More than 60 per cent of the land required is currently owned by Vicroads with the remainder reserved under the local planning scheme for acquisition as subdivision takes place. The economic evaluation report concludes that the Hallam-Narre Warren bypass project would have a pay-back period to Victoria in economic terms of three years if the project were completed by 2001. Returns to this magnitude are considered rare in public infrastructure planning. </PARA>
<PARA> This road has the support of local government and the local community. I seek the support of the House and this Government in having the Hallam-Narre Warren bypass declared as a national arterial road and placed as a high priority for construction at the earliest possible date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91, Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1990-91 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1990-91. During the past few months there has been much discussion about waterfront reform. There has inevitably been a lot of rubbish talk. Unfortunately, too many people, especially those on the Opposition benches, when they talk about waterfront reform, confuse it with reform of the Waterside Workers Federation. Anyone who knows anything about the waterfront realises that the waterside workers are only one aspect of the waterfront, one link in a very complex chain. When the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) threatens to put the troops onto the waterfront, does he have in mind that those troops are going to deal with all the complexities, such as the paper chase, the trucking queues and the late arrival of goods, which have nothing do with the waterside workers at all?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, we do need reform on the waterfront. Who has been to the fore in promoting this? The very group that is abused by the Opposition and abused by much of the media in Australia. If honourable members do not think that this is so, they should look at the rubbish about waterfront reform that has been in the media during the past week. Most of the media commentators are as misinformed about the waterfront as are honourable members opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> A report released in February by the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour showed that between September 1983 and December 1990 labour levels fell by 647, with a further 490 employees marked to go by mid-March 1991. Furthermore, 600 workers retired with less than the agreed golden handshake. They were generally in such poor health that they were unable to wait until the enterprise agreements were finalised. Waterside workers recognise the need to lift production and bring Australian ports up to world standards. </PARA>
<PARA> In a secret ballot in October 1989 wharfies voted 4 to 1 in favour of the reform program. Performance indicators for June 1990 showed disputes were down and shipping delays halved in most ports. Consultation and negotiation, combined with rationalisation and streamlining of labour, unions and the stevedoring companies, is paying off. The interim stevedoring industry award, ratified by the Industrial Relations Commission last year, is the first step towards rationalising up to 20 different awards. It also provides true flexibility for the formation of enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> A review of job classifications with the aim of developing a new career path for all waterfront workers is nearing completion. The new classification will enable workers to become multi-skilled and will further increase productivity and dislodge some longstanding work demarcations. As an example, the elimination of the watchman classification-this has happened recently at Port Kembla-has resulted in 300 people leaving the industry, saving some $30m. </PARA>
<PARA> Mergers of the six main maritime unions are now well advanced. The waterside workers, the seamen, foremen, engineers, supervisors and the Merchant Service Guild of Australia have agreed in principle to form a Maritime Federation by 1992. At the same time, unions with only a few members on the waterfront are agreeing to transfer their members to the new Federation. This will greatly simplify negotiations and reform by creating a single bargaining unit. The objective of the agreement was to ensure a reliable, efficient and competitive industry. Prior to signing the agreement the unions had taken the initiative and created their own productivity schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear many horrific stories about costs and delays on the waterfront. According to a recent report in the rural press, Australian shipping and stevedoring was so inefficient that it was cheaper to transport salt across the Pacific from Mexico than from South Australia. It claimed that this was exactly what one company had been forced to do. The report, which the Sydney Morning Herald leader writer took up as a further example of the Federal Government's failure to implement micro-economic reform, was raised in Parliament by the then shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). There was only problem with this. When subjected to scrutiny the report was found to be wrong. Customs records show that Australia has never imported any salt, except for minute quantities of a very special variety used in medicines. None of this comes from Mexico. This is true of so many of these examples that members of the Opposition and others and leader writers of the papers trot out time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA> Myths about waterfront inefficiency abound. In fact, the Government's three-year reform program, aimed at improving waterfront productivity by 30 per cent, has already been exceeded in some terminals only 14 months down the track. At national Australian terminals, where a new enterprise agreement is already operating, labour costs have fallen by 34 per cent. Meanwhile, stevedoring costs at Australia's 19 grain terminals are down by an average of 70 per cent. In crude terms, productivity has so far been achieved by fewer people doing the same work. </PARA>
<PARA> During the past few months, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have had the opportunity to visit most of the ports in Australia, and let me tell you who is to blame for most of the delays on Australia's waterfront. Those who shout loudest about the inefficiencies on the waterfront are often those most to blame. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the chaotic system of paperwork. For example, the steaming time for a ship from Singapore to Fremantle is often only four days. Time and time again the ship will arrive at Fremantle before the paperwork does because of the antiquated paperwork system that we have. When the paperwork arrives, an endless paper chain then has to be gone through before the goods can be cleared. Of course, this delays the ship and delays the unloading of the cargo or its removal from the port. When honourable members opposite and others criticise, they never mention this. It is always the poor old wharfie who gets the blame, and time and time again it has absolutely nothing to do with the Waterside Workers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> Do not overlook that good industrial relations term `the deliberately engendered dispute'. I have received a lot of evidence about deliberate delays on the wharf not caused by the wharfies but by businesses, and they do this for their own reason. Again, who inevitably gets the blame but the wharfies. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear a lot about the subject of demurrage. It is quite evident that at times consignors or consignees will choose to leave their containers at a terminal or depot because it suits their business requirements. Commercial interests, we are told, are supreme irrespective of the demurrage charge applied. One example I was recently given in Adelaide was of a refrigerated container with cargo that had come in from Europe. The shipping line wanted to turn that refrigerated container around because it needed it-we always have a problem here getting empty containers. </PARA>
<PARA> The shipping line wanted to use this container rather than having to ship an empty box across from some other part of Australia. The demurrage for that container started off at $25 a day-this was after the third day, because the first three days are free-then it was escalated to $75 a day because the shipping line wanted it moved. The cargo remained there in that refrigerated container not because the documentation was lost but because a particular client-a particular business-had a need to do so, and it was cheaper for it to pay $75 a day demurrage to leave it on the waterfront. But who got the blame? Again it was the wharfies. It had nothing to do with the wharfies. This is repeated time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA> The other interesting point on those charges relating to demurrage is that it is a common practice, as I have seen, for example, for a depot to apply a daily charge to a shipping line for boxes that are held after the three-day period. When these charges are then passed on to the shipper, the consignor or the consignee they are considerably increased. This does not show in the invoice that the shipper receives for the goods, so profits can be significantly increased by delays. If we use a unit rather than a dollar value ranging from one to 25, a shipping line may be being charged one to leave cargo there, but may be recovering 25. That is passed on and, of course, again the waterside workers always get the blame. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to what waterfront reform is really about. As the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) said yesterday, the waterfront is a reactor. It does not make anything. It makes nothing at all. It does not build anything. It provides a service. People bring things to the waterfront by sea and take them away on land, or vice versa. The timetables are very much determined by those who use the waterfront, whether by sea or by land. It is not done by the waterfront. The waterfront reacts. </PARA>
<PARA> But what do we find? Exporters turn up at the waterfront after the deadline for a ship has closed, wanting to get boxes or bags on the vessels. Why are they not there on time? Usually they have a minimum of seven days notice, and often it is 10 days notice. Why did the cargoes not come in at an even pace over those seven or 10 days? Explain that to the exporters; explain to them why 90 per cent of the trucks that go onto the waterfront are empty and come out full, or go in full and come out empty. </PARA>
<PARA> Why are these exporters not getting a decent deal on transport service rates to and from the waterfront? Why have we got this nonsense going on there? Why is it that when goods come onto the waterfront they sit there waiting to be taken away? The first three days on the waterfront are free when goods come off the ship. Fifteen per cent of the goods go out on the first day; 20 per cent go out on the second day; and there is one almighty rush on the third day. All that rush generates a peak and generates congestion, and who gets the blame? Again, the wharfies. </PARA>
<PARA> The exporters will always tell us that everyone is tucked in behind the big shed-blame them. But, as exporters, they do not get their goods to the wharf on time, and they do not check with their agents to see whether they could get a better rate by having the goods there a few days early. As importers, they do not check whether they could get a dedicated time for their ship's arrival, so that they could get an even spread of ships arriving at the terminal thus reducing the peaks and the congestion. None of these things have been done. The truck queues are not caused by the wharfies, but by the shippers who cannot organise to get their cargoes to and from the ships. The farmers who scream loudest are among the worst offenders in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to have an efficient system for moving cargoes in and out of the ports. For some truckies-and I say this coming from a trucking background-payment for queuing is a convenient money earner. We have to stop this business of trucks unloading and then leaving empty. There has to be better coordination. There is truly little point in clearing the obstacles at the waterside if the ones at the wharf gate remain in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I know you know the answer to this, Mr Deputy Speaker, but it is interesting and I will mention it to the House: what is the most expensive aspect of the waterfront today? The most expensive aspect of the waterfront today is the tugboats. That is where the real cost is today. But do we hear this from the Opposition or from the leader writers in our national newspapers? No, we hear that the waterfront is the site of some of the worst work practice rorts, overmanning and inefficiency. But it is not the wharfies, it is the other players on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> What is always missed out is that there are many players on the waterfront. We heard again yesterday about all these wonderful overseas ports, and that we are going to be compared with Rotterdam and Singapore. If there is to be a comparison between our ports-say, Port Kembla-and Rotterdam or Singapore, then give our ports the equipment and we will deliver the results. These comparisons are always very selective and members opposite are very selective in what ports they pick out in Asia too. </PARA>
<PARA> They should go to some of the ports in Thailand and a few of the other ports in Japan-go to Yokohama in Japan-not the few that they pick out. Singapore-that is all we hear. They should go round the ports of South East Asia and make a comparison with the Australian ports, even with the inadequate equipment that we have in the Australian ports. Give us the equipment in our ports-a couple of cranes and so on-and we will give the products. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point about making comparisons in connection with the waterfront is that it is not only the equipment but also the users of the waterfront. Would the business people of Singapore or Rotterdam go on with the nonsense that the business people in Australia go on with? Would they have all of their cargo come in late and things like that? If we are going to make these comparisons, let us compare apples with apples and compare the whole work, not just one aspect of the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that the hypocrisy of the Opposition about the waterfront is really amazing to me. Sometimes I wonder whether any of the honourable members opposite have ever visited the waterfront. I have never seen any of them wandering around Port Kembla and I know that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) at the table has not seen any of them wandering around the Newcastle waterfront, as I was doing the other week. Their ideologically blinkered view distorts any rational debate with them regarding reform of the waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA> Despite all the waffle from Opposition members about the waterfront, has anyone ever heard them say anything except to criticise the wharfies? I have not heard of one plan-and I would like to hear of one from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)-from the Opposition to increase productivity on the docks. Why? Because it does not have any plans. The only plan it has is to bash the workers and to put the troops in there. It should just try putting the troops in there. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite would be much more credible on waterfront reform if they could come up with their own plan for eliminating some of the waterfront practices of the users of the ports. For example, what would the Opposition do about the queuing, about time delivery of cargo, about electronic transfer of documents, about antiquated equipment? The Opposition will not speak of these issues because it has absolutely no policies on them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it clear: no-one argues that sorting out the ports is easy. I am not saying that. But it is simplistic to think the problem lies only with the wharfies. The Waterside Workers Federation has been largely restructured, and it has done it without industrial disputation. If the Opposition wishes to talk of inefficiencies and rorts, it should look at the other users of the waterfront and lift its eyes above the waterside workers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst we have the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) at the table, could I briefly say that the excellent exposition on the needs for the Berwick bypass by my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) equally applies to the Eastern Freeway extension in Melbourne and to the Scoresby arterial, but I will not go into that at length. I would say to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), that that was also an outstanding exposition on what is wrong with the waterfront-warts and all in all sorts of areas-but I remind him that it is his side of the House which is in government and it is his side of the House which is not fixing the problem. Why does the Government not fix it up? Why does the honourable member come in here and have a go at us?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are here today to talk about Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91, Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1990-91 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1990-91. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) relates to the Gulf war funding, and we of course supported the Government in this. It is about a number of defence measures which are unfortunately tinkering, but tinkering in the wrong direction for the most part. A number of my colleagues have dealt with that earlier today in great detail. It is about funding for veterans' affairs overruns, small amounts for more training places, support for Austrade and for tourism and, finally, extra money for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriation Bill (No. 5) deals with funding for compensation to the States resulting from the new companies and securities regulation arrangements, pharmacy restructuring, disaster relief, compensation to Victoria-and I might add that Victoria needs compensating in a whole host of areas-in respect of new petroleum tax arrangements and the purchase of Telecom's shareholding in Aussat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable gentleman at the front here says, we need a lot of sympathy down there as well. The last measure, the purchase of Telecom shareholdings in Aussat, is part of the Government's totally inappropriate telecommunications restructuring strategy, and we will be talking about that in the next couple of weeks in considerable detail, as I understand it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier speakers from this side of the House have dealt in detail with a number of those measures, and they have also indicated that we will generally support these Bills, but we will be moving some amendments commenting on the Government's fiscal irresponsibility and economic mismanagement. My intention is to pursue some particular areas of the Government's legislation in more depth. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I wish to briefly comment on ATSIC. I have to say, as a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, as I have travelled around the country fairly extensively in the last few months with that Committee, that I am yet to be convinced that this extra layer of bureaucracy is actually worth the cost. It is a subject I will pursue on a separate occasion in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to concentrate on the Government's attitude to industry, the economy and especially to technology and science take-up in the manufacturing and commerce sectors. Having announced a number of policy changes in the last few months, the Government now seeks appropriate funding for some of these initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 12 March we have seen other legislation resulting from that Building a Competitive Australia document. The Government has now clearly signalled its course. It has some of it right. It is going in the right direction in some areas, there is no doubt. But I believe it has wimped out on much that should be done. At least the Government has now signalled the areas of the new industry winners and has very specifically picked out some industry winners-the areas and the winners it proposes to back-so we know where we stand. These areas are resource-based industries, chiefly minerals and agriculture, and especially their value-added products; manufacturing and information industries; environmental research, technology and services and medical research and biotechnology. These choices in essence define the Government's view of where Australia should be earning its export dollars by the twentyfirst century. </PARA>
<PARA> I have nothing against any of these areas in particular but I would suggest that the missing ingredient in the scenario is the solution to the nation's most intractable problem, and that is how we are going to commercialise and capture the economic benefits of the clever products, processes and technologies of our scientists and engineers as they come up with them over the next 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government plans to offer ongoing tax concessions for industry research and development (R&amp;). Why? If it reduces the general tax rate and if it reduces the level of business cost layers, surely this will far outweigh for all potential users the 125 per cent tax concession which inevitably has to come out of John Citizen's pocket. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) on the Government side put it nicely when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian manufacturing had no history of innovation of taking product development to international markets. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to describe the Government's treatment of research and development as shabby. He said that its neglect in not encouraging the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) was one of its greatest failures. From the navigation system Interscan to the black box flight recorder, to the biotechnology breakthrough of gene shears and the Sarich engine, the list of Australian discoveries which failed to find a local backer and went offshore makes quite sobering, if not downright disquieting, reading. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures provided in the March industry statement to rectify this problem remain at the margin in the absence of cold hard cash to make it happen. I am not talking about hand-outs. The market has been starved of investment cash because of this Government's deliberate policy of high interest rates and its failure for eight years to control inflation. One can gut the economy, and if one does it often enough one does get lower inflation, and that is why we have it for the moment. But the trick will be to sustain it when we come out of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the problem of industry attitudes. A recent study by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce reveals that only one in three of our 16,000 manufacturing firms has made any significant investment in high technology and most of that, I might add, is for extra capacity rather than replacing the core machinery and technology that they have; so the core is gradually rotting away. Of course, high technology itself represents the biggest element in Australia's manufacturing balance of payments deficit. Most of the high technology that we do use has to be imported, and whilst the March industry statement attempts some measures to address both aspects of the problem-for example, as I have mentioned, the extended 125 per cent tax incentive for research and development and revised government purchasing procedures-it is by no means certain, in my view, that it will fix it or really go very far to help the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Government lays commendable emphasis on the need to upgrade national skills to handle the new technology and to develop a more competitive industry sector. However, to quote Julian Cribb in the Australian when he was commenting on the Prime Minister's March statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The statement boosts the opportunities for the `brightest and best' by enlarging postgraduate awards, but fails to address the deepening degradation of resources and facilities by the universities. </PARA>
<PARA>By their own estimates, the universities are almost $1 billion worse off in real terms than they were at the start of the 1980s, yet together with public organisations such as CSIRO, the Australian Nuclear Science &amp;Technology Organisation, and the Australian Institute of Marine Science, they form the nation's fountainhead of cleverness-both in terms of people and ideas. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet this Government has consistently starved those organisations of funds. The Government should use its purchasing clout in information technology to support those who do the right thing in terms of exporting. It should not be handing out taxpayers' money only to professional research companies. There are a lot of information technology companies in this country which have been around for the last decade, surviving almost exclusively on handouts, which never actually produced anything that is commercially viable. It should not just be handing out taxpayers' money to those professional research companies; it has to concentrate far more on the development part of the R&amp; and not just the research. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is still into picking winners, quite clearly, and we have seen examples of that recently. What stuns me is this: did those on the other side not learn anything from John Cain and our very unfortunate experience in Victoria from picking winners? It was a proven policy failure and an absolute disaster. As I have said in this place before, the Government should be tackling the big issues, the things that will have a significant impact for the better, by encouraging innovation across the board. Until this happens this country will continue to go down the economic gurgler at an alarming rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's role is to provide long term investment in research, in education and in human capital. It must educate management as well as the unions and it must assist with overseas marketing intelligence. Its role is not to pick winners by bringing a particular product or a particular process to market or the indirect funding of doing that with taxpayers' money. I am afraid that the Government's recent proposals are going to give us more public servants. It is proposing more boards and it is into making more Australian information technology just a simple subcontractor of overseas companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The partnerships for development program is unproven at best and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce is unfortunately very reticent about giving us any real information. At best it is unproven and is a sop to our ego, I suggest, at worst. Where is the evidence that it is worthwhile? Recently we have seen the introduction of fresh bounties-for example, the citric acid bounty, a fresh bounty for one particular company. Where is the lowering of protection that the Prime Minister promised us? Has the Prime Minister not actually misled the House on that matter?</PARA>
<PARA> Comfort measures in the information technology sector have also been increased. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) has demonstrated his heavy interventionist line, which is a proven policy direction failure from the past. He has done nothing meaningful for Australian information technology companies. His rhetoric sounds fine, but it lacks substance, and transparently so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was given the four key areas which are vital to wealth creation in Australia in a report in 1989 by the Prime Minister's Science Council, which was entitled Resources for Science and Technology and their utilisation. I do not agree with everything in the report, especially its advocacy of picking winners. But I must say that I do agree with its basic analysis that Government policy needs to address four things: improving market knowledge; improving communications; building skills and competence; and setting future strategic priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, to relay the following questions to the Minister for Science and Technology: does he know why Australian companies are shying away from Asian exports? Why does the Government not provide genuine market intelligence? Why has the Government not tackled the problem of dumping? Why does it not market Australia as a skills haven? Why has the Government not ramped up its training places much more during this period of high unemployment?</PARA>
<PARA> Young people in my electorate and around the country-my electorate is an outer eastern suburban seat in Melbourne; we get many young people looking for jobs because unemployment has more than tripled in the last 12 months-are looking to get their skills upgraded, trying to go to the technical and further education colleges and trying to get into Austudy and they are being turned away in their thousands. Apprentices are being laid off because the building industry is in a disastrous state. If they cannot get back into an apprenticeship within 12 months-and for many that just will not happen-they will never, therefore, qualify for their apprenticeship. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the third runway decision to boost our tourist trade in Sydney? Apart from selecting a few particular projects-again, I suspect, winners-via cooperative research centres, how does the Government propose to create, and I will use the Prime Minister's favourite words, `the nexus' between the academic, scientific and business community? Surely business will invest only if it has confidence and sees a return for its shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Government that artificially contrived schemes will just collapse. Look at the Victorian Economic Development Corporation. I remind the Minister that what we need is not just scientific push going out to industry, but industry has to perceive, for sound commercial reasons, the need to pull ideas from the universities and from other R &amp;D facilities. In this way it will be motivated to be committed to the process or product that is produced and actually see it right through to the end. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Government: where is its commitment to building skills and competence? Where are the strategic priorities? If one believes that picking winners is the right thing to do, it is still only a tactical approach. Where is the strategy? Where is the implementation of a vision by the Minister for Science and Technology? Where is the foreseeing of the tremendous growth in communications, in the quantum leap forward in transport technology or in the information industries? There has been no vision by the Minister for Science and Technology; there have been words, but no action. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, Australia will be reduced to the status of a south sea island unless the Government holds to its pledge to eliminate all tariffs for the manufacturing sector by 1996. There is no other choice, it is the only way forward. The idea that Australians can hide behind a protective barrier, build up industrial muscle and compete against the world I am afraid is an illusion. Australia must readjust its economic priorities to mesh into the Asia-Pacific Rim which will become-this is a very interesting statistic-the world's second largest market in the coming decade. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a mistake to try to spot or target industries and then find special niches for them in the fast growing Asian economies. Often people hold up Singapore as a good example. Places such as Singapore tried that strategy and failed, and they had to change their course. I accept that large amounts of public funds must be channelled into research and development. Australian companies, though, will not know what particular industrial areas they can excel in until they actually get out there, compete and start to have some successes. They cannot be picked too far in advance; there has to be a broad based attack and then some will succeed because some will inevitably fail. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody could have foretold that with a small population Australia would throw up champion cricketers, golfers and, from time to time, champion tennis players and swimmers. But small countries can get out and compete. There are certain industries where Australia has a natural advantage because of access to raw materials which would be viable if our industries became competitive. But we have neither used this advantage nor made our industries competitive. What happens? The Japanese and Koreans import our iron ore to make steel and then compete with us by selling it worldwide. There is a whole range of industries based on our minerals which do not have to be transported vast distances just to add value. We can add value to them in Australia and then export them. </PARA>
<PARA> Our food processing industries-this is an area where we have great difficulty in terms of our food products-are another area of comparative major advantage. If we want to go in for it in a big way, we should not be exporting frozen meat, we should be exporting processed foodstuffs, such as television dinners and lunches ready for the microwave and made to Asian tastes. We should get out into the marketplace, research the market and see what is required. We should then package it, process it and ship it out and we would get far higher value and profit than just sending out the bulk quantities of frozen meat. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these things are possible, but it requires research and development and whole teams of research workers out in the field defining tastes and preferences and then having the product packaged differently for specific tastes. Whatever the field, we will not know until we have opened it up and it must be on a profitable and competitive basis, not with a prop from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The voters have seen this Government for what it is-a sham, which protects the inefficient and sacrifices the ordinary working man or woman in my electorate and in the rest of Australia. There are thousands and thousands of them out there. The official figures for unemployment are dramatically understated, as we all know. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately, this Government has simply failed the nation. I suggest that it needs a new Prime Minister, a new Treasurer and a new policy direction. Most Australians know this. Unfortunately for Australians it is symptomatic of this Government that it is so out of touch with what is happening in the real world that it simply does not recognise the depth of our plight nor is it prepared to respond with the necessary urgency. If the Government cannot change-and it shows little sign of doing so-then it should be prepared to resign and make way for a coalition Government that has the policies, the vision and the will to do what is so necessary for Australia and for Australians both now and in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Appropriation Bill (No. 4), the Appropriation Bill (No. 5), and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) provide additional appropriations to meet the cost of additional commitments and expenses incurred by the Government since last year's Budget. These additional costs include $278.2m for defence outlays. This sum includes costs associated with Australia's contribution to the Gulf war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to publicly record the gratitude of the Australian people for all defence personnel who served in the Gulf during the recent conflict. During my visit to the Middle East in March this year, I was told by senior coalition commanders that Australia's service personnel were second to none in their professional capability and in their determination to successfully accomplish the task in hand. </PARA>
<PARA> Together with Senator David MacGibbon and Colonel Ross Bishop, I was privileged to visit HMAS Sydney and HMAS  Westralia during patrol operations and to talk with many of the crew. I also had the opportunity to visit the Australian medical contingent on board the United States hospital ship Comfort. </PARA>
<PARA> The respect held by coalition commanders for Australian service personnel is testament to the good quality of training principles and procedures employed by the Australian Defence Force. There was excellent interoperability of Australian naval forces with United States (US) naval forces. RIMPAC exercises have proved to be invaluable training operations. Nevertheless, coalition warfare is an area that warrants more detailed study by both Australia and US defence authorities. This is to ensure maximum defence capability in the event of future conflict, when once again Australian and US forces will stand shoulder to shoulder to defeat an aggressor. </PARA>
<PARA> I note from the second reading speech by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) that an additional $206.3m was appropriated for so-called `price movements and variations in progress on a number of projects, including payments for Anzac ships and submarine refit'. I have consistently stressed in this House the fundamental importance of maintaining an effective force of submarines as a strategic deterrent. It is a tragedy for Australia that the Government did not exercise the option it held to purchase two additional Collins class submarines. I sincerely hope, particularly for the young men and women of Australia, that this decision will not jeopardise the security of our country.</PARA>
<PARA> So it was with astonishment that I read recently that a member of the House claimed in a letter to his electors that he had `contributed to the Government's decision not to order two additional submarines, so saving Australia $800m'. He said that these savings would be available for more productive social and economic programs. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement is shameful. It is addressed in sanctimonious language. It is a boast that the defence capacity of this country will be weakened. With few exceptions, voters in my electorate would share my utter contempt for the statements expressed by this particular member of parliament. The people of my electorate, together with millions of other Australians, trust this Government to provide adequately for the defence of Australia. They also trust that their parliamentarians would never be involved, nor attempt to be involved, in any act or omission which would weaken Australia's defence forces. I know that I speak for the overwhelming majority of members of this House when I assure the people of Australia that, as elected representatives, I and others who share my views are determined, at whatever cost, to ensure that Australia has a Defence Force capable of protecting Australia, defeating an invader and contributing meaningfully as a responsible partner to the ANZUS alliance. </PARA>
<PARA> The appropriations for Defence also include an additional $29.6m for defence facilities and an additional $6.8m for defence housing. I congratulate the Government and the Defence Housing Authority on the tremendous work that has been done to upgrade defence housing stock throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Not long after I was elected, as a member of the Public Works Committee I visited Darwin, where I inspected a number of defence houses. The result of seven years of Liberal Party neglect was evident. No action had been taken to repair and maintain defence houses in Darwin. I believe the appalling housing conditions for defence personnel all around Australia were a major contributor to the widespread low morale which I found amongst Defence Force families at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> It never ceases to amaze me how any service personnel can vote for a Liberal or National Party candidate. Over the years, I have made a careful study of the performance of Labor and non-Labor governments with respect to the conditions of service of defence personnel, and it is consistently Labor governments who ensure by legislation that defence personnel are paid fair salaries, are adequately housed and are provided with attractive conditions of service, including retirement benefits. Non-Labor governments are tardy in providing these essential conditions of service. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note that additional money is provided for the welfare of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, including the sum of $8.2m for community development and employment projects. This scheme has been successful in many Aboriginal communities throughout Australia. It has been outstandingly successful at Palm Island, where unemployment is in excess of 90 per cent for a population of about 3,000 Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Palm Island endure chronic unemployment, inadequate health service, bad roads and a lack of other basic services but, most importantly, there is a chronic shortage of housing. The people of Palm Island need 100 new houses immediately. At present there are on Palm Island houses which have up to 20 people in occupation. Most houses on Palm Island would have about a dozen residents. This overcrowding causes enormous strain on family relationships, interferes with children's education and, in my view, is responsible for much of the social disruption on Palm Island. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) for urgent funds to provide 100 additional houses on Palm Island for the Aboriginal people. It would be the most important contribution he could make to the welfare of Australia's largest Aboriginal community, located on Palm Island. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned just a few matters to which, in my view, the Government should respond in a positive and substantial manner as soon as possible. I now turn to an issue which is causing great concern to the people of my electorate. This issue is the decision by Liberal and National parties to introduce a consumption tax, in the unlikely event of their coming to government. Opposition to the consumption tax proposal comes from a wide cross-section of people in my electorate-farmers and business people, defence personnel, students, retirees and the sick-and particularly from the women of my electorate. They do not want a consumption tax. Indeed, the Townsville Bulletin in its editorial on 4 September last year began with these words:</PARA>
<PARA> The last thing we need is more taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Federal Opposition has its way, Australians will have no choice. They will be forced to endure a consumption tax. Pensioners, people on low incomes, and other Australians who are genuinely in need will loathe a consumption tax. They do not yet comprehend what they would be letting themselves in for under a Hewson-Fischer government. On 26 July last year, a report from Canberra, published in the Townsville Bulletin, read:</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition Leader, John Hewson, yesterday denied he was softening up the Coalition to adopt a consumption tax as official policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Less than one month later, on 16 August, the Australian reported:</PARA>
<PARA> After more than a decade of debate on the value of a consumption tax, the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, emerged from a marathon meeting of opposition MPs in Canberra to say it had been adopted as Coalition policy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition Leader's earlier denial of the coalition's embrace of a consumption tax proved to be false, just as the coalition's economic policies overall are without substance and without benefit for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Who could trust a Liberal-National government whose leader denied that a consumption tax was policy one month and then announced its adoption the next? Who could trust such a government to offer compensating payments to low and middle income earners? Even if it did, such a system would be a nightmare to operate, would cost billions of dollars and would add to the inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Imagine the pressure on wages as the trade unions sought wage increases for their members to compensate for across the board price rises. Make no mistake, this would be one of the inevitable outcomes of a consumption tax imposed on the Australian people by the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all, a consumption tax combined with $3 billion-or possibly more-in spending cuts as promised by the Liberal and National parties would be harsh in the extreme on the poor of Australia. It would cripple the welfare system, which is one of the most efficient systems anywhere in the world, thanks to the concerned positive actions of the Hawke Labor Government. A consumption tax would rip into Australians who can least afford it. It would be a tax on the Australian family and would reduce incentive; it would be a tax that would inhibit economic growth in this country. One only needs to look at the experience in Canada, where a goods and services tax has been introduced. There a bureaucratic nightmare has now emerged leading, it is predicted, to almost decades of legal battles in administrative courts and other courts over the interpretation of various sections of its goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I share the view of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who has consistently, to his credit, opposed the introduction of a consumption tax. Many people from time to time criticise the honourable member for O'Connor, but on a number of issues in speeches to this House he has made more sense than many other members I have heard from in more than eight years in this House. On this issue, the honourable member for O'Connor is right: a consumption tax is wrong as a tax system and is against the interests of entrepreneurs and business people who are willing to put in the hard effort and expect to be rewarded for that hard work through a fairer tax system. A consumption tax is not wanted by the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told that honourable members are to limit their speeches in this debate, but I wish to say a few words on the issue of welfare. The statements issued by the Liberal and National parties are causing me a lot of concern. I find they are willing to farm out the welfare budget to charity organisations and to use the private sector to pay social welfare benefits. The people of my electorate find that scenario horrendous. These intentions have been canvassed widely in the media, as early as October 1990 and more recently. I cannot understand why the Opposition is pursuing this objective, and there is no real evidence why it should, despite some of the rather bizarre writings on certain experiences in other countries, particularly the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> The distribution of the welfare budget by voluntary agencies would provide a Hewson-Fischer government with a way to wield the axe on welfare. It would take a Sherlock Holmes to recognise, identify and elaborate on government cuts in welfare spending. It is a sneaky way of cutting into welfare. Criticism of pruning would be easily diverted away from the Government into the laps of voluntary agencies. Most welfare agencies are chiefly urban based, so guaranteeing welfare delivery to regional Australia, particularly remote areas-areas that I represent-would be almost impossible. Protecting this private agency system advocated by the Opposition from corruption is something else again. Corruption in its various forms would be one of the inevitable outcomes of having numerous agencies making decisions on discretionary payments without dependable national standards. Welfare fraud and overpayment would be rife. In stark contrast to the Liberal and National parties, the Hawke Government expects to save up to $400m a year with greater use of computer cross-matching and accelerated claimant matching. </PARA>
<PARA> On 18 October 1990, Professor Stuart Rees of the Department of Social Work, University of Sydney, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Hewson's ideas about the efficiency of transferring some of the responsibilities of the Department of Social Security to community welfare organisations represent a narrow view of welfare and a misunderstanding of the role of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Decades of advocacy of central governments' responsibilities were aimed at removing the stigmatising practices so beloved of the selfrighteous moralists of years ago. Dr Hewson's utterances suggest that such attitudes are still alive, even in the mind of a prospective Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will mention the honourable member in a minute. On the same day, Dr John Tomlinson, Director of the Australian Capital Territory Council of Social Services, spoke out in similar vein, when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Yesterday's call by Dr John Hewson, asking Australians to consider abolishing the Department of Social Security and handing welfare functions over to the states and voluntary agencies to cut out duplication and deliver services locally, defies logic . . . His idea that voluntary agencies would handle the type of income-support functions now handled by social security takes no account of economies of scale, equity, equal distribution of services nor the complex nature of the Australian incomes security system. In remote areas where voluntary agencies have no presence many rural people would never be assisted. Senator Alston today argued that the database of personal details, which are collected by the department should be handed over to private firms which could then conduct reviews of beneficiaries and pensioners. This would destroy the confidential nature of these inquiries. I would think it would not be long before an even cheaper option would be proposed, such as the concerned citizens in the town rounding up all the pensioners and beneficiaries in the local community hall and subjecting them to a kangaroo court inquisition about their personal and financial difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>Those financial difficulties would be severe enough, but add them to the burden of a consumption tax forced upon the nation by a Liberal-National government, and we discover suffering in the extreme. The expanse of hurt caused by a consumption tax in Australia would not be confined to welfare recipients and pensioners. Indeed, farmers, part time and self-employed workers would not be fully compensated. This is very evident, particularly for people in North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on this note: the Hawke Government has tightened the tax system since 1985 to ensure that all taxpayers pay their full share in such a way as to avoid making the lower income earner suffer. The expanding tax base has alleviated the need for a consumption tax-if indeed there ever was a need. The capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, substantiation requirements, the prescribed payment system and increased audit activity by the Australian Taxation Office have all contributed to this particular process. I am saying here and now that the coalition leadership is working on a consumption tax of 15 per cent. That is the kind of tax it will introduce in the unlikely event that it gains government. It is going to affect millions of Australians. It is going to reduce the standard of living of the poor of Australia particularly, and expose them to economic hardship. A consumption tax or a goods and services tax-call it what you like-is not a painless answer to Australia's economic well-being. In fact, it will be an economic disaster and cause social misery for millions of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I urge the people of Australia at the next election to make a judgment between the parties of Australia. One party, the Liberal-National party coalition, stands for the introduction of a consumption tax and for the privatisation of welfare services. One party, the Australian Labor Party, is opposed to the consumption tax. It supports the continuation of the delivery of welfare services by the Department of Social Security and other government organisations. It stands for the increased economic well-being of the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before commencing my speech on the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91, I cannot let go by the opportunity to comment on the speech of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). The goods and services issue will be sorted out in due course. I am sure that the views of the Opposition on that issue will be presented in a full and proper manner before the next election. I also wish to address an issue that the honourable member mentioned with respect to service people when he said he did not believe that any service people could support the Opposition. I point out to him that all three returned service people in this House happen to be on the Opposition side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He raised the issue of the safety and security of our country, and said that the Government would not allow it to fall below acceptable levels. I would point out that the regular Defence Service personnel in this country today are outnumbered two to one by a crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The infantry that we could put into the field within three months is outnumbered 20 to one by the paid-up members of the Collingwood Football Club. That puts into perspective the situation of our defence forces at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> I will return to my speech. I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate on these Appropriation Bills and I will use this time to discuss a number of concerns I have with the economic policies and direction of the Hawke-Keating Government. I find this Government's approach to solving economic problems fascinating-in fact, I find the Government's approach to solving economic problems quite unbelievable. I do not understand the logic behind this Government's approach to economic policy, and I do not understand how a Labor Government can be such a generous friend to big business and yet have policies which are so oppressive to small business. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's record is one of double standards. Since its election in 1983 this Government has been a good friend of big business, an even better friend of the trade union movement and the trade union bureaucrats and an outright enemy of small business. Yet it was small business that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) called `the engine room' of the Australian economy when he wrote to small businesses in my electorate during the 1987 election campaign. It would be a gross understatement to say that the Treasurer's rhetoric has not been matched by his actions. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has very close links with the trade union movement. The Government speaks of the accord. I speak of the Government's betrayal of its duty to the Australian people. This Government's links with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) go far beyond what is acceptable to the majority of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> When Australians elected the Australian Labor Party (ALP) to office they did not expect, or want, the ACTU to play such an important and decisive role in the decision making process of government. But, of course, the ALP must pay back favours to its mates in the unions-at ALP preselections union representatives comprise 60 per cent of delegates. The Government should govern for all Australians, not just for its mates in big business or for its very good mates in the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, as part of an expansive micro-economic reform package, should be thinking about saving jobs and creating jobs. The Government's figures grossly understate the level of unemployment facing this country-the problem is far worse than the Government will admit. The Government's statistics do not tell the real story-that many businesses cannot afford to pay redundancy packages so they keep their doors open until, finally, they go to the wall. This is of course detrimental to the workers because they do not get their redundancy payments and, in many cases, they do not even get their holiday pay. Yet, to protect its mates in the union movement, the Government refuses to discard the centralised wage fixing system that belongs to an era long past. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment should be a major concern of the trade union movement and a Labor government, but it is not. The Hawke-Keating Government and the ACTU do not care about the thousands upon thousands of Australians who are becoming unemployment statistics. They do not care about the thousands and thousands of young Australians who are being denied the opportunity of finding a job when they leave school-and all this is part of the Treasurer's recession that we had to have. It is all a part of the recession which, to start with, this Treasurer said was not going to occur. The Treasurer's incompetence never ceases to amaze me. I urge honourable members to read the Treasurer's rhetoric in last year's Budget speech. Page 1 states, `Economic policy has worked and is working'. If it was not so serious it would be laughable. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I wish to bring to the attention of honourable members some statistics concerning youth unemployment in my home town of Melbourne. Last week Senator Michael Baume, the shadow Minister for youth affairs, released figures which stated that the level of youth unemployment in Melbourne is grossly understated by the Government's figures. Senator Baume's figures suggest that the real level of unemployment in Melbourne for people aged 15 to 19 years is around 45 per cent and not the 27 per cent claimed by the Federal Government. Young Australians, and in particular young Victorians, can thank the incompetence of the Federal and the State Labor governments for this national disgrace. For too many young Australians `the lucky country' is something that they will only read about in history books. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer knows very well that significant changes are required in the labour market if we, as a nation, are to improve our productivity and consequently improve the prospects for employment. However, he also knows that the radical reforms required will always be vetoed by the institutional forces built into any Labor government-the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to advance into the next century and become part of the world economic community, we must move away from the current centralised wage fixing system and adopt a system of enterprise bargaining-real enterprise bargaining and not the enterprise bullying that this mob speaks of. But while we have this Government in office, its accord with the trade union movement will remain a barrier to all worthwhile reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> As one who comes to this place with first-hand knowledge of industry, I am aware of the current crisis facing industry and, in particular, the manufacturing sector. In this instance I am speaking about small manufacturing industry. It is weighed down by an antiquated labour system; wages are determined by a centralised system with little reference to productivity; work practices belong in another century; taxes are ever increasing; and business confidence is at an all-time low. The current system is closing down businesses at an unprecedented rate and as a result unemployment will continue to increase. </PARA>
<PARA> Bankruptcy figures released on 24 April reveal that between January and March this year 3,434 businesses in Australia folded or went into voluntary arrangements. The Treasurer must realise that behind every one of these bankruptcies there are many people who have lost their jobs, their homes and, in many cases, their families-so the problem is of a much more serious nature.</PARA>
<PARA> It is of particular interest to note that the States with the biggest increases in bankruptcies all have Labor governments. Victoria recorded a 75.2 per cent increase, Queensland had a 60.2 per cent increase while Western Australia had a 59.1 per cent increase. For the people who have lost their businesses and the people who have consequently lost their jobs, the Treasurer's recent talk of a recovery is a cruel hoax. </PARA>
<PARA> Other micro-economic reforms which are required in order to boost this nation's productivity must include changes to work practices. In this speech I wish to highlight some of the rorts which occur on the Australian waterfront. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), has, in the past, highlighted the following rorts: in 1991, two drivers are still required to operate a crane that has one seat and three levers; in 1991, waterfront gangs still draw for `nick-off' days where the lucky winner can return home on a full day's pay; in 1991, 14 waterside workers still front up to perform the task of bulk unloading of commodities-a task which actually needs just three workers; in 1991, dust allowances, hot weather allowances and wet weather allowances are still paid to drivers who are operating in closed air-conditioned cabins; and in 1991, two extra `spare' men are still employed on each vessel in some ports and these `spare' men have no jobs and are not allowed to be employed, even if a job arises during their shift. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is outrageous. What an amazing story to place before this House and, unfortunately, these examples of rorts are not isolated cases. They all impact on Australia's productivity, they all have a major impact on wages and the costs are inevitably passed on to the consumer. Waterside workers are a privileged class in Australia and this Government has extended those privileges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the 1989-90 financial year the average weekly earnings for wharfies had climbed to $750.36 per week against the all-industries average weekly earnings of $542.30. They have since climbed to $824 for the year ended 31 March 1991. For this amount they actually worked an average of 26.7 hours per week. On top of that, their superannuation arrangements have employers contributing 12.65 per cent of base wages compared with 3 per cent employer contributions in most other industries. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the industry get in return for such excesses? Sadly, the answer is complete inefficiency. Container movements on Australian wharves are 12 an hour while in Singapore there are 25 an hour and in Taiwan there are 30 an hour. If the Port of Melbourne were to double its efficiency, it would still be considerably less efficient than the Port of Singapore. The source of this information is the Victorian Minister for Industry, David White-a Labor Minister-who has pointed out that it takes between 103 to 107 separate pieces of paper to shift one container in the Port of Melbourne. While this inefficiency flourishes, the Hawke Government procrastinates about reform and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) stitches up further pay increases for his mates on the wharves. </PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of my speech I said that this Government was out of touch with the problems facing our economy. It has put the cart before the horse. It expects the recovery to come from the private sector, yet it does nothing but hinder its progress. When is this Government going to start removing some of the obstacles facing industry in this country? When is it going to do something about the many taxes and charges confronting businesses? Company tax, trainee guarantee contribution tax, sales taxes, taxes on bank accounts, long service payments and holiday pay loadings-the list is endless. Add to these the many taxes and charges levied by State Governments, such as payroll tax and Workcare costs, and one is talking about an economic nightmare for small businesses in this country. This Government has displayed a total lack of desire to implement any worthwhile reforms. To the contrary, the Government has added to the burden. </PARA>
<PARA> To illustrate my point, I refer honourable members to a report in the Melbourne Sun-Herald of 19 April 1991 where the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) is reported to be calling on employers to offer bonuses to workers with good attendance records in an effort to discourage sickies. The Minister was also reported as supporting the idea that workers suffering from alcohol and drug problems should be given paid leave to get treatment. The Minister is obviously totally unaware of the costs already facing small businesses-he totally disregards or has no knowledge of the fact that each day businesses are closing their doors, many as a direct result of this Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I state quite clearly that Australia is facing a crisis. It is unquestionably the worst small business crisis since the Second World War and irreparable damage has been done to the small business community by this Government. At the same time we are facing the worst rural crisis since the 1930s. Unemployment is exploding with many young Australians facing the bleak prospect of dole queues. The Australian dream of owning one's own home has been taken away from many Australians and our standard of living is declining at a rapid rate. Our gross foreign debt has grown to $165 billion with every Australian now owing $9,114 as part share of this debt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment tonight on the International Wool Secretariat (IWS). In this regard I am delighted that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has come into the House especially to hear my speech. The farming community is concerned that too much money is being spent in this area and that the IWS is becoming too remote, servicing the elite end of the market-the West European cocktail circuit. There is a feeling that perhaps Australia should pull out, go it alone on promotion and promote only Australian wool.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before we consider these issues seriously we should look at what the IWS has done in the past, particularly in light of the serious plight of the woolgrowers today. The aim of the IWS is to improve the long term income of woolgrowers by increasing worldwide demand for wool. The IWS was founded in 1937 with three original members; namely, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. In 1970 Uruguay joined that trio, and between the four of them they now supply 80 per cent of all wool traded internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that 97 per cent of Australia's wool production is exported, although most of the wool we use domestically is actually imported because of our small carpet wool production. The headquarters of the IWS are in London, though it has its process and product development centre in Ilkley in Yorkshire. It also has an international wool fashion office in Paris, which serves all the apparel fashion services, and at Delft in Holland it has its knitting and styling workshop. Altogether it has 40 operating branches around the world, divided into five main areas; namely, America, Asia, western Europe, eastern Europe and developing countries. In total it employs 950 staff, so it is a big operation. It is concerned overall with product development, styling, fashion, product marketing, publicity, market information, planning and quality control. In other words, it is involved at all stages of the processing and distribution wool pipeline. </PARA>
<PARA> The IWS is an unincorporated association of the four wool boards or corporations of the countries I mentioned earlier. The constitution it now works under was finalised on 16 September 1986 and is subject to English law. It has a couple of spin-offs: the IWS Nominee Co. Ltd, which holds the assets of the IWS and also the Woolmark registrations, and it has the Wool Development International Ltd, which is concerned with the sale, distribution and licensing of technologies and equipment developed from the research centre at Ilkley. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth looking at the IWS board. It has a chairman, currently Hugh Beggs, who will step down shortly. The arrangement whereby the Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) is the chairman of the IWS has been in place since 1961. As well as that, there are 13 other members of the board. Six of them are Australians, coming from the Australian Wool Corporation, three from New Zealand, three from the South African wool board and one from Uruguay. I think it is remarkable that this board only meets once a year. There is, of course, a board committee of nine members plus a non-voting managing director. The chairman of the IWS heads the board committee. There are four other members, one from each member country, and four other members on top of that, two of whom come from Australia, so that Australia provides at least four of the nine members. They meet five times a year. Their job is to run the functions of the board in between the annual meetings of the IWS board proper.</PARA>
<PARA> That IWS board has various committees under it. I realise this is getting very complicated, but it is worth outlining this. There is a board committee, an audit committee, a research policy committee and a research and development coordination and advisory committee. The Australian members have the job of reporting back to the Wool Council and the Wool Corporation on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In his very useful report, Sir William Vines makes certain comments on the IWS-AWC relationship. He says that that relationship is largely harmonious but that:</PARA>
<PARA>From time to time there have been strains at staff levels on specific issues. </PARA>
<PARA>He refers to comments that the Wool Council made of the IWS. He said that it has concerns about `the economic capability of the IWS' and `the objectivity of certain statistical indicators of performance'. He also says that IWS staff have various complaints about the Wool Council. They have complained that `the AWC's attempts to influence them can be excessive' and that `the AWC staff do not always have a correct understanding of international marketing and promotion issues'. In addition to this, the Vines committee considers that `the board of the IWS has not provided effective direction and oversight of the organisation'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Vines committee also believes that the IWS board structure does not serve the organisation well and points out that most of the functions of the IWS board have been delegated to the IWS board committee, which I spoke of earlier and which meets five times per year. Vines says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is apparent that the Board has failed to provide on a continuous basis the degree of guidance, direction and oversight of the organisation that would be regarded as necessary and normal in a commercial company engaged in a similar business. The problem has been exacerbated by the practice within the AWC of rotating membership of the IWS Board. Further, because all members of the Board and of the Committee are resident in the Southern Hemisphere, they cannot be in touch on a regular, continuous basis with the markets in which the IWS operates. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very important quotation. He goes on to say that the membership has a strong grower bias and that the committee strongly believes that the IWS board should, in the main, be comprised of people with proven skills in international marketing and promotion, finance or the management of large international organisations. Further he says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee considers it inappropriate for the Chairperson of the AWC to be also the Chairperson of the IWS. There is a clear conflict between the two positions which must make it difficult for the Chairperson of the AWC to be critical of policies in IWS or of its performance. </PARA>
<PARA>Vines goes on to recommend that the IWS board be made up of 13 members. He says that there should be eight core members, three coming from the Australian Wool Promotion Committee. Of course, that will not be set up; it will be a sort of AWC mark 2. He says that the views of those three should always prevail. Naturally, they will be Australian members. He says that it is important that they come from those skilled in marketing, promotion, finance and international business-in other words, they will not be necessarily grower members. Of the other five members of that core committee, he says that two should come from the New Zealand Wool Board, two from the South African Wool Board and one from the Uruguayan equivalent. </PARA>
<PARA> He also makes the interesting recommendation that three members be appointed from the Northern Hemisphere who are experts in marketing, finance, textile industry or multinational business. In particular, he recommends that one come from western Europe, one from North America and one from North Asia. He says that the chairman should come from those three Northern Hemisphere countries and be elected on stature and suitability. The chairman would not have a casting vote. That is a very interesting recommendation because there would be many in Australia, particularly amongst Australian woolgrowers, who would perhaps feel uncomfortable that we would be losing control of the IWS board if that took place. </PARA>
<PARA> He also recommends that a managing director be appointed by the board to sit on the IWS board, so there would be 12 in total. Their job would be to monitor the performance and assess the success or failure of the IWS's specific programs and activities. Sir William Vines makes further recommendations on what will become the Australian Wool Corporation mark 2 and the Wool Council-that they `ensure that growers are as well informed as possible about IWS objectives and performance'. I would concur with that entirely. That has fallen down in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, he states that `the IWS be responsible for wool promotion in Australia' instead of the AWC doing that, as has been the case in the past. That is a sensible recommendation, although I would not want to see that Australian promotion section subsumed or overshadowed, if we are to be included in the wider Asian sector. That is something to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> Vines also recommends that woolgrowers should be enabled to vote on any proposed changes to the apportionment of the wool tax. He says that this would give added accountability of the IWS and would give growers the power of veto over changes to IWS funding levels. That suggestion has merit, although before I would fully endorse it we should look carefully at the cost of doing that. I know that in the meat marketing area it costs the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation about $100,000 just to maintain the register, so we would not want to rush headlong into such a proposition without looking at it carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's contribution to IWS funding comes from 3 1/2 per cent of the total levy charged to woolgrowers. That tax levy is devoted to promotion. In 1989-90, total IWS funding from all countries was $261.4m-a considerable amount of money. Of that, Australia contributed $188.6m, or 72.3 per cent of the total budget; New Zealand contributed $50.8m, or 19.5 per cent of the budget; South Africa contributed $19m, or 7.3 per cent of the budget; and Uruguay contributed $2.2m, or 0.9 per cent of the budget. There was a residual adjustment of 0.8 per cent. If that total amount is translated into what it costs each of the 60,000 Australian growers, on average each grower is paying $3,000 per year to the IWS. As some people are running only 10 or 20 sheep, obviously the average dinky-di grower is contributing much more. When at least $60 per week is outlaid to the IWS, a grower would be entitled to know something about how it is functioning. That has not been the case in the past.</PARA>
<PARA> If one interviewed the average Australian grower on what he knew about the IWS, one would find that he knew very little because he has heard very little back in the past. The IWS has a base budget amount. It has a matrix system of funding and an additional funding segment. Vines comments that this is very complex and difficult to administer and should be simplified. That idea may well have merit. The IWS has undertaken in recent months a new promotion strategy. Previously it was putting about two-thirds of its effort into value and one-third into volume building, but that percentage has been reversed due to the recent collapse in the wool market. </PARA>
<PARA> Vines, in commenting on the IWS, makes some other interesting observations. He talks about the Woolmark, which, of course, is used on pure wool products that are sold. He says that the Woolmark is rarely used on casual lines and rarely used on lines that go out into the young market-the teenagers and 20-year-olds-which is the large volume market. That is something to be very mindful of. </PARA>
<PARA> Vines makes a comment on one of the people who put submissions to the inquiry. That person said that what was needed was a `snappier, more colourful and fashionable' image. Vines, in dealing with that in his report, said that perhaps we need a new Woolmark in this country. We do have a wool blend mark, which can be used when a garment has 55 per cent or more of wool in it, but that is rarely used and not too many people know about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Nowadays, with new technologies, wool can play an important part in a garment which has as little as 20, 30 or 40 per cent wool. Vines recommends that we look at instituting a Casuwool mark, which would be used for the more casual products, and wool could then get the credit for the percentage that it contributes. We could have a Casuwool 30, Casuwool 40 or Casuwool 50, for example, for a 30, 40 or 50 per cent wool contribution. That would supplement or perhaps replace the wool blend mark, which is not used so much now. That idea has considerable merit and I would certainly endorse it. </PARA>
<PARA> Some have been very critical of the IWS and have made comments, for example, that more marketing innovation is needed. Of its total $261m funding, 51 per cent-in other words, $133m-goes into advertising. It is pertinent to contemplate that that is three to four times greater than the amount Qantas Airways Ltd spends or that is spent on Foster's beer. </PARA>
<PARA> Wool needs positioning in the market with advertising campaigns more than it has been. We should be looking to set the image for wool for the next 10 years. People have commented to me that too much money goes on busybodies running around the world promoting wool in an inappropriate fashion, which ends up selling very little extra wool. Some say that private research people involved in processing wool in Italy, for example, are well ahead of what is done at Ilkley and that the people at Ilkley are, in a sense, reinventing the wheel, even with a product like cool wool. Another person has commented to me that spinners and knitters are being bribed to use the Woolmark symbol and that we need greater coordination in what is happening with marketing around the world so that we do not waste some of this money. </PARA>
<PARA> In my final comments I would like to get back to the information available within the IWS not getting back to the growers. The IWS report to 30 June 1990 says:</PARA>
<PARA>Wool also lost competitiveness against other fibres in some important markets, particularly the US and Western Europe, as earlier wool price increases fed through the textile manufacturing and retail systems. This was reflected in increased fibre substitution in blending. </PARA>
<PARA>The report was referring to the 1989 year. Had growers known about that and had they also learned that the market for textiles as a whole was weakening and that there was a declining interest in fashion evident amongst many consumers-had that sort of information been getting back-I do not think there would have been the headlong rush into wool that we saw in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the wool industry should be looking for new ideas and new textures to give it a marketing edge into fibre competition. More fibre blending has led to new effects and new synthetic fibres are coming out, including what are called the microfibres. All this is putting pressure on pure wool and on the Woolmark merchandising. United States wool usage halted because of the trade reaction to the higher prices, as happened in the developing countries. All this is reported in IWS reports, but it has not been getting back to growers. Had that information got back clearer and earlier than it did, I think we would not have had the trouble we have had. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, in deciding over the coming weeks how we will structure the wool industry for the future, I believe it is vital that the role of the IWS be properly defined and considered if the full potential of the promotion and marketing dollar that the Australian woolgrower contributes is to be fully realised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the feelings of the last speaker, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), but I feel I should say one or two things. I agree very much with many of the things he said about the International Wool Secretariat (IWS). As he well knows, the Government is well and truly at arm's length from that organisation and the only influence that the growers have had has been through the Australian Wool Corporation and thereby through its members' membership of the IWS board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that Sir William Vines has made many observations about the International Wool Secretariat. Part of the reason I have established a new Australian Wool Corporation is so I could give it the key job of looking at all questions relating to marketing and promotion. There is under way a restructuring of the International Wool Secretariat that has come about mainly because of some shortage of funds-New Zealand's funds are down $20m this year, for example-but there has been a need for a reorientation for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of work is now going into the middle market and into trying to draw the IWS together. I feel as frustrated as the honourable gentleman does, because there is no way that he, I or the growers can directly influence the IWS. I would not say that the Corporation has been making anything other than its best efforts, but we simply have to do better. Any criticism, as has been put forward by the honourable member for Parkes, should be regarded by everyone as being quite constructive. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Research and Development Corporation, as part of the new structure, being to one side of the old Wool Corporation and the new Wool Corporation, will have a much bigger influence in driving the necessary marketing research, as well as production and textile research, so that growers and the board of the new Corporation are far better equipped to deal with the International Wool Secretariat under the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> For a long time I have had the view that there have been gaps in the way information has been passed backwards and forwards and that we needed a more cohesive structure. In addition, with the Australian Wool Industry Council, for the first time, other than with the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council, all the players and actors in the Australian wool industry, including exporters and people with overseas connections who understand what is happening in the marketplace out there in the world where we sell our wool, will have a role and an input. I think a lot more information will come through in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> There has always been a fear by many people in the wool producing industry that these people have a vested interest in getting at them somehow and taking an edge on a market with the information they obtain. But very little information leaked out of the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council and, if we can focus on some of those generic issues in the new Wool Industry Council, with the right information flows, growers will have a little better idea of what is being done on their behalf. I certainly hope that we get that situation, because what the honourable member has pointed to concerns many people. </PARA>
<PARA> There are always many allegations about money being wasted on research. I have always taken the rather robust view that one cannot do good research without wasting a bit of money. There has been an allegation around that people have been bribed to use the Woolmark. I can find absolutely no evidence of that at all. When Dr John McPhee, the Director of the International Wool Secretariat, was out here recently, he explained how that may have arisen, but from what I can find from other sources there is no truth in that. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one other point, on behalf of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). I would like to provide some information in response to a request from the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who sought further explanation of an item of proposed defence expenditure. That additional $29.6m required for defence capital facilities is attributable in the main to the general downturn of the building and construction industry. The downturn has resulted in much keener competition among contractors and subcontractors, leading to shorter construction periods being achieved across the board. In addition, the continuing commercialisation of the Department of Administrative Services' Australian Construction Services has led to significantly improved performance in the design and tendering of defence facilities. In other words, the Department of Defence has been able to spend the funds appropriated for capital facilities more quickly than anticipated at Budget time. I trust that that explanation is of help to the honourable member who raised the question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight this House is debating three social security Bills-the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill, the Social Security Amendment Bill and the Social Security (Rewrite) Transition Bill. I would like to deal with each of these Bills separately. Firstly, I refer to the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill. This Bill seeks to replace the current regime of income support to the unemployed with a new approach that was announced in February 1990 in the economic statement just prior to the election of that year. Unemployment benefits will be replaced by an expanded Job Search allowance-currently available only to those under 18 years-for all persons unemployed for up to 12 months and thereafter by a restructured Newstart allowance. The intended start-up date is 1 July 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The changes represent the centrepiece of the Government's so-called active employment strategy which is designed to provide more active income support for the unemployed, with recipients being required to undertake training and other relevant activities in exchange for payment. The approach marks a shift from traditional passive income support. Job Search allowees who have been registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service for 12 months will be permitted to go onto the Newstart allowance. However, the transfer will not be automatic, as an application will need to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the second reading hyperbole of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), on behalf of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), that the Bill would implement one of the most significant changes to the Australian system of social security since the 1940s, it falls far short of a truly active employment strategy for welfare recipients. In many respects, it merely formalises existing practices. For many of the unemployed it will be largely business as usual. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Government's economic policies unemployment is forecast to rise further as more and more businesses fail, interest and inflation rates rise, our productivity and competitiveness decrease and the Australian Labor Party kowtows to the demands of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's March industry statement failed to show any understanding of the magnitude of Australia's current problems. It supplied no new forecasts which would reflect the seriousness of our situation. It offered no explanation as to what went wrong in the past. It offered no adjustment to macro policy. Sadly, Labor's economic policies continue to provide for growth only in unemployment, insolvency and foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention here the Government's current attitude towards employment of people with disabilities. Sheltered workshops around the country are under threat of de-funding because they do not meet the principles and objectives of the Disability Services Act. My colleagues and I have received many letters from parents and service providers protesting about the Government's quiet phasing out of these much needed services. I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table, would have received these complaints also. They all say the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the aim of encouraging people with disabilities to live and work in the community with minimum supervision is laudable, it is not a practical answer to the overall problems, as it does not take into account the present rate of high unemployment, which, in the unlikely case of job availability, would naturally favour the able-bodied and able-minded applicant. It does not take into account either the difficulties faced by the handicapped employee who, in the case of failure to adjust to either an everyday workplace or social situation, does not have the security of the sheltered workshop to return to in times of trouble. Instead, responsibility would fall back onto the parent. Without organised activity and social contact that failure would become a repeated but gradual pattern of regression. </PARA>
<PARA> The Disability Services Act does not take into account the needs of the profoundly and intellectually handicapped, whose skills and behaviour levels, despite intensive training, will never, now or in the future, reach a high enough standard to enable them to live or work independently in the community. When will the Minister listen to the parents and skilled service providers and ease their fears by stating categorically that there is, and always will be, a need for sheltered workshops for some of the people with disabilities and ensure their continued funding?</PARA>
<PARA> There is an inconsistency with, on the one hand, one Minister stating that jobs are universally available to people with disabilities and yet denying these people access in the Public Service and in his own Department and, on the other hand, another Minister making provision for a huge influx of able unemployed because the jobs are just not available. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to this Bill. Although it is relatively long-but, I am pleased to say, in the new plain English style-much of it is taken up with a restatement of existing practices but under new names. The main features are as follows. The first one is that allowances are to be open ended. The maximum time a client can spend on the Job Search allowance will be 12 months, but there will be no time limit on the Newstart allowance. Unlike the practice in many other countries, this new approach continues to allow indefinite receipt of income support, albeit after jumping a few more low hurdles. The principle of potentially permanent receipt of what was originally intended to be a temporary or transitional payment between jobs fundamentally changes the nature of the benefit, and will send misleading signals to those starting out on social security. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe it is very important that there be a sense of urgency, as long as adequate income support arrangements are in place for those who remain unable to find employment. The coalition's Economic Action Plan of October 1989 proposed that unemployment benefits would only be available for nine months, during which time counselling and access to training programs would be available. We still maintain that allowing for the payment of a relatively short fixed term benefit for nine months, followed by a more rigorously determined discretionary payment, would provide more incentive to people to find a job. We stress though that no-one genuinely in need will miss out on benefits. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Adelaide would not know what I mean. I now want to speak about the Newstart allowance. To be eligible for Newstart allowance, a person must be at least 18 years of age but below pension age, an Australian resident and in Australia and registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) as unemployed for longer than 12 months. Newstart allowees will also be required to enter into a Newstart activity agreement with the CES, which will oblige unemployed people to undertake various activities designed to increase their chances of gaining employment. Acceptable activities will include limited paid employment, training and education programs and voluntary work, as well as Job Search.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The agreement is the centrepiece of the Government's proposal. It is a step in the right direction, but it merely formalises the requirements that currently exist-although they may not always have been applied-for the receipt of income support. Also, much will depend on the extent to which such undertakings are monitored. The current activities test often means in practice that an applicant is required to nominate two potential employers approached for work within the last fortnight, but no effort is made to validate the claims. There is no time limit by which an agreement must be reached, and it will be possible to receive the Newstart allowance without an agreement having been concluded. </PARA>
<PARA> This state of affairs is most unsatisfactory, although it will protect clients where agreements are not reached due to, for instance, inadequate staffing levels in the CES. We believe that payments of Newstart allowance should be cancelled after two months if the client has not successfully negotiated an agreement with the CES, and it can be shown that failure to do so is due to the applicant acting unreasonably in the circumstances. What we are looking for is much more positive and much more active than what the Government is putting up at the moment. We shall be moving an amendment to this effect at the committee stage. I should like to add here that the Opposition welcomes the fact that Newstart allowees will be permitted to engage in voluntary work, although I am disappointed that those on Job Search allowance (JSA) do not have to meet such a requirement or are even able to carry out that voluntary work. </PARA>
<PARA> During the debate on the social security legislation just last year, I mentioned the case of a young person in my own electorate who was told by the CES that she was forbidden to do any voluntary work while receiving the Job Search allowance, and that she had to apply for two-and only two-jobs a fortnight. The CES worker told her mother that she would be unable to apply for her two jobs if doing other work, and if she was found to be doing the same, her allowances would be terminated immediately. How does the Government reconcile this approach with the new requirements that, to receive Newstart allowance, applicants are obliged to undertake various activities designed to increase the chances of gaining employment? `Acceptable activities' include limited paid employment, training and education programs and voluntary work, as well as Job Search. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the 12 months unemployment requirement, only after a person has become one of the long term unemployed will more intensive use of the CES be required of Job Search/Newstart allowees. The Department has acknowledged that 12 months was chosen arbitrarily as a `nice round figure' for determining the point of intervention. We believe that earlier intervention is far more appropriate to arrest falling morale and rusting skills, despite the fact that the earlier the intervention, the more expensive the exercise. If it succeeds in getting an applicant back into the work force at an earlier date, then there is an overall saving both in funding and in the morale of the client. The Government's proposed approach is curative rather than preventive. We believe that CES intervention should be made available to Job Search recipients after six months, and we shall be moving an amendment to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the role of the CES, the requirement for a minimum period of registration with the CES of 12 months before being eligible for the Newstart allowance is curious, given the unreliability and often irrelevance of CES data. The Department of Employment, Education and Training itself, which administers the CES, admits that such data are `neither an accurate measure of unemployment nor a reliable indication of changes in unemployment'. </PARA>
<PARA> This assessment has been reiterated by the Department of Social Security (DSS). Thus, it will be possible for someone who has not been unemployed according to the definition applied by the DSS-that is, actively searching for work-but who has been registered with the CES as unemployed, to go straight on to the Newstart allowance and receive the associated prioritised access to training programs. This implies poor targeting of training program assistance and, hence, an unnecessary waste of public money. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the DSS definition of unemployment is far tighter than that used by the CES, and checking of residents occurs far more regularly. We believe that for this reason it would be more appropriate to make access to the Newstart allowance dependent upon having JSA or unemployment benefits for nine months, and we shall be moving an amendment to this effect. To be eligible for the Job Search allowance, a person must be at least 16 years of age but below age pension age; an Australian resident and in Australia; registered with the CES as unemployed; and under 18 years of age or, if over 18, not having been registered with the CES for 12 months or more. For those aged 16 to 18 years, the rate of JSA will be the same as is paid now. For those over 18, the rate of JSA paid will be the equivalent to current unemployment benefit rates. As I mentioned earlier, the requirements relating to registration with CES rather than receipt of unemployment benefits is inappropriate. We shall be moving an amendment to the effect that applicants will be eligible for the Job Search allowance if they have not received JSA unemployment benefits for more than nine months. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the proposals concerning the rules for the sick unemployed whereby those who fall sick will be allowed to remain on Job Search allowance-and be excused from the activity test-for up to six weeks, after which an application would need to be made for sickness benefits. For Newstart allowees the period of grace will be 13 weeks. Taking clients off one benefit to put them on another for short periods, as was previously the case, is administratively costly and pointless when both benefits are paid at exactly the same rate. </PARA>
<PARA> I now address the issue of relaxed reporting requirements for older unemployed workers. Unemployed people aged between 55 years and the relevant age pension age, who have been continuously in receipt of a DSS pension for the previous 12 months, will be excused from having to report to DSS fortnightly on their Job Search activities. We are advised that reporting in such cases will be required at intervals of up to 12 weeks. While this provision may be reasonable given the poor work prospects of this group, especially in this Labor-engineered recession, we believe it is wrong to consign such persons so readily to the unemployment scrap heap, particularly if they are capable of work. They should at least be encouraged to undertake community based work projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The liquid assets test for unemployed benefits was introduced late last year in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. The test allows for an additional four-week waiting period for unemployment benefits if an applicant is single with no dependants and has $5,000 more in liquid assets-that is, shares, debentures and deposits with financial institutions; or if the applicant has a spouse and/or dependent children and has $10,000 in liquid assets. The liquid assets of a spouse are also taken into consideration and, where the applicant has transferred liquid assets to his or her children in the four weeks preceding a claim for unemployment benefits, the transfer is taken not to have occurred. This provision is to apply to applicants for Job Search allowance and Newstart allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> During the debate on the Social Security 1990 Bill, the Opposition moved an amendment to rectify a very obvious loophole so that an applicant could not, within three months of the lodgment of the claim, dispose of liquid assets to anyone other than his or her spouse or children for less than adequate consideration without being caught by the liquid assets test. We intend to reintroduce that amendment so that those who dispose of liquid assets for less than adequate consideration to any person in the three months prior to lodging a claim for either JSA or Newstart are caught by the liquid assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for a deferment period of two weeks for initial payments of JSA and Newstart where a person becomes unemployed as a consequence of a voluntary action without sufficient reason, that is, for resigning from work because it was no longer interesting; misconduct, for example, sacked for stealing from the employer; or for refusal of a suitable job offer. The deferment period rises by multiples of six weeks with each incidence of misconduct, sufficient reason or refusal of a suitable job offer. So, for example, where a person applies for JSA or Newstart for the fourth time in three years, having been sacked for misconduct each time, the deferment period before any payments will be made would be 24 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures provide an obvious incentive for people to retain current employment or to accept employment where an offer is made. But do they go far enough? By comparison, recent changes in New Zealand allow for deferment periods of 26 weeks if a person becomes unemployed through misconduct, leaves employment voluntarily or refuses two job offers organised by the New Zealand employment services. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the coalition's Economic Action Plan of 1989 recommended deferment of benefits for voluntary unemployment depending on the number of previous episodes. We welcome the Government's decision to adopt our policy approach in regard to voluntary unemployment and we support the extension of the deferral regime to misconduct and refusing to accept a job offer. However, we believe the adequacy of these disincentives should be subject to ongoing review. </PARA>
<PARA> We now come to changes to employment entry payments. Employment entry payments will now be made to JSA or Newstart allowees as long as they have been registered with the CES for 12 months or more. Currently such payments are made to those who have been on unemployment benefits for 12 months or more. The employment entry payment is currently $100 for those over 18 years of age and $50 for those below. It is designed to cover the initial costs associated with starting work and is paid just prior to the commencement of work. </PARA>
<PARA> For the reasons I have already outlined, CES unemployment duration data is unreliable. We believe it would be more satisfactory to provide the entry payment to those entering work who have been in receipt of JSA or Newstart for 12 months, and we shall be moving an amendment to this effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I should like to comment on the financial impact statement contained in the explanatory memorandum. This statement is obviously inadequate. It is merely a repeat of the February 1990 economic statement and is, therefore, hopelessly out of date since it does not take into account the recent dramatic downturn in the labour market, a critically important circumstance in a Bill dealing with a restructuring of income support to the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Even then the projected net savings were extremely modest: $400,000 in 1990-91 and net savings of around $12m in subsequent years. The 1990-91 figure assumes payment savings of $16m, despite the fact that the scheme will not come into effect until the following year. According to DSS the savings will result from a non-legislated tightening of the activity test for JSA and unemployment benefits from January 1991. DSS claims that the estimates for expanded labour market program costs and JSA-Newstart savings have not been updated are difficult to believe. It is more likely that the recession has caused a significant negative blow-out in the net cost to revenue. The Minister should explain these apparent failings in the financial impact statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security (Rewrite) Transition Bill 1991 makes no policy changes. It is technical in nature and is aimed at ensuring a smooth transition from the Social Security Act 1947 to the plain English Social Security Act 1991. The Act comprises 600 pages with over 2,000 pages of explanations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill's four specific objectives are: the repeal of the 1947 Act; the provision of transition arrangements from the 1947 Act to the 1991 Act; the consolidation of applicable savings provisions; and the making of consequential amendments to other Acts. The Bill ensures that any pension, benefit or allowance under the 1991 Act that has the same name as a pension, benefit or allowance under the 1947 Act, and vice versa, corresponds to that other pension, benefit or allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions are also made so that a claim for a pension, benefit or allowance made under the 1947 Act which is not determined as at 1 July 1991 will have effect from that date as if the claim had been made under the 1991 Act. Similar provisions are made for applications for employment entry payments and a range of other services provided by social security to its clients. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall not go through the Bill clause by clause, save to say that each clause is written in plain English and is easily understandable, unlike so many Bills of a technical nature. The Bill has no financial impact, and we intend to support it. As I mentioned before, I wish the Government would put the Taxation Assessment Act in the same type of language. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill, the Social Security Amendment Bill 1991, proposes a number of minor policy and technical amendments to social security legislation. Among the more significant of the proposals are, firstly, that certain scholarships are to be exempted from income tests. Scholarships awarded from overseas to cover training and education, but not living expenses, and which are approved by the Minister will be excluded from the pension income test. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Social Security has indicated that the impetus for this initiative came largely from the case of Mary Guy, a Tasmanian invalid pensioner who won a $100 a week scholarship from the Leichenstein Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists. Such payments are currently not excluded from the pension income test. As a result Ms Guy had her invalid pension significantly reduced, although the scholarship was awarded to assist her in purchasing materials for her artwork. The case received considerable publicity, and rightly so. It is just another example of the Government's inflexibility in the implementation of its policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal will be introduced retrospectively to 1 September, presumably to cover Ms Guy who was awarded her scholarship on 10 September 1990 and, given the very small number of pensioners likely to be awarded such scholarships, it is not likely to have any significant financial impact. We support this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, regarding the primacy of Commonwealth legislation in the recovery of overpayments from compensation claims, a recent Supreme Court of Victoria decision cast doubt on whether the existing Social Security Act permits the Commonwealth to recover social security payments, such as sickness benefits from compensation lump sum payments where State or Territory legislation makes such payments inalienable. The proposed amendment will assert the primacy of Commonwealth legislation over State and Territory legislation to allow the Department of Social Security to recover payments from clients once compensation has been paid. It will have only a small financial impact: savings of $3m in 1991-92 and $3m in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of individuals awaiting payment of compensation arising from injury received, the usual practice is for the Department of Social Security to pay sickness benefits to tide them over until compensation is paid. Once compensation has been paid the Department recovers the benefits that have been paid from the lump sum received. The Supreme Court of Victoria decision has put in doubt the legality of recoverability in some circumstances. This proposal merely acts to reassert what has been current practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, regarding changes in the treatment of funeral bonds, moneys invested in funeral bonds will be exempt from the pension assets test provided that the bond has a contribution limit of $5,000 or less per funeral, or $10,000 or less in the case of the funerals of a married couple. Where income from such bonds is not payable until maturity-that is, on the death of the investor-it will be exempted from the pension income test. </PARA>
<PARA> Many funeral directors offer prepaid funeral schemes into which investors are able to make contributions towards the cost of their funerals. Pensioners' funds held in such schemes are currently exempt from the pension assets test. Some investment companies have begun to offer funeral bonds also for the purpose of prepaying for funerals. Income does accrue on such bonds. This proposal will allow the same treatment for pension assets and income tests to be accorded to pensioners who choose to contribute to funeral bonds as to those who choose to invest directly with a particular funeral director. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the provision of legal basis for payment variations or cancellations performed by computer, will provide a legal mechanism for cancelling, varying or suspending certain social security payments through the use of the computer. Any such changes to payments will be taken to have been made because of a determination by the secretary. Only those changes which have no discretionary elements, such as the ceasing of payment of the sole parent pension when the youngest dependant child reaches the age of 16 or where a review form is not returned, will be effected by computer. All such computer determinations on behalf of the secretary will be reviewable. </PARA>
<PARA> In so far as computer initiated changes to payment will be changed with no discretionary content, this proposal will simply ease administration with no adverse impact upon clients. With regard to cessation of payments due to the non-return of review forms, such action only occurs after the Department has sent out a reminder to the client to return the form and usually a follow-up phone call is made by the relevant regional office. Also, in these circumstances, initially the cessation takes the form of a suspension of payments rather than a cancellation. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, I refer to the proposal which seeks to add to the list of decisions made by the Minister which are not reviewable by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Under subsection 251 (1b) of the Social Security Act, the Minister may give, vary or revoke directions relating to the exercise of the Secretary's power to waive recovery of a debt owed to the Commonwealth by a client or former client. This proposal seeks to make them non-reviewable. In the past, there has been considerable concern over subsection 251 (1b). The subsection requires the Secretary in exercising the discretion to waive a debt to act in accordance with any directions issued by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministerial rules and directions of this nature are not disallowable under section 251 (1c). They must merely be tabled before both Houses of Parliament within 15 sitting days of their having been made. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in its seventeenth report of 1988 expressed the view that such provisions possibly involved an inappropriate delegation of legislative power, and recommended that such directions be made disallowable instruments. </PARA>
<PARA> Various welfare groups have expressed similar concerns. The Welfare Rights Centre in Sydney told the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs review of debt recovery under the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlement Act that it is desirable for such determinations to go through the `normal parliamentary processes', preferring the basic elements of such determinations to be incorporated into the Act itself, and the detail published in the manuals. In consultation on this Bill, the Welfare Rights Centre has indicated that its past objections to decisions which are non-reviewable and non-disallowable still stand and it regards this latest proposal as unacceptable. The Australian Council of Social Service has expressed similar views. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only does this proposal seek to add to the list of non-reviewable decisions made by the Minister, it would also permit the Minister to make directions which are not disallowable. Reliance on the benevolence of the Minister in issuing such directives is no substitute for the transparency afforded by the proper consideration of the Parliament. The withdrawal from clients of the protection of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal review is similarly unacceptable. In committee we shall move an amendment seeking to remove the relevant clause from the proposed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixthly, regarding other proposals, a number of very minor technical changes are foreshadowed in the Bill, mainly concerned with refining the social security legislation passed by the Parliament in December last year. Included among these are a pushing back of the annual indexation of the pension assets test limit by several weeks to bring it into line with the date for the indexation of the pension income test free area; a slight tightening up on the payment of the employment entry payment for sole parent pensioners; and a clause to ensure that married or de facto persons aged under 21 who are separated by illness receive the single rate benefit payable to a person of that age. Also included is a minor change to the existing social security agreement between Australia and Canada so that Australian pensions which are payable to widows covered under the agreement will be able to be paid in Canada without any time limit. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just comment on the deeming provisions which have been reduced from 10 per cent to 8 per cent. It was due to the Minister's intransigence that we continued for a time with the 10 per cent. I fear for the pensioners in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition invites the Minister and the Government to fully examine our proposed and circulated amendments so that, if there is an amendment available, this may be addressed in the committee stage of the Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the House is discussing three pieces of social security legislation. The first is the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill, which is designed to provide practical and continuing assistance to unemployed people in order to enhance their chances of getting a job. The second is the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill which provides, amongst other things, an income and assets test exemption for funeral bonds with a contribution limit of $5,000 or less per funeral-$10,000 or less in the case of the funerals of married couples. The third piece of legislation is the Social Security (Rewrite) Transition Bill, which provides for the transition from the Social Security Act 1947 to the Social Security Act 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although I wish to spend most of my time this evening talking about the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill, I would like to commend the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table, on their work and the work of their Department in finalising the rewrite of the Social Security Act 1947. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be claimed with some validity that this particular Act affects a greater number of individual Australians in a more material way than almost any other piece of Federal legislation. Many of the people on whom it impacts are the poorest and most disadvantaged in our society. It is very appropriate, therefore, that this Act should be rewritten in plain English and have its format revised so that it is easier to access and to use. </PARA>
<PARA> The final document is quite bulky, as is the explanatory memorandum which accompanies it. Saying something complicated in plain English does not necessarily require fewer words as the people who were rewriting the legislation would have found out. Basically the Social Security (Rewrite) Transition Bill, which is a much smaller Bill and is before us tonight, is interim legislation which will repeal the 1947 Act on 1 July 1991, provide rules for the transition from the old Act to the new one, and make consequential amendments to other Commonwealth Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> In returning to my main topic of discussion, the Job Search and Newstart proposals, I think it is necessary to take the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) to task. I am sorry that he is not in the chamber because I would have liked him to hear it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He should get his priorities right. I think it is necessary to take him to task over his criticism of the so-called open-ended nature of the support offered by this legislation. The honourable member reminded the House that at the last election the Opposition proposed to cut the unemployment benefit out after nine months. I am glad that he reminded the House about that because some people might have forgotten it. However, he then qualified this claim by saying that disadvantaged people would not be cut off the benefit if they could show that they were genuinely seeking work, or words to that effect. He did not provide any detail as to what constituted continuing eligibility for receipt of benefit, and that is crucial to the discussion we are having this evening. I believe that the Opposition's policy on unemployment benefit eligibility would be heartless and draconian-I have no doubt about that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, just as the New Zealand Government has recently done. More importantly, the people of this country have a right to know what the Opposition is claiming it would do. The honourable member for Dawson and his colleagues cannot continue to play hide and seek with their policies for much longer. Eventually they will have to bring them out from whatever rock they are hiding them under and expose them to the hard light of day and public scrutiny. In the meantime, the honourable member for Dawson cannot have his cake and eat it. He cannot criticise the Government for providing indefinite income support on the one hand and then proffer that apology for a policy from the Liberal and National parties on the other. He must be more specific. Apparently the coalition's social security policies are as elusive and as devoid of detail as the utterings of their leader on subjects of national concern and interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the Government's Job Search and Newstart legislation-our arrangements are much more specific-it is proposed that people seeking work will be eligible to receive the Job Search allowance for 12 months. If, after that time, they have still not managed to find a job they will be required to apply for Newstart allowance. To be eligible for Newstart the individual will have to enter into an agreement with the Department of Employment, Education and Training via the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES). This agreement will outline the endeavours expected to be undertaken by the individual in search of work. The individual is important in all of this because the agreement will be able to be tailored to meet his or her specific needs and the needs of the local region, which is actually crucial to the whole discussion of unemployment. As we in this House are all aware, different regions have different problems when it comes to getting jobs, or different regions have different qualities in terms of even having access to training. </PARA>
<PARA> Referral to training programs will be included in the agreement if such training is considered necessary for the unemployed person to obtain a job. The effectiveness of the Job Search allowance and the Job Search training program is now well-known as they have replaced unemployment benefits for young people since being introduced early in 1988. The allowance was paid to young people on the proviso that employment, training and educational options appropriate to the individual would be established with the Commonwealth Employment Service via an interview and be pursued by the young person as required. This has worked very well. </PARA>
<PARA> Community judgment of the Job Search allowance arrangements has been favourable, as Job Search has been successful in assisting thousands of young Australians to improve their skills and confidence and to obtain work-in conjunction with traineeships, I might add. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of its introduction, however, its emphasis and intent were misunderstood and many people working with youth were critical that it was a backdoor way of taking kids off the dole. At first they could not see that young unemployed people would be better off if the Government utilised its resources to identify any difficulties that they had in obtaining a job and actively helped them to overcome such problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I can recall addressing a public meeting of youth workers on this very issue to explain the positive nature of the changes being made. It was unfortunate that this program-the Job Search program-when it was first being introduced was so misunderstood and so maligned in many local newspapers around Australia that people had simply not got the message and thought that we were bringing in a draconian measure, whereas ultimately it has proved to be a very useful and helpful measure to the young people concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Concerns on some aspects of the legislation that we are discussing this evening have been expressed by such welfare rights organisations as the Australian Council of Social Service and the Welfare Rights Centre. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) raised a number of these in his contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> A major difficulty was the lack of the right of appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, if the agreement was not suitable for the person concerned or if there was a change in their circumstances. I understand that the Government has looked at this very sympathetically and accepted the need to have some such appeal, and I feel that that is a very important change to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security Appeals Tribunal does a terrific job, and it is important that we ensure that, wherever there may be seen to be some compulsion or some difficulty placed on people who are unemployed and where it appears that they may in fact be being pushed into accepting an agreement which is not suitable for them, then there should be access to that appeal mechanism. However, I doubt very much that under the circumstances many people will have to resort to that appeal because they will be properly treated by the Commonwealth Employment Service staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The Newstart program is also well known for having assisted longer term unemployed people to obtain jobs. It too is a positive and intensively targeted program which identifies and builds on the strengths of unemployed individuals and helps them overcome any obstacles or weaknesses which may be preventing them from getting work. I will just read a couple of paragraphs from the Minister's second reading speech which actually relate to this area of Newstart. First of all, he says:</PARA>
<PARA> Experience has shown that the key to tackling successfully the problems of the longer term unemployed lies in integration of income support and other forms of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Between February 1989 and December 1990, 134,000 persons in the Newstart target group left unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the arrangements for Newstart allowance, therefore, the CES will have greatly increased responsibility for the long term unemployed. Willingness to undertake training or take advantage of other program advance will be a major condition of income support. </PARA>
<PARA>I think all of those things are crucial to our understanding of what Newstart implied under the previous system, when it was for the longer term unemployed, and what it implies now for all people over the age of 18. </PARA>
<PARA> By abolishing the ongoing unemployment benefit as such and replacing it with a combination of these two programs, the Government is committing itself and the Public Service to a proactive strategy for upgrading the skills of the unemployed and tailoring them more closely to the needs of the labour market. I would emphasise that involvement of the Public Service, because we cannot allow a situation-which this Government has not actually allowed but which some people in the Opposition might wish to see happen-where people are allowed to languish on unemployment benefit without anybody taking any interest in them at all and expecting them to be capable and able to find themselves, firstly, work or, secondly, the types of training and skills that are required to get them work. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, with programs such as Job Search, the job clubs that have been provided by Skillshare and other organisations around the country have been very important, because often unemployed people are not aware of how they should present for a job, and it is very basic skills like that which make the difference between them getting a job or not getting a job. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that any organisation that is prepared to take the time to present a person with a curriculum vitae, or some sort of document to help them detail their experience, will be making a great step forward in helping that person find themselves a job, because employers will look at that person as being more substantial than if he or she just appeared on the doorstep improperly dressed, perhaps inappropriately spoken and certainly without proper documentation of their experience. These are things that many of us in our society take for granted, but unemployed people do not always know that those skills are required, as well as a skill in their job area. </PARA>
<PARA> This intensive type of approach is greatly needed in the present economic circumstances so that unemployed people can improve their job skills and be in a much better position to get work when job growth begins again in earnest. It is similar to the very successful and more personalised service that some unemployed people have come to expect from programs such as Joblink, which is a program operating in Western Australia and of which the Minister may be aware. </PARA>
<PARA> Balga Joblink, which is in my electorate, was established with State Government funding a number of years ago and has been extremely successful in assisting unemployed people from very disadvantaged backgrounds to find work. Unfortunately, such services are not provided in all areas or in all States. It is questionable how long they would be funded by State governments, given the Commonwealth's overriding responsibility for income support and its emphasis on training and skills acquisition. Furthermore, the Commonwealth is ideally placed to offer such a service on a more universal, uniform and comprehensive basis through its existing CES and Department of Social Security infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> Skillshare, as I indicated before, is integral to the provision of the labour market training programs, and I am sure that the intention is that Skillshare, colleges of technical and further education (TAFE) and other labour market training forums be utilised to ensure that people have access to the best programs available, and that CES is consulted intensively and extensively about the availability of jobs for people when they come out of those training programs. In other words, the appropriateness of the training program to the labour market is a most important factor. </PARA>
<PARA> We must not repeat the mistakes of 1982-83. We must not let people languish on unemployment benefits. We must ensure that they have an opportunity to find skills, provide themselves with those skills and obtain work. We must also ensure that, in the course of their training, people understand that there are additional skills necessary to retain work. I think that is important, too, because getting a job is not always the hard part: keeping it is often very difficult, and people have to understand the expectations of employers in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The skills and capacities of individuals in our society matter: they matter to the person, they matter to their local community and their employer, and they matter to the economy as a whole. This Government has done a great deal to ensure that proper recognition of skills is occurring in our community. The quality of life of the individual and their self-esteem matters as well, and all members in this House would be aware that people who have been on unemployment benefits for a long time have a dearth of self-esteem. They often think nothing of themselves at all, and training is one of the areas by which they can start to lift their self-esteem. </PARA>
<PARA> Literacy is another area where training would be required for a large number of people who may be unemployed. I would recommend the programs provided by Skillshare and TAFE to anybody who knows of people requiring that sort of assistance. These aspects will be considered at every level by the CES in coming to terms with the agreement and the individual concerned. Unemployed people deserve to have their options for employment properly canvassed and considered by government departments and by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> They deserve to have their barriers to employment ameliorated or removed. These barriers could be very diverse. They may well be literacy, as I mentioned, or a physical disability or a lack of skills. This is what this legislation is all about. I congratulate the Minister at the table. I hope he is able to take on board some of the comments made in our Caucus Committee and also by the organisations to which we have spoken. I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that I followed the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) in the debate early this morning and that the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) was also in the House. They are gluttons for punishment. But I think we are all being upstaged by the State of Origin match, so we probably should not get too excited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to address my remarks to the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill 1991. Before doing so, I want to make some general observations initially about the very real problem of unemployment and the different ways of solving it. There is no doubt that unemployment, as an economic disease, has afflicted this nation over the last 25 years or so. I remember growing up during the 1950s and 1960s, at a time when unemployment rates were actually very low. There was generally some limited amount of structural unemployment but, overall, rates were generally in the very low percentages, certainly below three or four percentage points. </PARA>
<PARA> In some respects it may be true to say that unemployment is a potential by-product of capitalism. Certainly, there are countries such as China-I am pleased to see the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) in the House; he has just returned from China and can speak with more authority than I can on this subject-which have embraced Marxism or other forms of capitalism and generally manage to disguise unemployment by creating a situation in which everyone ostensibly has a job. Inevitably, within these systems people are significantly under- employed. The fact that people are all employed means they are earning very low wages. As a result, countries which subscribe to those sorts of systems inevitably experience very low standards of living. </PARA>
<PARA> The demand for and supply of labour respond, as one would expect them to do, pretty much to the general laws of supply and demand. The fact is that the unions-and the Minister at the table, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), might listen to this, as it is largely his responsibility-have managed over the years through sheer coercion to establish or achieve wage rates that are generally in excess of a true market price for labour. Ironically, when one looks at the cold hard facts, one sees that the product of that approach by the unions in this country has been a direct contribution to a significant pool of unemployed people. It was said by somebody years ago that in the environment that we are experiencing today, one person's pay rise inevitably becomes another person's job--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Berowra for making that interjection, because that sheets it home, does it not? The Minister is sitting there squirming, I suppose. The Government's great claim of success in reducing real wage rates through the numerous accords with the unions has really only very superficially addressed the problem. It is patently obvious to most people, and it is even dawning on some honourable members in the Government at this very late stage, that the whole accord process has looked only at one side of the picture. Put in the context of the policies that we will implement when we come to government, it may be that many workers in the Australian work force are being under-rewarded. Our policy provides a challenge for people to earn more rather than less. The key variable of course is productivity. We believe that people should be provided with incentives to work and they should be given the opportunity to produce more and to be rewarded accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for that reminder. I will come to it. I did want to put in context the specifics that we are dealing with, because we have the Government bringing before us tonight and today in this Parliament what is in a sense a new approach or a new way of handling the unemployment problems. It is for that reason that I am attempting to paint the picture that in this country we have an enormous problem with unemployment. We have now recognised that Australia needs to become competitive on an international scale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government desperately needs to produce a solution to the unemployment problem that it has created. Therefore, I remind the Parliament that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), in his second reading speech-I refer specifically to that-described this Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill 1991 as `one of the most significant changes in the Australian system of social security since the 1940s'. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister pointed out, it involves the end of the unemployment benefit program. However, unlike the position that exists in most countries in the world, this new approach of which he is speaking still allows the almost indefinite receipt of income support, albeit after jumping a few more low hurdles. In his speech, the Minister claimed:</PARA>
<PARA>With the Newstart program we will not be repeating the disastrous social and economic policy of 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA>The problem that he claims in that reference to the 1982-83 period to be his legacy will pale into insignificance beside the problems inherited by a coalition government in the next 18 months to two years. Our challenge will be to create in Australia a whole new attitude to work. You will remind me, I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, if I diverge too much-but we have had so many instances in recent days of how the Government's industrial relations policies are breaking down. There was the recent waterfront deal where we find that the waterfront workers are earning over $800 per week for under 27 hours work. It is no wonder that our waterfront is so inefficient by international comparisons. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of this debate, attention is re-focused on the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES). I think many honourable members have had numerous people expressing concerns about the role of the Commonwealth Employment Service. I believe it is a bureaucracy which has numerous deficiencies. It has enormous scope for improvement in the delivery of the services that it offers. Many of its functions ought properly to be delegated to private enterprise. We members of Parliament hear story after story of employers being disenchanted with the ability of the CES to meet their requirements. There is anecdote after anecdote about people being sent to an employer by the CES to apply for jobs. They go through the motion of applying for the job, but when the crunch comes they are not seriously interested in taking the job. The whole climate in many respects has been wrong for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> My having said that, there is, as the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) said in his opening of the debate for the Opposition on this subject, something to commend in what the Government is at least attempting to do with this legislation, for it does highlight the depth of the problem that we face in this country, that is, coming to grips with the plight of the unemployed. I resist any further temptation to sheet the blame home further than I have already done. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Opposition endorse the concept of Job Search as an alternative to unemployment benefit. The way we see it-and, in a sense, perceptions are important-the terminology is conducive. The terminology suggests something more positive than the term `unemployment benefit' which these days is, in many ways, rather disparaging. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the big difference between the Opposition and the Government with regard to this issue is that we adhere to a fundamental policy position which sees benefits as being in some way finite. In other words, we are not prepared to embrace a position whereby people can go on to benefits and remain on them ad infinitum. There has to be a point where we say, enough is enough, and we are prepared to establish the parameters for those sorts of time constraints. The alternative, not only in terms of the enormous costs that are involved-costs which we in this country can ill-afford-but also the effects on the people concerned, is counterproductive. If people can successfully gain access to welfare-whether it be access to unemployment benefits which we are talking about now, or some other form of welfare-it has become fairly obvious from our experience in recent years that there is a strong tendency, almost a self-fulfilling tendency, for them to remain on welfare. They find it very difficult to break out of this cycle. </PARA>
<PARA> In a sense we might well be being kind to people by saying to them, as we might do, that after nine months on unemployment benefit-or whatever we want to call it now-we will seriously examine their position and reassess it very critically to the point where we may have to say to some of them, `Look, we believe you should be out there getting a job. We don't believe that you are serious about getting one, and you'd better go and get one because your benefit is about to be cut off'. That would be kind to a lot of people not, as has been suggested by the honourable member for Cowan and others, being unkind or treating people badly. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, my colleague the honourable member for Dawson has indicated our intention to move certain amendments which will recognise that principle which we on this side espouse strongly about there being a finite limit to these sorts of benefits. We believe that it is an important element of the payment of any social security benefits that there be that finite limit and that there be a period of assessment. There should be a critical examination-not only of these benefits but also of all benefits-as to whether the people who are gaining access to those benefits are, in fact, entitled to them on a continuing basis. That is an important feature of the amendments which will be moved by the honourable member for Dawson during the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the Newstart activity agreement as being a move in the right direction, although it should be noted that it merely formalises the requirements that currently exist. We believe that the Newstart allowance should be cancelled after two months if the client has not successfully negotiated an agreement with the CES in circumstances where it can be shown that failure to do so is due to the applicant acting unreasonably. We also favour a requirement that CES intervention be made available to Jobstart allowance recipients after six months. </PARA>
<PARA> Our other amendments are similarly concerned, as I have said, with putting limits on benefit recipients. Also, the corollary to that, if you like, is in providing checks and balances on benefits so that they do not remain open-ended and there is a constant ongoing assessment and reassessment of eligibility and progress. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes remaining to me I want to say a few words about the relaxed reporting requirements for older unemployed workers. The Government has stipulated that unemployed people aged between 55 years and the relevant age pension who have been continuously in receipt of a Department of Social Security benefit for 12 months will be excused from having to report to the Department of Social Security fortnightly on their Job Search activities. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that there are numerous circumstances where it has been a particularly onerous requirement for people in this age group to report. It is often demeaning for them and it may even be counterproductive in terms of their actually gaining re-employment. In some senses-and the honourable member for Cowan alluded to this as, I think, did the honourable member for Dawson-by recognising that someone aged 55 years is almost unemployable, we may be accused of consigning such a person to the unemployment scrap heap. That would be unfortunate indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> As others have said-and I would like to emphasise this-these people have a very real problem which deserves our sympathy and our closest attention. I think that for someone aged 55 and sometimes even 45, unemployment-particularly in today's economic climate-is a disaster because that person will have great difficulty gaining re-employment. Whilst we support this provision, nevertheless, we believe strongly that special consideration needs to be given to providing people who are in the category we are talking about-55 years and over-with useful activities even if they are not paid for doing them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is quite right when he says:</PARA>
<PARA>Experience has shown that the key to tackling successfully the problems associated with the longer term unemployed lies in the integration of income support and other forms of assistance. Solving the problem of the hard core or long term unemployed is very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, overseas experience does not really give us much room for optimism with regard to our ability to solve the problem. In many respects, it probably demonstrates to us that the problem is, in many ways, insoluble. As I said earlier, it is a fact of life that people in that age group who have been retrenched or who have become redundant will find it very difficult to get a job. I suppose it is particularly demeaning-although I am not limiting it to these people-for someone who has been a senior executive or perhaps the managing director of a company which has gone bankrupt to suddenly find himself or herself out knocking on doors. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that these people do need special consideration. Ultimately, they may well be forced to accept any job which becomes available. However, I believe that every attempt should be made to locate them where they can be most productive. Certainly, people in those categories can be productive. They have proved that. They have been productive and most of them want to be productive again and, in a sense, it is a great pity if they do not get the opportunity to be so. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem of the young unemployed is a different problem and it is of no less concern. If one were to add weights to the spectrum one may well see it as an even more concerning problem. The potential exists that some people may never actually experience employment as most of us have understood it. Many people have been forced to stay at school because of the unavailability of jobs, but sooner or later they will move out onto the job market. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased retention rates which the Government often trumpets as having been one of its great achievements really do not address the issue-they merely push the qualification hurdle a little higher. It might not be too long before a person needs a PhD degree in order to get a job as a taxi driver. The honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) would probably rue that prospect in view of his qualification, although I suspect that many people with PhDs are driving taxis at the moment. Our sympathy ought to go out to them-not that there is much wrong with driving a taxi; it is a useful occupation and I would hate to have 1,000 taxi drivers writing to me next week--</PARA>

<PARA> We may well have to come to grips with the fact that there are people in our society, particularly older people, who are unemployable for one reason or another and no amount of training or retraining will really solve the problem for them. To use a cliche, we ought to think a little laterally about how we are going to solve that problem. I think we need to place a higher value on voluntary work and community service of all sorts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to talk about the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill 1991, by which it is intended to replace the unemployment benefit with the Job Search and Newstart allowances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The new income structure will comprise two separate payments: a short term Job Search allowance which will be available only during the first 12 months of unemployment, and a Newstart allowance for those who are unemployed for 12 months or more. Both payments will apply to unemployed people aged 18 years or over. The Newstart allowance represents a comprehensive and intensive process of contact, assistance and client obligation to deal with the more complex problems of prolonged unemployment. This allowance will be subject to a contracted arrangement between the client and the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES). </PARA>
<PARA> These two allowances are integral to the active employment strategy announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the February 1990 economic statement. The active employment strategy is designed to assist unemployed and disabled people to move from welfare dependency to full work force participation. The new payments indicate a more structured and comprehensive approach to labour market strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has become aware that the unemployment benefit, which has been in existence since 1945, no longer readily applies to today's unemployment situation. The underlying rate of unemployment has not been below 5 per cent since the 1970s, and throughout the 1980s long term unemployment increased. To some degree this was due to the increase in the participation rate, notably among married women, although structural changes were taking place in the labour market. The Government has seen the need for the long term unemployed to obtain skills and the experience necessary to return to the work force rather than being handed an unemployment benefit. In the past they could have received that benefit merely by mail, without active participation and doing little else. This often requires retraining and demands a much more active interaction between government, employers and the client himself. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the active employment strategy was conceived, it is quite true that Australia's labour market situation has worsened considerably; only a fool would deny that. This has put added pressure on the new system. It is being introduced on 1 July and it will place additional strains again. I notice that the previous speaker, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), made some remarks about capitalism. He pointed out that it is a system which is intensely competitive, has down sides but produces an economic growth rate faster than alternative systems. Well, I think that is probably the same kind of attitude I would adopt towards capitalism, but I would remind him that an additional price that one pays in this sort of economy is the boom-bust cycle, which has been endemic since it first came into existence 200 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now in a downturn in the economic cycle. This downturn has been caused in part by the classic trade cycle of an imbalance between capital production and the production of consumer goods-most notably in the surplus of capital to be found in every central business district in the Commonwealth today. It is in part intensified by the international fluctuations, notably the international recession, which is to be found almost throughout the capitalist world. It has been worsened unfortunately by the Government's efforts in 1988 to offset the stock market collapse which led to the 1988-89 boom being over-extensive and the contractionary phase which we have now entered rather more sustained and deeper than it would otherwise have liked. It has been intensified by a rural crisis caused by a lack of external markets, by the banks' tardiness in reducing interest rates over the past 12 months and by a crisis of business and consumer confidence, most notably in the State of Victoria, which while excessive at a national level is perhaps understandable in the south east corner of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> We are unfortunate to be in this situation for the reasons I have just outlined. The point is that we must look to the future and how to get out of this situation. We have to get out of the recession with three conditions: firstly, lower inflation. It is quite clear that this is already being achieved and the next quarterly figures on inflation are anticipated to show a figure heading down towards zero. Secondly, there should be a better balance of payments figure; already the figures announced this week show that has been achieved-as exports are rising imports are falling, and our present balance of payment problems are caused by previous debt. Finally, and this is the importance of the measures announced and being debated tonight-we must get out of this recession with a greater level of production; that is, production for import replacement and, if possible, for export into the great booming markets, particularly of Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> A different Australia must emerge from this recession; it must be a different Australia with a different industrial and labour market structure. It will be a different Australia in which some of its industries have been shed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As some of these industries grow and some shrink the labour market will need to be reorganised in order for people to take advantage of improving industries as they move out of declining industries. The active employment strategy is designed to achieve this as it is implemented on 1 July 1991. The active employment strategy indicates a change in policy for this Government. Among other people, I was a little concerned about how it would affect people in unemployment and people who have to deal with the unemployed. As a result, I sought the opinions of a range of people both nationally and in my own electorate as to how they envisaged the strategy affecting the situation of the unemployed. These people come from the local CES office, which is located across the road from my office, from the local business sector and from community retraining skills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of them, Inta Sellick, is the manager of Adelaide Options, a Skillshare project which will be deeply involved in this new active employment strategy. Inta says that she welcomes the strategy and believes that existing Skillshare and other employment training programs will be well placed to contribute to the extended training needs which will be created by the Newstart scheme. She also thinks that technical and further education colleges should be encouraged to broaden their focus to accept the training of the long term unemployed and that these facilities should be appropriate for participating in that. </PARA>
<PARA> However, she is concerned about various aspects of the labour market as they presently stand, that the economic environment is not so appropriate now as it was over a year ago for a training-based strategy, that there may not be enough jobs even for these newly retrained people to go to, that it may affect the morale of retrained unemployed and that there may be added pressure on existing services trying to retrain hard-core unemployed who do not believe that even when retrained they will be able to get back into the work force. I think some of these observations are timely and well taken, and I share some of her concerns about moving to a full blooded active employment strategy at a time of higher unemployment than when it was first conceived. </PARA>
<PARA> I note also that the manager of Job Prospects, which is the local Skillshare program-and I am on the board of it-has expressed similar concerns. I have been contacted by the Welfare Rights and Legal Centre, which operates in Canberra, and we have all read the complaints of the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) about the response that the labour market and the unemployed are likely to have to this new active employment strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a few remarks about that which are intended to allay the fears that these very well meaning people, who will be at the centre of these retraining active employment strategy programs, have raised. I think some of their fears should be allayed. The point about the active employment strategy is that it is designed to assist those who are the most disadvantaged in the labour market back into employment. These people cannot be left to languish in a state of unemployment without help and merely receive welfare or unemployment benefits periodically. It is a strategy designed to help people into jobs by providing an enhanced level of client contact through interviews with CES officers and unemployed people and to enhance a range of labour market programs that are better designed to assist individuals' needs to get back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at expenditure on the four main programs for long term unemployed people, we see it has been increased by $113m, or 40 per cent. The centrepiece of these new arrangements will be activity agreements negotiated between long term unemployed people and CES officers with a view to getting them into a situation where they can re-enter the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The guidelines for these agreements are being carefully drawn up at the moment by the CES. These guidelines are being developed in consultation with ACOSS, and I hope that that reassures ACOSS about the situation. They have not been finalised and fully approved by the Minister. They are being continually negotiated with a view to providing natural justice requirements for clients and to contain important review guarantees for them. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not claim-and it would be foolish for the Government to do so-that such an active employment strategy in a context of a downturn in the business cycle will be a panacea for the problem of unemployment. The point is that it will provide an active training program for people to enter training programs as the economy recovers-which is another lever of policy-to enable them to take advantage of growing industries and not to be saddled with unemployment in the long term. ACOSS has raised a number of other concerns about this active employment strategy and about these active employment agreements negotiated between CES officers and long term unemployed clients. I will make a few observations about its complaints. </PARA>
<PARA> First, ACOSS is concerned about the element of compulsion involved in the active employment strategy. I should point out that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development recommends strongly the active society approach to long term unemployment and the link of a receipt of an income support system during unemployment with an obligation on the part of the recipient to undertake not just job search but also training and other activities to help them back into employment. The occasional letter to employers found in the yellow pages or even small advertisements for job vacancies in the local newspaper has been internationally and in this country found to be an insufficient method for actually acquiring a job, and retraining is a necessary part of the active employment strategy. To say that it is compulsion avoids the necessity of retraining the work force, particularly in an economy that is undergoing such rapid transformation as this. </PARA>
<PARA> The second concern of ACOSS is that the process of negotiating these agreements would be one-sided and would involve the CES official in fact imposing the conditions of agreement on the client. This would be unsatisfactory were it the case, but the Government is intending to ensure that clients would be fully advised in writing prior to attending their initial agreement interview of what the Newstart activity agreement involves so that they can prepare for the negotiation on an equal basis with the CES officials. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, there are some clients who will be in trouble with literacy, language or learning difficulties-and this is appreciated, particularly among people of non-English speaking backgrounds or who have been long term unemployed and, as a result, have lost many job skills or even negotiating skills. To this end, we are concerned to ensure that clients can bring along mentors to the agreement process, that enhanced interpreter resources will be available, and that printed multilingual information will be available on the active employment strategy, the Newstart activity agreement, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, concerns have been expressed that a requirement to participate in the labour market program should be imposed only where the nature of the course or program is specified and there is good reason to believe that a place will become available. These agreements must take into account the specific nature of the client's capacity and the availability of jobs and training programs in the area concerned-and I will return to Adelaide in that context in a moment-and cannot just be negotiated in isolation from the existing labour market and the place that the client may be able to find in it. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, the Government has absolutely no intention to introduce, as ACOSS expressed fears about, any work for the dole scheme. That ought to be knocked on the head immediately. Sixthly, junior CES officers, it is feared, who are not suited or who are untrained for the job will be negotiating with long term unemployed people and will be unable to provide them with the necessary advice. The terms of the agreement in fact must be agreed by the client, and the assumption is that, where the client agrees, the terms will not be unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we have seen in the press the fear that there will be no appeal rights. I am assured by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) that the Social Security Amendment Bill will be amended to provide for an appeal right on the terms of the Newstart activity agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that those remarks will allay any fears that have been expressed to me not only by ACOSS but also by the other agencies involved in the active employment strategy. If any further difficulties emerge, I hope that people in my area and other electorates will approach their local members because we are entering into a new active employment strategy that needs to be monitored carefully in a period of high unemployment. I appreciate the concerns expressed by these agencies. They must be, and will be, taken on board while I am able to speak in the Caucus. </PARA>
<PARA> The other kinds of objections which have been raised to this active employment strategy have been raised by the Federal Opposition from an entirely opposite direction. It appears to me to be intent on diverting an active employment strategy and employing punitive measures against people who are, through no fault of their own, unemployed over a long period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has said that it would reduce the amount of time a person can claim a Jobstart allowance to nine months and, as a result of more difficult provisions for getting onto Newstart, would actually halve the number of people who are able to go on to these longer term programs. Newstart would become harder to get and its provision would be, to quote the first speaker for the Opposition, discretionary. The last speaker for the Opposition said that at a particular time benefits would end as a policy of being kinder to people than would otherwise be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> No indication was given in either of the two Opposition speeches made so far as to how people would survive having been taken off these provisions. This must be of considerable concern to people who are faced with unemployment as a result of the downturn in the cycle, particularly when it is proposed that they get Jobstart for nine months; then there would be a transition of half of them to Newstart, the provision of Newstart being discretionary and able to be terminated after two months, which on my calculation gives 11 months reasonable certainty of income followed by a discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's goal is to get members of the population retraining and to encourage them to re-enter the work force by engaging in voluntary agreements with local CES offices, under which people can be brought along either to interpret or to act as mentors in how to structure the programs. They would then be subject to appeal rights. The strategy is a positive one designed to get people back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> One fears that the overall impact of the Opposition's policies is on the one hand to say that it will hand over large departments such as social security to charities-and, now we find, hand over the CES to private enterprise, according to the previous Opposition speaker in his remarks-and, on the other hand, dismantle the most successful examples of the retraining programs which will be integral aspects of the active employment strategy which we are now undertaking. The combination of all those things is a worry and should be a severe worry to those people who are entering unemployment at this time, a condition which I regard, as I am sure do most members on this side, as an extremely unfortunate situation which is beyond the choice of most people at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look, for example, at the Skillshare program, which will be an integral part of these agreements reached between the CES and the long term unemployed. Skillshare has been one of the Government's most effective employment training projects and will be a key element in the active employment strategy. It is one of the most striking examples of the way in which a government and the community sector can strike up an effective partnership. In 1989 a report on Skillshare, called Skillshare: It's working, found that, of the 76,000 long term unemployed or disadvantaged job seekers that were helped by Skillshare projects, 26,500 found employment and another 12,000 went on to further education or training. </PARA>
<PARA> In my seat of Adelaide there are a number of Skillshare projects. The one that I am most familiar with is Job Prospects in Sefton Park, of which I am on the board. Admittedly, in more buoyant labour market conditions, Job Prospects has had the highest success rate of placing 50 per cent of the long term unemployed people who come through its front door into either jobs or further training programs. It is locally based with a board that includes me and, I might say, to his great credit, the previous member for Adelaide, who was a member of the Opposition, despite the fact that the Opposition was committed to abolishing the program. He was a decent enough individual to recognise that it served a very valuable contribution to the long term unemployed in the northern inner working class suburbs of Adelaide and that it deserved continuation. To be fair to him, he did his best to introduce the people who went through that program to those employers that he encountered in his fundraising programs and other activities.I tip my hat to the man. I wish that the Opposition would continue such an attitude towards active employment programs and retraining. </PARA>
<PARA> The active employment strategy will help, I trust, to fundamentally change the nature of unemployment as we go into the upturn of the business cycle, and I wish it well. Subject to the qualifications which I have voiced and some of the fears that have been expressed by people who are in the business of retraining-fears that need to be attended to-I support these provisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill, I would like first to comment on some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), who has totally misunderstood the speakers who came before him and whom he quoted. The Opposition's policy certainly is not punitive and it is not to leave people who have no other means of support without support. People who will be moving off the Jobstart allowance and cannot get other employment will be moved onto a special benefit. Our policy is to move people quickly through the unemployment period so that they can get jobs, and only those who at the very end cannot get jobs will move onto the special benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With April unemployment figures due on Thursday, this legislation comes at a very appropriate time. The unemployment situation in this country is appalling. It is appalling not only because the Government has failed to respond to the economic circumstances with appropriate policies, but also because it is as a direct result of Government policies that we have such massive unemployment. As a result of this Government's economic policies, 824,500 people were unemployed in March this year-275,000 more people than at the same time last year, which represents an increase of 50 per cent. These are disgraceful statistics. The Treasurer who created them should have resigned. For the same Treasurer (Mr Keating) now to be claiming that his policies are working because imports are falling is chicanery. Bringing the country to a standstill is certainly one way to reduce imports, but only this Treasurer would have the hide to pretend that crippling a country is an appropriate form of economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> We have 824,500 people unemployed-over 9.2 per cent of the work force. But even this figure, as bad as it is, does not reveal the extent of the dislocation that is occurring in the community. This figure excludes anyone who has worked for even one hour in the previous week. Hence it excludes all unemployed people who managed to find a couple of hours work. Labour force statistics for March 1991 show that, of more than 100,000 men between 20 and 34 who are working part time, over half would have preferred to have worked longer hours. Of all people working part time, 24 per cent would like to have worked longer hours. To the 824,500 people without jobs, the people to whom this legislation is addressed, we can add the 409,000 who are under- employed.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the 9.2 per cent unemployment figure does not include the number of previously full time workers whose jobs have been cut from five days to four, the number of workers who are being asked to take their long service leave or the number of discouraged workers, mainly women, who do not even bother to look for work any more. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Sunday, 5 May, the Age published Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) unemployment statistics. According to these figures, in March 1,054,000 Australians were looking for work. This makes Australia's unemployment rate 12.4 per cent, or 30 per cent higher than the official figure. CES statistics are not as consistent as Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, but they are still an economic barometer and, as such, indicate that unemployment is even worse than that 9.2 per cent figure would have us believe, even though that is bad enough. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the House was designed to counter the Opposition's policy on long term unemployment benefits. Under this Government, unemployment benefits, originally conceived as a way to assist people between jobs, have become a way of life for some. Under this Government there were people who believed they had a right to live on unemployment benefits for ever. I can recall two delightful people who came to my office. One told me he was on unemployment benefits because he wanted to write a novel. The other said he did not like to work because it mucked up his social security benefits. This was before the recession and, except for antipathy to work, there was no reason why either of these people should have been on unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> As a country, we cannot afford to pay people who do not want to work to stay at home. I believe that the present Government has realised this and I am aware of the general tightening up of social security over the past year. To a large extent, this legislation puts into effect what is now practised. I think that the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) has already mentioned that. </PARA>
<PARA> The major change brought in by this legislation is that the responsibility for excluding people from benefits will pass from employees of the Department of Social Security (DSS) to those of the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET). I shall say more on that later. This legislation was designed to get people back to work. In particular, it was designed to force those people who had decided that unemployment benefits were an acceptable alternative lifestyle, preferable to hard work, back into the labour force. For every job vacancy there are now 28 people unemployed. That means that of the 824,500 people who are presently unemployed there are no jobs for 790,000 of them-and there are no jobs because of the Treasurer's recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the people who are out of work today, who are on unemployment benefits today, simply do not have jobs to apply for. What is needed now are some policies from the Government that will help business get started again so that business can start hiring again. The coalition has already suggested a number of reforms that will help achieve this end. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the legislation in detail, I have concerns about it. I have concerns about the length of time the Job Search allowance (JSA) will be in force-12 months. Twelve months is a long time to be out of work. The longer a person is without work, the more likely he or she is to become one of the permanent unemployed. The move from temporary to permanent unemployment occurs for a number of reasons. First, employers discriminate against the long term unemployed, preferring to hire people with more recent work experience. Secondly, unemployment destroys people. It destroys their self-confidence and their self-esteem. It totally removes their pride and as a consequence they present as unattractive employment prospects. Thirdly, long term unemployment beneficiaries become trapped in a lifestyle which in the end excludes the work ethic. Fourthly, by being excluded from the workplace, long term unemployment beneficiaries lose contact with the rest of society and become alienated from it. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons, I believe that 12 months is too long a period for payment of the Job Search allowance. Active intervention of the type prescribed under the Newstart legislation should begin earlier. The coalition seeks to amend this legislation to limit the Job Search allowance to nine months and to require active intervention of CES at six months. </PARA>
<PARA> I have concerns about the red tape that the Newstart agreement will involve. I believe there is a danger that the Newstart agreement will become a bureaucratic nightmare with volumes of agreements, hours of negotiations and hundreds of counsellors with quite enormous powers. Those who are out of work not only will suffer the indignity of not earning their income but also will have the indignity of having their lives raked over by public servants, many of whom will be considerably younger than the people whom they are counselling. I have noted the efforts of the honourable member for Adelaide to reassure us on that point. I also note that I know a great many DEET employees and have a great amount of respect for them. However, there could be employees who are offensive to those people they are counselling. </PARA>
<PARA> The emphasis on skill acquisition is an important one and certainly an emphasis that this side of the House would applaud. It is essential that those whose skills are not in demand are given every chance to acquire new skills. Also positive are the options of voluntary work as part of the Newstart agreement. Not mentioned in the legislation is the current restriction on entrance to CES courses to people who have been registered as unemployed for six months unless they are specially disadvantaged. I note the reference of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) in his second reading speech to early intervention. Although he does not clarify it, I take this phrase to mean what it means currently-which is intervention at three months for the especially disadvantaged, in particular, Aborigines, those with low literary skills and those with physical and mental disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to suggest to the Minister that anyone who has been without work for three months is already especially disadvantaged. After three months, these courses should be open to all who have a problem obtaining work because of a lack of marketable skills. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several questions that the Minister has not answered. How many counsellors are going to be needed for the Newstart program to work? Will it be like the jobs, education and training program, where counsellors are claiming that to see four clients a day is too heavy a load? What is the estimated cost and salaries that the bureaucracy needed to implement the Newstart program? What will be the effect of having DEET personnel make the decision to cut recipients off Newstart benefits rather than Social Security?</PARA>
<PARA> I am curious about this because I can see that I will have people in my electorate receiving a letter from Social Security saying that they have been cut off benefits. They will go to the Department of Social Security with this letter and say, `What has happened? You have cut me off the benefits'. Instead of getting an answer from Social Security they will be told, `This is not our decision. This was not taken at Social Security. This is a DEET decision'. What does the recipient do then? He has to find out who at DEET is responsible, go home and make a separate trip to DEET. The Minister should be looking at a closer liaison between CES, DEET and DSS so that this type of thing does not occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister mentioned long term unemployment in his speech, indicating that JSA/Newstart will address this problem. Of course, it cannot address the fundamental problem. The Minister has failed to acknowledge the extent to which this recession is going to add to the permanent pool of long term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the three unemployment categories-frictional, cyclical and structural-structural unemployment is the main problem. Frictional unemployment will take care of itself as those people who are between jobs move on. Cyclical unemployment-the unemployment created by this recession-will look after itself when the economy gets moving again. Despite this, those people who have suffered as a result of cyclical unemployment will bear the scars, perhaps for the rest of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Structural unemployment is the heart of the problem-those people who stay on government benefits and have little or no chance of getting a job. Each recession increases structural unemployment. We saw this happen after the 1974 recession and the 1982-83 recession and we will see it again after this recession. Each recession adds a large number of unemployed to the hard-core of unemployed who are already there. After the recession, the level of hard-core unemployed does not return to its previous level; it plateaus at a higher level and that plateau becomes the new base. For many, this will become the never-ending recession. For Australia it means a permanent crippling impost to our already large welfare bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Our projected unemployment benefits bill for this year is $4.5 billion. Even if it drops next year, it will never return to previous 1990-91 levels because of the increase in structural unemployment. The community will have to keep paying this increased welfare bill-a permanent legacy of this recession. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three groups who are particularly at risk from this recession. The first group is those who were already unemployed at the beginning of the recession. The longer a person is without work the less likely it is for that person to obtain work. The second group is young people who have never had a job. Leave them without a job for too long and many of them are likely to pass into an alternative culture where they, too, become unemployable. Businesses are reluctant to hire 20-year-olds who have been out of school for three years but who have never worked. Currently, the unemployment rate for the 15-to 19-year age group born in Australia is 22.2 per cent. For the higher risk group-those born outside Australia-it is 27.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The third group is the older men who in normal times would have continued work until they were 65. Because of the recession they lost their jobs. But older men are less attractive job prospects and when the businesses start hiring again many of these older men will not be re-hired. </PARA>
<PARA> One group of older men is of particular concern. Government policies have closed down factories and constricted building. Unemployment is currently the highest in both the manufacturing and the construction industries-9 per cent and 11.5 per cent respectively. The people who are being laid off are the manual labourers over 40. These men have a strong work ethic. They have worked hard all their lives and they take pride in their work. Now that they are unemployed they are some of the hardest seekers after new employment. But the new employment is not there for them and it is not going to be there for them.</PARA>
<PARA> When the economy goes forward again businesses will have a large choice. They will choose their manual labourers from the younger, stronger and more mentally agile workers that are available to them. What happens to our older manual workers? How will Newstart help them? For many of them English is a second language and re-skilling into a non-manual job is not a real possibility. Similarly, those with low literacy will go on to the scrap heap of the unemployed. Some are already there. About half the men over 55 who are unemployed have been unemployed for over a year, and the figures will grow. This will be one of the legacies of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA> This present legislation has acknowledged the plight of the older unemployed. Section 525 of the Social Security Act 1991 allows for exemption from the reporting requirement for people over the age of 55 who are engaged in full time voluntary work. I think this is a positive move and I am sorry that the Government did not take it further. Community work is one way for the long term unemployed to maintain their self-respect and to feel that they too are contributing to society. It keeps them in contact with people and increases their chances of employment by showing prospective employers that they have been working. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether the Government likes it or not, we are a work oriented society and work gives us our identity, our self-respect and many of our social contacts. As the honourable member for Dawson has acknowledged, this Bill heads some way in the right direction. It recognises the importance of intervention to assist the unemployed to return to the work force. It recognises the importance of re-skilling to get those without marketable jobs back into the work force. However, it allows too long a period before active intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has other problems that the honourable member for Dawson has alluded to, in particular, the open-ended nature of the Newstart agreement and the failure to close the loophole on assets handed over to a third person. However, the crux of the problem now in May 1991 is that there are no jobs. There are more than 800,000 people officially unemployed and even more hidden unemployed and these people are out of work as a direct result of the policies of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill. The honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) has talked about how the Government has allegedly created the present level of unemployment. The conservatives have been out of office for a record time in Australia's history since Federation, but they left us with double digit inflation, with double digit unemployment and they changed the method of statistical reporting. We still have not reached the levels of inflation and unemployment that were left with us in 1983. What is happening tonight is quite historic for Australia and it is great that both the Opposition and the Government have agreed that the unemployment concept should go and that it should be replaced by a new concept which is established under Job Search and Newstart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A few years ago, in the mid 1980s, I attended a very large, well-attended rural crisis meeting in Yass. That meeting was quite militant. It consisted mainly of farmers who voted unanimously that unemployment should be abolished. Of course, they did not have in mind the sort of thing that is happening here tonight. The introduction of this legislation means that people will not be thrown onto the scrap heap and will not be made to queue up at soup kitchens. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is reflecting the common desire of those people at Yass, but it is also reflecting something else. It is reflecting a message from taxpayers that money which they contribute to revenue should be accountable and should be properly spent; that their funds should not be spent where a standard of cooperation is not evident. It also reflects a message from the parents of the unemployed, from people who work with the unemployed and from the unemployed themselves. That message is that there is a need for individual attention to each unemployed person. That is because each unemployed person is different. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all different; we have different skills. There are now some people who are unemployed who are very skilled in some areas and who possess many and varied skills. There are people who have some experience. While they may not be called skilled, they may be called semi-skilled, and there can be hundreds of different types of experience in the semi-skilled area. There are people with very little experience or no experience at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals we are considering tonight try to look at each individual. Of course, each individual has different abilities. There are people with different intellectual abilities; people with different manual abilities; people who have different communication skills and abilities; people who differ in their ability to use numbers; and people who differ in their literacy ability. There are strong differences. As well as that, there are differences in presentation. There are people who present themselves well and confidently, and have high self-esteem. There are others who do not have that self-esteem. In fact, there are those who develop very low self-esteem, and that leads to defence mechanisms which often make them present a false front, and they say, `No-one wants me, so I don't want a job'. Of course, this is being extremely destructive. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is giving hope to the hopeless because eventually people should be able to be treated on an individual basis. It is a reasonable result to what taxpayers have been asking for-accountability, and payment where there is cooperation. Of course, this continues a trend which has been evident and is the reason why social security benefits have reduced. Some years ago there was a substantial reduction in social security benefit pay outs compared with 1983 when the Government came into office, because of the high drop in employment pay outs, and overall this Government is spending less on social security. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Jobstart people will be able to receive an allowance. They can then move onto Newstart where they will have an agreement set out with the Department. This agreement has been described by some, including the Australian Council of Social Service, which the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) mentioned, as being too tough. But there will be fairly tough requirements. This is understandable and, in fact, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, through the Commonwealth Employment Service, has been moving towards this already. So has the Department of Social Security which has actually been getting tougher on people who will not cooperate with schemes. I have actually spoken to people who have had benefits taken from them because they have been told that they were not cooperating on schemes. In some cases it is people who move away and have to attend a tertiary and further education facility perhaps in another town, and there are behavioural problems. Those people have been taken off benefits. After those people have been counselled twice and have not accepted that counselling, they have been taken off benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> I decided that I would publicise that fact and I made it clear to people that, especially when Job Search and Newstart commenced, things would be a bit tougher than perhaps some people had experienced so far. People will be told that they may have to go away for training. But every time I have put an article in a newspaper or explained just what is happening, I have had counselling from officers of the Department because they say, `Well, perhaps you shouldn't be emphasising this because we don't want people to think that there'll be nothing at all for them'. Of course, as the honourable member for Hawker has said, there is something; people can go onto special benefits. They can get something, but there is a degree of testing and it is that much harder for them if they do not cooperate. </PARA>
<PARA> A positive aspect of the proposal is that people can be diverted into training-into a system of personal development-so that they receive reasonable help. If they will not accept reasonable help, they may be told that they cannot obtain benefits without accepting the reasonable offers of assistance that are given to them by the Commonwealth Employment Service and, in some cases, by the Department of Social Security. So they need to accept it. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially, with a reasonably high level of unemployment, which I believe will continue for a few months yet, it may be hard for the extra staff who have been appointed to cope with each person on an individual basis. People will need to understand that they will receive allowances if they are not offered that help and if they are not offered the help that will be available to them in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the 1960s there has been a big change in the concept of unemployment. In those days statistics were quite different. While the rate of unemployment seemed to have been low even in 1961, when there was a crisis in employment, the figures were quite different because the number of people who claimed to be looking for work was far less. For instance, there were not nearly as many women saying that they were interested in obtaining work. Then in the late 1970s there was another change, when a lot more people became unemployed on a long term basis. Even today there are people who became unemployed when they left school in the late 1970s and who still have not obtained work. </PARA>
<PARA> All of the symptoms that I talked about are evident in those people-low self- esteem and the development of defence mechanisms. People have developed a habit of unemployment because they were not dealt with on a proper individual basis and they were not properly counselled. Once again, the unemployed were blamed instead of the managers of the system. Now at least government, the Public Service, members of parliament-all those involved-realise that people have to be dealt with on an ongoing, individual basis. So I recognise those two problems: the need for ongoing assistance and the need for accountability.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has moved some amendments. They remind me of the old days when I was young and one of the few young people, I suppose, who listened to Parliament. In those days one would hear the Opposition reject the Budget by moving that the Budget be reduced by #1. In this instance, the Opposition is moving to amend the Bill by substituting the term `12 months' for `9 months' and that sort of thing. It is not really seeking to alter the concept of the legislation to any great extent. It is just trying to make it slightly tougher. </PARA>
<PARA> For a long time the Opposition has failed to come up with policies on a wide range of issues, including social security. As the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) said earlier today during Question Time, if Opposition members will not tell us what their policies are then we have to take note of the kites that they are flying. They have flown a kite about the jobless, pensioners and people on social security being assessed by charity. They have flown a kite about chartered accountants paying benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> No pensioners, no unemployed persons and no-one on social security would be happy if they knew what would happen if they were assessed by charitable organisations of varying quality. The big ones are mostly run by good quality people who do not really want to do that work, and no-one would particularly want chartered accountants operating the payment system for social security. What Opposition members really want to do is implement the system which operates in the United States, where people queue up at soup kitchens and wander around the country without accommodation. Opposition members are going to rescue the system with their industrial relations policy and get more people into work. Their hidden agenda there is to get wages for Australia which will compete with those in other countries-for example, some of the Asian countries which can produce more cheaply. </PARA>
<PARA> This would mean again what is happening in the United States, where we find people receiving $3 an hour below subsistence incomes because of their enterprise bargaining system. We as a Government must never accept that concept of getting away from an award rate of pay per hour. We can talk about enterprise bargaining on penalty rates and conditions, but we should never accept the concept of enterprise bargaining on the amount paid per hour. At least if a person is on casual work he or she can go to another casual job. People are not a commodity on a shelf; they are not like other costs in a business-they are people. </PARA>
<PARA> The important Harvester case of 1908 should not be ignored by any government today. We cannot afford to allow any enterprise bargaining to include negotiation about an hourly rate which has been fixed by an award. That would impoverish people for a start. It would also actually reduce working incentive. Small business employers I have spoken with have freely admitted that, if they pay a low wage per hour, a person's work value drops. Some people would accept the concept of paying a low rate. Others would be forced to compete by reducing their hourly rate. We would then get the sort of situation that exists in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's policy on industrial relations is one of social failure and bad economics. As far as social security is concerned, even though the Opposition is supporting this legislation, there is little doubt in my mind that people would once again become numbers on a file as has been the case for many years now. It would be little more than that-people just rolling up to report. People would be on benefits for nine months and then they would have big problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst thing about the policy enunciated by the Opposition until tonight is that it would not get people back to work. The cost-cutting that occurred under those opposite in a wide range of community services would occur again in the unlikely event that it was elected. We would get to the situation where once again it would cut out services such as the wide range of training schemes that will be introduced along with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with great pleasure that I support the legislation. A lot of credit has to go not only to the Department and to the Ministers involved but also to the committees within this Parliament. Even tonight, when there are very few people in this place, there are committees meeting all over this Parliament actually working out policy--</PARA>

<PARA> Full credit should go to the previous Fraser Government for the way in which it improved on the regional employment development or RED scheme through a wage pause.

Full credit goes to the Hawke Government, too, for the community employment program, which was a further advance. What this matter is about and what training is about, and has been about in the last few years, is getting people into long term full time employment. This legislation is an important step in that march. </PARA>

<PARA> When making some remarks on this Bill earlier this evening, the honourable member for Cowan (Ms Jakobsen) referred to the open-ended nature of the current arrangements. That is exactly what my Party opposes, especially indefinite income support for those people who choose not to work. That is what we are saying. </PARA>
<PARA> If people choose not to work in this country, we say that we will not offer them funds to enable them to continue to do exactly that. That is all we are saying. For making those remarks, tonight the honourable member for Cowan called us heartless and draconian. </PARA>
<PARA> A friend of mine-I will refer to him as Roger-went out and got himself a job as soon as he heard there would be changes, and became an expert worker in a chicken factory. He thoroughly enjoyed his position. The honourable member for Cowan-I will get to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) in a few minutes-admitted earlier this evening that her experience already to this point showed that young people, after hearing what is ahead of them through changes to be made by this Bill, have already begun to address their training needs and those of the people around them. So a positive element is being established in the community. Tonight I did not hear one member on the Government side thank the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) for introducing this measure through his Party prior to the previous election. It was then taken up by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his election speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not one of them thanked the honourable member for Kooyong for introducing the measure into the House and into the Australian community. I am surprised that Government members allow us to take the lead on so many issues. It has taken the Government nearly 15 months, though, to get to this point, following the initial introduction by the honourable member for Kooyong and his band of merry men. The honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley)-if I can mention Government members who spoke this evening-spoke about an active employment strategy. That term was dropped by his own Government immediately after the campaign speech. An article by Margo Kingston stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, the Government's market research showed that people thought that in Government speak the word `strategy' meant nothing was actually being done. </PARA>
<PARA>So, the Government dropped that term and came up with Newstart, because it is more acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Eden-Monaro made one mistake, when he did not recognise that the recession of 1982-83 was not a desired recession. We did not beg for it, we did not ask for it. We did have a drought, we did have a drop in commodity prices and we had the legacy of the Whitlam Government. Putting those three things together-it was not our choice to go into that recession, with the unemployment that ensued. However, the comment `This is the recession that we just had to have' came from the mouth of the honourable member's own Treasurer (Mr Keating). He said that we had to have this recession, and it is the ensuing unemployment that this Bill is beginning to address in an effort to help people. I come from the sad and sorry State of Victoria. Victorian employees on the edge were like the young red lobsters that are now no longer allowed to be dropped into a pot in Queensland. Anyone who does that will be fined $1,000. The young people on the edge and those on the edge of the employment circle were dropped into what could be termed the boiling water of this recession that we just `had to have'. </PARA>
<PARA> With over 700,000 people now unemployed, plus the hidden unemployment, we are perhaps talking about one million people being unemployed in Australia. My beautiful Victoria has been brought to its knees. We have possibly the worst unemployment figures ever, possibly the worst investment prospects ever, and possibly the bleakest outlook for business opportunities. Therefore, employment for those on the edge is undoubtedly curtailed. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), would know this, because his electorate is next door to mine, and he would be receiving the same sorts of phone calls and experiencing the same problems as I am facing with my constituents. He also is in a very heavily industrialised area. </PARA>
<PARA> So who are these people on the edge? At one time it was the least educated, the least skilled. Perhaps it is now middle management, often talented women and men who would have been looking for further advancement but for the mismanagement of the Australian economy and the resultant recession we just had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer told us on a Special Broadcasting Service program that he likes to paint a word picture when he speaks in this House. Let him please paint a word picture of Victoria, and perhaps I can mention some basics that he might create this word picture out of: confidence, zero; capital, zero; investment, zero; job opportunities, zero; business collapses, everywhere. In fact, one writer, Mr Terry Vine, in our newspapers in Melbourne, said that there was chaos in the Australian community, especially in Victoria, but there was also a terrible silence about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Glenice Davies of West Melton, in writing to one of the newspapers, said:</PARA>
<PARA>We do care. We are just a little bit battered, bruised and weary and feel lost and betrayed. Clear the State of hangers on, elect someone who can govern and Victoria will shine again. Until then there is very little we can do because we are the working people without a voice. </PARA>
<PARA>That last line must hurt the Minister at the table. J. P. Stephen of Hoppers Crossing said:</PARA>
<PARA>The silence you hear is an anguished cry for help from tired people treading water who know that Mrs Kirner's `light at the end of the tunnel' is a train coming the other way. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that not a great line? That is another word picture. Margot Kingston, about this Bill, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Today the Government introduced legislation for a plan (to make it harder for many to get the dole). In late June, it will spend $3m on television and printed advertising to tell the unemployed the news that despite the fact that there are virtually no jobs any more, they must pretend there are and do all sorts of things to prove it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is going to spend $3m to sell this program to the unemployed people of Australia. There has been quite a bit of pollution not only since the State election started in New South Wales but also in this House today. Quite a cloud is hanging over the building because the unemployment figures are coming out tomorrow. That same pollution surrounding the western suburbs of Sydney also pollutes the western and northern sides of this House. The members on the other side of the House pollute the process of government by their failure to bring their Prime Minister to account for putting mateship in front of propriety or scarcely addressing himself to his policy speech during the 1990 election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote for the benefit of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is now at the table, a few facts about that policy speech. It should bring tears to his eyes and inspiration to his heart for what he might be able to draw to his attention. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The fact that the tough and hard decisions we have had to make for the good of Australia are starting to work-</PARA>
<PARA>it was very soon after that that the Government acknowledged this recession we had to have-</PARA>
<PARA>the fact that we are building together a nation of opportunity, fairness and security-</PARA>
<PARA>where is the opportunity, the fairness and the security for people who had jobs just a while ago?-</PARA>
<PARA>and above all, on the strength of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>Yes, perhaps the Prime Minister is right in that, because when the Australian people have their backs to the wall they begin to fight, and they are beginning to fight now, and they are saying that this is not good enough. They are saying to all politicians, including us, `It is time to get your act into gear'. The Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We will never accept the proposition that some Australians are expendable, to be dropped through a trap door and forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>We will abolish the dole. </PARA>
<PARA>He took on exactly what our leader at the time, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), had said: `We will abolish the dole'. </PARA>
<PARA>Then the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>I commit my Government to provide, with the States and voluntary groups . . . </PARA>
<PARA>These are the words of the Prime Minister of Australia: `with the States and voluntary groups'. Was it not the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) who talked about using voluntary groups to administer some parts of our welfare system? Is this not the Prime Minister I am talking about here, who is talking about using voluntary groups to help out with our welfare system?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister talked about a new level of Commonwealth support. He offered us marriage counselling services. He must have known that the recession was coming because there are a few problems in families now and that is leading back to money. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We will establish Family Resources Centres. </PARA>
<PARA>We now find out that family resource centres are not going to help with any hands-on work as well; they will just establish what is actually happening with welfare services. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We will support State efforts to care for teenagers after school. </PARA>
<PARA>What do I get from the city of Springvale? A letter a week on the underfunding of services after school for young students and older students. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we will help to provide improved transport for outer urban areas through the provision of more trains and buses. </PARA>
<PARA>He then talked about the total cost. That just has not happened. There is a tragedy befalling the nation at this moment. The Prime Minister went on to address himself to women and said:</PARA>
<PARA>In the task of national mobilisation to build a more productive and competitive economy, the women of Australia have a key role. Today-International Women's Day-I reaffirm our deep commitment to equality of opportunity for the women of Australia. It is a commitment to give women a full say, a real choice and a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA>What has happened? Women are the major losers of this recession. They were the ones who lost their jobs and who fell out of favour with this Government. It was their jobs that were keeping a whole lot things going. </PARA>
<PARA> In the February economic statement the Treasurer backed that up-I have not got the time tonight to go into it-when he talked about the Newstart allowance expenditure resulting from getting people back to work. Since that date all that has happened to us is that we have just turned people away from the workplaces of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Even having regard to the recession and the promises of more work, we have less work. The Treasurer said that in the wake of the 1982 recession we had 670,000 people unemployed; when the March figures were 824,600 or 9.6 per cent. He talked about the halving of teenage unemployment-which we would all like to see-but today, teenage unemployment stands at 189,700 or 22.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition wants proposed changes to the unemployment benefits system stiffened and toughened. We would like to see that after nine months people are given an opportunity to begin to make a change to the situation they find themselves in. Whether they choose to find themselves in that position or not, the Opposition would like to see an earlier change. All we are saying is, `We don't want you on unemployment benefits for 12 months'. We would like to say, `After nine months we are giving you the opportunity to move on in another direction'. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition is particularly concerned about the treatment of those over 55 years of age. They will not be asked to conform in the same way as other unemployed people are. I would respectfully suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if we are to see any difference in people from executive positions at all-or any people-if there were private job agencies, they could register with those agencies and, in doing so, give themselves an opportunity in perhaps another area outside the Commonwealth Employment Service to go forward and get a job. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government talks of percentages, the unemployed as numbers, consumer price indexes and economic downturns, what it really means is that these are people out of work. This includes those who have always survived on temporary jobs, topping up with unemployment benefits-street smart people who have worked the system for years. They work in industries that thrive in the good times and die in the hard times. There are those who work two jobs to get ahead to pay for extras, and the loss of the second job often causes a crisis in the family budget. There are those who have always worked on a casual basis-labourers, tradesmen and those who work in the building industry-who find things really tough during a recession. Mostly, these people cope with the ups and downs. </PARA>
<PARA> The real losers in the current recession are genuine Australian workers who, after holding their jobs for years, are unpractised in the use of redundancy payments or services afforded by Government agencies-both urban and rural. Men and women of middle age who may even receive small superannuation payments that see them through a recession will find it hard to regain employment. The new poor find themselves spiritless. They experience shock, hurt, anger, humility and despair. They are often amongst friends whose home is secure and whose job is secure. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than bag the Government any further for its failure in the social justice area for ordinary people who find themselves in this predicament, we encourage the unemployed to make a new start. I hope that this legislation will be moving in that area. If our recommendations are accepted by the Government I am sure that that will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> My Party is also offering people the opportunity to take personal action. Perhaps there is an opportunity here for those people in our community who have been out of work, but who have an interest in a particular area, to retrain in that area. I give honourable members an instance. People who take an interest in those with disabilities could, with an involvement in further education in disability support training, obtain part time or full time work in the disabled area. I know from personal experience that this has happened to people around me who have been out of work. That is one instance, and there would be 100 others. People who have interests and real talents but have been in other jobs may have an opportunity to get a real new start. We are not offering a dead end, but a new opportunity for them to regain their self esteem by trying another way. </PARA>
<PARA> People who are over 54, going on 55, and are being treated differently by the Government from other unemployed people-their status in the community has fallen or they have lost face or their salary expectations have diminished-are the ones who are going to make the recovery in Australia more important because the recovery will begin with individuals, not governments. When we Australians change our attitudes and the way we approach our work and endeavours to gain work, then this nation will begin to revive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government would do Australia's unemployed people a great service if it agreed with our policy to remove people from unemployment benefits after nine months and begin the process of re-employment or community contribution. This recession we have had to have has damaged the self-esteem of so many through loss of jobs and businesses, sackings, and the reduction of full time employment to part time. The wash out for so many people is huge disappointment, rejection, and an inability to function as they would see themselves. Probably they feel ashamed that they cannot continue in the employment that they have had for such a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> One fellow at 55 years of age was retrenched from a glass factory recently. It seems he has nowhere to go. I hope there is an opportunity for that man. Politicians have a few things to face up to around here at the moment. There is going to be a political wash out from this recession, and the State governments' royal commissions. I suggest to honourable members that Brian Burke might be managing Mr Lang Hancock's mines shortly. The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, may be going to Ireland to negotiate a peace with the Irish Republican Army, which is similar to the waterfront situation. Mr Paul Keating will be placing his clocks in the Lodge very shortly and Joan Kirner will get a full time job, I dare say, trying to wind those clocks back. Minister Kim Beazley will start the first private telecommunications company run by a non-union labour force. Mr John Kerin is likely to buy a sheep farm after the next election. The honourable Barry Jones will become the Ambassador to Siberia for coming too close to the truth, and Senator Peter Walsh will be shot at dawn and buried at Kakadu by the Prime Minister and Cabinet, subject to an environmental impact study. The good senator may live forever because waiting for a decision on the environment under this Government is an easy way to stay alive. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been a fine opportunity to stand here this evening knowing there are so many hanging on every word I say, including my mother and two others. My father may be interested too because he is still holding my first wage cheque from my first job. There was dirt involved in the job and he never thought I would get it. I do not think he thinks this is a real job either. We find ourselves in a situation where, after 15 months, the Government and the Opposition are standing together to say that we need a new start for so many people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If I am serious about one thing it is this: all young people under this scheme will have a greater opportunity to gain employment. That is what is important to all honourable members in this House. We need to give young people and those unemployed a new start, the opportunity to have another try, to get enthusiastic and be part of this great nation. Before I finish, I believe that, with all of the problems we have in this House, we should remember tonight the homeless, not only in Australia but throughout the world. We should remember the hungry, the grieved, the desolate, the persecuted and those who are suffering the ravages of weather throughout the world on this day. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UD4">Mrs DARLING</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Lilley)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.15 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the past, legislation passed in this House has not been specifically lauded for the clarity of expression in introducing programs to meet the expressed and covert needs of the Australian electorate. Given this, I am pleased to address the Bills before the House-the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1990-91, the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill and the Social Security (Rewrite) Transition Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last mentioned of these Bills makes a promising start in providing for the transition from the Social Security Act 1947 to the clear English Social Security Act 1991 and updating that Act to take into account social security initiatives introduced in the 1990-91 Budget and providing for the implementation of initiatives in that Budget, such as New- start and disability reform. </PARA>
<PARA> If time allows, I will speak later of Newstart and the progressive disability reforms undertaken by the Hawke Government. But first I will detail some of the housekeeping provisions of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>Anomalies existing in the earlier Act include the fact that the definition of income did not exclude certain scholarship payments when gauging eligibility for pension or benefit. The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) has pointed out that, as a result of this anomaly, a person could have a pension or benefit reduced or cancelled on receiving a scholarship. I therefore welcome the Government's decision that, as from 1 September last, a scholarship awarded from outside Australia is to be excluded from the person's income if the payment does not include any component for living expenses, and if the Minister approves the scholarship payment for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Other provisions give asset test exemption for certain prepaid funeral expenses. Clause 28, for example, ensures that certain retirement village residents receiving rent assistance immediately before 3 November 1988 who have continued at all times since that date to reside in a retirement village will continue to be qualified for rent assistance. This will be achieved by taking a person in this category not to be an eligible home owner for the purpose of the 1991 Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Other clauses look at payment of pensions to women whose husbands are patients in mental hospitals, and rent assistance for sickness beneficiaries. Before 1 November 1980 a woman was qualified to receive a widow's pension if her husband was a mental hospital patient. After 1 November 1980, however, a pension or benefit became payable to the husband while he resided in the mental hospital and a wife's pension, instead of a widow's pension, became payable to the wife. </PARA>
<PARA> A problem arose on this transfer to wife's pension in that it would have involved a reduction in the level of income support. Clause 21 in the Bill is a savings provision to provide an alternative qualification rule for women in this position, to ensure the trauma already being suffered by such a person is not exacerbated by a loss of income. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar saving provision is incorporated in clause 24, which provides that the rate of rent assistance payable to certain sickness beneficiaries will continue to be calculated under section 120 of the 1947 Act, as it applied before 13 September 1987. Without this savings provision sickness beneficiaries would have been adversely affected by the standardisation of rent assistance in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> These clauses are indicative of the manner in which, with flexibility, legislation can respond to the needs of the general public when the lines of communication between government and those elected remain open. While some of these mechanisms may appear trivial to those not affected, they are crucial to the well-being of a significant number of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to address the legislation, which will enable major changes to be made in order to make support programs for unemployed people more effective-a most important move, particularly in the present circumstances. The Newstart program is significant in that it heralds new beginnings for people discouraged by a lengthy and fruitless search for that elusive job. Along with the Job Search program, Newstart typifies the latest rung in a ladder of reform intended to bridge the often difficult chasm between unemployment and active participation in a job. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Hawke Government came to power in March 1983, unemployed people were at an extremely low ebb, as the trauma occasioned by lack of work was exacerbated by the grossly insensitive Fraser label of `dole bludger'. There has been some interesting commentary this evening regarding the very real trauma which people who are out of a job, particularly for a lengthy period, are suffering. In fact, I commend the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) for his concern for the people within his electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Having been elected to this House in 1980, I had very close contact in 1981-82 with a similar situation, which lasted until the Hawke Government came to office in 1983. These problems have come up from time to time during this century. I can remember a very difficult time during the credit squeeze in the 1960s and the difficulty I had in raising a young family. So one learns after a while that these problems do repeat themselves. But before any government is able to put forward programs to meet those specific needs, it firstly has to recognise what that problem is. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern in that earlier 1981-82 period was that the then coalition Government did not recognise and did not say publicly that there was an economic malaise and that there was a reason why kids coming onto the job market could not get jobs. In fact, they were labelled as dole bludgers. That had the effect of lowering the esteem of young people. Anyone who has been in contact with young people who are looking for work now will understand the extra load that that unfair tag put onto the young job seeker. In effect, the general public was being told to look down on these young people and was told that in fact they were not getting jobs not because jobs were not available, but because of some deficiency within their own make-up-because they lacked a desire to go out and look for work. Because of that attitude there was no reform of, or change to, the sorts of programs that were mounted to assist people in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of that, I was very pleased to see the introduction of the new community employment program (CEP), which was one of the first programs brought in by the Hawke Labor Government in 1983. That CEP filled a real need in the area. Most particularly, it brought young people who were suffering long hours of despair behind closed doors or down at the local pinball parlour-which was perhaps the trendy meeting place for young people in those days-out of these inward looking areas where they were losing more and more self-esteem and put them into real work, in a day by day work environment, providing facilities for the local community. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the Boondall entertainment complex within my electorate was one of the recipients of work by young people under the CEP, as was the sea wall at Shorncliffe. Road safety was assisted by the building of a number of park and drive car parks at railway stations running along the Shorncliffe line through my electorate of Lilley. </PARA>
<PARA> That was indicative of the way in which the general community benefited from the CEP, but the real benefit was in getting young people out of the home, breaking that cycle of despondency and despair which prevented them from getting jobs when there was a job vacancy because they had lost all confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> After the CEP had run its course, there was a need for another move because it did not meet the long term needs of unemployed young people, nor was it designed to. It was designed to break that earlier cycle, and it did that very effectively. Since then, there have been a number of programs. I think most honourable members, again from both sides, will have had contact with Skillshare, which followed on from the community youth support scheme; the job centres; the NEIS, the new enterprise incentive scheme for young people who might want to start up a new business; and a lot of the training programs which have right up until now been conducted through technical and further education colleges or through private colleges, such as secretarial colleges. The Hawke Government has subsidised these colleges to enable young people to get training to get back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> It is that growth and development of programs, the shifting to meet needs, on which the programs we are discussing today in this Bill are built. Newstart is notable for the manner in which it integrates income support with labour market assistance. Without labour market programs, income and other types of supported programs for job seekers are hindered in their effectiveness. The Newstart program brings with it an additional $220m for labour market programs until the end of 1993-94, providing over 50,000 program places each year. This then will be topped by the $155m expansion of labour market programs announced in the March 1991 industry statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the Newstart program is the improved liaison between the bodies supporting job searches-the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) and the Department of Social Security. In developing arrangements for a Job Search allowance, the programs aim to help prevent long term unemployment before those problems surrounding it become entrenched in the way we have been discussing. In many cases, it just does not work to give young job seekers income support and then leave them to their own resources. Many need training and job seeking skills. To meet this need, the CES will provide early intervention assistance to Job Search allowance recipients in the first three months where it is needed. There will be a strong focus on assisting young people, and the current arrangements for 16- to 17-year-olds will be incorporated into Job Search provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Before closing, I wish to comment on the activity agreement into which recipients must enter in order to receive the Job Search allowance. The agreement will set out steps which will hopefully enhance the job seeker's employment prospects. The aspect of this agreement which I will be monitoring closely is the requirement that a person must enter into and abide by the agreement if he or she is to receive the Newstart allowance. I want to make it clear that in my experience and the experience of my colleagues the large majority of job seekers are anxious above all to secure work. It is not their fault that suitable work is not available, and the Government has no intention of knocking the victims of economic downturn. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, where any public program exists, abuse exists. By taking measures to reduce the risk of fraud and incorrect payments, the Department is acting in the interests of the majority of job seekers, who do not abuse the system. When government revenue is robbed by fraud, less money remains to meet the real needs of the majority of honest job seekers. However, this should not be taken to suggest that abuse is greater at the lower end of the earning scale than at the top. The enormous bill carried by the pay as you earn taxpayer and caused by large scale tax evasion schemes such as the bottom of the harbour scheme which the Government has addressed with the closing of loopholes, bear witness to this fact. I trust and believe that the Newstart program will address the real problems of unemployed people and will prove to be to their advantage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. I take notice of your statement in that regard. In the Sunday Age of 5 May, the Federal Treasurer warned the Industrial Relations Commission to rethink its position `or it will not have a position'. Further, he said that the Industrial Relations Commission would `be run over, bypassed and materially damaged' if it failed to adapt to the economic society of the 1990s. If that does not tend to bring the Industrial Relations Commission and the commissioners into disrepute within Australian society, I do not know what does. It is very simple for a person to say, for instance, that a Commissioner is very poor at golf, and by such a statement being made, clearly the Commissioner could be considered to be brought into disrepute in the community. The statements made in recent times by the Treasurer and by the President and the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, as well as by many others in the community, regarding the Industrial Relations Commission may in their minds be fair statements, but in fact they violate a section of an Act which was brought into being by this Government in 1988, specifically section 299 (1) (d) (ii) of the Industrial Relations Act, which says:</PARA></TALK.START>

Given the thoroughly disgraceful treatment he received from the then Premier of Western Australia, Sir Charles Court, I am not surprised that he has decided to support the Labor Party. I refer to Lang Hancock.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find it rather pitiful that we have had this denigration of this man's achievement in Romania. What Lang Hancock is about in Romania is opening up to Australia potential trade with eastern Europe, a potential that far exceeds the voluminous trade with Japan. The market for iron ore, coal and the other minerals produced in Australia is far greater in eastern Europe, and Lang Hancock has led the way. The market hinges on the canal which runs from the port of Constanta on the Black Sea to Cernavoda on the Danube. </PARA>
<PARA> This canal, which is 64.2 kilometres long and 120 metres wide, required the removal of 300 million cubic metres of earth and 3.5 million cubic metres of concrete. To put that into perspective, the Suez Canal, which is 164 kilometres long, required the removal of only 275 million cubic metres of dirt and the Panama Canal, which is 81 kilometres long, required the removal of 160 million cubic metres of dirt and 3.9 million cubic metres of concrete. </PARA>
<PARA> This canal is not a new idea; it was an idea of the last century and, indeed, Hitler started it during the early part of 1944. However, it was Lang Hancock who seized on the opportunity to present it. The canal enables us to send large ships in excess of 150,000 tonnes into the Mediterranean. Prior to the construction of this canal, the Danube offered passage only to ships of about 30,000 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA> The canal enables us to be competitive with South America. I refer not only to iron ore but bauxite, alumina, coal and many other products. Hungary, which has a history of being a very large aluminium producing country, is running out of its own raw material. Hungary has the potential to be a very big customer for Australian alumina or bauxite. Coal has already entered eastern Europe through this canal. </PARA>
<PARA> This canal is working because Lang Hancock had the vision to see its potential. Out of his own pocket, he spent $30m to install the unloaders at the port of Constanta. Without these unloaders, no traffic in the commodities that we sell would be possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is a tribute to this man, and it is a pity to see him so denigrated. Sly innuendos are made and questions asked about why Brian Burke should be involved. Brian Burke is involved because the Western Australian Government was the government that gave support to Hancock in these ventures, and it was Brian Burke who had the political contacts in Romania. He was known there and had done far more to develop trade than Austrade had ever done, and far more effectively. We need to realise the debt that Australia owes to some of these people. History will write them in much bolder letters than we, in our parsimonious and sanctimonious way, tend to do at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> To date, the unloading facility at the port of Constanta has cost Hancock dearly. He certainly has not made a profit from it, but Australia certainly has through the passage of its cargoes through that port. In the long haul it is to be hoped that Hancock will benefit from this. It is a tribute to Lang Hancock and to his able offsider, Kevin Dalby. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw to the House's attention the untimely death of Councillor William Thwaites, OBE. He was born at Yannathan on 6 August 1918 and died on 13 April 1991 aged 73-a rather remarkable gentleman. He was a councillor of the Shire of Cranbourne for 36 years from 1955-91. He replaced his father, John, who was on the council from 1936-55-a period of 19 years. The combined services of father and son was 55 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bill Thwaites was Shire President five times, a returned soldier with five years service from 1939-45 and a justice of the peace. He was awarded the OBE in 1972 for services to local government and distinguished himself in service to local government at both State and Federal levels. At a State level he was President of the Municipal Association of Victoria for three successive terms, from 1969-72. He was Treasurer of the Municipal Association of Victoria for 15 years from 1973-88. Bill Thwaites was Chairman of the Local Authority Superannuation Board for 10 years from 1975-85 and Foundation Chairman of the Western Port Regional Planning Authority in 1969. </PARA>
<PARA> In a federal sphere, he was President of the Australian Local Government Association from 1975-76, and the Victorian local government representative at three constitutional conventions, in 1973, 1975 and 1976. He was the Victorian local government representative on the Federal Government Inter-Government Relations Committee in 1976, the Victorian local government representative on the Federal Government Housing Standards Committee in 1971 and an Australian local government representative at the United Nations Habitat Conference in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill Thwaites's loving wife, Marg, died earlier and I do not think that Councillor Bill was ever the same from that time on. Bill Thwaites, Marg and his three children were friends of our family for many years. In fact, Bill grew up in the early years with my mother. He made a great contribution to his local community and was much loved by many throughout the Cranbourne shire. Although I never served on the same council that he did, I served on many regional bodies with him. He was a great source of information and wisdom for me. He was somebody to whom I could turn when I needed help in my local government years. </PARA>
<PARA> His contribution to his general community is not listed here because he served in a local area in his beloved Yannathan and Lang Lang on all sorts of community committees, as many honourable members in this House have served. As I said, he was greatly loved by his community, and especially his family-the three children and the grandchildren he leaves. We offer the best to them and recognise the great contribution that this man made over his 36 years on the council of the Shire of Cranbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> The Shire of Cranbourne will be better off that this man lived, just as it was better off that his father lived. Their joint service of 55 years is remarkable at this time when politicians serve such limited time in their chosen field. A remarkable man, through remarkable years, he saw remarkable change. </PARA>

I believe it could well be the beginning of the end for the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look back at some of the comments that the right honourable member for New England made when he accused his National Party colleagues of disloyalty. On 11 May 1989 he said in the Hobart Mercury--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great paper, as the honourable member for Denison said. The article was headed `Sinclair keeps his challenge options open'. It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Ousted Federal National Party leader Mr Ian Sinclair yesterday would not rule out a challenge to regain the leadership before the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>Knowing Sinkers, that means he will not ever rule out a challenge, because one thing about him people have to admire is that he is tough and he likes to have a go. Let us look at what is happening in the National Party today. On 16 April the Australian said:</PARA>
<PARA>Nationals split on backing tariff cut. </PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA>It is believed the former leader of the National Party Mr Ian Sinclair was last night considering tabling an amendment in Parliament against the legislation. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UF4">Mr COURTICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly a painful position, as the honourable member for Oxley says, and obviously he is still not aware of the benefits to the sugar industry of cutting tariffs and trying to get better access to markets for the 80 per cent of sugar we try to sell overseas. It is interesting to note that on 14 December 1990 the QTV afternoon news said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Federal National Party Leader, Tim Fischer, says he can't support a ban on imported produce into Australia. In particular, the Nationals' leader says he doesn't go along with news to ban imported bananas from South America, claiming Australia must rely on free trade to survive. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an interesting point and I am pleased that he said that. On 28 April the Sunday Sun in Queensland said:</PARA>
<PARA>State National Party frontbencher Neville Harper said that the party in Queensland did not support a free trade policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Baldwin-</PARA>
<PARA>another person who was at the function-</PARA>
<PARA>replied: The National Party federally has the same free trade policy-</PARA>
<PARA>as the Liberal and Labor parties. The article then quoted him as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>You should use your numbers to make them think about what they're doing to their constituency. </PARA>
<PARA>We have seen what has happened in the Senate, where three Queensland National Party senators have crossed the floor and voted against their coalition partners on everything of importance, whether it be wheat, wool, sugar, et cetera. There is a whiff of challenge on the other side of the House in regard to the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I was just looking at what I think would make a great Woody Allen script-the National Party Federal policy on economics. It says that the priority for the coalition in government, according to the National Party, is emphasis on cutting inflation-something we in the Australian Labor Party have been doing for the last seven years. Obviously those in the National Party are not aware of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Even better, the policy goes on to say that we should move from monetary to fiscal policy. Yet every time we want to make some tough decisions in here, those in the National Party wimp out. I refer, for example, to selling the pipeline or to the assets test. They have promised more money for roads, more money for everything. In other words, they want a softer fiscal policy at the same time as their policy itself, formed last year down here in Canberra, said they wanted a tighter fiscal policy. But, better still, they go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>That it be National Party policy to reduce all tariffs to negligible levels . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is to be over the next eight years. But we have the Queensland National Party. That is the Klu Klux Klan. The League of Rights runs the Queensland National Party; it is the Klu Klux Klan without the bed sheets. Its members are saying, of course, that they do not believe in a free trade policy. Is it any wonder, with the right honourable member for New England lifting the agenda, that there is not a challenge in the wings?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that anyone in this House would take very seriously the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). What he has said is so wide of the mark that he really should be looking at his side of the House and the little Caucus meetings around the corridors as to who is getting the numbers to take on the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). That is the issue that he should be talking about and looking at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He does not need to worry about this side because, after the next election, those on this side of the House will be on the other side, and the honourable member for Hinkler will not be here anyway. I think that he is just trying to shore up a few of his constituents. He needs to look at the issues that are running in the electorate and not trivia, and he should not talk rubbish in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night I travelled to Dubbo to speak with some of the people in the Wool Council of Australia and the Australian Wool Corporation at an open meeting today of the Corporation which was addressed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and which had a record attendance. The auditorium was packed to overflowing. One of the issues that was canvassed around the room during morning tea was the real fear amongst many people on the land and many small businesses in rural Australia that they will not survive the current crisis and recession. </PARA>
<PARA> It would do well for the honourable member for Hinkler to listen to what I have to say because only last year he said that there was no rural crisis in Australia. I suggest that he go to some of these rural crisis meetings, such as the one at Dubbo, which I attended today. He would learn a little more and understand some of the real issues that are out there. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk about the rural adjustment package that has been announced by the Minister. That matter was put to him in Dubbo today. The Minister was accusing the New South Wales farmers-they can defend themselves-of saying that his latest package was a con job. I looked at the package that has been released by the Minister and I acknowledge that he has made more money available. In the most important part of the package, part A, there is only $12.2m being made available for 1991-92. This amount in part A of the package is for the whole of Australia. Part B and part C address different areas of reconstruction for people who are moving off the land or reconstructing debts.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hinkler may be very interested to know that part A of the package is directed to interest subsidies for those farmers who, through no fault of their own, have hit an economic crisis and it is beyond their economic capacity to meet their interest rate payments. If he can agree that $12.2m of additional funding, of new lending, for 1991-92 will meet the crisis confronting rural Australia in the next 12 months, he is a bigger joke than I have imagined. I would like the Minister to take another look at part A of this adjustment package because it is vitally important. I believe that the Minister does have an empathy with people in rural Australia and that he should be looking at making more money available in part A of the package. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who have had a go in the past three or four years will be most affected. They have had a go and have taken on extra debt and they will be affected. Unless we are very careful, we will be left with those people who have not had a go rather than those who have. I believe that we should be supporting those people who are the achievers. The part A side of this adjustment package is critical and needs additional funding allocated to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem with the whole rural adjustment package and the emphasis that the Minister is placing on saving rural Australia with rural adjustment is that rural adjustment committees across Australia, which in each State are administered by the State authorities, have to sit and to act as God as to who gets this adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been talking to the banks in Queensland and to the constituents in my electorate and have been advised that up to 50 per cent of applicants have not received any assistance at this stage. The worst is yet to come. In other words, 50 per cent of the applicants are getting assistance but there is still another 50 per cent who are real achievers, who have had a go in the past four or five years, who are getting no assistance at all. They could well be forced into a situation within the next 12 months or two years where not only will they will be penniless but they will also be homeless. They will be forced off the land. The flippant comments of the honourable member for Hinkler obviously demonstrate that he and the Government have no understanding of the crisis confronting rural Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pleasure to enter the adjournment debate this evening. You might recall, Mr Speaker, that last night I informed the House of the very important event in the sporting calendar of the nation which was to occur this evening-the first State of Origin match of the 1991 rugby league season.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ET4">Mr BEVIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The match having been decided only recently, I am very pleased to be able to inform the House that it was indeed the great sporting spectacle that I suggested last night that it would be. The Queensland State of Origin side has triumphed 6-4 over the New South Wales team and has once again asserted its authority in national rugby league and demonstrated yet again its superior ability in this great sport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the early discussions after the end of the match there were various theories put forward to explain what was, in some quarters, an unexpected victory. It is fair to say that Queensland went into the match as the underdogs. New South Wales had a more much more seasoned team, with nearly half of the Queensland side never having played in a State of Origin match before. As I said last night, put a maroon jersey on a Queensland player in the middle of Lang Park in a State of Origin match and wonderful things can happen. That was certainly the way in which the match unfolded this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give some special recognition to the efforts of the new players in that side this evening, players who for the first time were in the maroon jerseys in a State of Origin match. Full-back Hauff was outstanding and made no fault throughout the game. It was a sad sight to see him removed from the field injured. One hopes that it is only a minor injury and will not interfere with his commitments later this season. </PARA>
<PARA> The other person who deserves special mention was forward Larson, whom, I suspect, most people had not heard anything of and who at half-time had topped the tackle count and, I believe, also topped the count of the number of occasions the ball had been taken up in offence. That is an outstanding contribution from a player in his first match. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some other theories. I was interested to see interviewed on the television tonight the New South Wales captain, who claimed that it was the three Ls-Lewis, Langer and Lang Park-that decided it. I suppose that in many respects he is nearly right. I would have put four Ls in there. I think the coach, Graham Lowe, contributed an enormous amount to the win. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing should be taken away from the captain of the side, Wally Lewis, who, as I said last night, is one of the greatest players ever to play in the code of rugby league. He demonstrated this evening in the State of Origin match-taking out the man of the match award-that as a veteran of the game, as he is, he is still on the field one of the best players in the world. His performance this evening was nothing short of outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA> My friend and colleague the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) has a further analysis of the game and attributes a great portion of our victory to the Ipswich factor. The Ipswich factor was an important one-the Ipswich factor being Kevin Langer, Kevin Walters and Steve Walters, outstanding rugby league players who all contributed magnificently to the performance this evening and certainly played their part in ensuring that Queensland was victorious. </PARA>
<PARA> It was one of the great games of rugby league, although it was one of the lowest scoring games. At one point-and I imagine that the statisticians will now be checking through the records-it was speculated that it was the match with the lowest points scored since State of Origin matches were first played. But that does not detract from the quality of the game because the quality of the game was outstanding. The first half, in particular, was played at such a hectic pace that I think all who watched it wondered just how long it could go on that rate. It was a testimony to the fitness of all concerned on both sides that they were able to play the game at such a frantic pace at such a high quality for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that was the first match of the series. I am sure that you, Mr Speaker, and a number of other members of the House would be keenly looking forward to the second match, which will be in Sydney. I have no doubt whatsoever that the Sydney crowd will provide encouragement for the Blues. I equally have no doubt that the Queensland side will again be victorious. </PARA>
