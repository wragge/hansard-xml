<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The national housing strategy is a broad strategy that not only includes social housing and social considerations but also goes to the structure of the industry. The change with respect to the portfolio will assist in terms of coordination of the response that comes out of the national housing strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are some key issues in terms of housing that are being addressed as part of the housing strategy. There are questions of choice in terms of housing needs. I think it is becoming clear, and people who have read the early papers on the national housing strategy will understand, that our housing stock in this country does not match the needs of Australians because the types of households that Australians live in have changed, are changing and will change further over the next 25 years. The national housing strategy's primary objective is to develop policy which will enable the housing industry to deliver appropriate and affordable housing for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> Appropriate housing will mean a greater variety in the types of housing we build and better links between housing and the services that people need. Affordable housing means looking at new ways of building housing through initiatives such as the Green Street joint venture, higher density housing in established suburbs and better use of capital investment in infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA> Reform of the relations between Commonwealth, State and local government is also essential because of State and local government responsibilities for regulation of service delivery. The work being done by the national housing strategy necessarily involves the housing construction industry. The Government will be talking to all the main players through the housing industry development strategy and the national housing strategy consultations. I will be hosting in early July an Australian Housing Research Council meeting which will be attended by State Ministers, representatives of housing and finance industry bodies and local government, community organisations and the Australian Council of Trade Unions.</PARA>
<PARA> The housing industry is clearly an extremely important part of the Australian economy. The national housing strategy, the housing industry development strategy and reform of Commonwealth-State relations will remove barriers to the housing industry's efficient operation and increase its efficiency and competitiveness by lowering its cost structure.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, there needs to be change in terms of housing in this country. We need to look at the quality, the affordability and the choice available to all Australians in relation to housing. In this nation something like 80 per cent of all dwellings are single detached houses. Only 13 per cent of dwellings in Australia are medium density. At the same time as we have seen a decline in average family size, the density in house sizes has risen from 13 squares in the 1970s to over 18 squares now. We are building increasingly at the edge of our cities larger and more generous houses in terms of squareage while the affordability of Australian housing effectively goes down.</PARA>
<PARA> If we are concerned about both efficiency objectives and social justice objectives, then the access to quality housing of ordinary Australians needs to be given much greater emphasis. Out of the national housing strategy I believe we will build a consensus between the Commonwealth, the States and local government. Through the Australian Housing Research Council all of the major players in the industry, together with the Government, will be able to help us chart more affordable housing built in cities which are more humane and which better express the needs of average Australians.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was Andrew. The old Andrew used to start fiddling with his tie and then he would get his serious look. I will just stop at this point for the edification of the Leader of the National Party and tell him about Telecom, which is of some interest to his colleagues in the bush, who are in the process of abandoning their friendly attitude to his current policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To get back to the question, Telecom's position is sound. Obviously its revenues in a recession will be somewhat down, but the Government expects it to return yet another healthy profit this year. One might find it passing strange also to assume that there is some urgency in Telecom's financial situation when one considers that the profitability of Telecom last year was well over $1 billion and when it will have added to it another company with a profitability of around $300m. Such companies are not in any sense, shape or form in trouble.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom's capital structure was adjusted in August 1989 to appropriate levels, with a conversion of 25 per cent of its government debt to equity. Its current debt to equity ratio is around 50 per cent, which is in line with that of prudent private sector organisations. Its interest cover ratio of 2 : 1 for 1989-90 and a 2 : 3 anticipated ratio for 1990-91 is quite healthy, although not as high as the ratio of 3 : 67 for operating profits to interest of the top 20 listed companies. Those ratios need to be viewed in light of the fact that Telecom is a government owned monopoly and has operated on that basis for a substantial period of time.</PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the circumstances applying to that do not require the sorts of conservative gearing ratios considered appropriate by the marketplace for commercial enterprises. So there needs to be a sense of balance brought into some of the discussions going on here. For the first time, we have from the Opposition some sounds of sympathy for Telecom: it is bogus sympathy; the propositions the Opposition is putting forward are essentially related to what might be called a process of bolstering prior to privatisation-a situation in which taxpayers' dollars are shovelled in and then bought back.</PARA>
<PARA> That proposition is not something this Government finds attractive or necessary. In dealing with the problems confronting Telecom, if it confronts any, it is making appropriate adjustments to its capital program and, even more important, in relation to its productivity by cutting staff costs. Telecom is in good shape; it will be in better shape, and it will be an effective competitor in the communications regime that will kick off towards the end of this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services aware of recent claims that Medicare has failed to ensure the provision of adequate medical and hospital services to those most in need? What is the Government doing to ensure effective and efficient health services for the Australian population?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4625" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect to Medicare, as I have indicated in Parliament before, there is very clear support by the Australian people for a universal health insurance system. Nevertheless, we have seen proposals being developed within the Liberal Party of Australia and its various branches that I think have some implications for my portfolio and, indeed, for the future of Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is argued that there are deficiencies that need to be tackled. We heard that in relation to the Australian Capital Territory branch, and here is another branch of the Liberal Party, in this case the South Australian branch of the Liberal Party-Dale Baker, Leader of the Opposition and Michael Armitage, shadow Minister for health. What is argued there is that--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about Downer?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mayo, I guess, is comfortable. What is argued there is that many of the ideological deficiencies must be tackled federally; the inefficiencies in the provision of universal health care are a matter primarily for the Commonwealth Government to acknowledge and address, but it may not be tackled in any meaningful way until a Federal Liberal government with a different ideology is in office. Certainly a most pressing need is to induce more people to be responsible for their own well-being by entering private health insurance funds; and the present health system provides little incentive for many who can afford it to take out private insurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So, in terms of the debate in relation to health insurance, a second State branch of the Liberal Party in Australia has indicated its position: the dismantling of Medicare and the privatisation of the health system. We have seen that debate begun and then aborted in this Parliament in terms of the Leader of the Opposition's floating of the idea of the health voucher-he throws it up, then away quickly, and the debate goes on, simmering away, State branch after State branch, towards the dismantling of Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> We have to ask what this will mean for Australians. What it will mean is no automatic access to free hospital and medical care. The fundamental bases of Medicare, those of universal coverage and equity of access, are to be destroyed. Under Medicare, an individual's contribution to the costs of the health system is related to the capacity to pay. Under Liberal proposals, the poor and the sick would pay more and the wealthy would pay less.</PARA>
<PARA> This is not a debate about equity only. As people who have been to the United States will know, it has a system dominated in fact by private insurance, a system which is rationed by private insurance in terms of affordability-those who can afford to pay get health treatment; those who cannot do not have the same accessibility. And it is costing nearly 12 per cent of gross domestic product compared to Australia's performance, which is keeping the cost of Medicare to around 8 per cent of GDP, right through the 1980s and indeed through the 1990s, as we tackle the issues and provide Australians with something that is fair, equitable and efficient.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FJ4">Mr SIMMONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Petrie for his question. I will say at the outset that over the last few months I have received a number of representations on this particular issue raised by the honourable member for Petrie. While it is true that in the financial year 1989-90, apart from funding for the national companies and overseas activities, Queensland received about 9.4 per cent of Australia Council funding compared with its population of 17 per cent, I point out for the benefit of honourable members of the House that this does not in itself reflect any discrimination on the part of the Australia Council. On the contrary, applications from Queensland have a success rate higher than the national average. The fact is though that, unfortunately, a lower number of applications for grants come from Queensland in comparison with the other States and Territories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australia Council, as the Government's principal arts funding body, is no doubt concerned about this low application rate and is taking measures to address the issues it raises. For instance, an affirmative action program commenced in 1988 specifically to target areas of Queensland and, in particular, north Queensland. More research in the region will be carried out to identify the relevant issues and to suggest appropriate strategies for future arts development in that region.</PARA>
<PARA> In April this year, in conjunction with the general manager of the Australia Council, I had an opportunity to visit far north Queensland, in particular the cities of Cairns and Townsville, to try to ensure that the people in that part of Queensland were well aware of the importance of the Australia Council and, more specifically, to ensure that they did lodge applications to be considered for Australia Council grants. I was very pleased with the response that that visit received.</PARA>
<PARA> I know that the general manager of the Australia Council was gratified when a number of brochures and application forms were made available to a wide group of people in the arts community in far north Queensland. The visit did attract fairly wide interest in the local media. We are very confident that the issues that have been raised will be addressed in time.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the actions the Australia Council has taken, and the way in which that recent visit focused upon the problems, will result in a larger number of applications from Queensland so that Council funding can be more evenly divided between all the States.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some concerns have been raised about the Government's intention in its legislation as a result of the passage of the legislation through this House prior to its consideration by the Senate. Honourable members will have noticed in that legislation the intention of the Government to establish a national planning code to provide a predictable and national approach to the development of telecommunications infrastructure. It will maximise protection of the environment and set in place appropriate design standards and planning procedures. It will cover facilities which are exempted from the application of State laws and the code will impose more comprehensive obligations and restrictions on both carriers than currently apply to either Telecom Australia or OTC Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It represents a considerable winding back of Telecom's current exemption from all State, Territory and local government laws. For the first time, telecommunications facilities will be subject to external environmental regulation and accountability and, until the time that the code is established, the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation will remain subject to the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, a Commonwealth Act; and interim guidelines, included in their licence conditions, will apply to both carriers. Power will be given to Austel to enforce the code and to give directions to the carriers on how the code is to apply. The result will be uniform processes which will also enable a second carrier to roll out its network in the shortest possible time.</PARA>
<PARA> As to that national environmental code, as with everything else we have done in the telecommunications area, we will be very pleased to receive advice from the community and other sections of government departments, from the Opposition for that matter, from the Australian Democrats and from others in the community who have a concern in the environmental area. It is not being regarded as an exclusive activity simply conducted by us, and when that code comes into place, it will be enforced.</PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that in this area we do have national legislation. It is not possible or sensible to subject the development of a national communications infrastructure to unfettered interference by State and local planning laws. The consequences of that would be potentially highly damaging both for Telecom Australia in its current infrastructure and for the new carrier as it rolls it out. But this will be a matter of concern, I know, for the Opposition and the Democrats in the Senate, and I am prepared to give an undertaking-and no doubt my spokesman in the Senate will do so also-that as this national code is developed there will be consultation with them.</PARA>

In view of the fact that the Government is not looking at introducing a consumption tax and it is an Opposition proposal, I suggest that an answer to the question would be considered as an expression of opinion on the part of the Minister and, therefore, should be ruled out of order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank the honourable member for Corio for a question that I would have to say is very definitely without notice, so points of order that might be taken that somehow it is not integral to my portfolio have some sympathy in that sense. Let me say that the issues which have been raised by the honourable member for Corio are obviously issues that do need to be considered when one thinks about taxation policy and its social impact. Of course, in terms of the Government's thinking, we have had considerable opportunity now over eight years to consider a whole range of options in relation to taxation, including a proposed consumption tax. At the time when such a proposal was included in the Treasury White Paper on taxation, I was Minister for Social Security and I had the opportunity in that portfolio to give very great consideration to any social impacts that might occur as a result of the introduction of such a tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed rate at that time was of the order of 12.5 per cent, and we were able to do some modelling to indicate the level of compensation that would be required, particularly to cover disadvantaged people. When we did that, it raised quite serious problems because the fact of the matter is that expenditure is skewed in terms of the income distribution; that is, those people who are at the lowest end of the income distribution are in fact people who tend to spend more on direct consumption goods such as food-they spend a much higher proportion of their income on the kinds of essentials that were referred to by the honourable member for Corio.</PARA>
<PARA> The result of that means that there are considerable difficulties in designing any effective compensation. Indeed, the fact that it was impossible to provide effective compensation was a factor in the Government's decision at that time not to proceed with a consumption tax. There is, as I think the question of the honourable member for Corio hints, a fundamental inequity involved in a tax that is regressive in its impact on low income people. That is why the Government rejected it then and is aware of the political debate that will develop in this country about the levels of consumption tax that are likely to be proposed by Opposition members, who seem to want to talk about a proposal with a degree of firmness, except at the point that one questions a particular detail.</PARA>
<PARA> There is one final point that I would make in response to the honourable member's question about a consumption tax: it is very difficult indeed to compensate to, in any sense, deal with the inequities that are provided. Therefore, the Government's decision at that time reflected its concern, which has been followed through in terms of taxation policy which has been progressive and which has enabled us, together with social security policy that has been highly targeted, to produce a much fairer distribution of income in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Denison for his question. As honourable members know, yesterday President Mitterrand made a comprehensive statement of France's approach to the control of weapons of mass destruction as well as conventional weapons. The President announced France's in-principle decision to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and expressed the wish that all states adhere to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We in Australia very much welcome this decision, which is a further step in strengthening the international non-proliferation regime in the wake of the Gulf war. At both the prime ministerial and ministerial level, we have long urged France to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty and to require full scope safeguards as a condition for new nuclear supply. Under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, nuclear weapon states undertake, by article 1, not to transfer nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or in any way assist other states to acquire them and, according to article 6, to pursue the negotiation for the cessation of the nuclear arms race and a treaty on general and complete disarmament.</PARA>
<PARA> The treaty does not require nuclear weapons states which are parties to it to cease nuclear tests. Australia's position on the urgent need for a comprehensive test ban and its position against French nuclear testing in the South Pacific remains unchanged. Nevertheless France's very welcome decision to adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty means that China remains the only nuclear weapons state that is outside the treaty. We hope that China will now also take the step which Australia has long urged China to do.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question, which is entirely without notice. This Government has a great deal to be proud of in its record in providing adequate quality housing for the members of our Defence Force personnel. Some years ago my colleague the current Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), then Minister for Defence, announced a program worth some $750m to be expended over 10 years in upgrading the standard of housing provided to defence personnel through the Defence Housing Authority (DHA), which was created at that time. We are about a third of the way through that program, but rather more than a third of the way in making progress towards that laudable objective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report of the Cross committee, on personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force, revealed that a major reason for people leaving the defence forces was the fact that the housing provided-not just the housing, but the standard of maintenance, the quality of the housing and the areas in which it was located-was not adequate.</PARA>
<PARA> The DHA has gone a long way towards changing all that. Two or three weeks ago the Prime Minister went to Sydney to open a housing development at Wattle Grove, the like of which I think people in the defence forces had not seen before. Indeed, one corporal was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald as saying that he had to keep pinching himself because he might wake up to find it was all a dream. As the Prime Minister knows, the standard of that housing is superb. It is housing that no person would be unhappy to live in.</PARA>
<PARA> There is some way to go. It is the case that the Commonwealth-State housing agreement renegotiations with the State governments have been agreed to by all State governments except, I am sad to say, South Australia. I am having talks with the South Australian State Minister about that in the near future. Under that program, we are handing back half of the service housing to the States and DHA is accepting responsibility for the other half of it. I am pleased to say that the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, as one of his last acts agreed to an increase in the borrowing program for the Defence Housing Authority which will enable us to purchase a further couple of hundred houses in this year at a time when the housing market is not at its peak.</PARA>
<PARA> In short, I believe that the progress which has been made in giving Defence Force personnel decent housing-and no member of this House would dispute that is an entitlement they ought to have-has been very rapid in recent years. As a member of the Cross committee, I remember visiting a number of defence bases and establishments around the north of Australia and witnessing the slums in which defence personnel had to live. That is a shameful blot on the record of previous governments-it was a legacy of previous governments-and is a blot which we are a long way towards wiping out.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seem to make a repeat speech at this time of year, and I made it only last week, where again at the end of the parliamentary session legislation in connection with the aged and disadvantaged is being rushed through this House without any time for proper debate. Since I took over this portfolio over three years ago, we have never had the opportunity to debate as we should in the Parliament of Australia the requirements, needs and issues of people who are more disadvantaged than people here. We have not had debate with any degree of freedom because of the wretched timetables set by the guillotine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We notice that when it comes to debating matters of social justice this Government denies the basic right of the members of this Parliament to be consulted and to speak. I have mentioned the guillotine. As an example of great laxity, I need only mention the particular Ministers responsible for this legislation, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) and the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), who is still basically in charge of the health and social portfolio. Over recent weeks, these people have been concerning themselves with their own welfare and power rather than those of their constituents out in the electorate, the aged and disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> We can see this through the fact that the legislation now before us as the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill and the Social Security (Rewrite) Amendment Bill was foreshadowed in the Budget nine months ago-that is, the 1990 Budget-and yet it was introduced into the Parliament only last Friday. It was introduced very much in a draft form; some haste is indicated by the Department of Social Security's not having been ready for what is contained in it. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been no time for consultation on or discussion of this very important package of reforms. The Minister for Social Security has spent time overseas on two extravagant trips that cost the Australian taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars; in the last week he was drumming up votes for the bid by the ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), for the prime ministership; and over this year he has had excessive consultations with Mr Burke on his position over in Ireland. In the meantime, we have seen a $1m loss at the Ravenshoe sawmill, where money was incorrectly directed because the Minister had no supervision. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time the Minister and the Government started to look at the needs of people who are disadvantaged and let this House have its fair say. Those are just some of the examples where the Minister shows such disdain for the disadvantaged in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we are debating, in great haste, three Bills, one of which is of major significance to people with disadvantages and to their families, yet we barely have two hours, I think it will be now, to discuss the whole package of Bills and put them through this House. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill gives effect to changes announced in the 1990 Budget designed to restructure income support for the sick and the disabled. The Government concedes that for many years now the basis for, and operation of, invalid pensions and sickness benefits have not been satisfactory. The invalid pension will be replaced by a disability support pension and the sickness benefit will be replaced by a sickness allowance. The sheltered employment allowance will be abolished. The rehabilitation and incentive allowance, as well as the wife pension, will be phased out, and the mobility allowance increased from $22 to $40 a fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we welcome the increase in the mobility allowance, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) will recall that the Social Security Review Issues Paper No. 5, Enabling Policies for People with Disabilities, recommended that eligibility for the allowance be widened to include not only people with disabilities involved in employment or training but also those involved in family care, household work, community activities and Job Search. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again the Minister has chosen to ignore those particular recommendations. Indeed, the mobility allowance has already been withdrawn for those previously attending activity therapy centres in Western Australia and now participating in community access and support services. On behalf of people with disabilities, their carers and families and the service providers, we do ask the Minister to recognise the extra cost of disability and to re-examine widening the eligibility for the mobility allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also concerned that payment for 16- to 20-year-olds will fall below single invalid pension rates. Payments for this group are now to be linked with the common youth allowance. They will also receive the equivalent of the child disability allowance, but they are still taking a drop in rates. We believe this is a harsh decision for young people with disabilities, particularly their parents and their families, and is contrary to the stated philosophy of Government legislation, which aims to assist people with disabilities integrate fully into the community. Again, this decision fails to recognise the extra cost of disabilities and overlooks the real needs of a person with disabilities-particularly in this young age group-which are education, training, transport and the need for outreach into an adult community. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, in order to qualify for an invalid pension, a person must have a permanent-defined as 85 per cent-incapacity, of which at least one-half must be due to physical, mental or psychological impairment. In practice invalid pensions have been granted to persons with impairment levels as low as 15 per cent, leading to an extraordinary blow-out in the number of those receiving the invalid pension as either a pensioner or a wife or a carer. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1970-71 there were 150,000 recipients. In 1989-90, 20 years later, there were 413,000. This increase goes far beyond what might be explained by population growth. We believe the reason is not declining health standards but a progressive softening in the criteria determining eligibility. In many instances it has become a form of hidden unemployment, particularly for young people. With the number of people aged under 30 on invalid pensions in the mid-1990s being 34,000, that is in actual fact probably a degree of hidden unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite many invalid pensioners having only relatively minor physical injuries, only 2 per cent have been re-entering the labour market. The changes in this Bill are therefore clearly a political response to a system widely perceived as being completely out of control. Under amendments proposed in this Bill, in order to qualify for a disability support pension a person must have a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment of 20 per cent and a continuing inability to work for at least the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA> The explanatory memorandum states that the inability to work must stem completely, or virtually completely, from the impairment. Non-medical factors will not be taken into account except for those aged over 55 years. We find the fact that non-medical factors will not be taken into account extraordinary in view of the reaction of government bodies, advocates, medical bodies and service providers alike that an intellectual disability is not a medical condition. When I introduced a draft Bill some two years ago to amend the Disability Services Act-a discussion paper proposing amendments to the Disability Services Act-I was castigated for suggesting that a medical practitioner be consulted in determining the level of disability. </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that this section of the Bill has been drafted without any consultation with the disability services program of the Department as to what constitutes an intellectual disability. This is only one example of the inconsistency in thinking between the Department of Social Security and the Department of Community Services and Health. When we were debating last week the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill, I pointed out that, on the one hand, one Minister was stating that jobs are universally available for people with disabilities and yet denying these people access to jobs in the Public Service and his own Department while, on the other hand, another Minister was making provision for a huge influx of able unemployed because jobs are just not available. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Bill professes to introduce fundamental changes, a number of features suggest that the changes are in many respects largely cosmetic. People currently on invalid pensions will be automatically transferred to the disability support pension and will not be subject to any medical re-examination or reassessment. We find this extremely worrying. What chance will such people have for reassessment, retraining and an opportunity to lead a more fulfilling life in the community? What are the qualifications of the people who will be assessing them? Why are 75 new disability support officers (DSOs) being employed to do the job that experienced service providers could do at no extra cost to the taxpayer?</PARA>
<PARA> Again, we ask: what chances will these people have for rehabilitation and training? This would appear to be another example of inconsistency with the Disability Services Act under which sheltered workshops, which provide valuable training, living skills and social interaction, are being phased out by the Minister. Also, I point out to the Minister that if all those currently receiving invalid pensions chose to be active there would be insufficient disability support officers to deal with them all. Is the Government relying on the majority of current invalid pensioners to settle just for the unemployment scrap heap with no encouragement whatsoever from the Government for rehabilitation, training and education because the funds and the positions are not there to match those numbers if they were to apply in full force?</PARA>
<PARA> The 20 per cent impairment test merely legitimises the status quo and will continue to constitute a very low eligibility threshold. By introducing a two-year yardstick for inability to work, the concept of permanent incapacity has been effectively discarded. Under the definition of `continuing inability to work', a person will be entitled to a disability support pension even if capable of performing a range of work other than the person's usual work or work for which the person is currently skilled. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes are not estimated to achieve any savings for at least two years, and beyond that point are largely dependent upon the success of rehabilitation and training programs in encouraging people to re-enter the work force. The retention of non-medical factors such as age and the likelihood of finding work in the locally accessible labour market for those aged over 55 years simply makes it easier for this group to obtain a pension rather than joining the unemployment queues. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill pins its hopes on streaming new entrants into training and rehabilitation programs with the initial engagement of 75 disability support officers, with the number doubling over the next two years. Those responsible for administering the previous regime will merely be absorbed elsewhere. The DSOs will determine the initial eligibility of an estimated 70,000 claimants per year, and then a joint panel of officers from the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service and the Department of Employment, Education and Training labour market training program will identify those who are to be placed in an active stream and required to participate in an additional 12,000 training places over the next three years, for which $10m has been allocated. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the very poor track record of training and rehabilitation in weaning injured workers away from income support payments for workers compensation, invalid pensions and the like, the Bill relies heavily on this approach, casting a large question mark over future projected savings. The Bill effectively eschews several hard options: first, raising the eligibility high jump bar; secondly, tightening up on monitoring and reassessment; and, thirdly, forcing immediate participation in training programs and paid employment. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, the incentive structure will remain largely unchanged. It will still be relatively attractive to seek and remain on a disability support pension which, unlike other pensions and benefits, will remain exempt from income tax. The crux of the Bill lies in the conditions which may be attached to the continuing entitlement to receive a disability support pension. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Secretary is satisfied that it will assist a person's ability to work, the Secretary may require such person to: receive treatment; complete a questionnaire; undertake a program of assistance or rehabilitation; or do, or apply for, paid work which, in the opinion of the Secretary, is suitable to be undertaken by that person. The Secretary must also take into account the plans, preferences, views and needs of the person and the capacity of the person to comply with the requirement. If stringently enforced, these provisions will have the potential to significantly tighten the regime over the longer term but a great deal will rest on the exercise of administrative discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> The penalties for non-compliance appear to be somewhat inadequate. Refusal to comply with a request in the first instance attracts only a warning. A second refusal will result in a two-week deferment and a third in a six-week deferment. It is only then that the Secretary must cancel the pension. Moreover, even the soft penalties for non-compliance will not come into operation until 1 October 1993, by which time the rehabilitation and labour market infrastructure is expected to be established. It should be noted that this date extends beyond the likely date of the next election and is further evidence of a refusal by this Government to bite the bullet. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that the ability to impose mandatory conditions on individual recipients is important, particularly as it would seem to allow for the introduction of a work for the pension scheme on a case by case basis. However, I question whether the deferment regime is not too lax. I would be interested to hear from the Minister the rationale behind these rather weak penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> The portability of disability support pensions overseas will be limited to a maximum of 12 months for pensions granted after 30 June 1991, except for severely disabled persons and where a social security agreement with a foreign country provides otherwise. The coalition supports this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> A sickness allowance will replace the sickness benefit for those who become incapacitated for work due to sickness or accident. Where the sickness or accident occasions absence from ongoing employment, the test will be an ability to perform the usual work. In other cases it will be work which the person could reasonably be expected to do. This approach seems reasonable, and the requirement to undertake work which the person could reasonably be expected to do is broader than the usual or currently qualified work test for the disability support pension. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes similar deferment periods in the event of refusal to cooperate. Again, we question whether these are not too lax. For recipients for whom rehabilitation is not deemed appropriate, the allowance will be payable for up to 13 weeks, after which fresh medical and other evidence will be required. A fresh claim must also be lodged after 12 months. Payments cannot continue beyond three years, except in respect of a new or significantly worsened medical condition. We support these provisions on sickness allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we believe that the Government has looked at disability reform in a piecemeal fashion and has not heeded the recommendations of its own review committee on a disability allowance or the widening of the eligibility criteria for the mobility allowance. It has not recognised the extra costs of disability. We shall be moving a second reading amendment regretting the failure of the Government to undertake a fundamental overhaul of the present system. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). This Bill implements some relatively minor policy changes and allows for the amendments made to the 1947 Social Security Act during the 1991 autumn sittings to be incorporated into the plain-English 1991 Social Security Act. Change to eligibility criteria for special benefits is also a part of this package. This Bill allows for special benefits to be payable, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Department of Social Security, to a person who is the holder of a conditional two-year residence permit granted on the basis of a relationship with an Australian resident where the application for that payment was made on or after 15 April 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the recently introduced migration rules, as from 15 April 1991, a two-year conditional residence permit can be granted to a person who has entered into a formal marriage or de facto relationship with an Australian citizen or resident. The proposed change would allow special benefits to be paid to such persons and, if necessary, backdated to the commencement date of the new rules. It must be presumed that applicants for such conditional entry permits and, indeed, the overwhelming proportion of migrants to this country are able-bodied citizens who are entering Australia with adequate means of support. To allow newly arrived migrants immediately to receive social security income support sends precisely the wrong signals to prospective entrants. </PARA>
<PARA> There is even less justification for any retrospective operation. While the Department of Social Security may have promised such payments as from 1 April 1991, it had no authority to do so. Presuming the new arrivals have survived financially to date, there is no justification for now providing them with a backdated lump sum payment. The Opposition cannot support the changes proposed in clauses 4 and 10. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the indexation of income free areas of pensions and benefits where the income is derived from child support or maintenance. Indexation will occur on 1 July each year. This measure will ensure that the allowable level of child support is not eroded over time by inflation. Such an erosion makes child support a relatively unattractive source of income over time, leading to informal arrangements between separated parents to evade or reduce child support payments so as to permit more of the burden to be picked up by the state. We support this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> The pharmaceutical allowance is to be indexed from the first pension or benefit payday after 20 September each year. The allowance is paid to pensioners and some beneficiaries to compensate them for the concessional beneficiary charge which applies per pharmaceutical item and currently stands at $2.50. </PARA>
<PARA> Indexation will mean that pensioners will be protected from increases in the pharmaceutical beneficiary charge. We shall not oppose this initiative. However, the annual cost of indexation of the allowance to rises in the charge is high. Is this really indicative of the increases in the charge that the Government has in store for the next and subsequent Budgets? The Bill also adds further refinements to the restrictions on the portability of the wife's and class B widow's pensions which were put in place last year, and we support this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal now with pharmaceutical benefits card eligibility. Pensioners were promised that they would not lose entitlement to the pharmaceutical benefits card if, as a result of complying with the initiative to deem a rate of return on their savings above designated savings thresholds, the rearranging of their assets pushed their incomes above the income thresholds which determine eligibility for the card. Pensioners who lost entitlement to the pension as a result of deeming will lose entitlement to the pharmaceutical benefits card. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that if one had these arrangements in place prior to the change of deeming one would retain one's card whereas people who played the game and were investing their money properly would be denied that card. However, we support the provision. We also support the reciprocal social security agreement with the Netherlands. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the incorporation of measures in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 into the Social Security Act 1991. Measures in this Bill, such as excluding approved scholarships from the definition of income for income test purposes, the exemption of certain funeral bond moneys from pension income and assets tests and the confirmation of the primacy of Commonwealth legislation in relation to recovery of overpayments from compensation lump sums which were included in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, will be incorporated into the new plain-English Social Security Act 1991 by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Also incorporated into the plain-English Act via this Bill are the policy and technical initiatives and changes in this particular Bill. Featured amongst the transitional arrangements in this Bill is clause 20, which is designed to exempt the Secretary's power to waive a debt from review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT). The Opposition still opposes this particular provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security (Rewrite) Amendment Bill contains no policy changes. It proposes a number of amendments to the plain-English Social Security Act 1991 before it commences operation on 1 July 1991. It also incorporates the transitional arrangements to the old Social Security Act 1947 which were passed during the 1990 Budget sittings. Among the initiatives which this Bill incorporates into the 1991 Social Security Act are those which relate to the liquid assets test for sickness beneficiaries, disaster relief payments, deeming on loans and deposits, the reciprocal agreements between Malta and the United Kingdom and the provision of tax file numbers. The changes involve minor tidying up of existing legislation to make the intent of the legislation clearer and minor drafting changes to tighten up the new Act before it comes into operation. The Bill should mean fewer appeals to the SSAT and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, resulting in savings for both the Department of Social Security and its clients. We support this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a particular interest in the Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill 1991. I take the point made by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) that this is a cognate debate on more than one Bill; in fact, two other social security Bills are also under consideration. I had the pleasure of being involved in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in May 1988 when we brought down a report called Getting to Work. That was a report of the inquiry of that Committee into the entry or return to the work force of social security pensioners and beneficiaries. One of the groups of people with whom we had discussions were people with disabilities. Many of the points which are covered in the Bill today were also raised at that time by people with disabilities and by representatives of those people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I inform the House that one page in the report, where we outlined the recommendations and information provided by the Office of Disability, indicated that in May 1988 at least 461,000 people were receiving social security benefits because of disability. These 461,000 people comprised 292,000 people on the invalid pension, 11,418 people on the sheltered employment allowance, 6,300 people in receipt of the rehabilitation allowance, 87,214 people receiving the wife's pension-a pension for the wife of an invalid-6,500 people receiving a carer's pension, 1,768 people receiving special benefit, and 71,019 people receiving sickness benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that was made by the Office of Disability at that time-it was taken on board by the Committee and since then by the Government-was that people with disabilities are just as interested in paid employment as are people who are not disabled. During consultations conducted by the Office of Disability in 1987 disabled adults identified the loss of employment income and opportunities as a high priority concern. Largely, that is what this Bill is about and what the Government's changes in this area have been about all along. </PARA>
<PARA> It has already been indicated in the second reading speech of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) that this is an undertaking that was made in the 1990-91 Budget. It was also the result of an extensive review of income support and other forms of assistance for the disabled. That was part of the Social Security Review which produced a great number of very substantial and valuable reports for the Government. It implements further significant reforms to the Australian social security system and to the pension aspects of that system. </PARA>
<PARA> From my own experience, I understand well and truly that many people who are disabled wish to work and they were confronting a great many barriers in the workplace in order to do so, not least of which was their fear of losing access to the invalid pension. When people may have been 85 per cent incapacitated, for instance, and have been in receipt of an invalid pension, it is strange to think that they could work. But people can work and they work at things that they like doing but they must not have pressure placed upon them where they think that they will lose that income support if they work for a few short years on a part time basis for a few hours a week. The very act of working and being involved in the social interaction at work is beneficial to their health in most cases. </PARA>
<PARA> In May 1988, the House of Representatives Standing Committee was concerned that people in those circumstances were not taking up opportunities that may have been available to them, even sometimes for voluntary work, because they were afraid that they would lose their invalid pension. This legislation is attempting to overcome that fear and to overcome the stigma of disability in our society, as well as to change the way that we have tended to institutionalise disability in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in his second reading speech pointed out that there was a small but significant percentage of cases of relatively young people, even people in their twenties, who were not manifestly impaired but who were being awarded the invalid pension with the expectation that they would continue to receive it on an indefinite basis. The concept of permanent incapacity for work became self-fulfilling and only some 2 per cent of invalid pensioners went off the pension because of their return to employment. This is not because these people did not want to work; many of them would like to work but were genuinely afraid that if they undertook any work at all it would bring about the loss of what was an essential income support for them and exacerbate the difficulties that they were having. For instance, people who have very severe asthma may not want to take up work despite its advantages because the stress of not working would be less than the stress of working and fearing the loss of their pension. </PARA>
<PARA> The main features of the changes that we are discussing today are the reform of income support arrangements for persons with disabilities to remove existing anomalies and encourage greater participation in the labour market and to change the sickness benefit which will now be re-named sickness allowance and be limited to 12 months duration except under special conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> This package of assistance measures totals $48.6m in 1991-92 and will increase to $88m in 1993-94 to encourage people with disabilities to realise their labour force potential. Critics may think that this is an inappropriate time to bring in this type of legislation which will encourage more people to try to attain training or employment. There is never a correct time; this time is as good as any other when we have labour market packages available for people through Skillshare and technical and further education colleges and a lot of other organisations in our society. Disabled people should be able to access those types of training and assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly that is the sort of thing that I would like to see happening, although some of the Skillshare projects have not been assisting these people because, obviously, they are a little difficult to assist. Fairly specialised personnel and sometimes specialised equipment are needed to help them in some circumstances. Nevertheless, with the change to the Skillshare guidelines and module funding packages there is now specific funding for the assistance of people with disabilities through Skillshare as an avenue of training. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill continues the development of a common allowance structure for income support given to young people. This will be done by aligning the rates of disability support pension for people under 21 with the rates of Job Search and Newstart allowance payable to people under 21. It may appear that I am concentrating my remarks on young people. While that is not true, it is still important to recall that young people can adopt a mindset of disability if they are not careful and if we as a community do not take every opportunity that we can to help them to break out of their disability in some way and to ensure that society is a sufficiently caring place to take their specific disability on board and assist them with employment and training. </PARA>
<PARA> The active stream, which will apply to new applicants only if they are able to work, will allow people to participate in training programs. I think it is important at this juncture to point out to people on the existing invalid pension that they will not have to undergo any difficult transition with the change brought about by this legislation because they will simply be changed over to the new allowance or the new pension, as the case may be, but it will not be called the invalid pension any longer. Their situation will not be reviewed until such time as a normal review falls due for them in a few years or something like that. In the main this legislation is aimed at new applicants for the invalid pension or for disability support. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of recommendations made in the booklet Getting to Work are quite pertinent to this discussion. It is indicated on page 73 of the booklet that the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training had received submissions from some organisations that had received funding from the Department of Community Services and Health for demonstration projects to establish the employability of people with disabilities, because the Committee saw that it might not appear to be a worthwhile thing to employ people with disabilities at a time when other people were seeking work. It was clear that the additional assistance provided by the specialist advisory services was essential to gain employment for many of these people, and the organisations' submissions suggested a high success rate with the ongoing funding being important. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence to that effect was also given by advocacy groups such as the Commonwealth Office for Disability, the Disability Advisory Council of Australia and the Disability Council of New South Wales. All of these groups emphasised the waste of human resources if disabled people are ignored as potential work force participants. I certainly agree with that. The comparative economic disadvantage suffered by disabled people is dramatic, as:</PARA>
<PARA> - only 40% are employed, versus an Australian average of 70%</PARA>
<PARA> - the unemployment rate amongst the disabled is double the community average-</PARA>
<PARA>which is not surprising-</PARA>
<PARA> - the average household incomes are one-third lower than the Australian average</PARA>
<PARA>Barriers to employment are experienced not only by invalid pensioners but also by beneficiaries who may have an unrecognised disability. Of course many employers do not appreciate the sort of assistance and work output that a disabled person is capable of achieving, because they cannot see past the disability. However, many of these people have useful skills that we could utilise in our work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations of the Committee included the following:</PARA>
<PARA>Additional assistance should be provided to assist disabled people on pensions or benefits to gain access to employment. Principles which should be followed include:</PARA>
<PARA> - discouragement of discrimination in all areas of employment and training</PARA>
<PARA> - specific provision for inclusion of disabled people in government training and job creation programs</PARA>
<PARA> - pilot projects by specialist advocacy and job training organisations to assist disabled people gain employment should be continued at 100% funding level</PARA>
<PARA> - part-time work opportunities should be encouraged</PARA>
<PARA> - programs to persuade employers to favourably consider the employability of disabled people should be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>That is actually a very good outcome; this legislation picks up most of the recommendations of the report in one way or another. I think anybody involved in that Committee would be pleased to see that the Government has undertaken extensive consultations in the community with disabled people, with disabled people's advocacy groups and with the parents of young disabled people to ascertain their views on these types of reform. I would say they are very acceptable to the majority of disabled people in this country and that we, as a government and a parliament, can be pleased to accept them. I therefore commend the legislation to the House and thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table and who is representing the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), and our own Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services for the outcome that we see here today. I hope that all aspects of this legislation will be carried when it goes to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Cowan protests. All the do-gooders on the Government side are into giving handouts to everybody; it is a free lunch for everybody in this country; people can come here from all over the world, go on the unemployment benefit the day they walk in, and when they have been here 10 years they can get onto the age pension. It really is terrific, but the only problem Australia has as it heads further down the Argentinean road along which the failed Treasurer and honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) took Australia is that it cannot afford it any longer. We have fewer taxpayers; businesses are going broke every day; people are finding it very difficult to pay their taxes. Even the Government's temporary solution to the problem has become an enormous debt because it has borrowed extensively overseas to prop up so many of its great programs and has sent this country into near insolvency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation before us further cements the approach that we have seen this Government take. The House is considering the situation in which a two-year conditional residence permit can be granted to a person who has entered into a formal marriage or a de facto relationship with an Australian citizen or resident. After the debate we had on immigration last night, when I had an altercation with the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), I would also assume that homosexual relationships were included in this. In other words, a homosexual who gets connected up with a homosexual in some other country can, now that we have provided this special treatment, bring that person here as a homosexual partner under the same terms. </PARA>
<PARA> It came home to me in talking about the issue of the two-year conditional residence permit last night-we are talking here about immigration to some extent, although strictly speaking it is the social security aspects of it, but the two are very closely related-that when we consider the costs and benefits of immigration, we are quick to recognise the benefits. There have been enormous benefits for this country over the years. There is no doubt that, had we not had the immigration programs of the 1950s, we would not have had the burst of economic growth Australia had during those years. However, the 1990s present very different economic circumstances, and Australia is now saddled with a huge social security bill which is increasing every day as more people go on the unemployment benefit. I think we need to be much more critical of how the Government performs, and the Government needs to be more concerned about the way it spends taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> On the 60 Minutes program a couple of weeks ago, we saw two lesbians living together. Each had a child. In the course of that particular program, it transpired that each of them was on a pension. One of them had the gall to say, `Well, actually, no matter how much the Government gives us, it is not enough; but we only get $800 a fortnight'. The reaction to that program from the public was absolute outrage. One of the letters that was broadcast suggested that, if they want to enter into that type of relationship, that is, to some extent, up to them, but at least one of them ought to assume the role of a breadwinner and go out to work. No, that would be too hard! Of course, we allow them, in effect, to live together, earning $800 a fortnight. We saw them going fishing. That is what they did; they went fishing. Why should they go to work when they can put their hands out!</PARA>
<PARA> The scenario that I am creating here in dealing with this particular legislation is that once again we are confronted with an attempt to create handouts, but we are not even talking, in this situation, about handouts for Australian citizens. We want to go way beyond that now. We want to make it more attractive for people to come here from overseas, land on our shores and put their hands out-put their hands out from the moment they arrive here. This legislation which we are confronted with this afternoon makes it possible for people who have come here, on a conditional residence permit-that is, those who are in a de facto relationship or a formal marriage or, I assume, some sort of homosexual marriage or relationship, whatever they call them-to become entitled to a special benefit, which is actually going to be backdated, would honourable members believe, to the commencement date of the new rules. </PARA>
<PARA> When these people arrive here under those circumstances, there is not even any guarantee that they will be able-bodied people. That is why there is the crossover in this area with the immigration rules. In most situations, we would expect when they come here that they would be able to earn something or go out to work. I suppose that would depend on their being able to get a job, and that came out during the 60 Minutes program last Sunday. What an informative program 60 Minutes is! Last Sunday, we saw an Indian couple who had arrived here expecting that they would be able to get a job. They were interviewed. They seemed to me to be extremely articulate, sensible, decent people. They said that they arrived here, could not get a job and felt very bad, having been here only a short time, because they had to go down and get on the end of the queue for unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> We have encouraged these people; we have allowed these people to come here and we have told them that they can get a job. Of course, they arrive here and find that they cannot get a job and so they get on the unemployment queue. There has to be something dramatically wrong with the way that we handle these particular situations. I believe that the people of Australia are entitled to be extremely cynical about the payment of social security benefits to people who have just arrived here under any circumstances; yet, time after time, we see examples of people who come to this country and immediately get on the line for handouts. </PARA>
<PARA> At least we require people to live here for 10 years-and even that does not seem a long time-before they can get the age pension. The anomaly in that situation is that they can actually come here and get unemployment benefit pretty much the day they arrive. They can stay on unemployment benefit for 10 years, even given the new Jobstart and Job Search arrangements that are in place; then, after 10 years, they can get the age pension. So they get unemployment benefit or some derivation of it for 10 years, then they get the age pension. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that to allow newly arrived immigrants immediately to receive any social security income support certainly sends precisely the wrong signals to prospective entrants. I am sure that the word has got out. It is no wonder that people want to come here! It is no wonder that this is such a marvellous country for people to come to! We maintain the biggest immigration program in the world; on a per capita basis, it is three times the size of the immigration program of the United States. It is no wonder that people want to come here! The word has spread, I imagine, that if people cannot get a job in Australia, it is okay because they get handouts. They can actually come here and live comfortably without having to do any work. For people in most countries of the world, that is quite a surprise. There are not many countries-in fact, I think we are probably the only country-that make that type of facility available to people. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a letter, coincidentally, as this matter came up today, from one of my constituents who lives in Surfers Paradise. He asked me a couple of rather pertinent questions, and in framing a reply I found it rather difficult. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it permissible for an Australian resident, NOT citizen, whose only income is the Government pension (age) supplemented by a small age pension from another country, who lives in a Housing Commission residence also subsidised, of course, by public monies to be regarded by the immigration authorities as an acceptable husband-to-be for the national of another country. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer to that is yes, under the present rules. We do not want to interfere if somebody chooses to marry someone who is living overseas. We do not want to question that. They can make that choice, apparently. If they want to bring their husband, wife or homosexual partner here now, it is okay; and, of course, the implication is that they can then get some social security. The writer of the letter went on and made the point that, I believe, most Australians would make:</PARA>
<PARA> To me as a taxpayer, in receipt of no largesse from the Government at all, it is of the utmost concern that this country should not be saddled with any more social security recipients than we have already. To contemplate the admission of a person with no acceptable qualification, other than that of prospective bride, to join in matrimony a person already receiving social security income defies belief!</PARA>
<PARA>And it does defy belief. The writer went on:</PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious that a single pension will almost immediately be converted to a married pension for a person who has not contributed in any way to the funds of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>He then asked a question, which I have now to answer. Maybe the Government members when they speak can help me. I will probably write to the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) or the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), because I need to answer this question:</PARA>
<PARA>Are we admitting people with no income to join a person-</PARA>
<PARA>not necessarily even Australian; we are talking here about not only Australian citizens but also people who are just resident here-</PARA>
<PARA>(not Australian) only in receipt of Social Security??</PARA>
<PARA>The answer is `Yes, we are'. Under this legislation, that is exactly what we propose to do, and I think it is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA> I could talk about the rorts in the immigration system because they impinge on this, but I talked about that last night. The Government, under the guillotine, rammed through some very significant legislation, some of which I have already alluded to. I got the impression from some of the Government members who were contributing in that debate last night that it is almost laissez faire as far as immigration is concerned. Anyone can come; just about anything goes. We have got 150,000 illegal immigrants in Australia; people have come here on holidays or have come as students and do not want to be students any more. They are out there taking jobs. In my electorate alone, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people working illegally who are taking jobs from young Australians. They are the types of jobs that they are doing. They are taking jobs from young Australians. We have encouraged them to come here. Of course, now that they are here, we cannot find them because we have not got the money to put into programs to find them. It is a big country. If we really started looking closely at my electorate, which I guess lends itself to people who want to come and live the life of Riley--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the tourism capital of Australia, as the honourable member for Fadden said. We find an awful lot of them hanging around there. I say to employers-I will not get too far off the track here-that they should not be employing them; but they are being employed sometimes in substandard conditions, on below award wages, and so on. So we need to question the benefits of an immigration program that has gone just so far out of control. We need to look at what the actual down side is, and to add into the costs of our immigration program, when we do that exercise, the costs of the welfare that we hand out because, for practical purposes, where a migrant never works in Australia, it would be correct to charge the permanent ongoing costs to the cost of immigration. We would then have a far better idea of how our taxes are being swelled by the immigration program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, it appears to me that there are no serious procedures to stop sponsored migrants or even illegal immigrants, as I said before, from claiming unemployment or other benefits immediately on arrival. But the position gets worse-if that is possible. This legislation actually goes beyond that position. Not only are we going to allow people to come here and to go on social security straight away-and if the husband is already on a pension and brings his new wife here, then they get the married pension overnight-but the Government proposes to be even more generous. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking here about being generous with taxpayers' money; it must be easy if the Government is not spending its own money, because it has decided that new arrivals are entitled to backdated lump sum payments. The Department of Social Security apparently has promised payments as from 1 April 1991. I hope somebody on the Government side will answer this question in the limited time available for the debate: assuming new arrivals have survived financially to date, what justification is there for this back payment now to 1 April 1991? It is just Government largess again. No wonder the great majority of taxpayers listening to this debate today are concerned about how their money is being spent. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to a couple of aspects of this legislation. First, the indexation of the pharmaceutical allowance: last year the Government introduced the concessional beneficiary pharmaceutical charge, which was designed to arrest the explosion in the cost of so-called free pharmaceuticals. The Government gives the wrong message in many respects because people, if they do not pay for something, think it is free. So the Government's response in respect of the pharmaceutical benefits was to introduce a charge. </PARA>
<PARA> That was okay; that was in a sense using a price mechanism for what, I suppose, is a fairly valid purpose. But then the Government had to compensate the pensioners. It came up with a scheme whereby the pensioners got more money. Although they had to pay when they went to get their prescriptions, they were not really paying because they were getting the money back on their pensions. Nevertheless, it has probably had some psychological effect because people having to put their hands in their pocket when they went to a pharmacy had the immediate effect of deterring them from getting prescriptions unnecessarily. I do not know whose fault it was. </PARA>
<PARA> When pensioners or anybody else go to the doctor, the doctor says, `What is wrong?'. They say, `I have got a headache'. The doctor says, `I will give you a prescription'. That was okay. But now the pensioner says, `Hang on. Can you do something else? I do not want a prescription because it costs me $2.50'. It does not really cost them that but they have to fork out $2.50 when they get a prescription. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one of the problems we have with the whole Medicare system. No wonder it is costing this country so much: people think it is free as well. They pay a Medicare levy, but the total levy collections work out to be about one-fifth of the actual cost of running the whole scheme. Of course, we have bulkbilling, whereby even wealthy people say, `This is terrific; we can go to the doctor for nothing'. But that is not true either. It is costing a lot more than that. </PARA>
<PARA> In this situation the Minister has upset a lot of people. As I said, his idea was right about putting the charge on. But he has upset a lot of people and so he has had to increase the pensions. But in the process-and talk about compounding errors, or going from the sublime to the ridiculous-he effectively overcompensates many pensioners because there is a vast number out there who did not need so many prescriptions. So these people are effectively overcompensated. We now find that this overcompensation will be entrenched by this Bill. I suppose that must be, in a sense, an unintended consequence. I am not making a statement here about the plight of pensioners because they have certainly got plenty to complain about, but it is hardly the best way to solve a problem which the Minister created for himself. </PARA>

<PARA> The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), who has just spoken, has indicated quite dramatically how those opposite are in utter confusion. First of all, for seven years they had a much higher social security budget than this Government has had in its first seven years-much higher because they had more handouts and more unemployment benefits. Now the honourable member is accusing us of not remedying the situation which was left as a legacy by the previous Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What the honourable member has said when talking about migrants is that we have not taken actions which were not taken when those opposite were in government. In fact, actions have been taken. With regard to migration, for instance, of over one million applicants-I do not know what the exact figure is because I did not expect to come here to debate migration-little more than 100,000 are permitted to come to Australia. Because of the substantial checking through the points system, these migrants are targeted so that there is not much likelihood of them being unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> It certainly happens in the case of refugees, but under United Nations arrangements and other international arrangements we take a certain proportion of refugees into Australia. If these refugees are entitled to benefits, then it may well be that they ought to receive them. After all, they have to live. We have taken them under an international agreement and we ought to allow them to have benefits in those cases. But people who are assessed under normal migration criteria are assessed so thoroughly that there is not much chance that a substantial number of them will be unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no wonder that there is confusion because under the previous Government the number of handouts was substantially higher. Now those opposite are saying, `Let us get tougher. Let us take unemployment benefits off people after nine months'. </PARA>

I would like to go to New York with the honourable member for McPherson; he is good company. I am on a couple of committees with him. If he went to New York with me and just walked along the streets, he would see sleeping under scaffolding people who have nowhere to sleep, no public housing and no benefits. They are begging for money. Those people hang up their clothes, if it is raining, on scaffolding, and try to sleep under it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those opposite are talking tough. The confusion is that we do not know whether they would be tough or whether they would go back to their old ways of being careless and saying, `We can push these people aside, on the dole, and forget about them'. What we are trying to do now through this legislation is to have a fundamental overhaul of what applies to people. The broad range of social security, employment, education and training measures is going to give accountability to taxpayers-the sort of accountability which the honourable member for McPherson was requesting. </PARA>
<PARA> More than that, it is going to give fulfilment to Australians who have been forgotten. It is going to give maximum fulfilment to people who have been unemployed, perhaps long term, or to people who are disabled-or even to people who are in employment but who have not felt fulfilment. So through a broad range of training schemes and social security measures there is going to be encouragement for people who feel hopeless: we are going to give them hope through the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I thoroughly support the Government's legislation. Whatever the Government decides, I will not be voting for this amendment circulated by the honourable member for Dawson. He wants a fundamental overhaul but he will not tell us what that fundamental overhaul is. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument that the Opposition has so far put to us, the kite that it has flown, is assessment by charities-assessment of all these social security beneficiaries by charitable organisations and non-government organisations. Of course, the response we receive from the non-government organisations is that they do not want to do that. I certainly believe that they should not be able to do it, because those charitable and non-government organisations vary. One charitable organisation in one area may be generous; another charitable organisation in another area may be tough. Naturally, they do not want that because it gives them a whole new range of responsibilities. The assessment should be where it is, although maybe more localised, and that is in the area of government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition then talked about payment by chartered accountants-for example, Price Waterhouse-instead of by the social security office. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) has said that there would be people walking into the marble halls of Price Waterhouse to talk about their payment of benefits. It is quite ridiculous to expect private organisations to handle this sort of thing in an equitable way. We should reject the sort of fundamental overhauls which the Opposition has talked about but which it has not defined. We do not want what has happened in other countries of the world: people pushing their worldly goods around in shopping trolleys, people being put out of institutions, because they cannot get benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly support the broad range of social security and economic measures, having had a fairly full involvement with them in committee, that have been instituted by the Government. The Government, through this legislation, is giving people greater fulfilment: for instance, the replacement of the invalid pension by the disability support pension, and the sickness benefit by the sickness allowance. With the implementation of these changes, people will have opportunities to look for work and will be encouraged to look for work. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Opposition response? We had it from the honourable member for Dawson that the Opposition is worried that the people who are already on invalid pensions, the people who are already on benefits, are not being reassessed. He says that they will not be given the chance to receive rehabilitation and training. Those people certainly will receive those opportunities, if they want them. They will be encouraged, just as anyone will be, to take opportunities in rehabilitation and training with the broad range of measures that are being introduced and that are occurring already not only in hospitals where people are being rehabilitated but also in the Commonwealth rehabilitation centres. I had the privilege of opening one of these centres recently in Batemans Bay where people can get help with the transitional stages of being rehabilitated into the community, into their social life and then into work. </PARA>
<PARA> Current recipients will be reviewed. All people who are on sickness benefit as at 30 September 1991 will be reviewed for continuous sickness allowance on or before 1 January 1992. Administratively, they cannot be processed any faster than over a three-month period, but they will be reviewed. Those who are on an invalid pension either now or at 30 September 1991 will be granted the disability support pension automatically on 1 October 1991. About 2 per cent of those on invalid pension as at 20 August 1990-which is the date of the announcement of the reforms-will be reviewed as soon as possible after 1 October 1991 as regards continued eligibility for the new pension. Of those granted invalid pension after 20 August 1990, 30 per cent will be reviewed as soon as possible after 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> So there has been a broad range of measures which will help not only the people who will be on benefits but also those who have been on benefits in the past. The opportunity is there. Of course, we do not want to be harsh on people, particularly those people who are over 55. They will be excepted from the consideration only of medical criteria. They will find it difficult to get back into work, just as unemployed people over the age of 55 will find it difficult to get back into work. We should not have the same expectations of those people. There will not be jobs for many of them. So it is pointless to place those strict requirements on them. </PARA>
<PARA> Other provisions will also be of benefit to people. For instance, those who find work will only have their pension suspended for two years, usually. But there is, as I have said, every chance for people to receive rehabilitation and training, if they really want it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security (Rewrite) Amendment Bill 1991 refers to amendments made to the 1947 Act by a number of pieces of legislation-the Social Welfare (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Act 1990, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1990, and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act 1990. There is a requirement that they be incorporated into the 1991 Act. This covers a wide range of initiatives that have been introduced, including the tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again that I disagreed with the withdrawal by this Government of the original proposal for an Australia Card. People come to me and say, `This tax file number is a nuisance. Why didn't you go ahead with the Australia Card?'. I have to say to them that we did not go ahead with the Australia Card because the Senate was obviously going to reject it. This Government introduced the proposal for an Australia Card. People are now saying, `We've got a drivers licence with our picture on it. Why can't we have an Australia Card? It would be much easier than this clerical or administrative work involving a tax file number'. With the Australia Card, people would just have had to show it; now they have to give their tax file number. That is recorded and available to banks, the Australian Taxation Office and Social Security. I agree that an Australia Card would have been much simpler. But now we have the tax file number. The tax file number is eliminating quite a deal of fraud but, more than that, it is making us accountable to the taxpayers, which the honourable member for McPherson was requesting. </PARA>
<PARA> Another initiative which is covered is deeming. There is no doubt that since deeming was introduced people have actually increased their incomes; it is no longer an advantage for them to invest for little or no return at all. They are now deemed to have a percentage return. Many people are finding that they are actually at an advantage by being able to invest in the wide range of opportunities available, even at call, in banks and other financial institutions. It is actually worth their while investing, and the deeming has had that benefit both for them and for taxpayers. In that the taxpayers are no longer obliged to support them to the same extent; they are doing better because they lose only 50c in every extra dollar that most of them make. The people who have lost, of course, are the banks and the financial institutions, who are paying no interest at all or, in some cases, very little interest on cheque accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> Other items include the liquid assets test for sickness beneficiaries and the recovery of overpayments. I am pleased that the methods used by the Department have to date, in my experience, been fairly elastic. Where there have been overpayments, the Department has been fairly flexible in the way that it has tolerated the repayments from clients who have been overpaid. </PARA>
<PARA> The employment entry payment for sole parents is extremely important. A couple of years ago, when we decided that sole parents whose children came of age would have to go back into the work force and be available for work for an income from the Government, I can remember people coming to me with very sad stories: women with very little or no employment at all since they had left school and some women with no employment since they were perhaps 19 or 20 years old, when they were married. They were very worried. But now, with the training schemes that are available, half of the people who have taken up these schemes have found jobs. It is very interesting that many employers throughout Australia, particularly those in small business, prefer these women who are coming back into the work force; they are very popular with employers.</PARA>
<PARA> Disaster relief payments are another area which is covered in the initiatives under the legislation. These payments are very important. They have different criteria. There can be problems where people are not always eligible for payments under other systems. As disasters are always a possibility in most areas of Australia, these payments are important. </PARA>
<PARA> Another initiative is the extension of the qualification criteria for remote area allowance. I, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls), the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), and a wide range of other members would have people in our electorates who are entitled to a remote area allowance. Their extension of qualification needs to be taken into account, and it is. </PARA>
<PARA> The pharmaceutical benefits allowance, which is a charge, of course, is compensated. The honourable member for McPherson has referred to it. He does not realise that people are getting an allowance, so full funding is provided for their pharmaceutical benefits. He accuses us of overcompensating. He should realise-he may be listening to this speech in his office or somewhere else-that there has been a drop in the numbers of prescriptions to people who do not really need them. That will be both a financial benefit and a health benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes people receive prescriptions which are worth anything up to $100 or $200. I think the highest priced item I have seen on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme was $1,700. People can get these benefits and not know that they are worth that amount. It is important that people are aware-not necessarily of the amount charged-of the fact that it costs money. That is why the charge is made on pharmaceutical benefits. The Government has supplemented pensions and other allowances so that people can afford to pay them. When they reach a threshold, they can then get free prescriptions. The amended international social security agreement with the United Kingdom and the new agreement with Malta are specifically mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget 1990 initiatives which affect the employment benefit and Job Search allowance structure in the 1947 Act are incorporated into the new provisions for Job Search allowance and Newstart allowance to be inserted into the 1991 Act by the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill 1991, which was introduced into this House on 18 April 1991. That will mean, once again, that unemployment benefits are abolished. The concept of the dole has gone, but there is an allowance in its place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not pulling out unemployment benefits after nine months, let alone immediately, but it is making sure that people can get an allowance, as long as they are prepared to enter an agreement with the Commonwealth Employment Service to undertake training schemes, if they are reasonably offered, and perhaps even move away if accommodation is reasonably offered. In other words, there should be a reasonable agreement. It may even cover the presentation of a person when going for a job. There is an agreement, which can be appealed against and can be reviewed, between the recipient of the allowance and the Commonwealth Employment Service and people are encouraged to go into the work force and are given all the means possible to assist them in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment is fairly high and it may get a little higher, but in six or seven months the turn is going to happen and people will need to be ready for the jobs as they come up. Honourable members should remember that the last time jobs came up there was a huge gap between the number of unemployed people and the number of employers who wanted people to work for them but could not find people with the right skills. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this legislation, which is a partner of the other legislation, we will find that people will be able to move into the work force more readily through the broad range of government programs. I oppose the Opposition's amendment and support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill and the Social Security (Rewrite) Amendment Bill under discussion touch the lives of people who, while having so much to offer our society, are often cut off from the mainstream of Australia by a virtual glass wall. That is, people with physical, intellectual or emotional disabilities and people who are sick can see the mainstream of people and be seen, but in the past they could not join the mainstream because of lack of options and lack of opportunities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some people, including some honourable members in this House, appear to be absorbed by the abuses of the system which supports and rehabilitates people. This waste of taxpayers' money really worries them. That is fair enough, as long as we do not use this worry to cover up the greater worry and the greater need of people who have been neglected and from whom healthy society has turned away. </PARA>
<PARA> One has to look at such abuses of the system, because cheats are denying people with authentic needs the taxpayer funded aids and supports which are their right, or should be their right in a decent nation, and taking away the money which would go further to fill real needs in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is taking the anomalies and the adverse aspects of the social security system seriously, and is particularly looking at abuse. The Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill 1991 deals with such potential abuse. This Bill would include the provision for the deferment of disability support pension payments for relevant persons, who do not take reasonable steps to meet the active requirements of the pension, to receive treatment, undergo a program of assistance or undertake Job Search and work. These segments must be implemented with extreme sensitivity. A stigma could certainly attach to people during the process of monitoring and the process of assessment, but it is up to us to see that such a stigma does not arise and does not develop. It is the risk with any publicly funded program, but it is a risk which must be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides real hope and assistance for people in this category who are disabled or sick to acquire skills so that they will be better placed now and when the labour market starts to improve. To encourage transition to work, a disability support pensioner who finds employment will, in the majority of cases, have his or her pension suspended for up to two years-not finalised. </PARA>
<PARA> This piece of legislation has a lot to do with options; it has a lot to do with dignity. Up until now people have been bundled into one category, whether it be in the Job Search area or whether it be in determining eligibility for the invalid pension. Those of us who have dealt with applications for the invalid pension over the years have certainly seen the anomalies and injustices that can arise-a rigidity-in the application of a percentage of disability when deciding who is or is not to have support. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the Bills that have gone before the House in recent years-certainly over the last two or three years-have been trying to overcome the rigidity of such legislation, trying to assess people on individual needs. In the past, particularly under the Disability Services Act (DSA) and under the Department of Community Services and Health, programs have been introduced and implemented to strive to overcome a phenomenon which can attack some people with disabilities and some people who are on invalid pensions-people lose confidence; they fear making the transition in breaking out into the healthy and so-called able world. Agoraphobia is a sickness, a disease experienced by many people who are cut off from the mainstream of life for whatever reason. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that when we implement regulations and eligibility rules we have to look not only at the possibility that people might just want easy money when they stick to a pension-whether it be a disability pension, sickness pension or other benefit-but also at whether in fact they have lost confidence to the extent that they fear going beyond that weekly or monthly handout. I believe that in many cases this would be so. </PARA>
<PARA> When we are looking at legislation such as the Bills we are debating today, we must do so not only with sensitivity but also in the context of other legislation. The Bill is certainly about making the system efficient to the advantage of all, but it is also about change and the creation of new opportunities for people with disabilities, many of whom have been excluded from the mainstream of life's possibilities, risks and advantages for far too long. Protection has not really been to the advantage of a number of such people. I know there are different degrees of disability and it depends on the specific person. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes should be monitored carefully and certainly they will be reviewed. They should also be considered in the context of other Government programs aimed at assessing job needs and providing options. Since the introduction of the Disability Services Act, a range of services have developed whose primary goal is to obtain jobs in open employment for people with disabilities. I am very aware of the pace at which services such as Work Scope, Epic, Compass, Work Venture and Red Cross, to name just a few in Brisbane, have been developing, especially in the last three years, and I am impressed by how active they have been in locating jobs and providing on the job training and support for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I have seen how changes under the Disability Services Act which may seem unremarkable to many people in the community, because they simply reflect things which are generally taken for granted, are in fact truly revolutionary. It is the very ordinariness, the very simplicity, of the basis underlying the changes which emphasises the revolutionary nature of the programs. It is that ordinariness which is the point. </PARA>
<PARA> All Australians are being given the opportunity to live the lifestyle option of their choice, including working in the place of their choice. It is important to note that one cannot bundle all people with disabilities under one category or assume that employment programs will open horizons for them all. Diverse individual potentials require a diversity of options, but the supported and open employment programs initiated under the Disability Services Act offer a large number of people with disabilities a diversity of new opportunities and experiences which once were just unimagined-the opportunity for real work in the regular work force with the same working conditions as everyone else, not a specially created, so-called disability job; the opportunity to earn a fair award based or productivity based wage and to enjoy both the benefits of a weekly pay packet, with its increased economic independence, and real leisure, not simply an enforced whiling away of the time; the opportunity to learn new skills; the opportunity to demonstrate enthusiasm and ability in the workplace; and, even more significantly, the opportunity to be free of the sheltered conformity of segregated factory style environments and to develop new relationships and make new friends with a wider range of people in the workplace and in the general community. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what is happening. Many new initiatives are continuing to be developed to remove the existing barriers and disincentives which prevent people with disabilities participating more fully in the working life of the community. Some of these barriers include lack of income security; employer-employee disincentives such as poor job design and job training; family attitudes; inaccessible transport, both public and private; unfair or inequitable wages; and a reluctant lack of self-confidence, which in itself turns people back again behind the doors and, in the past, has made them reliant on the pension. I am speaking of people who have the potential to go further. </PARA>
<PARA> New initiatives include the disability reform package announced in the 1990-91 Budget, which heralded the development of a more active income security system, concentrating on younger people and new entrants to the system. This strategy, which represents the most significant reform to the disability income security system since the early 1900s, allows for social security payments to be structured in such a way that people with severe disabilities will be able to develop their work force potential while maintaining an adequate and secure source of income support. </PARA>
<PARA> The disability task force, an interdepartmental committee composed of members of the Department of Community Services and Health, the Department of Industrial Relations, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training, has been established for the purpose of developing a framework for skills based wages which would operate within the mainstream industrial environment. The development of an appropriate and equitable system of wage payments is particularly important for people whose disability prevents them from earning a full award wage even with intensive support and training. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the introduction of the DSA, this Government has funded 225 new employment services, providing around 3,500 new program places. Our 1990-91 Budget package added a further 4,000 employment places by 1993-94. These additional places will be distributed between supported employment services and competitive employment services. At the same time, 5,000 extra places specifically targeted at people with disabilities will be provided in labour market programs administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. The Government will also provide 4,500 additional rehabilitation places to cope with the demand for our more active income support strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge now is to ensure that these funds can create actual jobs tailored to the needs of people with disabilities. To facilitate the structural processes of change, the Government is also establishing a national technical assistance unit in Sydney for the purpose of providing independent expert technical assistance for the transition of sheltered workshops to eligible supported and competitive employment services under the DSA. A key element of the unit will be both the development and implementation of transition plans for sheltered workshops. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I think it is most important that, when we talk of taking away one particular allowance, or changing the name of one particular allowance, and altering segments of one particular system or program, there is no intent to leave-indeed no possibility of leaving-people without income support, without training, without assessment or without opportunities to reach their best potential, whether it be at home or out in the workplace with someone alongside them assisting them to enter that workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a range of different options already opening up, and the Bills before the House are part of that overall package. They should be accepted as such with goodwill by both sides of the House, for it is truly said that when an efficient system is not available to cater for people with disabilities, the people who are sick, it is the carers, the providers and the community organisations who conduct the mop-up-and they are supporting the objectives of these Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) in a moment. I know for a fact that the honourable member for Lilley has a very deep interest in people with disabilities. The sincerity of her thoughts in that regard came out during her contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also would like to thank the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) for her contribution and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) for his. As the honourable member for Dawson just stated: what about his speech? It was a 30-minute one, and that is fine. I know that the honourable member for Dawson also takes a very close interest in these matters affecting people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has introduced a new culture in terms of the active employment strategy, for which Bills were passed not very long ago, and, in respect of people with disabilities, has also come up with a more active training culture so that we can try to make sure that those people who have some possibility of entering the work force are given every opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> For far too long there has been a situation in this country in which, for one reason or another, people as young as 18 years of age go on an invalid pension and, because of the lack of appropriate opportunities, stay on that invalid pension, sometimes for the whole of their lives. In other words, they get onto a treadmill; they get into a rut in which they think they are of no use to anybody and they are never given the opportunities to be able to better themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The disability reform package complements the active employment strategy of the Government, and it is an encouragement to those who receive pensions or allowances to maximise their work potential so as to be prepared for any future work opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill, as correctly stated by all honourable members, will introduce two streams of disability support pension-an inactive strategy and an active strategy. It has been stated by the honourable member for Dawson that there are not sufficient penalties in the Bill to make sure that people do the right thing and that those who can work do in fact take up the training opportunities availed to them. The Government is satisfied that the penalty provisions or the enforcement provisions are in order and that to make them any tougher would not do anybody any good. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dawson suggested that the mobility allowance should be increased and that costs of disability should be recognised. Research on the varying costs of disablement is almost complete and proposals will soon be put to the Government. In the meantime the mobility allowance has been increased from $22 to $40 per fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA> The general criticisms that have been levelled at this Bill-and I speak now specifically of the disability reform package-do not take into account the fact that there was a lot of discussion and a lot of consultation with people and organisations involved in the disability field. They believe that this disability reform package is indeed a very good step and is something which should have happened a long time ago. All comment that we have received from welfare organisations so far has been good, and I am very pleased that the honourable member for Dawson did not come up with anybody who he believes has criticised these Bills from the welfare lobby, from councils of social service, et cetera, or from disability organisations, for that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dawson also put forward the proposition that this Bill is lax in the assessment of those who are disabled, with the result that they will go onto pensions. That is not so. The new arrangements will mean fewer will go onto a disability support pension because almost no notice will now be taken of socio-economic factors; the assessment will be almost entirely medical. Secondly, those on the new disability support pension or sickness allowance will be considered intensively for rehabilitation and vocational training. Refusal to participate in such programs may lead to non-payment or cancellation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point to be made is that there will be a fair bit of cooperation here between the Department of Community Services and Health, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Social Security (DSS). The honourable member for Dawson expressed some reservations about the training of disability support officers and whether they would be sufficiently trained to be able to make these assessments as to who should go on the active strategy or the inactive strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer to that is that there will be 75 disability support officers employed by the DSS. A consultant at this very point in time is being selected to do the training. The consultant will draw up a formal course with on the job experience as a component. Experienced DSS trainers will assist with this. The disability support officers will be trained over three months, between July and September, given that this starts on 1 October 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The Disability Advisory Council will nominate other consultants to double-check the training to ensure that it is comprehensive. The Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Community Services and Health will be involved as is required and as is appropriate. I understand the cost will be of the order of $100,000. There will be similar ongoing training for new recruits. </PARA>
<PARA> Every opportunity will be given by the Government to ensure that everyone knows what it is that he or she can get out of this new program. Just to put it as simply as I can, the position will be that only those who apply for a disability support pension after 1 October will be affected by this. All those who are on invalid pensions now will retain their eligibility, except for approximately 2 per cent of those persons, who have already received a letter and are having their entitlement reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> That does not mean that all those who are presently on an invalid pension cannot apply to go on the active stream. When an application is made it will go to a disability support officer, one of the 75 we will have trained by that time; that officer will make the assessment as to whether the person is 20 per cent disabled and as to whether he or she should go to the active stream or the inactive stream. </PARA>
<PARA> If the person involved goes to the inactive stream, he or she will automatically be awarded a disability support pension. If the disability support officer believes that that person should go on the active stream, he or she will then be referred to a panel made up of someone from the DSS, a Commonwealth rehabilitation officer and, of course, someone from the Department of Employment, Education and Training. At that stage the person will be entitled to have with him or her a friend or somebody who can put forward the situation in case the person involved cannot explain it. Appeal rights will be there if the person is not happy with the assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important to note also that the disability support officers will be looking at the medical records not only of a government medical officer but also of the doctor treating that person, so there will be notice taken of the individual's own doctor. That panel will then decide as to what sort of package it will put the person on and the sort of training it believes that person would benefit from. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be stated, and emphasised, that this legislation will provide many of these people with opportunities that they may have not had in the past. I accept, and understand, what the honourable member for Dawson would probably be thinking-that some people cannot, that some people with disabilities would be hopeless in the sense that they do not have the sorts of skills to go into any sort of job. I know what the honourable member feels with respect to sheltered workshops. I will not comment on that, but I have views, that in some instances, are not all that far away from his. </PARA>
<PARA> If we can give such people the opportunity, and they believe that they want to take that opportunity and give it a go, we should not stand in their way. In fact, we should give them all the help that we can. At the end of the day, this will give these people some dignity and the opportunity to enter into the mainstream of life and get the social interaction that occurs when one has a job. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I and members here are very blessed that we do not have any disabilities. I can just imagine how lonely it could be if one were just stuck at home on an invalid pension. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dawson also put forward the proposition that assessment of inability to work based on a prediction of being unable to work for two years could discourage people from attempting to work. That is not so. Any person granted a disability support pension who may have work potential will be assessed for rehabilitation, training or similar programs that could assist them to join the work force. People will not be left to their own devices when on a disability support pension, if work is a possibility. Training will be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some of the comments made by the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford). We know that the honourable member can always be somewhat colourful and has views that sometimes are not exactly mainstream, shall I say; but, frankly, I think he insulted those people who come to this country as immigrants when he said that our immigration policy was so free or so easy, in his own words, that people would probably come here because they think they will get a handout. To me, that is an absolute insult. If he wants to attack the Government's immigration policy, that is up to him, but it is being a little over the top, if not bordering on racism--</PARA>

<PARA> While we are on the question of newcomers from other countries, I want to touch on the question of portability of pensions, which, I note, the honourable member for Dawson says that the Opposition supports. I refer to the portability of wives pensions and class B widows pensions. Last year, in its 1990 economic statement, the Government came forward with a number of propositions which would restrict the portability of these types of pensions. The Government has been concerned for some time now-in fact, since 1973 or 1974-that there were a small number of people in other countries, particularly Greece and Turkey, who were receiving wives pensions and class B widows pensions but had never been to Australia. So the Government restricted those pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> Later, after certain consultations between the Greek and Turkish communities and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), a number of exemptions were made to that law. It was amended further in May so that all de jure widows, whether or not they leave after July 1990, will be able to retain that pension. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the guillotine will bring this debate to a halt at 5.20 p.m., and I do not know whether my friend opposite wants to say anything further. I commend these Bills to the House. They are very good Bills and will really help many people. The Government and the Minister for Social Security should be congratulated on them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As indicated in the second reading debate, the Opposition opposes clauses 4 and 10. I will speak to clause 4, because it is all-inclusive as far as we are concerned and refers to the special benefit. The Bill provides for certain things in connection with the change in the migration laws and also allows a discretion to the Secretary of the Department of Social Security to provide a special benefit. We did canvass this during the second reading debate. We believe that a person who comes here within the period concerned to be given the conditional residence permit for a marriage would be checked quite thoroughly with respect to health and those defects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For precisely the same reason that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) mentioned, whilst the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) was not being racist, we are saying that it does send the wrong signals if people are able to come to Australia and automatically find that they can obtain special benefits. We are not saying that migrants do it, but we are saying that it sends the wrong signals to prospective entrants; and we would oppose clause 4, and later will oppose clause 10, with the intention that we send out the right signals by deleting these clauses from the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill, I would like to first register my complaint about the fact that we are under guillotine yet again and dealing with over 30 Bills in one week. It seems that one of the many things that this Government cannot do is run this chamber, let alone run itself. This Bill, which the coalition will not be opposing, deals with a number of areas of local government, and four main ones in particular. The first two will give effect to the some of the decisions of last October's Special Premiers Conference. The first of them allows local road funding to be untied when it is given to local councils and the other relates to the maintenance of general purpose assistance in real terms to be in line with the levels in the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a couple of other changes. One of those is to correct the funding formula for local government to take into account the decision to transfer the debits tax base to the States and Territories. If the Government had not made this amendment there would have been a reduction in general purpose grants to local government. In other words, yet again the Government was disorganised and has had to rush this Bill in without realising prior to this date that it overlooked this point. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth change provides the Treasurer with discretion to set the level of general purpose assistance to local government similar to the general purpose assistance that has been given to the States. It clarifies the existing situation by allowing changes without it being necessary to have frequent changes to the legislation. Although this allows the States some further security in planning-in other words, some predictability for the next three years in general purpose assistance-the Government has allowed itself a safety clause. This obviously means that, if the economic conditions are not satisfactory or if there is a major deterioration, the Government has the opportunity, if it so wishes, to reduce the general purpose assistance. While, obviously, this clause has some merit, it also gives the Government a chance of a cop-out and therefore is of some concern to local government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly of some concern when we see that local government could very easily be penalised, yet the Commonwealth itself has not shown the same sort of discipline that it has been willing to apply to itself to other levels of government. In other words, although it is cutting back-in the past, it has cut back quite a bit to the States-it has not made the same cuts in its own expenditure. If we do some analysis on this, we will find that spending by the Commonwealth under this Government has not fallen anything like that which has happened to the States and that which has been forced on local government from the assistance it gets from other levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA> While there may well be some arguments to say that the State budgets could be trimmed, the fact is that the Commonwealth has many areas where it could cut. To demonstrate our bona fides on this, before the 1990 election the coalition parties showed details under our Economic Action Plan of how we could cut $3 billion off Commonwealth expenditure. We demonstrated it in considerable detail. When we talk about cuts to government expenditure we can show exactly how it can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government is still not only trying to escape the cuts that it wants to apply to other levels of government but is also, by putting in this escape clause, intending to try to make the States and local government carry the burden of the sort of discipline that it should be applying to itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the question of road funding, which is an integral part of this legislation. While we have no objection to local government getting more flexibility in how it spends the money that it is getting, there is some concern about what this will mean in the longer term. There is no doubt that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) is also concerned because it will reduce those photo opportunities that he seems to love to have when he is travelling around Australia. Maybe the Minister at the table, the Minister for Local Government (Ms Fatin), might like to take up the challenge and try to match his efforts. It seems that he spends most of his time standing in front of a camera or a microphone trying to get publicity. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we are pleased to see that road funding at this stage will continue to be identified. We would like to see some more tangible evidence that motorists will know that the money that has been raised from their taxes, particularly fuel tax, will be maintained in real terms in the expected funding. I will come back to the question of the level of funding for roads in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, local government is concerned about the question of full absorption because, once we take away any connection with road funding in any form, local government could very easily be squeezed in times of an economic downturn, such as the recession that we have had forced on us by the present Government. That squeeze could affect particularly local roads. </PARA>
<PARA> The record of the present Government when it comes to road funding is appalling. In the last seven years, in real terms we have seen the amount of money allocated to roads drop by 27 per cent, yet at the same time the amount of revenue that has gone to the Commonwealth from fuel excise has increased by over 90 per cent. Before the last election, the coalition gave a very clear undertaking that, if we were elected, we would increase over three years the amount of funds going out of existing fuel taxes to roads by $1,000m. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the Commonwealth's cutting back on road funding over the last seven years has had a very marked effect on our road network. We have seen a rapid deterioration in many parts of our road network. Often, we have seen local councils rip up local roads and turn them back to gravel. We have seen sealed roads with potholes in them like we have not seen around this country for decades and we have seen gravel roads which were once bitumen roads. They are a sign of what has happened because the Government has cut back on road funding. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at this situation, one finds it is far more serious than that. If one does an analysis of our major roads, one finds that over half have surfaces over 20 years old. Many are approaching the end of the normal lifespan of a road and some have even gone past it. It is clear that a major infrastructure problem is building up because the Government, in its short sighted economics, has not looked forward to what it means to take these cuts, which may save money in the short term but which will prove extremely expensive in the long term. Had many of these roads been properly maintained and upgraded when necessary, we might not be facing the massive bill over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> We must remember that for many people roads are the only way they can travel; roads are a vital part of our communication network. That is why I think the Government stands condemned for allowing so much of this vital network-one of the country's most valuable assets-to deteriorate in a way that has not been seen since the war. This is against the background of the challenge that will be faced by the roads in the level of usage expected over the next decade. As the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) is so fond of saying, the freight task is expected to double over the next decade. It is a wonder the Minister does not say with his next breath that we will have to match that with an increase in road funding. Yet, as I have said, over the last seven years road funding from the Commonwealth has dropped in real terms by 27 per cent, and the number of cars on the road is expected to increase by about 30 per cent over the next decade. Why has the money going to roads not been increased to match this and to anticipate what the need will be?</PARA>
<PARA> Not only that; it is estimated that up to 30 per cent of car crashes are due in part to bad roads. The estimated cost of a fatality which occurs on the roads is about $475,000; that figure could be revised shortly. This is a massive cost, not only in human suffering for those directly connected with the person who unfortunately loses his life, but also to the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of people in road accidents do not die, and the cost of caring for someone with severe disabilities caused by a road accident could be in excess of $800,000. The cost of bad roads is enormous in terms of human suffering and the economy. There is ample evidence around to show that better roads are safer roads. In many places the cost of improving those roads can be undertaken without massive changes. For example, an extra metre on road width can reduce head-on and run off road crashes by 20 per cent; improving or increasing the number of passing lanes on many roads can cut crashes by as much as 50 per cent; and replacing an undivided road with a freeway, where that can be afforded, can cut down the number of crashes by 90 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a great opportunity for the Government to demonstrate its bona fides. When we talk about roads and funding for local roads, we should recognise the value of those roads. If we look at what it means to the community to have those roads upgraded to the level we could reasonably afford if we gave them priority, I think in terms of lives and the economics the savings would be extensive. </PARA>
<PARA> As I pointed out, the Government's record on road funding is not good. One suspects that may reflect a number of other things in the Government's record, and its problems, over the past few days. While this Bill gives local government a three-year undertaking, one must ask whether that will be honoured. That is one of the major points the Government will have to stand by. One problem with that is that the Government might not be here for three years. I can assure all those concerned about that matter that the coalition parties demonstrated their bona fides in their concern for roads and, particularly, for local government before the last election; that is, the coalition will give local government the support it so justly deserves. </PARA>
<PARA> While the coalition does not oppose this Bill, it believes there is a real risk that, by taking road funding for local roads out of the Australian Land Transport Development Trust Fund and sourcing it from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the Government has greater scope and opportunity to reduce the amount of money going to roads in future years. Given the Government's record already in reducing funds to roads when we have a trust fund for the land transport portfolio, local government has every right to feel nervous about what this Bill will mean in the long term. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, in listening to the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), with his gloom and doom predictions of what this legislation will do for local government, the only conclusion one could come to is that the honourable member not only did not read the Bill, but, had he read the Bill and understood its implications, obviously did not go out and communicate with the electorate at large. By that, because this Bill is the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill, I mean local government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Local government welcomes the legislation now before the House. One must consider that throughout Australia one has the opportunity of knocking on the doors of 914 councils; my State has 176. Those councils want what the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) has achieved with his legislation. The honourable member went on to talk about building highways and asked what would happen to the roads if we did not have proper maintenance. I do not disagree with a lot of the sentiments in that, except to say that one does not create a freeway with a local government road. I am sure my constituents, when they see that the council has classified their road as a local road, would view with trepidation the fact that we are going to turn local road grants, which are what this Bill is about, into freeway applications. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure the honourable member that the money allocated, and what this Bill refers to, would not build one kilometre of freeway. This Bill is referring to the actual transfer of the allocation for local roads to local councils. I will touch on that part now because I am concerned, as the Minister for Local Government (Mrs Fatin) is aware, that to allocate local road grants under the system we use for the allocation of local government assistance grants would be most unfair. The Government knows that; that system needs to be worked out, otherwise there will be instances where a highly populated council would, under the present system for financial assistance grants, perhaps have only about 50 kilometres of roadways as designated local roads and could possibly receive a large amount of money from the funding for local roads, whereas a council with a very small population-it could have something like 5,000 square kilometres-because of its small population, would receive limited amounts of money under local road grants. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government knows and acknowledges that this is only a small proportion of the money spent by local governments on roads throughout Australia, but at the same time the Government is saying that local road funding will no longer be tied and it has, through the Minister's negotiations, acceptance throughout local government that this year the money allocated will be spent on roads. I am fearful that councils in the future, when they realise this money is untied, will spend it in some other area. I am sure neither councils nor ratepayers would do that, but it still leaves a doubt in my mind. Previously they were always tied so that we knew that money allocated-whether from the Commonwealth to the State or from the State to local government-for a specific purpose had to be spent for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise we must change to meet the future, and I certainly welcome the Government's decision to provide local councils with the same real terms funding guarantee for the next three years. I think this has been a victory for local government, and I reiterate for the benefit of local government: not so long ago it was very concerned about a report brought down by the commissioners of the Commonwealth Grants Commission following a Special Premiers Conference in 1989. Local government throughout Australia welcomed that announcement released by the Minister for Local Government on 1 May, when it was accepted by Cabinet and by Government that funding for local government would continue with real terms increases. That certainly gave stability to local government around Australia for the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, we have the initiatives that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced in 1990 of reforming Australia's Federal arrangements involving the Commonwealth, the States and local government. A Bill such as this gives one an opportunity to have recorded in the House the historic recognition of local government in Australia's Federal system. It particularly reflects our Government's efforts to raise the States and strengthen the capacity of local government. The legislation before the House not only will guarantee that, but is certainly a step in the direction of involvement because, in the discussions that occurred at that special conference last year, it was the first time that the Australian Local Government Association had the opportunity of being present. </PARA>
<PARA> If we wish to talk about local government being that third tier of government, and acting and doing throughout Australia what is requested by the local communities, we also have to acknowledge that it is a government that is appreciated at the community level and a government that is only too prepared to work with the State and Federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly commend the Minister at the table because she has the ability to get out and consult with local government, and that has been recorded throughout all of the local government areas to which I have been speaking. Particularly on behalf of the New South Wales area, I commend and congratulate the Minister on the initiatives that she has taken up to date, and certainly for the very vocal support that she has put forward for local government in Cabinet and with the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, I would like to bring forward a few initiatives that have been commissioned, commenced and achieved for local government since the Hawke Labor Government has been in power. In 1983, the Hawke Government established the first Federal Ministry for local government to provide a focus for Commonwealth dealings and initiatives involving local government. The local government portfolio has improved cooperation among those three tiers of government. It has assisted in strengthening local government's ability to adapt to rapidly changing economic circumstances and, most particularly, that has helped to upgrade local government in its role within the Australian federation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also continued to provide a very high level of untied general purpose grants to local government. In 1990-91, local government received some $699.3m. The Commonwealth has ensured that the allocations among councils have provided the greatest assistance to the most disadvantaged councils, with all councils eligible for a minimum grant. We have also seen assistance given to Aboriginal councils and the communities performing local government functions. The number of bodies receiving assistance has increased from two in 1985-86 to 75 in 1990-91, while funding increased for those bodies from $125,232 to $4,993,193 over that period. </PARA>
<PARA> Local government was represented at the first Special Premiers Conference in Brisbane in October 1990. We also saw that it was decided, with local government present, to untie Commonwealth funding for local roads and to provide local government with general purpose assistance grants. </PARA>
<PARA> The rating of Commonwealth business enterprises has been a catchcry continually with local government, given the many Commonwealth and State instrumentalities within its rating areas on which it has not had the ability to levy rates. If it were able to do so, it certainly would assist its ratepayers and assist the local government budgets. We have seen the Hawke Labor Government recognise the general right of local councils to tax Commonwealth business proprietors, and local government has been permitted to levy rates and charges on Telecom Australia and Australia Post properties. That commenced on 1 July 1989. It is interesting that in 1989-90 they have paid some $19m to local government under those new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> After the 1990 announcement by the Minister of the Federal arrangements, we also saw an improvement in the intergovernmental administrative arrangements. For three years, the Office of Local Government and the Australian Local Government Association have been working together to identify how to better integrate local government into Commonwealth program planning and to improve the efficiency of program administration at a local level. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to see that some 20 projects were funded by that office, and particularly in areas such as home and community care, children's services and employment and training. It is interesting to see also that in 1990, the Australian Local Government Association and the Office of Local Government consulted with over half of Australia's councils about the development of a process to enhance local government involvement in Commonwealth programs. In 1989 the Government initiated annual consultations between the Commonwealth and local government to provide an intergovernmental forum where the parties could discuss issues of mutual concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on and on, but time will not permit me to do so. But, as far as community relations and ethnic affairs are concerned, I would like it to be recognised that local government, through Commonwealth assistance, is now encouraging better relations between different groups within its local communities. I am speaking about not only the Aborigines but also our non-English speaking people. </PARA>
<PARA> Local government has been given $1.7m under the national community relations program. The goal of that program is to promote greater harmony within local communities. Since 1989, over three years, $450,000 has been provided to assist research into the development of local government services to ethnic communities. In fact, 12 new projects were funded in 1989-90 under that specific scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> National awards, introduced in 1986, have been given for innovation in local government, and that has certainly given impetus to local government to implement innovative and resourceful programs. The local government development program, which, again, was introduced under the Hawke Labor Government in 1984, has now funded some 800 projects around Australia. That program has helped local government in the national goals of micro-economic reform, social justice and certainly sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also seen $1.3m allocated to the local approvals review program over three years, with its aim to produce more cost-effective and simple approaches to land and building approvals at local government level, and to achieve associated potential savings of some $1 billion to consumers. The program has funded at the moment 10 case studies in local government and associated bodies and three complementary research projects covering topics such as referral and concurrence, fees and charges, developer contributions and dispute resolution procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> They are only a few of the wonderful, innovative programs that this Commonwealth Labor Government has implemented since it came to office in 1983. I believe that the legislation before us is again simplifying the procedure which is adopted in the transfer of the particular financial assistance grants. It also shows-which the honourable member for Wannon made a great deal about-that, instead of coming back with legislation time and time again every time there is an amendment to the particular changing of structure between Commonwealth and States that affects local government, we have a far more efficient and simpler way of doing it that is going to provide better impetus for local government and, most particularly, a simplified and swifter procedure by which those changes can be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last few years, legislation has had to be amended because adjustments were occurring to the particular health agreements. We saw also that adjustments had to occur because of the structure of particular State taxes in the last year. I do not believe that we need to have those changes coming back to the Parliament time and time again so that we can enable local government to be advantaged, and not disadvantaged, by the particular procedures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), painted a very rosy picture of what the Hawke Government has done for local government in Australia. I can assure the House that it is not a rosy picture in the electorate of Maranoa. I know that the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill certainly does give more flexibility, which I applaud. It is going to untie $296m worth of funds and it will give local government a lot more flexibility. I certainly welcome that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I would argue that local government is in need of more than just flexibility. Local government needs more money than the present level of funding which this Labor Government is providing to it. Furthermore, funding for local roads currently comes out of the Australian land transport development trust fund. This makes a direct link between fuel tax paid and road funding. Under these provisions, the future of local road funding for local government budgets will come from Consolidated Revenue. Therefore, the link we have always had between fuel tax and road funding is going to be, I believe, somehow disguised. It is very important from the motorists' point of view, so far as fuel tax is concerned, that they be able to see quite visibly where that money is being spent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill certainly rectifies the unintended consequences of a reduction in general purpose grants arising from the transfer of the debits tax base to the States and Territories in 1990-91. It provides the Treasurer with the discretion to set the general purposes assistance-I looked at the wording very carefully; it is the `discretion'-to local government and to clarify the existing situation by allowing changes without the necessity for frequent amendments to the legislation. That will avoid this Government's introduction of legislation and quite often chopping it off without debate with the guillotine. So I must welcome that provision as a positive move forward, because the Government usually allows very little time for debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides local government with a commitment that general purpose assistance to the States will be maintained in real terms for the next three years. However, it is on the condition that Australia not experience a major deterioration in its economic circumstance. Perhaps when the Minister for Local Government (Ms Fatin) sums up, she will say what determines a deterioration in Australia's economy. Is it the inflation figure?</PARA>

Is it the balance of payments figures? Is it the unemployment figures? What is the circumstance in which we would not see general purpose assistance to the States maintained in real terms? In my language, `real terms' means increasing at the rate of at least inflation, unless we have this balance of payments problem or experience a deterioration in economic circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to argue the case for Queensland. The recent report by the Commonwealth Grants Commission clearly indicated that Queensland has a case for additional funding which has been rejected by this Government. I am absolutely appalled that it was rejected by this Government, which has not acted on a report that it initiated. The report clearly came out in favour of local government funding to Queensland because under the terms of reference the Commission identified that Queensland does have very special circumstances. They are the words in the report. It says clearly that because of Queensland's special needs owing to distance, isolation and capacity to pay Queensland certainly deserves greater consideration than it is getting from this current Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I know quite a lot about local government because in my electorate of Maranoa I have 31 local authorities out of a total of 134 in Queensland. I suggest that there are many members in this House who do not have more than one local authority in their electorates. I have got 31, and I have frequent contact with them and with others in other electorates. Next week I will be attending the south-west Queensland local government conference in St George, and I know the subject of the Commonwealth Grants Commission will be discussed there. Of the 914 local authorities in Australia, 31 are in the electorate of Maranoa. There is a very real need out there in rural Australia. My electorate of Maranoa, a very real rural electorate, is in need of greater consideration from this Federal Government in many respects. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the honourable member for Prospect that there is more to Australia than just a few cities. In regard to the capacity to pay, New South Wales has almost six million people, so when it comes to taxing people in local government areas by way of their rates, it has a greater population base. New South Wales is only half the size of the State of Queensland. If we were to fold Queensland over at the border with New South Wales and let the tip of Cape York run down to the bottom of Australia, it would cross New South Wales, Victoria, Bass Strait and Tasmania; it would go 300 miles south of Hobart. That gives members of this House some idea of the size of Queensland and of the area for which local authorities have to fund roads. This was clearly identified in the Commission's report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is much easier to service a small area. In South Australia, very much a centralised State-a legacy of failed Labor Governments-the people all live around Adelaide. Down in the south they only need a couple of roads. But Queensland has population growth in centres all over the 1.7 million square kilometres of the State. As a matter of fact, Victoria fits three times into the electorate of Maranoa. That gives honourable members some idea of the size of Victoria in relation to my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> We are looking at a situation in which Queensland is vastly different from the rest of Australia. It does have special needs, and I would urge the Minister for Local Government to look again at this report, because for a long time now Queensland has been disadvantaged. I would hope that the Minister would address that problem and look again at the Grants Commission report, because it clearly suggests that this could be phased in over a number of years; it would not have to happen immediately, although it was one of the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Minister to look again at the special needs of Queensland. If she does, it will help Queensland very much, and it will help right across Australia to maintain a rural infrastructure at a time when, under this Government's economic policies, we are seeing a continuing and accelerating drift from rural Australia to the cities. We will see already overcrowded cities become even more crowded because people are unable to stay in rural Australia. One thing that does keep people in rural Australia, in addition to jobs, is their ability to travel on reasonable roads to get to their major cities at least once a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Extra funding in my electorate could establish an alternative road to the coastal highway from Brisbane to Cairns. In the recent central Queensland floods many of those major cities along the coast on the Bruce Highway were isolated. The rains were torrential. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) has, I am sure, told Government members what happened there. They were disastrous floods, and for days and days those communities were isolated. People could not travel north or south because the Bruce Highway was cut by floods. </PARA>
<PARA> If 67 kilometres of road were sealed between Emerald and Roma in Queensland, there would effectively be a sealed road from Cairns right down to Brisbane. It would be an alternative route to the Bruce Highway. Many people who were caught in Townsville and Cairns in the central Queensland floods had to go as far inland as Longreach, almost out to Mount Isa, coming back along the national highway in order to return to Brisbane, because the floods coincided with the resumption of the school year. </PARA>
<PARA> Time is short, and I know that there are many other members who would like to speak on this Bill. However, I would ask the Minister to look at the proposal of the Carnarvon development road, where 67 kilometres remain unsealed. At this point, the local authorities have been left with the burden of funding that road, which would create an alternative route to the Bruce Highway. In New South Wales there are alternative routes between Sydney and Brisbane-the Pacific Highway and the New England Highway. We also have an alternative route between Sydney and Melbourne. Therefore, I believe there is good reason for the Minister to look at the grants that go to Queensland. In particular, I ask her to look at the Carnarvon development road, because it would open up tourism in Queensland; it would create a sealed link between Cairns, where there is an international airport, and Brisbane; and it would also give added benefit to people bringing primary produce from the inland to the coast. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst supporting parts of the Bill, I would certainly ask that the Minister look at what I have said. I would hope also that she would answer a couple of my points in her reply. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking in support of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill, at the outset I would have to make the comment that the continuing ability of the Opposition, on the one hand, to argue that there should be greater fiscal restraint and, on the other, to continue to advocate across a whole range of fields additional public expenditure has to be one of those imponderables, and we will probably have to wait until the next election, or well after, to see how those two things actually gel together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In particular, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) called for, essentially, the adoption of the Commonwealth Grants Commission report on local government general purpose assistance grants. He suggested that it was, in fact, an initiative of this Government to have that report presented. Of course, the report arose out of the 1989 Premiers Conference. It was an initiative, as I recall, of the Premier from South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has given consideration to that report and has determined that the arrangements that are outlined in these measures are more appropriate. Indeed, the Grants Commission itself, in preparing that report, did not recommend that the fiscal equalisation formula which the honourable member opposite has just advocated should be adopted in the 1991-92 financial year. The Commission recognised that the difficulties of making fiscal equalisation work needed an enormous amount of research and a lot more analysis than just saying that the councils in the electorate of Maranoa needed particular assistance. There was recognition that one had to get a proper research database before one could actually establish a fair, sensible and rational basis for financial equalisation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no other way to do it than to go through that process. It is interesting as well to note that representatives of the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils (WESROC) came down to Canberra about a month ago. They met both Government members and the Opposition, including the shadow Minister for local government. I presume that the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), could well have been in on that meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suspect he was. It is interesting to note that the honourable member for Dundas and others in the delegation said that they did not support the recommendations of the Grants Commission. The situation is that the honourable member for Maranoa this evening is saying that it should have been adopted by the Government as holy writ, and only a month ago members of the Opposition from the Sydney area were saying that they would not endorse such a proposition under any circumstances. They made it very clear that the per capita funding arrangements should continue-and so they should, because, frankly, the needs of local government are such that we just cannot automatically impose a system because a Premier says that it would be a nice idea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We need to actually assess what sort of capacity local government has to meet the services it provides and, fundamentally, we have to recognise the capacity of ratepayers and of the constituency to actually pay for the sorts of services that people would be asked to go without. Such things as the rapid population growth of areas like western Sydney would have to be properly analysed as part of any formula for the funding of local government. That is not an easy exercise to actually undertake but, if we were going to go down the path of a fiscal equalisation formula for local government funding, frankly we would have to do that exercise to get arrangements which were fair and equitable and which guaranteed the certainty of local government services being provided not only to remote communities but also to communities which are planned and which will develop over the next few years. The great difficulty, of course, has been to ensure that the dynamics of funding local government are always there. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Bill before the House tonight is a very positive contribution to the enhancement of local government. As one who has had a long involvement in local government, I would have to say that some of these measures are the sorts of things that have been advocated by both sides of the House and by advocates of local government for decades. That is the fundamental reality. All too often we have heard from local government and conservatives generally the chant that local government wants to be treated on an equal footing with the other tiers of government. Unfortunately, the history of local government recognition by the other side of the chamber is a very disappointing one indeed: each time there has been an attempt to consider such things as giving constitutional recognition to local government, we have found people on the other side of the chamber being strong advocates against adoption of those proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Bill before us tonight, we have the chance to ensure that the financial certainty that applies to Federal-State financial relations is passed on to local government financial sharing grants as well, and that is being done in the form of guaranteeing the same real terms funding commitment that applies to the States. That is an important step on the part of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Maranoa has attempted to qualify the significance of that by saying that that applies only if there is not a significant change in economic circumstances. We have just had the Premiers Conference relating to next year's financial year grants and, despite the economic difficulties, the Commonwealth has maintained its commitment to both the States and to local government to ensure that that real terms funding guarantee is provided. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Minister two or three weeks ago provided the advice of the Cabinet decision in that regard, I contacted WESROC, the organisation of local government in Western Sydney, which expressed great satisfaction, great pleasure. In fact, the councils claimed it as a victory for local government. I think it was a victory for the good sense of the Minister and the Government that the decision was reached. But the councils claimed it as a victory for local government that the new funding arrangements had been worked out-and they are entitled to make that claim if they wish. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have guaranteed through that formula is that local government knows its funding arrangements are secured not only for this financial year but in terms of the three-year commitment that has been given. We also know, because of this historic reform in the area of road funding, that there is now the capacity for local government to have the flexibility to determine best-as I believe it usually is best able to determine-how those funds should be developed and distributed. At the same time, local government's funding formula relating to roads has the same real terms commitment that is applied to the other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Much was made by the honourable member for Maranoa and the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) earlier in the debate about the assertion that what was being done did not give any guarantees about the level of road funding. They only have to read the second reading speech to see that that commitment is there, and all the statements that have been made by the Federal Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) confirm the Government's bona fides in that regard. As well as that, of course, when we discuss local government and the Commonwealth's commitment to local government, there are many other areas which are very important. </PARA>
<PARA> In some of those areas, local government has a key role, not only now but in the future, to ensure that the sort of infrastructure that communities need will be properly provided. Of course, in a number of those services-such as child-care, housing, reformation in the social justice area, and the home and community care program-local government has a crucial role, and much of the Commonwealth's assistance that is directed to local government through those specific purpose areas is on top of the general purpose assistance that is provided. So it really has been a chapter, as the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) said earlier in the debate, in which local government's whole sphere of influence has extended significantly during the life of the Hawke Government. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6T4">Mr ELLIOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Maranoa should not worry; it will be here a lot longer after he has gone. The question remains that we have the capacity, as we have demonstrated, to ensure that local government is an activist in community support infrastructure. We have the capacity to ensure that, as the real reforms particularly in the area of housing and as some sort of public infrastructure investment are undertaken, local government can and should play a very significant part in that major development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The best means of assuring that is to ensure that we do have this equal partnership arrangement between the various tiers of government. This legislation before us tonight is an important step as part of that process, as I have said. Clearly, if we look at questions of housing and the need for housing, which applies both in major urban centres such as I represent or in the remote parts of Australia, local government is well placed to play a more significant role in that particular sphere than it has up to date. So I trust that the measures the Government is looking at in that regard will get local government's strong endorsement and encouragement. </PARA>
<PARA> I also feel sure that the provisions contained in this Bill relating to more flexibility and decision-making devolution for local government and a real funding commitment which equates to that provided to the States are matters that local government will treat as a very significant move by this Government. As important as anything else, it will be seen as a real demonstration of the worth of the changes as a result of the Special Premiers Conference in the area of Federal-State relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said about the need for micro-economic reform and so forth. There is not one area of reform that needs more attention or offers as much scope than the area of inter-governmental relations, and it is pleasing to see that this particular Bill is part of ensuring that that process is undertaken. I strongly support the Bill before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not oppose the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill, but I think it is a continuation of the confusion and conflict that has been a regular feature of local government funding for many years. Ideally, all levels of government should be moving towards fiscal independence. That is the only way a democratic and an economically accountable system can operate. In other words, it should be raising revenue for the services it provides from its local areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Grants to local government, from any source, cut across that principle of fiscal independence and encourage irresponsibility and a lack of accountability. It is a significant fact that, in many councils which have received major grants throughout Australia, there is a correlation almost between the number of Taj Mahals and the luxury of the administrative offices. I think there is a prima facie case against any system of grants to local government. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, there are so many difficulties and so many variations in the whole local government structure, given its historical basis, that it is obviously impossible in the foreseeable future to take a purist line and to advocate a local government totally self-funding at an independent level. But I think that should be the long term goal for local government and over the next few years, when we see a very close examination of the restructuring of Commonwealth-State relations, this should be the goal for local government. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems is that no-one has really ever defined what local government is supposed to do. We all know that over the past couple of decades its services have grown like topsy. That has come about through a mixture of community pressures, empire building and State-Federal initiatives-there has really been no direction to it-but we do know that local government has expanded dramatically, and we cannot really establish any sensible method of funding until we know where it is all going. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the principle of delivering public services at the lowest possible level is certainly a good principle, and we have got to pursue it, but we have enormous problems at local government with overservicing and wide variations in standards of different councils. One of the worst defects, of course, is the bureaucracy of local government: their salaries are tied basically to expenditure. Until we can address those sorts of problems, the thought of massive untied grants is pretty frightening. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis that local government does need funds over and above its capacity to raise local funds, the next question is: should funding come from the States or should it come from the Commonwealth? The more one looks at it, the more there is a very good case for the Commonwealth to get out of direct funding and include all local government funding in States' grants. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not preaching States' rights; I think that is a separate question. States will exist for the foreseeable future, whether they are good or bad, but no amount of fiddling with the funding of local government will really have any bearing on the question of States' rights. After all, the only public test of this question of where funding should come from was the 1974 referendum to give the Commonwealth constitutional power to make grants direct to local government-and of course that was comprehensively defeated. </PARA>
<PARA> As things stand, the funding to local government is incredibly complex and opaque and is a confusion of the State and Commonwealth, compounded with the complexity of fiscal equalisation and a whole range of other various needs based formulas. Certainly, to me, it was a merciful relief that even the Commonwealth Grants Commission had to give up, to some extent, the push for fiscal equalisation this year when it looked at the bizarre results that it produced. I think the whole question of fiscal equalisation is a subject on which we have to spend a lot more time over the next few years. At the moment it is very much an academically based exercise which, if pursued, can only produce quite ridiculous results. At present, a substantial saving in administrative expenses, which would certainly be a bonus in clarity at both State and Federal levels, would be achieved if all local government grants from the Commonwealth were included in general purpose grants for the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I have certainly got nothing personal against the Minister for Local Government (Ms Fatin), who I think has done a very good job, but I really think we could abolish the office of Minister for Local Government and the associated bureaucracy. I think there would be many more public advantages to such a step than there would be disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA> So I support the Bill to the extent that it is a very small move towards getting the Commonwealth out of direct funding of local government, but I think the suggestions in the second reading speech of the Minister that the Bill will strengthen the capacity of local government and raise the status of local government are fairly exaggerated. The retention of the arrangement under the Australian Land Transport Development Act of maintaining what could only be called a slush fund of $24m has very little merit, other than facilitating a little pork-barrelling at election time. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as the honourable member for Wannon is still in the chamber, I was a little disappointed to see the Opposition spokesman trot out some of the platitudes of the motoring organisations and the road transport lobby for more road funding and to use the Bill for that purpose. The problem of roads in Australia can never be solved until we get some basis for relating cost to usage. While we do not have that nexus, we will always have unlimited demand which cannot be funded without dramatically reducing many other services. We have to move as fast as we can over the next few years towards full cost recovery. At the moment, any sensible person knows that the road transport industry is riding on the back of the private motorist and that the private motorist, far from being soaked, as is the usual line of the motoring organisations, is being heavily subsidised. </PARA>
<PARA> An examination of all the material we now have shows that fuel costs should be over $2 a litre if full road cost recovery was really wanted. A result of all these distortions is that we have a community with unreal expectations, a complete distortion of land use-both rural and urban-throughout the country, a complete distortion of our transport systems, and a misallocation of funds between national State highways and local roads. Our only hope is to move steadily towards full cost recovery to get things on a proper basis. </PARA>

<PARA>Customs tariff proposal No. 5 of 1991 relates to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. The main purpose of the proposal, which is operative on and from 1 July 1991, is to implement measures to facilitate Australia's partial accession to the 1950 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation agreement on the importation of educational, scientific and cultural material. This agreement is more commonly known as the Florence agreement. The changes introduce a free rate of duty for goods of an educational, scientific or cultural nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal also contains two minor alterations to the notes to chapter 43 to align them with the international harmonised system administered by the Customs Cooperation Council in Brussels. Australia is a signatory to the convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Further alterations made in this proposal are to restore the Canadian preference duty rates which were inadvertently omitted from changes made in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991 for cucumbers, gherkins and onions of heading 2001. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again we have last minute legislation for the wool industry, a repeat of last year, with major legislation for this great Australian industry coming in in the dying hours of Parliament when the proposals have to be in place by 1 July. The Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill, the Australian Wool Corporation Bill, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill, the Primary Industries (Industry Councils) Bill and the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills were introduced at 1 a.m. last Friday morning. There has been no time for anybody, including those in the industry, to study fully all the detail and the implications. We now have a guillotine for three hours for the main debate, and we have achieved that extra time for the guillotine only by agreeing to reduce the time to debate the Fisheries Administration Bill and related Bills tomorrow morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a most unsatisfactory situation for this most important rural industry in Australia, the wool industry. It comes at a time of great difficulty for people engaged in the industry. All farmers are facing the worst situation since the Depression of the 1930s, and for woolgrowers the worst is still to come. The real impact of lower incomes will occur over the next 12 months and if the drought continues over much of Australia it will be even worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Just to give some indication of projections concerning woolgrowers' income, I want to cite some figures from the Agriculture and Resources Quarterly of March. Those figures are already out of date. When one looks at farm cash operating surplus for the sheep industry, in 1989-90 there was a cash operating surplus of $50,407 per sheep farmer; in 1990-91-that is, this year just ending-it was down to $5,724, a reduction of 89 per cent; and for next year, 1991-92, the projection is that it will be a negative figure of minus $626, a further fall by 111 per cent. That is a frightening figure. </PARA>
<PARA> Table 5.1 of the report of the Vines Committee of Inquiry into the Wool Industry and the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council concerning wool farmers' income shows distribution of farm cash operating surplus for specialist sheep producers in 1991-92; the figure here is based on 400c kilogram clean net of tax, which means a figure of about 460c gross average price for wool. At that level 25 per cent of all specialist sheep farmers will earn a negative figure of at least minus $13,920, and 50 per cent of farmers will have a figure of minus $620. </PARA>
<PARA> That gives the impact of what is still to come for the woolgrowers of Australia. If this drought continues, there will obviously be a great cost to woolgrowers. Many will face the terrible dilemma as to whether it will pay to feed sheep, and there will be reduced production as well. </PARA>
<PARA> This very grave financial situation confronting our woolgrowers emphasises the crucial part of all of the Bills before us tonight, that is, the tax level or the levy and the impact that a higher than necessary levy rate can have on thousands of woolgrowers. It can force them off the land by fire sales of their properties. After that, there will be fewer growers to pay out the stockpile debt for the remaining years, with even more pressure on those still remaining. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the wool debate and the wool crisis of the last 12 months or so, I believe the coalition has maintained a consistent and positive policy. At all times we have emphasised the importance of having a supply-demand balance to get the price up. That was initially in relation to a flock reduction scheme, which was the only positive proposal by anybody in the industry to save the floor price. That proposal was put up about nine months ago-to bring supply back so that the pressure would come off that mounting stockpile. We supported the floor price until such time as the Government terminated that scheme. We have more recently used the proposal for a flock reduction scheme as a method to be able to reduce the levy applying to growers in the marketing situation since the termination of the floor price. </PARA>
<PARA> At all times we have opposed quotas, because they do not work. We initiated a proposal for wool credit sales to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and both the National Party and Liberal Party had delegations of parliamentarians to China for the purpose, among other things, of discussing and encouraging the purchase of Australian wool by that country. Once the floor price was terminated, we recognised that it was more beneficial for putting security or stability back in the industry not to talk about attempting to reinstate such a scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially and at various stages of the debate, many people in the wool industry did not accept or agree with what we were proposing. Some did. I believe the great majority of woolgrowers in Australia now accept that what we were proposing at various stages was a sensible and positive response to the problems and that they were the correct responses by ourselves as the coalition parties. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to the Vines Committee recommendations, which were presented at the end of March. I believe the Vines Committee made a series of comprehensive and valuable recommendations. Basically that report set the parameters for the debate that has taken place since. Those recommendations are valuable, even if not all of them have been accepted either by the coalition parties or, for that matter, the Government. For example, with the question of the management of the stockpile, Vines emphasised that we need to have predictability and accountability. But people have differed in their views as to the best way to achieve that management. </PARA>
<PARA> The two parameters of the Vines Committee have held up very well. The first is that 12 per cent is the maximum levy or tax which woolgrowers can afford. The Vines Committee documented that, as have plenty of other people. Secondly, that 900 million kilograms is a safe and reasonable basis of sales of Australian wool each year. With a lower price that figure may be able to be increased, but I believe it is too soon for us to say whether that is the case or not. I believe that 900 million kilograms is still there as a benchmark. </PARA>
<PARA> The market has moved since the Vines Committee recommendations went to press, but those particular points are still very valid. When the Vines recommendations were released we did not wait for the Government to announce its decision. We accepted the challenge to produce a levy figure which was lower than 12 per cent, and which was sustainable and credible. Obviously any figure lower than 12 per cent must be to the value of the viability of thousands of Australian woolgrowers. We were able to do so because, once again, we factored in the flock reduction scheme so that wool would be removed from the market. Reducing supply below that 900 million kilogram figure would allow wool to be sold from the stockpile and then be utilised to either reduce the principal debt or reduce the debt servicing cost. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also a need to have a sensible level of asset sales of the non-wool assets of the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC). Through that debate, and since, the general accuracy of the figures we produced has been challenged, but it has not been proven to be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially individual members of the Australian Wool Council were critical of our putting forward this positive proposal because they were hoping that the Government would accept the Vines recommendation of no more than 12 per cent. Of course, the Government did not. The Government went for 15 per cent. So the Wool Council now accepts the sense of a flock reduction scheme, at least as an option. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members should remember that there was a successful flock reduction scheme which removed 11 million sheep. If it had been continued until the present, there is no doubt that the future of woolgrowers would have been far more assured for next year than is now the case. The Wool Council also accepts the priority of asset sales in relation to keeping that levy down. This evening a statement from the Wool Council has been released supporting our proposal which we released earlier today. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Vines Committee and the release of our figures, the market has continued to improve. The supplementary payments and the necessary borrowings are well down; interest rates are falling; and supply is 130,000 bales short of what was predicted for this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Just last week the projections for production next year were reduced to 881 million kilograms and it is generally believed that they will fall to at least 850 million kilograms with the next projection period, partly because of the flock reduction, the drought and because it is just not economic to keep certain types of sheep. </PARA>
<PARA> In that time the price has increased from 435c a kilogram to 450c a kilogram, and now to 580c a kilogram. The projections we have-I think most people are using these projections now-are around the 450c a kilogram figure. The projections for the average price for next year will certainly be in excess of 450c and, when they are announced, could be around 475c. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my understanding that the Wool Corporation initially recommended that a 12 to 13 per cent levy would be adequate. That was before these better figures became available. The Government, through the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), stuck to 15 per cent. Presumably it was the best he could get through the Cabinet because the alternative assumption of sticking to 15 per cent would mean that he wanted to inflict unnecessary pain on thousands of Australian woolgrowers. No alternative assumption could be made. No matter how it is rationalised now, that is the realistic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I sought, and received, the approval of the previous Minister at the table to incorporate some figures in Hansard indicating the justification for the amendment which I will be moving towards the conclusion of my speech to the effect that a 10 per cent maximum is all that is necessary. I will be moving amendments to that effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that ACIL Australia Pty Ltd, a consulting firm, has indicated that it was possible to pay off all the debts of the Wool Corporation, the wool stockpile, et cetera, on an 8 per cent figure over a period of years. With the Australian Wool Realisation Commission about to come into play, it should be able to do even better because it should be able to manage the finances and the management of the stockpile to a better degree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The significant point for woolgrowers is around asset sales. That is the whole crux of 10 per cent versus 15 per cent. It is a question of what level of asset sales are reasonable from the Wool Corporation and where receipts from those asset sales should be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> It would not surprise me at all if the Government, in attempting to support its unsustainable and unnecessarily cruel figure of 15 per cent, claims that it can sell only $40m of the $280m to $300m of the assets of the Wool Corporation in the next financial year. We have had repeated indications that $120m is quite a reasonable figure in the first year and in the second year. If the Government wants to maintain that sort of situation, on the basis on which it is operating it should be honest and say how many years it will take for the whole debt to be removed. Will it be four years or five years? It will certainly be far shorter than the seven years which the Government originally proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is, once again, showing its lack of sympathy and lack of understanding for the problems facing woolgrowers. What does it matter if it takes one year or two years more to pay the whole debt off if it maintains the viability of Australia's woolgrowers. If we do have a maximum of 10 per cent, I believe that will also put sensible pressure on the Wool Corporation and the Wool Realisation Commission to perform. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, in his second reading speech tried to indicate that there was no significant difference with figures below a 15 per cent tax level. I assure the House that that is not the case. For example, the difference between a 10 per cent levy and a 15 per cent levy for a woolgrower, say, with 5,000 sheep at 450c a kilogram clean is close to $3,500; for 10,000 sheep it is obviously double that, about $7,000. The Minister is not speaking about hundreds but thousands of dollars. If that does not sound a big amount of money, remember that the average woolgrower this coming year will have a negative income. Several thousands of dollars becomes a very significant figure in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> If we compare the choice of Wool Corporation asset sales to farmers asset sales-that is, the selling up of individual woolgrowers-we find that anyone with any sympathy or understanding for rural Australia, for the future of the wool industry or for the ultimate cost to the taxpayer, because of what it could mean in welfare payments, must come down on the side of asset sales from the Wool Corporation rather than asset sales of farmers' individual properties. That is what the choice is in stark form. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that we should not go ahead with any significant amount of non-wool assets of the AWC because it is not the best time to have sales in Melbourne. I have been told that close to 70 per cent of those non-wool assets-those stores and warehouses of the Wool Corporation-are not holding any wool at all. They are certainly serving a reasonable commercial purpose and some are returning quite a good price of 13 per cent to 14 per cent. If they are, that would be a good time to sell them, because that is a reasonable return for the buyer. But if they are not, the loss to the wool industry from selling $120m worth of assets at the present time, as against what could be obtained on a maximum market, is minor compared with the far greater capital loss for thousands of Australian farmers who would be sold up because of that significant difference between a 10 per cent and 15 per cent levy. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone's calculations, whether they are ours or those of the Government-and I would be very interested to see the Government's projections when it produces them-are really about guesstimates of the price and production over the next few years and about the number of years it is thought essential for the whole thing to be wound up. I make this plea to the Government: for the sake of the woolgrowers of Australia, the future of the industry, look again at the 15 per cent and look again at how many years that will be paid out, and make a decision for the sake of those growers. </PARA>
<PARA> With that in mind, I move a second reading amendment as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>`whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House-</PARA>
<PARA>(a) regrets the Government's unnecessary decision to create a Wool Realisation Commission separate from the Australian Wool Corporation;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) regrets the Government's failure to provide some certainty in the wool market by not implementing an orderly schedule, with appropriate legislative authority, for releasing specified quantities of wool from the Australian Wool Corporation's stockpile; and</PARA>
<PARA>(c) calls on the Government to support a properly managed industry funded flock reduction scheme to be introduced if and when the industry agrees such a scheme is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>At a later stage-if time permits with the operation of the guillotine-in the debate in committee on the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills I will be moving for a reduction from 15 per cent to 10 per cent, and at the second reading stage on the Australian Wool Corporation Bill I will be moving another second reading amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment that I have just moved reaffirms our policy of a predictable and accountable release from the stockpile on a predetermined volume basis, which we believe is the best method. We believe that it was unnecessary to create another body, by separating the AWC from the wool realisation aspects, if you like, of determining the stockpile-with no need for a separate Wool Realisation Commission-reaffirming the sense of at least having a flock reduction scheme in the legislation as an option for woolgrowers in the future, at their own cost. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other aspects to this Bill, and more amendments will be moved in the Senate as we pursue this very important piece of legislation. If I have time, I will be indicating in another second reading debate, on the Australian Wool Corporation Bill, the importance of having an Industry Commission inquiry into the level and method of wool promotion to ensure that Australian woolgrowers are receiving maximum benefit for the very large amounts of money, particularly at this difficult time, that they are putting into wool promotion. </PARA>

There is the question as to whether or not carpet wool should be included in the debt repayment levy arrangements. There is the question of the industry council, of the conduct of the general meeting, and who will receive the final profit. I have no doubt that there will be a final profit from the settlement of the stockpile, and it has to be made far clearer that it will be the growers of Australia and not Consolidated Revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The five cognate Bills under discussion this evening are the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill 1991, the Australian Wool Corporation Bill 1991, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill 1991, the Primary Industries (Industry Councils) Bill 1991, and the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1991. At the outset I pay tribute and give credit to the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, now the Treasurer, Mr John Kerin, for the work and dedication that he has put into the portfolio and these Bills over our four terms of government. There is no doubt that John Kerin has held the respect of honourable members on both sides of this House and certainly people in the bush during times that have been very tough and will be very tough for the next couple of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also welcome the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Simon Crean, who will do an outstanding job. The way in which the new Minister was able to bring about commonsense in the industrial relations field, to work through healing processes and to see a reduction of 10 per cent in non-farm unit labour costs demonstrates that, with his capacity for working for the country and for the bush, he will fulfil adequately the role that John Kerin has left. </PARA>
<PARA> The aim of this package of Bills is to establish a new institutional structure and marketing arrangements in the wool industry in the absence of the reserve price scheme. Three new bodies-the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, the new Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Research and Development Corporation-will replace the present Australian Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Realisation Commission has a life expectancy of a maximum of approximately seven years. It will play a pivotal role in the resolution of the present problems facing the wool industry. It has the role of disposing of the stockpiles and non-wool assets, and repayment of the wool debt. The establishment of the new Australian Wool Corporation to promote the wool industry will facilitate the marketing of wool and will develop and implement programs to safeguard the quality of Australian wool. There is no doubt that Australian wool is the best quality in the world and, with that going for us, we will get back on track. </PARA>
<PARA> The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill 1991 makes a number of changes to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1990 that provide for the establishment by regulation of the new Australian Wool Research and Development Corporation. It will be responsible for the strategic planning and funding of research and development projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Primary Industries (Industry Councils) Bill 1991 provides for primary industries councils to be established by regulation. The Australian Wool Industry Council will be responsible for the coordination of the overall strategic directions for the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In a study commissioned by the Wool Council of Australia in May this year, it was concluded that the Government's analysis, based on information then available, does imply a 15 per cent wool tax. It was stated that the 15 per cent wool tax remains necessary for 1991-92 if the Government's minimum debt repayment is to be met. </PARA>
<PARA> The comprehensive plan for recovery of the wool industry allows it to retain responsibility for its own destiny while receiving the continued support of the Australian Government. These measures responsibly address the biggest challenge our wool industry has faced in modern times. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry is facing a major adjustment to market prices and, at the same time, is saddled with an enormous debt and a huge stockpile of wool. We need to build a strong future for wool. The seven-year debt repayment will mean that there will be no fire sale from the stockpile. Seven years is a maximum and it may well be that the market circumstances will enable the debt to be paid off earlier. Current price levels make wool very competitive against other fibres. This will enable Australian wools to regain the market share that we have lost to our competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know of the immense pressure that woolgrowers are facing. The rate of the wool tax has been a major concern to growers. There has been an enormous range of views but a balance has had to be found between the national interest objectives of debt management and the health of the industry on the one hand and the management of the debt and stockpile and consequent financial burden on growers on the other. The decision on wool tax reflects the Government's decision that responsibility for the debt will remain with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In determining the most appropriate tax rate for the industry, the Government had to weigh two competing objectives-first, the need to ensure the continued viability of the Australian wool industry and, secondly, the need to protect the Commonwealth's-and by that, I mean the taxpayers'-contingent liability for the Australian Wool Corporation debt. In recognition of the position that woolgrowers face in the first year, the Government is underwriting asset sales with a $200m interest free loan and has required the debt to be reduced by some $20m in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel it is important for all parties involved in our great Australian wool industry-that is, government, growers and the industry itself-to continue to work together. If we do that, we will come through these tough times. I believe that there is a better understanding, not only in the bush but on both sides of this House, that we need to have co-operation and common sense if we are to overcome these difficulties. This is the case not just in wool but, of course, in the grains industry and now, sadly, in the sugar industry. Since this time last year, sugar prices have dropped by some 50 per cent as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Several other propositions have been put forward in regard to solving the problem. The honourable member for Murray mentioned one-a quota scheme-which both he and I oppose. Such a scheme would not work and it would impact unfairly on the finer wool producers who do not have the same sorts of difficulties. I have never believed that quota schemes work in such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the difficulties is flock reduction. This is an understandably hard area because reducing stock involves putting down or destroying animals. The situation is quite different in the case of the sugar industry because making reductions means ploughing out 50 acres of cane. Nevertheless, the effect, in the circumstances, is just the same. </PARA>
<PARA> I oppose the amendment. But because of the short time that has been allowed for this debate and the number of speakers on this legislation-I note that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who has a very strong interest in the wool industry, who represents almost all of Western Australia, and whose electorate is larger than most European countries and has a massive number of sheep, is to speak-I will conclude my remarks to allow the honourable member and members on the other side of the House to contribute to these very important Bills which are being discussed at a very serious and important time in the history of the wool industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) said, this is a really traumatic time for the wool industry. I think it is worth noting that the last time we got ourselves into this sort of hiatus was in 1969-71 and it took four or five years for that situation to right itself. I do not anticipate that the position in which we find ourselves today will take any less time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose I should welcome the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to the table. I should make the observation that many members of this House probably have forgotten more about the industry than the Minister will know for some time in the future. But let us hope that that remedies itself fairly quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Murray pointed out that it is not an easy matter to differentiate between the 15 per cent levy and, say, a 12 or 10 per cent levy. He explained that for a modest number of sheep these days-that is, 5,000, which I would suggest is for many people at the bottom end for a living area-the difference will be of the order of $3,500 per annum. Of course, the difference will be greater for farmers who have more sheep. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also explained that under our proposals asset sales are preferable to putting woolgrowers into greater debt and I will come back to that a little later. The honourable member emphasised the point that 60 or 70 per cent of the assets of the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC)-that is, the wool stores that it owns-have no wool in them at all. They are full of motor cars and other things. This may be a perfectly profitable way of carrying on business but these activities are not necessary to the operations of the Corporation. This is why we believe that as long as the Corporation can get us a good sale price, there should be no compunction about selling to it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that in all of this discussion, the matter of who bears the debt is vital. At the outset I should point out that today the AWC can borrow its funds at a touch over 11 per cent. The Corporation anticipates that next year it will be able to borrow its funds at just under 11 per cent. The figures that the honourable member for Murray has asked to be incorporated have been arrived at on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, growers whose debt in agriculture has risen from about $7 billion in 1985 to nigh on $12 billion today, will be paying 14, 15, 16 or, with penalties, up to 19 and 20 per cent, depending on their circumstances. It seems to me that, if we have the opportunity to do so, the growers should take advantage of the price at which the Corporation can borrow funds, the interest rate that it can borrow at, because, after all, the Corporation has a government guarantee. It is reasonable and, in fact, absolutely necessary, to try our hardest to mitigate the burden on those growers. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hinkler said that the Government's minimum repayment schedule has to be met and that 15 per cent will be needed. We disagree. Seven years are not needed if we are to levy people 15 per cent; I suggest that we would not even need a levy of 15 per cent if we were to try to get rid of this debt over five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Just before going into those details, I would like to make a point or two about the ability of the Australian Wool Corporation to borrow, if you like, on behalf of the industry. I would like to say something about the effect of that statutory corporation borrowing $2.88 billion at the peak on behalf of woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA> The AWC, having accumulated in the market support fund about $1.7 billion of growers' funds, found that it could not buy wool without going into debt. So off it went to the banks and borrowed, as I said, $2.8 billion. That, of course, was the cream on the top of growers' wool cheques. It was an amount of money that they were to get that was borrowed on their behalf over and above the bid price on the day. So we could say that that was the top part of their income-it was the cream, if you like, of growers' wool cheques. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is reasonable to assume that a large amount of tax-that is personal income tax or corporate tax in the case of farming corporations-was paid on the $2.8 billion that was borrowed on behalf of these growers. Some people say that it is as high as $1 billion-but let us be conservative and say that it was $800m. So, $2 billion of the $2.8 billion that was borrowed on their behalf, fell into the hands of the growers and $800m or so went off to the tax collector and resides in the hands of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> That does not take into account the fact that in 1984 the Government got rid of the income equalisation deposits (IED) scheme, a scheme which most people now believe should be brought back and which, in these very high peak years, would have allowed growers to put aside a little bit of hay for the hard times. In fact, that is what it was designed for. Perhaps there could have been even further moneys residing, albeit temporarily, in the hands of the Government if that IED scheme had been brought back before 30 June last year instead of on 1 July, which, I have to say, seemed to us to be done to avoid the Government having to lose taxation revenue in the 1989-90 year. </PARA>
<PARA> If at the end of the wind-up of this whole stockpile, when we have finally sold it all off, it turns out that there is a deficit to the guarantor-that is, the Government-it seems to me that the Government will have a little bit of wherewithal with which to pay it. After all, the Government is saying that the growers should meet the whole of the debt-the whole $2.8 billion, $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion, or whatever it will be on 30 June. It looks as though it will be about $2.6 billion. Are we saying that the Government can keep the moneys that it has received out of the tax, with the exception of the $300m and perhaps the $44m that it will put in on interest on the $200m that it is kicking into the till, and that the growers should pay all the rest? I am not sure that that is exactly a reasonable proposition. That is something that the Government will have to take into account, and should take into account. </PARA>
<PARA> History shows that we on this side of the House have taken a bipartisan view in the debate on these wool problems, as much as is possible, since it was obvious that the industry was in big trouble and, as I said earlier, since we managed to dissipate the $1.7 billion of growers' funds that were in the market support fund. As I have said before in this House, in 1987 the Government designed the legislation which allowed the reserve price to be put so high that we dissipated that $1.7 billion and then got rid of another $2.8 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government had a member on the board of the Corporation who, my information says, was probably in favour of 900c. Even if that were not true, he certainly voted for 870c. The responsibility therefore-as many people have said and we have said many times-is a dual responsibility which comes down both on the growers and on the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> For nigh on nine months now we have been saying that there is a way to help mitigate this obligation-that is, by the introduction of a flock reduction scheme. I will not spend too much time on it but finally, one way or another, we did coerce the Corporation into introducing it. It set out to remove an extra 20 million sheep, over and above the normal kill, in 12 months. It successfully got rid of 11 million in 2 1/2 months and then, sadly, the scheme came to a halt. I cannot understand why that was the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, now the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), said in this House that he was very happy to spend $100m on that scheme. In fact, he told some of us privately that, if that was spent, he was happy to go on. The scheme was apparently a great success. It managed to take out some of next year's wool supply-probably 40 to 50 million kilograms of it-at a price of 80c a kilogram, which, had it gone on, would have enabled us to sell even more wool out of the stockpile next year. We will be able to sell some, no doubt, but there were those who did not have the stomach for the scheme, those who could not do the sums, or those who simply did not know enough about the wool industry to understand that, if those sheep had come out fast, then the price would have improved earlier and some value would have been put into people's sale sheep, into their 1 1/2 and 5 1/2-year-old sheep. Unfortunately, for all the wrong reasons, that scheme came to a halt and we are in a position today, as has been proven by the Wool Corporation's consultants, in which we will be forced to pay a higher levy than would otherwise have been the case. </PARA>
<PARA> So far we have no figures from the Government to show how it reached a figure of 15 per cent. I understand that the Government had in mind the figure of 15 per cent a few weeks ago and then it was reduced to 12 per cent, as announced in a press release that the former Minister put out at the time-or was it in a letter that he wrote to all the woolgrowers? Since then we have had no figures at all to show how the Government reached that decision. If it is going to come up with that sort of figure, then it really ought to be throwing some figures around to justify it. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Murray has put some figures on the table. He has shown that we can get nearly a 4 per cent decrease in the levy in the first year. After all, these next two years will be the years that make or break the woolgrowers. He has shown that, by varying the amount of assets sales, for every $20m-odd of assets sales we can reduce the levy by one per cent in the first year, and we can do it again in the second year. In fact, it is quite a reasonable assumption that we will sell $120m worth of assets not only in the first year but also in the second year. </PARA>
<PARA> By that time, the stockpile will be starting to reduce. We already know that the annual production of sheep is starting to reduce. In two years' time we will be well down in the number of kilograms coming up for sale. I would suggest that we will have a lessening of the amount of wool left in the stockpile, we will have a low annual production, and people will start to wonder where the wool is coming from, so the price will start to rise. Every one of these sums ought to be based on the fact that the price will rise, because it most surely will. It already came up to nearly 600c because of a temporary shortage at the end of this selling season. Everybody knows that there will be plenty of wool on the market at the beginning of the next selling season when it opens in July-August. We can reduce the burden on growers quite radically by changing the amount of assets sales in the first year. </PARA>
<PARA> In our proposal we have done nothing to reduce the promotion and research and development more than would seem sensible in these circumstances. We have come up with levy figures that vary from 9.1 per cent down to 8 per cent. As I said earlier, for some extraordinary reason neither the wool industry leaders nor the Government had the stomach to go on with the flock reduction scheme, although the growers themselves, of course, grabbed it with alacrity. Not only did they grab it with alacrity, but some of those same leaders sold their own sheep into this scheme for the measly amount of $1.80, and on other occasions for as low at $5, for young sheep. We could have had a lesser levy if anybody had had the foresight to take it up. I suggest to the Minister that 15 per cent is an impossibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I declare an interest in this matter because I am a woolgrower. Having done the sums backwards, forwards and sideways, I can tell the Minister that, if 15 per cent is going to be around for the next four or five years, an enormous number of people will go out of this industry. That is not what we want. I do not agree with those who say that we have to lose a lot of people out of this industry. We are used to low prices on and off for agricultural commodities. We are not used to paying 20 per cent interest rates for 5 1/2 years. For that we can thank the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who has left his post in recent days. We are not used to paying 20 per cent interest rates. This industry, like almost every other small business industry in this country, has been caught on that high interest rate wave. When that wave breaks a lot of people will go out altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to comment on one other thing before I finish-that is, I thought that efficiency was the name of the game. But now we have the International Wool Secretariat with its board; we have the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, with a board of nine members; we have the AWC, with a board of a similar number; we have the Australian Wool Research and Development Corporation, with another board of about the same size; and we have the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are really efficient, surely we do not need five institutions running under the auspices of the Government. Admittedly, one or two of those institutions-at least one-will disappear as the stockpile is sold, but this seems to the Opposition to be an awful lot of institutions, an awful lot of directors, an awful lot of expense and an awful great temptation to build policies to make sure that those people stay in jobs. It is a great temptation for them. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the major point: we have run these figures time and time again over the past few months; we have put them in the public arena and nobody has been able to shoot holes in them. There is absolutely no chance that growers can continue to pay a levy of 15 per cent, or indeed anything over 10 per cent, and the Government ought to take up its part of the obligations-having stood as guarantor and having been responsible for the legislation which brought about this enormous debt, along with the woolgrowers-stand in its place and give the growers still in the industry today a chance to be there in five years time when the Wool Realisation Commission has done its job. If that is the case, my guess is that there will be a repayment of some moneys to growers still in the business or to those who contributed to the previous $1.7 billion, because the price of wool will go up as the stockpile reduces. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In debating these cognate Bills tonight, I intend to address only two of them: the Australian Wool Corporation Bill and the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill; I might briefly touch on the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I do so, I would like to say that I am absolutely appalled at the response from the agro-political industry in this country to the appointment of the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) as the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Firstly, that industry has a proven track record of incompetence; its performance during the whole wool fiasco was appalling. It saddens me that the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia, whose performance is relatively good compared with that of the others, also jumped on this bandwagon. I believe the new Minister will bring to the wool industry a new vision; he comes free of and uncluttered by the old prejudices; he brings a keen intellect; and I believe he will bring the guts and determination this industry so sadly needs and has not had in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills concern me. In the words of the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in his second reading speech, in the new Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) we are setting up:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the new AWC will have a role as a market facilitator and will act as a catalyst to ensure that the market is operating as efficiently as possible. As part of the function of encouraging the Australian wool industry to adopt plans for the improvement of the marketing of Australian wool, the Corporation will be required to encourage the adoption of sale by description. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the record of the Corporation. Its history hardly enables its representatives to talk about marketing efficiency. Its own record proves that. The Corporation, according to the second reading speech, is required to encourage the adoption of sale by description. Why would one do this? Unless one wanted to move down the road of acquisition, there is no great requirement for sale by description; it is a decision that should be made, not imposed on it-or even encouraged to be imposed on it-by an industry driven by industry demand. It is the sort of thing in this Bill which leads me to fear that here we have the beginning of another bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the people who ran the last bureaucracy, believe me, they will seek to make this a bureaucracy such as they had before. If Australian woolgrowers want innovation in wool marketing and to ensure they get the best results for their money, they should not put their faith in the Australian Wool Corporation or in agro-political bodies; they should send their money to the wool marketing reform group in Western Australia, which I believe has had the best ideas and has been consistent in its approach to the necessary wool industry reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the 15 per cent tax, which I believe will be hard to bear. The tax is broken into three components: debt management, promotion, and research and development (R&amp;). The debt management component comprises 11 per cent; promotion comprises 3.5 per cent; and R&amp; comprises 0.5 per cent. We have heard much from the Opposition about reducing this component to as low as 10 per cent. It says that it could perhaps be done for 12 per cent. This is not the problem facing the wool industry. It will not make much difference whether it is reduced by 3 per cent, 4 per cent or even 5 per cent; it has to be reduced much more dramatically than that. The Bill contains nothing to stop that happening should the opportunity arise. It can still be done. I will speak presently about how I believe it can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pointless for the Opposition to come in here and talk about reducing the tax by that small amount. The Opposition harps a lot about what I call the `McLachlan flock reduction program'. The Opposition's proud boast is that 11 million sheep were slaughtered under the old scheme. Certainly 11 million sheep were slaughtered, but the question must be asked: how many would or should have been slaughtered anyway? Certainly a large percentage of that 11 million. There was a bizarre scheme where all woolgrowers paid the bureaucracy, which in turn paid to some woolgrowers, money for destroying the sheep, which is what every woolgrower should have done anyway and had a responsibility to do. It was a nonsense scheme; a mass flock slaughter scheme simply would not work. </PARA>

<PARA> In respect of the problems of getting rid of the wool clip, a scheme is available to put the wool into zero coupon bonds. This will have the capacity to reduce the tax from 15 per cent to the very low level of 4 per cent, just for the components of research and development and promotion. I believe it is a program that will work and I am very pleased that the new Minister has undertaken to have it thoroughly researched. Opposition to this program comes from two main areas. Some people say, `The wool might fall into the hands of individuals who would then control the Australian flock'. That is possible but highly improbable, and the industry could not be any worse off than it is now anyway. Other people say, `If the worst came to the worst, at the end of 10 years the Government would owe some money'. That is also possible but highly improbable, and given that everyone agrees-including the Opposition-that the price of wool will rise it is certainly a risk worth taking now to get that large burden from around the necks of growers. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it deplorable that I have 10 minutes to speak on such important Bills and I rather resent the fact that Opposition members had 20 minutes, particularly when they had so little to say. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been enormous waste in research and development in the past. I believe it is essential that research and development be kept out of the hands of the Wool Corporation. When the scandals are eventually unearthed and we know the full ramifications of what the Wool Corporation did with the Abel Star handpiece, when I was in the industry 20 years ago, that handpiece was going to revolutionise the wool industry and remove the prevalence of second cuts in wool, which gives farmers one of their greatest areas of loss. This machine certainly did that; it was very effective. It is outrageous that in 20 years we did not see it go into full production, yet we saw the Wool Corporation spend millions of woolgrowers' dollars trying to circumvent the handpiece and get its favourites to develop a comparable scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to look at wool testing. The Australian Wool Testing Authority (AWTA) submitted to the Vines Committee of Inquiry into the Wool Industry and the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council that it should have a monopoly on wool testing and that it alone should test Australia's wool clip. The AWTA tests by an airflow device, which is technology from the 1940s; all it does is measure the average fibre diameter of any particular sample. </PARA>
<PARA> Melden Laboratories, on the other hand, has developed, with it own resources, without help from the Australian Wool Corporation, a machine that not only tests-it gives the average fibre diameter-but also gives a print-out of the fibre diameter of 2,000 samples and enables one to have a much better idea of the disposition of the diameter in any particular sample of wool. This is important because of the tail. One could possibly get, as in South America, nominally 19- micron wool, which has some very broad fibres in it as well. Clearly a fibre with more consistency is much better for the industry. That is what is called style. It is one of the great things about Australian wool and one of the things that is very hard to test for under the proposed testing methods that the Corporation wants to impose on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the AWTA spent $8m of woolgrowers' money in developing this without success. It has been developed on a shoestring by Melden Laboratories, which is exporting that technology to the world today. I could go on with some of the other outrageous performances of the Australian Wool Corporation. I think of the then wool fibre marketing director, Mr Sven Andersen, traipsing around Europe, wreaking havoc as he went and I think of Mr Fletcher Jones's proposal to sell a million bales of wool in the United States. In 1990, he was going to save the industry by putting wool into men's slacks in America. We eventually sold 2,000 bales, with promotional costs of some $70m-odd, which works out to a promotional cost of about $430 a kilogram. That is a great effort. </PARA>
<PARA> We must ensure that those people who wreaked havoc on the industry before, and those people who are responsible for much of the trouble we have today, are not allowed to once more insinuate themselves into these new boards that are being set up. I urge the Minister to take care of that. I also urge the Minister in passing to be aware of those who come with their preconceived ideas. I know that the bureaucracy in his Department is very strong and very confident in its own knowledge. I suspect that what the Minister will get from Mr Miller, the Secretary to the Department, is very much what we have had in the past. I am thankful that we have a Minister who comes to this industry unfettered by previous knowledge and prepared to give it the vision and the hope that it needs for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian wool industry is unique and the product produced is unique. No other industry is more important to the economy of Australia and to the standard of living of all Australians. Its viability is critical to thousands of woolgrowers, their families, rural towns and cities and the communities they serve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation, introduced by the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) does not provide the best option to restore that viability and confidence to the wool industry. The Government has not responded with a desire or a compassion commensurate with the significance of the issues, but clearly with the aim to limit, even preclude, any possibility of further government support. This legislation further exposes the Government's inept handling of the crisis that, for a myriad of reasons, has developed during the past 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1970, during a period of depressed wool prices and markets, the coalition Government introduced the original reserve price scheme. The scheme was designed to smooth price fluctuations, not to maintain a minimum price. It was managed by the Australian Wool Commission, which, by the end of the 1970-71 season, had purchased nearly 600,000 bales, which were ultimately sold at a profit. The scheme was funded through the Government's credit facility at rural credit rates of interest. In 1973, under an ALP Government, the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) was established. A minimum reserve price was introduced in 1974. At that time, prices were low and stocks accumulated. Originally the floor price was underpinned with a government guarantee, but ultimately this was financed by growers through a wool levy, AWC trading profits and interests on investments. In June 1990, the AWC commercial borrowings were guaranteed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> At the commencement of the scheme, the legislation gave the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy responsibility for key decisions and the AWC administered them. This included the minimum price scheme. These roles were subsequently changed and the Wool Marketing Act 1987, which gave responsibility to the Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Council of Australia for the management and day to day running of the industry. The Government's role therefore became one of general overseeing and direction. I mention these changes because I see them as crucial in any debate on the operation and success of statutory marketing authorities. It is important that we recognise that the objectives of the reserve price scheme changed from one that protected growers against disastrously low prices, with some protection against short term market falls, to the objective of attaining the maximum sustainable price. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of this legislation, the reasons why the scheme was suspended and now abandoned should be documented. In 1983-84, the stockpile reached 1.6 million bales. As a result, private buyers and processors let their stocks run down. Wool demand increased during the 1980s from China, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and Japan, which virtually eliminated that stockpile. Panic buying by the trade in 1987-88 caused a rapid increase in price. The minimum reserve price was increased from 408c a kilogram clean in 1986-87 to 870c a kilogram clean in 1988-89. This was a 70 per cent rise. In 1989-90, severe economic problems developed in the USSR and China, causing a 50 per cent reduction in their purchases. Those two countries accounted for 20 per cent of Australian wool exports in the important mid-micron range of our clip. The Australian dollar rose and wool production and supply increased through price expectations and excellent seasons. </PARA>
<PARA> I doubt if any industry has ever had to contend with a combination of such difficult circumstances. When these factors, many outside the influence of the woolgrower, occurred at a time of unsustainable high interest rates, introduced by that outstanding combination of Hawke and Keating, the devastation was obvious and predictable. Few commentators acknowledged the horrible impact of these monetary policies in the context of rural industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry was in deep trouble. The $1.8 billion support fund built up by growers was gone and the AWC had to borrow heavily to finance the stockpile at the market indicator of 870c. The Minister lowered the floor price to 700c for 1990-91, repudiating his own undertaking, destroying market confidence and increasing speculation within the trade. This decision sounded the death knell for the reserve price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government then endorsed some of the AWC's business plans, which included a maximum wool tax of up to 30 per cent, a possible surcharge on the wool tax up to 20 per cent for 1991-92, a 15 to 20 million sheep slaughter scheme, reduction in the maximum sale offerings from 170,000 to 140,000 bales per week, plus the most bizarre of all unworkable wool marketing suggestions, wool quotas. While all this was happening, the bulk of the woolgrowers had little information and little understanding of the position of their industry. I publicly stated, as many others did in the coalition, that we could not support an effective wool tax of 50 per cent or quotas. It seemed obvious that such taxes would fall heavily on the most efficient and viable producers left to repay industry debt as hundreds of other growers drifted into bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the whole situation fell to pieces when, on 1 February, the AWC suspended wool sales. On 11 February, the Minister suspended the reserve price scheme for the rest of the season and introduced measures designed to carry the AWC and growers through to the end of June. These included the 25 per cent levy and the supplementary payment scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to this legislation, a package of nine Bills that relate to new administrative and management structures and the imposition of a wool tax at the rate of 15 per cent. I do not intend to comment on the new structures. They have already been discussed by my colleague the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). My major concern is with the level of the levy and the options available to manage the $2.7 billion debt and the 4.7 million bale stockpile held by the Australian Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table relating to the coalition's proposals for a 10 per cent levy. I have already received the permission of the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. Large numbers of woolgrowers will have no farm cash operating surpluses in 1991-92. Despite the former Minister's view that there is little difference between a 15 per cent levy and a lower tax, he is clearly wrong. A producer with 5,000 sheep, selling wool at 450c, would pay $10,125 with a 15 per cent tax levy, and $6,750 with a 10 per cent levy. With 10,000 sheep, a grower would pay $20,250 with a 15 per cent levy, and $13,500 with a 10 per cent levy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that the industry is forecast to have negative incomes in the next season, these figures are obviously very important. They are stark figures, as has been acknowledged, and they will be of the utmost importance. They may well provide the difference between maintaining viability, keeping children at school or even, in extreme cases that I am aware of in my own constituency, putting food on the table. </PARA>
<PARA> To acknowledge that the floor price must end was the most painful decision I have faced since I have been in this Parliament. I strongly believe that growers have the right to develop marketing and administrative arrangements to satisfy their common needs and to provide equity and stability. The floor price scheme became unsustainable the day sales were suspended and the wool textile markets around the world were being denied a flow of product. </PARA>
<PARA> It became unrealistic, with growers buying their own wool, stockpiling it at high storage and interest costs and financing all this with levies that had the potential to become astronomical. There is no doubt that the wool industry is at risk and the most satisfactory arrangement in the early years of the restructuring processes is to keep grower costs and levies as low as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Vines Committee of Inquiry into the Wool Industry and the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council recommended a 12 per cent levy, acknowledging that the industry could not cope with a higher levy. The then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, in a letter to all woolgrowers on 13 February, indicated a similar level of levy, and yet this legislation we are debating tonight discards those views. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal that the coalition has developed offers flexibility in its detailed analysis. It is credible and will give a lift in the level of confidence to rural communities suffering during this time of national economic depression. I, like the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), would also like to protest at the time being given to the level of this debate. I also would like to speak on the research and development issues and particularly to ask the Government and the Australian Wool Corporation why the Parke's rotary handpiece that has been in research and development, and now is likely to come into production in America, has also not been given greater consideration by the authorities. This Parliament must defeat the proposal put up by this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to take part in this debate on the five cognate Bills before the House, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill, the Australian Wool Corporation Bill, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill, the Primary Industries (Industry Councils) Bill and the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills. I would like to address them in general terms and perhaps to make some comment on the figures that the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher), the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), and the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), have given with regard to the projected incomes of wool farmers for 1991-92 and onwards. If they could substantiate a little more the creative accounting that has gone into those figures, I would be very glad to pass more comment on them; but I will return to them at a later date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In rising to address the House on the package of Bills relating to the future of the wool industry in Australia, I am aware of the great heartache that has accompanied the debate within the industry as its members seek to come to terms with the problems-not of their own making-in an industry which has been Australia's staple for so long. Although the wool industry is not represented to any extent in my electorate of Richmond, for climatic reasons, I have followed closely the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems associated with the wool industry might appear to the casual observer to be quite different from the problems of the export oriented primary industries represented in my electorate or in the coastal electorates. However, they have a number of things in common. Among these are the events of overseas which of recent years have affected our export markets. Although it will bring no comfort to woolgrowers, they are fortunate that they have not had to deal also with the subsidised dumping by the European Community and the United States of America. That dumping has plagued our primary industries and has brought the Uruguay Round of talks to a halt. However, that is cold comfort for the wool industry which has other unique problems to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills before this House can quite rightly be called a comprehensive recovery plan for the wool industry which will reform the administration of the wool industry when they come into force. The comprehensive plan for the wool industry broadly does two things; firstly, it allows the industry to retain control over its own destiny and, secondly, it underscores the continued support of the Australian Government for that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In his second reading speech, the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, now Treasurer (Mr Kerin), recognised and acknowledged the importance of the wool industry both to the Australian rural economy and as the main agricultural contributor to Australia's export income. The measures before this House tonight also acknowledge that importance and contribution. They also deal with what has been called, without exaggeration, the biggest crisis the wool industry has faced in modern times. That crisis stems from the major adjustment to market prices which the industry must make while at the same time dealing with the tremendous burden of debt and a huge stockpile of wool which almost defies imagination. </PARA>
<PARA> The structures which will flow from the package of Bills now before the House will provide the efficient administrative oversight to allow these problems to be dealt with, and they must be dealt with in the interests of those whose livelihood depends upon finding solutions and in the interests of the wider Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate for this House to recognise the contribution which the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has made to this nation through his work in this portfolio not only for the wool industry but also for other primary industries which are vital for the future of this nation. He sits there, working away quietly at the table. The esteem with which he is held by people right across the political spectrum who have had dealings with him in his portfolio is equalled by few. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister never sought to find slick solutions nor to be a crowd pleaser just for the sake of political gain, but was seen to be what we all recognise by the term `fair dinkum' in his pursuit of the best possible directions for Australian primary industries. While some of those working in the various primary industries might not always have agreed with him, it would be true to say that he held the respect of all of rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, I reveal for the record that a well-known National Party of Australia figure on the north coast-actually from the Page electorate-not long after I was elected to this House, said to me, `Whatever you do, don't let them take away John Kerin. He is the best primary industries Minister this country has ever had'. Circumstances have seen that happen. I am sure it will be Treasury's gain. But I am sure that the rural industries of Australia will not be at a loss with the incoming Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). </PARA>
<PARA> The strategy for the wool industry reflects the close consultation that this Government, through the Minister, brought to bear on what for many seemed to be insoluble problems. There is no doubt that the process of adjustment will be difficult and there will be some who will find the going too tough at the price levels currently being paid for wool. Much of the criticism from those opposite, and indeed from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) adjacent to me, has centred on the wool tax levy and the level at which it should be set. </PARA>
<PARA> Difficulties which come with predicting prices into the future have to be faced and dealt with in a realistic manner, and no doubt that is why the Government has set that level at 15 per cent. The process of adjustment will be difficult and, indeed, there will be some who will find the going too tough at these price levels. But the rural adjustment scheme funding, announced by the Minister only the other day, will be a vital part of the support needed by country producers to deal with their current difficulties. It is to be deplored that some of the States, my own State of New South Wales amongst them, are still jibbing at matching dollars for that part of the rural adjustment scheme which could give interest relief to growers. At the same time, those States grabbed the 100 per cent Federal Government money with both hands from that other section of the rural adjustment scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> It has certainly come as an education for me since my election to watch how the State National Party leadership in New South Wales always puts political expedience before compassion. It seems to me that this Government has demonstrated its commitment to supporting the wool industry through its most difficult period, and I can do no better than to echo the recent call of the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to those involved in industry at all levels to match the Government's commitment with what he called the `cooperative determination' needed to reach the goal of recovery and renewed prosperity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In joining this debate tonight, I too would like to make the observation that we are debating nine Bills under the guillotine. But, worse than that, this is the third time in the last 12 months when we have been debating wool that we have had to do so under the guillotine. It is absolutely unbelievable that this Government, on every occasion that we have been debating major points about the wool industry, has placed that legislation under the guillotine. I think that shows just how much the Government cares about this major industry-not just major agricultural industry, but major industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the wool industry this time is facing its worst crisis in decades and probably the worst crisis since the 1930s. Against that background, I think we want to look at, firstly, the origins of this crisis; secondly, we want to look at the coalition's position; and in between somewhere, we might even get time to look at where the Government has been and where the Government seems to have managed to do its cop-out. </PARA>
<PARA> I must admit that I was quite staggered when I looked at the history of this crisis and at what has happened to find that, in his second reading speech, the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) made the observation:</PARA>
<PARA>It is now a new era. The recriminations and disappointments of the past 18 months should remain in the past, and all efforts and energy should be devoted to building a revitalised and sustainable industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I would agree with him on the second part of that comment, but I cannot agree with him on the first part because, as the old saying goes, those who ignore history are destined to repeat it. I think a bit of history tonight would not be out of place. </PARA>
<PARA> I also said that we would be looking at the coalition response, which I think is a very exciting response, a very responsible approach to the whole wool industry; it shows that the coalition really cares. As my colleagues the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) have already pointed out, we have a very responsible approach to this and one that shows that we do in fact put the woolgrowers first in this whole crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The origins of this crisis can be traced, I believe, back to 1987 when the Minister, no doubt with good intention but unfortunately with the wrong results, introduced a Bill which was, if I could use the pun, `fatally flawed'. The Minister started off with good intentions. In fact, if we look at Hansard of 30 April 1987, we note that the Minister, in his second reading speech on the Wool Marketing Bill, said:</PARA>
<PARA>First, the Bill seeks to place the Australian Wool Corporation on a sound commercial footing so that it is equipped to respond now and into the future to the pressures of the market-place. Secondly, the Bill is designed to introduce appropriate arrangements to ensure that the Corporation is fully accountable to industry and government without disturbing its commercial performance. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words, I am sure, must come back to haunt the Minister because, no matter how hard he tried to achieve that, he in fact failed and failed dismally. The question must be: how, indeed, could he have got it so wrong?</PARA>
<PARA> Prior to 1987, the industry managed to operate a market scheme, a reserve price scheme, very effectively. It was clear that one of the reasons why it could operate it effectively was that it was carefully controlled by government. I think it is a lesson to the Minister and it is a lesson to this Government that we really cannot go into a situation in which, to use the colloquial expression, we are `half pregnant', because it just does not work. The Government may have wanted to make it more commercial, it may have wanted to allow the industry to have more say; but, in fact, right now it has achieved the exact opposite where the industry more than ever has been at the mercy of government. That is probably why some of the solutions that are being proposed are being `imposed' by a Government that really is showing very little sensitivity to the problems facing individual growers. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like now to just very briefly allude to some of the events that have occurred since the introduction of the 1987 Wool Marketing Bill, and particularly when it became clear that we were starting to look at a bit of a crisis. I have asked the Minister if he would agree to the incorporation of a table on wool facts, which is the chronicle of a crisis and was put out in April 1991 by Michelles. That chronicle gives the problems from 28 June 1989 right through until March of this year. I seek leave to incorporate that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What this table shows in a chronicle of a crisis is that, far from being innocent of blame or responsibility, the Government knew what was happening but hesitated. In fact, as is pointed out, on 28 December 1989 the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy said that he was considering raising woolgrowers' tax to support the Corporation buying rate because, by that stage, the Corporation was buying heavily. If we look at 8 June-I am trying to abridge this because I am aware of the shortage of time-we can see that all through the crisis, the Minister certainly knew what was happening and yet, rather than taking a responsible decision at any time, at any one of the number of points where he could have done so, he continued to vacillate and to procrastinate, and avoided taking that decision until the industry reached the crisis it is in now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a couple of other points I would just like to bring up in this chronicle. One is when the Minister in early June went over to Yugoslavia and he made this famous quote:</PARA>
<PARA>If there is one central message I want to convey to you today, it is the commitment of the Australian industry and the Australian Government to stand behind the decision to lower the floor price and to work to overcome the problems we confront. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to give a cast-iron guarantee that the Government would never again lower the floor price. But he went on and did that again in July. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government will not contemplate under any circumstances a further downward movement of the floor price. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say it again in October and, even as recently as December last year, he was quoted as saying that he had had an optimistic response from his trip overseas trying to push the 700c along. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is clear that the Minister was aware of what he was doing, but he continued to mislead the industry. I think he knows now, from what has happened to his Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and to his former Treasurer (Mr Keating), both of whom seem to be quite happy to mislead not only wool buyers but the whole of Australia, that when one gets caught out, people are very loath to forgive one. There are a number of points that the Government does have to be held responsible for, and that is just one of many where this Government has undermined the confidence of the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> But, of course, there are other ways that the Government did this. As has already been mentioned in this debate, the high interest rate policy that the former Treasurer, the one who wanted us to have a recession, forced on the industry has exacerbated the problems we face today. We could go on and talk about the Government's failure to bring in the income equalisation deposit scheme when it should have and various other measures which would have ameliorated the problems that we face today. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the then Minister misled the growers again when he wrote a letter in February implying that the tax would be 12 per cent. He repeated on a number of occasions-it was reported that he had anyway, certainly on the front page of the Stock and Land -that 12 per cent was likely to be the tax. The report of the Vines Committee of Inquiry into the Wool Industry and the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council also clearly supported that. Yet it seems that the former Minister has managed to avoid facing up to that responsibility since he has made this announcement. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at some of the responsibilities that the Government should have had and yet seems to have avoided, we find that the former Minister in his second reading speech said it all, when he clearly ran away from the facts:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's decision on wool tax also reflects its decision that responsibility for the debt will remain with the industry . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I think that shows that the Government has washed its hands of this problem that it has created. Yet the fact is that the Government does have an obligation. It has an obligation for a number of reasons: firstly, the 1987 Act, which the Government put in place; and, secondly, for extending the guarantee repeatedly, and allowing the industry to get so heavily into debt. The point is that the Government took a proactive decision to do that and therefore has a responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> As time is short, I would like to point out why I believe the coalition's response, in moving an amendment to reduce this levy to 10 per cent, is the right way to go. It is clearly in the best interests of growers, and it is clearly going to do the most to try to help the individual growers who are facing real hardship in the coming year. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very sensible policy, as my colleague the shadow Minister for primary industry has mentioned. It also means considerable savings. As the honourable member for Mallee has already pointed out, for a grower with 5,000 sheep a drop of 5 per cent in wool tax would mean savings of approximately $3,500, which is not insignificant if someone has a negative income. It also has the advantage of applying some discipline on the Australian Wool Corporation and its successor bodies. Also, and most significantly, it does not force growers to go further into debt to try to prop up the Corporation, when clearly the Corporation can borrow at a considerably lower rate than individual growers-it is probably about 6 per cent cheaper on average for the Corporation to borrow money than for growers. I believe, therefore, that we have a very responsible position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have already sought leave from the Minister to incorporate in Hansard the table that the coalition has put together showing how we can responsibly keep that levy below 10 per cent. I therefore seek leave to incorporate that in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. I now briefly turn to the assumptions behind our figuring for this 10 per cent levy, because I think it is very important to realise that we have taken some very careful assumptions here-conservatively based and realistic. We are talking about the Corporation being able to borrow at the long term bond rate, which is currently about 10 3/4 per cent interest. We are assuming that 25 million kilograms can be released from the stockpile next year without a significant impact on price.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, the cost of storing the stockpile and running the Corporation, or its replacement organisations, is of the order of $45m a year. Fourthly, the Corporation, or its replacements, is committed to expenditure of $187m in the coming financial year on promotion, and $54m on research and development. Fifthly, unless otherwise noted, the average price to prevail in 1991-92 is 295c a kilogram greasy, which is equivalent to 447c clean, or the bottom of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics' range of price forecasts of between 450c and 500c. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much that should be said about the wool industry. In the short time that is available because of this guillotine, I would like to conclude by saying that I believe our 10 per cent is a very responsible figure, and I have to say that the Government has much blame to bear for the crisis that has occurred. The Government may try to blame others, it may try and rewrite history, and the former Minister may have even shifted to being Treasurer today, but the fact remains that the responsibility for the failure of the 1987 Wool Marketing Act is wholly and solely that of the Australian Labor Party Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I declare my interest, as I rise tonight, as a woolgrower with an electorate in Queensland-the electorate of Maranoa-with a substantial stake in the wool industry and the future of the wool industry. The Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill, which is before the House, is significant in that it will either make or break many woolgrowers in Australia, and it will make them if our amendment is agreed to by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before moving on to the Bill, I notice that we have with us tonight at the table the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, now the new Treasurer (Mr Kerin), and I wish him well in that role. I hope that, following his statement on the Australian dollar being too high, he may have some influence on the Australian dollar and bring it back to more realistic levels.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not have the same confidence, nor does much of rural Australia, in the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, because he has an image problem to overcome; he has got to lose some of the spots that he gained during the broad comb dispute-or, I should say, the narrow comb dispute-the live sheep trade dispute and also the Mudginberri dispute. So he has a huge image problem to overcome, and I am sure, for the sake of the Minister at the table, that he will try to overcome that. Let us hope so, for the sake of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to pass on my congratulations, and have them recorded in Hansard, to the Chairman-elect of the Australian Wool Corporation. Mr Mac Drysdale, who has been appointed by the Minister, is in fact a constituent of mine. I have known him quite well and I am sure that he is going to do a tremendous job in that role. It is also interesting to note that the electorate of Maranoa will in fact have supplied the Australian wool industry, when Mac takes up his position, with two chairmen of the Australian Wool Corporation, the former one from the electorate of Maranoa being Sir William Gunn. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is fitting that we should reflect on the last 18 months. The industry itself, the growers out there, and Australians generally owe a debt of gratitude to the staff of the Australian Wool Corporation. In the last 18 months they have been through a most difficult time. This time last year, they were buying 70 per cent of our Australian woolclip, and some days more than that. They had to store that wool, pay for it and in many cases ship it overseas. In November, the industry called on them to set up a quota scheme. With all the debate raging at the time, they had to field calls on what would happen with the quotas, how the quotas would apply. Then in December they had to set up a flock reduction scheme and in February of this year they had to set up a deficiency scheme which expires at the end of June this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wool Corporation staff have had an enormous load on their shoulders and I do not believe we have heard any of them complain once. I believe that the industry owes a debt of gratitude for the wonderful work that they have done in these most difficult times. The staffing levels would not have been set up to cope with the sort of crisis that has faced the industry in the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us look at the minimum reserve price scheme. This is an historic night, perhaps particularly for the National Party, because it was the National Party that introduced this legislation 18 years ago. If it was not for the legislation of the now Treasurer and former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, this reserve price scheme could still be operating today. I believe that is the pity of what we face right now in Australia-that the reserve price is not operating today at around 450c or 500c a kilogram. If it had been, we would never have seen the stockpiles that we are confronted with or seen taxes that reached 25 per cent and were proposed to reach 35 per cent this year. Those are the things that I believe will be a legacy that the former Minister, now the Treasurer, will have to live with. </PARA>
<PARA> Under our legislation, the minimum reserve price scheme would have been operating right now at today's prices, not at prices of 12 or 18 months ago. Our figures, which support a 10 per cent tax-no more than 10 per cent for the coming 12 months-are in fact credible figures, as the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has said. But what underlies those figures is the sale of non-wool assets-$120m of them in the next 12 months. I-and I believe most members on this side of the House-believe that we must ensure that that sale happens, because 70 per cent of those non-wool assets of the Corporation do not store any wool; they are readily saleable and are returning good returns on the capital invested. I would rather see those assets sold than see woolgrowers sold up in the next 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the figures of the former Minister, now the Treasurer, who is at the table tonight. Perhaps we should call him the Minister for negative incomes, because he said a negative income of a few hundred dollars is not really substantial and he said at the Australian Wool Council meeting that the difference between 12 per cent and 15 per cent amounted to 12c. But he failed to say that it was 12c a kilogram. When one multiplies that out, one gets a substantial amount of money, not an insignificant amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA> The difference between our proposal and the Government's proposal, the difference between 10 per cent and 15 per cent, equates to $700 for every 1,000 sheep. That equates to $120m in woolgrowers' accounts around Australia from 1 July next year. That is the difference between our proposals: $120m. If one looks at today's closing figure of 574c, the amount will be almost $150m. I believe that would create jobs and assist growers out there to survive. At a time of record unemployment, I thought the Government would be looking at trying to keep people in rural Australia. It has always protected the jobs of unionists and I thought it might have been looking at a way of keeping people out there in rural Australia-keeping jobs and keeping people on the land. </PARA>
<PARA> I know we do not have the responsible Minister at the table, but the former Minister could nod his head if he agrees that 10 per cent is right. That is all he would have to do as Treasurer-nod his head and say that 10 per cent is the goer. I challenge him to nod that head tonight. It really does not take much. The new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy would certainly make a name for himself straight away, and perhaps gain a bit of credibility out there in the bush, if he nodded his head, if he were here tonight, and if he showed some interest in this Bill. </PARA>

He was the man who said that there is no real crisis out there. Let me assure him that the rural crisis has worsened since he made that momentous statement. That $120m would be indeed valuable to those growers out there tonight-and I believe many of them will be listening to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We on this side of the House take the longer term view. We are not taking the short term view, as is the Government. As the honourable member for Murray, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, said, our figures have been run through and through, and through again. They are credible; they stand up. They will meet the Government's debt repayment scheme. I ask the Treasurer, who is at the table, to nod his head in agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> My time is short because of the guillotine and I know a lot of other people in the House would like to talk, but exemptions are proposed in the Bill and I would like to say that exempting carpet wools from the tax proposals is not the right way to go. Once we create an exemption, other sectors have just as good a reason to be exempted. I refer to the Sharlee wool industry, the very fine end of the wool industry. That includes the people who shed their sheep and produce 16 and 17 micron wools. They have a very small industry and produce a very small quantity of wool annually. They market that direct to mills. There is none of that in the stockpile and, as we know, there are 11,000 bales of carpet wool in the stockpile. But carpet wools have been exempted. I ask the Minister why the Sharlee woolgrowers have not been exempted. </PARA>
<PARA> I know the industry will survive, and I for one do not believe that we need fewer growers in Australia. I believe that in the next four or five years we will see the great wool industry emerge again and that it will rise to be our number one export earner again if the right decision is taken tonight. That right decision will be to support the Opposition's amendment for a 10 per cent tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to follow the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) in the debate and to support the Deputy Leader of the National Party and our spokesman on primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), in his plea to the Government for a more realistic look at the wool tax and the impact on woolgrowers around Australia of the legislation currently before the House, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, the Australian Wool Corporation Bill, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill, the Primary Industries (Industry Councils) Bill and the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a particular interest in this legislation because my electorate of Wakefield has within it the merino capital of the world, Burra, and the merino studs of the Clare Valley and the Burra region. It is coincidental that I should be participating in this debate tonight in the presence of the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, now the Treasurer (Mr Kerin). In fact, I last greeted the former Minister in my electorate at the Burra merino field days where, I observe, the woolgrowers of Burra were very gracious in their reception of him in what were, two months ago, very difficult times-times which are only a little easier today because it happens to have rained. That rain, of course, has done nothing as yet for their income; it has merely meant that the prospect of a future income is a little less gloomy than it was when the former Minister was in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I also recognise that I participate in this debate under a guillotine. I share the sentiments of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and all other honourable members who have protested at the fact that legislation as important as this has been subject to the guillotine. I remind those who are listening to this debate that this guillotining of important rural legislation through the House has become characteristic of this Government. We faced precisely the same situation with the wool Bills last year and, prior to that, with other key rural legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I also stand here, as other members have done, on the day when we have seen the appointment of the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). I congratulate him. I hope that the capacity he has shown in this House in his relatively short term as a parliamentarian-the capacity to offer a great deal of advice-will also be matched by the capacity to deliver on behalf of the primary industries of Australia. I have to recognise that a great number of farmers are certainly apprehensive at best at the provocative appointment of him as the Minister for primary industry. His record on their behalf has not been good and he tends to have been much more, it would seem, a party to increasing rather than decreasing farm costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the House effectively removes the 30 per cent tax on a 700c floor that has become part of the wool scheme following the abandonment of the floor price last year. The proposal, as we have heard from all other speakers, is that woolgrowers from around Australia should now be saddled with a 15 per cent tax. The Opposition insists that this tax could be lowered to 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those opposite-and the former Minister, if he responds, may well be one-who point out to us that, after all, the 15 per cent tax is a maximum tax, so why should the Opposition be so excited about a proposal to reduce that maximum to 10 per cent when the 15 per cent may never be needed or realised anyway? The reason the Opposition is so adamant that its amendments should be passed and that the maximum tax borne by woolgrowers should be 10 per cent is that we believe that the woolgrowers' industry and the woolgrowers' bureaucracies, and all those who now manage the clip on behalf of woolgrowers, should be placed under exactly the same pressure as the woolgrowers themselves are currently bearing. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone knows, because the point has been clearly made, that primary producers around Australia, and woolgrowers particularly, are facing a real income fall-calculated, for example, by the United Farmers and Stockowners of South Australia Inc.-of 40 per cent. While that is generally known in rural Australia, it has even been running in urban papers such as the Sydney Morning Herald, where it was reported, as recently as 27 March this year, that the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has forecast that farm incomes across Australia will fall by at least 33 per cent this financial year followed by a further fall of 21 per cent in 1991-92, no matter what happens to the weather. What would the Minister do if his former constituents in the Australian Council of Trade Unions were faced with a fall in income of between 33 per cent and 40 per cent?</PARA>

I think it is only reasonable to demand that those organisations, appointed and funded by the growers, should be expected to exercise some sort of financial stringency as well.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Leader of the National Party. As the honourable member for Maranoa pointed out in his speech, this small amount, multiplied across growers right across Australia, comes to $120m. In fact, in an illustration already adequately given by the honourable member for Wannon-an illustration, I acknowledge, also given to me by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who wanted to participate in this debate on behalf of Kangaroo Island farmers but has been unable to do so-if one is running 5,000 head of sheep, a 15 per cent tax on a wool clip realising 450c a kilogram, or 295c clean, will cost $10,125 and a 10 per cent tax will cost $6,750, the difference being $3,375.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Three and a half thousand dollars is not a large amount, but for many of my farmers, and for many of the constituents of those on this side of the House, it is the difference between survival and disaster. In some cases, it helps enable the farmer to meet an outstanding bank debt, but there are instances already given in the House in which the difference between a 10 per cent and a 15 per cent tax will be the difference that keeps the family alive. It is small, but it is survival, and multiplied around Australia it is $120m. More than that, it is the growers' money that is either being taken from the growers and used wisely or unwisely up to 15 per cent or being taken from the growers and used wisely obligingly because the maximum available will be 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kalgoorlie came into this House and was critical of farm bureaucracies. I will not take issue with him on that account. The thrust of his remarks was that he was critical of farm bureaucracies. But he is not proposing to support us in putting some pressure on the farm bureaucracies to oblige them to be efficient in the way in which they serve their growers. The purpose of our amendments is to put the bureaucracy under pressure and oblige it not to squander grower money. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said, and as other honourable members have pointed out, on the proposal of the 15 per cent, the debt servicing portion of it should be 11 per cent, promotion 3.5 per cent and research and development 0.5 per cent. The point the Opposition makes is that the debt servicing obligation has already been reduced because the market has realised better than people anticipated; so the outstanding debt sits at $2.63 billion, which was the amount projected to be reached in 1992-93. Along with the asset sales already outlined by the honourable member for Mallee and the honourable member for Maranoa, this makes it possible for the Opposition to responsibly suggest that the growers should be saddled with a tax bill of no more than 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about dealing with the growers' money, and we are obliging the growers to part with more than they need in the face of what for them may be the difference between bankruptcy and survival. You know, Mr Deputy Speaker, because it is legendary, that the Australian wool industry is an efficient industry. Of the operators, 93 per cent are family based. In fact, if we take primary industry across Australia in total, over the last 25 years primary industry has seen its costs go up by 690 per cent while the price received for its product has gone up by a mere 316 per cent. A measure of its sufficiency is the fact that farmers have survived under this sort of pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> We are proposing to put some pressure on the new bodies being established to manage the Australian wool industry. Those bodies are, for the sake of the record, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, which will be responsible for the disposal of the stockpile; the Australian Wool Research and Development Corporation, which will obviously be responsible for research and development; the Australian Wool Corporation, which has been restructured so that it is responsible principally for promotion of standards and industry training; and the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council, which will replace the old Australian Wool Council and become a key advisory body to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Our call is that these bodies be obliged-in fact, forced-to taper their costs because the growers' returns are being desperately tapered. I do not wish to take up any more time of the House than is absolutely necessary because many others wish to participate in the debate. However, I do want to take up the point made by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell), when he came into this chamber and, in a convenient throwaway line, accused the Opposition of what he called `creative accounting'. He said, `If this is not the case, I would like to look at the figures again'. I thought that that was the height of audacity. When did we receive the Bills with which we are currently dealing? We received them late on Thursday night last week--</PARA>

It has put real demands on the staff of the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray and on the staff of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), one of whom is in the gallery tonight, to come up with figures that would stand up. I remind the honourable member for Richmond that these are not figures plucked out of the air by the Opposition, these are figures that have been worked and reworked over the past months. These figures have been run past organisations as reputable as ACIL Australia Pty Ltd and found to be absolutely substantiated. I make the point to the honourable member for Richmond that the figures that the Opposition is dealing with are responsible figures designed to enable the maximum number of woolgrowers in Australia to survive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Government had exercised precisely the same sort of responsibility, both in the development of figures and historically, in allowing, as the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) pointed out, income equalisation deposits to continue, we would not have this disastrous debate in the Parliament tonight. </PARA>

I recognise the validity, for example, of the call by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) for zero coupon bonds. I happen to think it is time that they may need modification. They may not be applicable as they currently stand, but it is time that we encouraged investors outside the wool industry to see the wool stockpile as an asset and to treat it as such, and the move into zero coupon bonds or some sort of modification may be the way to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I point out to the House, and particularly to the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), who is now at the table, that in his former role as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy he enjoyed a great deal of bipartisan support from the Opposition. I hope he bears in mind the fact that it would have been a lot easier for me and every member of the House of Representatives to have gone out into our electorates and simply to have been critical of him. Being prepared to recognise the things the Government was doing responsibly in our electorate has been a difficult exercise. We would call for a similar measure of bipartisanship from the Government as it considers these amendments responsibly being brought into the House by the Opposition tonight. I support the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I say a few things about this legislation, I will declare my interest. I am both a woolgrower and represent one of the best wool growing areas in Australia. Within that, there is a diverse range of wool growing interests from superfine to carpet wools, and I will try to speak a little about them. First, I compliment the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) on his appointment. I hope he does not leave the taxpayers and citizens of Australia in the sad plight that he leaves the Australian family farmer as he vacates the portfolio of primary industries and energy. In my view, the term of the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has been a disaster. Whilst I know there are extraordinarily complex circumstances prevailing within the industry which make difficult the resolution of production, distribution and sale of agricultural products, I do not believe that the steps he has taken are in any way helpful towards the well-being of the rural community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That describes it well, as my colleague the honourable member for Maranoa explains. However, one thing that the Minister has not explained to the Australian woolgrowing public is that he has always, at every stage of the function of the minimum reserve price scheme, had a representative on the Australian Wool Corporation. Under the legislation there has been a requirement for reporting to the Minister. He has had a capacity to direct the Australian Wool Corporation and, with his hand on his heart, he told us he would not direct the industry but leave it to the industry. The reality of the amendments he made to the legislation in 1987 is that the Minister is as culpable as anyone in the plight of the industry today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Had the amendments been implemented which I suggested to the Wool Council prior to its Launceston meeting at the time the 870c level was under discussion-indeed, had the suggestion been put into place that I made at the Roma meeting before that-the 870c for fleece wools could have been preserved, and much of the present plight of the industry would not be now before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that several honourable members have spoken about the arithmetic of the industry. I compliment Anna Cronin for the work she has done in trying to produce the only accurate set of figures which I have seen for some time on the plight of the industry. There is no reason why the Government and, indeed, the Wool Council, should not have available each month the statistics of sales that are given to head office by each of the branch offices of the wool brokers. Having been a director of a wool broking office, having known the facts and figures that were available to me in the days gone by, I see absolutely no reason for the imprecision that seems to plague the industry. Indeed, the Grains Council of Australia is far better in that respect. I suggest that if the industry wants to get its act in order for the future it is about time that it registered that figures are available and if those figures were considered, it would make decisions by the industry far more viable. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say a few more things. I know I do not have long because several of my colleagues also wish to speak. First, there is no use in looking back. Of course there are problems with what has happened. Earlier tonight I was looking at some of the annual reports of the Australian Wool Corporation. Like the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) reports, they are totally inaccurate in their projection of the forward sales, forward demand and forward production. The difficulty that we have is that tonight we are looking at another set of figures. The Government's figures are inadequate; ABARE continues to modify its figures as it needs to, but tells us little of them; and the industry is really beset with circumstances where I think there are a number of conditions on which it is very difficult to pass judgment simply because we do not know what are the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I will cite one example. Carpet wool is defined under the amendments to the Wool Administration Act. As I say, I have carpet wool producers within my electorate and they are not required to pay the levy imposed by the Minister with respect to the handling of the stockpile. Their levy is to be increased to 4 per cent. However, the difficulty that the superfine woolgrowers have is that they have no wool in the stockpile. I am told that if their wool has not been sold, it could have been if the Minister had not made a mess of the disposal of the stockpile. I commend to the Minister the recommendation of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) for the disposal of the stockpile, and I will come back to that briefly in a second. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty with the carpet wool position, as far as the superfine woolgrowers are concerned, is that we do not know how much carpet wool is in the stockpile. In one instance, we have been told that it has all been sold and that a loss was incurred as a result. In another instance, we are told that wool over a 32-micron count, which is the definition that appears in the Wool Administration Act--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says that it is 4,000 bales. I thank the Minister for that. Part of the difficulty is knowing what is there. If it is 4,000 bales, then the position is justifiable. The superfine woolgrowers are asking: is not our wool now saleable? Why should we have any in the stockpile? Why should we then be incurring the 15 per cent levy? Indeed, I think they are prepared to accept their responsibility, and I well understand the different circumstances of carpet woolgrowers and support their exemption. I illustrate the contrast between the superfine woolgrowers and the carpet woolgrowers, because one of the difficulties is knowing where circumstances do lie and the justification for each.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make a few other brief points. First, as far as I am concerned the International Wool Secretariat (IWS) has done an outstanding job. I totally support the maintenance of the contribution to the IWS. But I would like to see the role of promotion extended. I would like to see alternative avenues explored to improve the marketing of Australian wool. For example, I have suggested that we might well have a double Woolmark to represent Australian merino fleece. I think there are ways in which we can create a different image for Australian wool. Let us try to get out and sell our wool. Let us look at whether in future we might be able to give the Australian merino image a slightly different brand name. We need a slightly different promotion gimmick. Let us see whether we can promote the sale of Australian wool instead of just talking about wool and the Woolmark, about blended wools and the blended Woolmark. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there are difficulties in terms of looking at the way in which the new organisations are going to function. I do not accept the recommendations of the Vines committee that there should be a constitution of all of the separate bodies which are part of this legislative package. I cannot see the advantage of this. I believe that it would be far better if a small nucleus managed, as indeed it was intended that the Council would do, the policy formulation of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> People are employed in different sectors of the industry. For goodness sake, the Government is setting up a duopoly in the telecommunications area. The size of this operation is gigantic. In terms of the function of ordinary enterprises in Australia, Telecom has twice the number of employees of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. There is no reason to set up different bodies in order to promote efficiency. What we should do is see whether the people who are employed have a role to play. We should determine what their role is and, if they do not have a role, get rid of them. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I am concerned, part of the difficulty with the minimum reserve price scheme was that the AWC became too bureaucratic. Frankly, by creating more bodies we will have more bureaucracy, not less. Having said that, I commend Sir William Vines and the members of his committee-Mr Millar and Professor Davis-for the outstanding job that they have done. I note that only some of the 40 recommendations in the report are referred to by the Minister. I think all of the others need to be picked up. But the report has helped the industry in concentrating attention on some of the options available to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier my concern about the extent to which, in looking at the figures and at how we might be able to sell wool, we can deal with some of the problems that relate to disposal of the stockpile. As far as I am concerned, it is important that there be predictability. In my view, we have to adopt the practice that had been pursued by the Australian Wool Corporation-the practice that was referred to in a corrigendum to the 1989-90 annual report. There needs to be certainty for the industry. I do not like unpredictability. Apparently the South Africans have sold a quarter of a million bales from their stockpile while our stockpile is floundering. Apparently the former Minister made a decision that the wool would be offered only through auction. The corrigendum to the annual report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Wool held in inventory is available for sale at any given time and is not disposed of at less than the floor price in effect at the time of sale. </PARA>
<PARA>As far as I am concerned, now that the floor price no longer operates, we should substitute the words `the auction price for the day'. To that, I would add `the value added costs, dumping, and freight processing' so that those factors which directly apply to the relevant inventory items are added to the process of the wool and the wool is then available. </PARA>
<PARA> It could be that we should add a margin. Indeed, that has always been my past preference. In particular, I see no reason why, where there are shortfalls of wool, as I understand, for example, there were in carbonised wools, we could not sell such wool from overseas stores so that it would be available. We need to get wool into the marketplace. That, above all, is what we must do at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many aspects to the legislation. There has been a great deal of discussion about the levy. I am concerned that the levy should not be 15 per cent. In my view, the levy should be determined by the Minister. The figures that Anna Cronin has produced demonstrate that a range of options are available, none of which have been explored by the Wool Council, none of which have been explored by the Government and, as far as I am aware, none of which have been explored by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. Either by accelerated disposal of the property of the AWC or by other mechanisms, we could ensure that we can reduce the level of the levy. I can tell the Minister that, as far as I am concerned, the family farmers in my part of the world would far prefer a fire sale of the AWC's assets than a fire sale of their own. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told by farmers that they have had to withdraw their children from school, that they are no longer able to buy clothing or the prerequisites to operate their farms because of the collapse of the reserve price mechanism and the problems in marketing the clip. I would far prefer to see them given a chance. Let us forget about trying to get the highest possible price for what I would see as being highly negotiable assets in terms of wool stores which at the moment are yielding something like 14 per cent in rental payments. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the contrast between the annual reporting provisions of the Australian Wool Corporation Bill 1991 and the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill 1991. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in clause 89 (3) on page 39 of the Australian Wool Corporation Bill there is reference to the fact that there is an obligation to lay before the House with respect to the Australian Wool Corporation annual reports of the Corporation. Where the Minister has given a direction to the Corporation, there is an obligation for the Minister to cause a written notice setting out particulars of the direction to be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. That gives an opportunity to the Parliament, if it wishes, to terminate that notice by virtue of a regulation. I understand that this is the way which the legislation will be applied. If that is not so, at least there will be a public knowledge of directions that are given by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> If we contrast that with what is contained in the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill, we will see that there is a series of areas in which directions can be given by the Minister. For example, under clause 32 (1) the Commission must, as soon as possible after 1 July 1991, prepare and give to the Minister a corporate plan relating to a period of five years commencing on that date. Under clause 33 there is a capacity for the Commission to be given a direction by the Minister. There is no obligation to publish it. If we look further, we find that the Minister can ask for additional information. Under clause 51 he can reject nominations to the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to the Australian Wool Corporation Bill, there is no direction in the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill to publish the directions that are given by the Minister. I want to say two things in this respect. Ministerial directions must at least be available in the annual report. If not, they should be gazetted. The woolgrowing industry must have an opportunity to know the character and the nature of such directions. Secondly, in respect of the whole reporting process, in the legislation that I introduced back in 1972 there was a requirement on each of the bodies, including the then Wool Corporation, to report regularly to the Minister on the statistics of sale and the management of the minimum reserve price scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that there seems to be no regular reporting required in the disposal of the stockpile. I want to see the stockpile disposed of. I want to see it disposed of in a satisfactory, meaningful, businesslike way. I believe that there should be regular reporting to the Minister so that there is some understanding at a government level of what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister has intervened to a greater degree than any other Minister in the affairs of the industry. The former Minister virtually socialised the industry. I am concerned that the powers of the Minister under this legislation are at least as great, if not greater and, where the Minister does give directions, there is no obligation for reporting. </PARA>
<PARA> I want the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Wool Realisation Commission to report to the Minister regularly. I want any instructions and directions from the Minister to be reported to the woolgrowers and the public. If efforts are made to shield these directions under a cloud of bureaucracy that lies within the legislation, I fear for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a difficult time for the wool industry. All of us trust that the product of this legislation will be a brighter future. Indeed, I read with some sadness the conclusion of Hugh Beggs's annual report when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Our major task in the year ahead is to restore confidence in the wool industry and in particular the important role played by the AWC. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not so worried about the important role played by the AWC. I am concerned about all dimensions of the wool industry-production, processing, distribution and, of course, meeting the requirements of the end customer. There are enormous challenges. We have to recognise that we cannot just produce and expect our customers to buy. We have to sell. We have to market. We have to understand that we are in a very competitive marketplace in terms of other fibres. For the life of me, when cotton is selling well, when we are talking about increasing the production of cotton, I find it anomalous that we are here discussing legislation because the wool industry is in the plight it is. </PARA>
<PARA> My own view is that the statistics of production will significantly change because of drought and weather conditions. The production levels this year are likely to be closer to 850 million kilograms than the 900 million kilograms that has been projected by the Minister. As a result, I believe that the industry will be in a much better state this time next year than it is now. But it will be no fault of the Minister and no fault of the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) for his attendance here this evening. Something that I have always welcomed about his particular involvement is that whenever there is a debate in this House he is the sole Labor Minister who chooses to sit throughout the debate and, to my knowledge, has always done so. I hope, nevertheless, that in sitting here, and considering his new responsibilities-which are inextricably linked to this legislation before us today, notwithstanding that he was the father of it as well-he is not just sitting there for the purpose of rebutting the arguments coming from this side of the House. I think that would be a tragedy in the circumstances. I hope that he is prepared to take some notice of some of the remarks that are to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to bring a short one-liner to the Treasurer's attention-it is one that I use frequently-`There are no such things as political solutions to commercial problems'. Unfortunately, in this wool legislation we see another attempt to apply the political solution. In fact, nothing has changed. We even have a form of reserve price scheme, because the Australian Wool Realisation Commission will be fiddling the market because it has no proper guidelines laid down in legislation within which it will operate. We have all the old quangos; we have just given them some new names and broken them up into different groups. That is a disaster because the simple fact is that we do not need any of them, including the Wool Realisation Commission in the form in which it is provided for in the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Treasurer of his second reading speech, in which, as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Wool Realisation Commission will be required to maximise the value of each of its sales. The announcement of an annual debt reduction target, together with a known rate of tax, will enable the market to make an estimate of the sales required from the stockpile to meet the target. </PARA>
<PARA>How will the market make that decision when the Commission has people sitting there trying to make up their minds when to maximise the value of each of its sales?</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Treasurer of something else that occurred during this wool debate and which I will never forget. I refer to the time when a leading wool exporter said, `We are not so concerned about the price we pay today, but we are very concerned about the price our competitor might pay tomorrow'. How can he make that judgment while we have this arrangement of a Wool Realisation Commission sitting over the top waiting to enter the market whenever it feels like it?</PARA>
<PARA> Would it not have been more simple for us to conclude that the only way to get rid of this stockpile was to decide on an appropriate release to the market, set it down in legislation and get some competent store manager to see that it gets to the auction floor on time? Unlike some who have spoken tonight, I do not agree with anything but disposal through auction, because there has been too much evidence of snide preferential deals and so on done through private treaty from this the growers organisation-the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC). </PARA>
<PARA> Generally, why do we need to continue government intervention in the business of commerce when it has been demonstrated to fail? The Treasurer, when Minister, gave us a series of reasons in his second reading speech why what appeared to be a very successful organisation-I know that was my view some time ago-fell in a hole. All of the reasons he gave were credible, but he forgot one thing. The reason it fell over was that no reserve price scheme, no buffer price scheme, has succeeded in the history of the world. That is why it fell over. We all knew it. Why the heck are we trying to resurrect it in this peculiar way? Why are we continuing to impose all of these substantial costs on woolgrowers, who would prefer to do it-and, I think, now understand that it is best to do it-in their own way?</PARA>
<PARA> Figures have been thrown around, such as the operating cost of the Australian Wool Corporation of $45m a year. That $45m would go a long way towards supporting woolgrower's families around Australia. I think that is more important. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill gives us the Wool Realisation Commission. But before it has even been formed, the Minister decided to throw 100,000 bales of wool into the marketplace. A few days later the current incumbent Manager of the Wool Corporation says that he thinks we ought to put a stop to that because the price has fallen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was 11,000 bales or something like that. One minute the Corporation is in there and the next minute it is out of there. We do not know where it is going. It is on again and off again. The worst thing that can happen to the industry is to have people make decisions in that particular way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The newly formed AWC will have responsibilities for promotion, standards and industry training. It is even going to have an annual general meeting for those people who can afford to go. I do not know where we will find them. What a farce! If we are going to have some control over these people, why can we not have a proper plebiscite and a proper vote and let people do it from the convenience of their homes? They may be able to afford the stamp, but they will certainly not be able to afford a trip to a meeting, which will be a waste of time anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> Within this group of quangos we will have the Australian Wool Research and Development Corporation. If as a woolgrower-which I admit I am-I am prepared to pay a tax, it is probably to aid in research, particularly if it is carefully allocated with some reasonable consideration. For many years the researchers sat in judgment as to who got the money. I am not sure all of it went to a good cause. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make a remark concerning the International Wool Secretariat (IWS), which will come under the control of the AWC in terms of its promotion of product, and research. The other day I bought a woollen doona. I wonder how many honourable members listening tonight, or anyone who may be listening to the radio broadcast tonight, even knew that they could buy a woollen doona. It is an excellent product. It uses the coarser end of our micron range of wool. It is an invention of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). In other words, it represents a very practical use of taxes paid in the past. However, as I have just pointed out, no-one knows that woollen doonas are for sale. The reason I was able to buy one is that I rang the CSIRO, who put me onto the manufacturer in Victoria, who was then able to tell me that there are three shops in Perth which stock them. It is a tiny little franchise operation called Mrs Mouse. Not one major retailer is stocking those doonas or the pillows that we can buy also. I hope to get some of them to put in my motel because I think they will be better than the crummy pillows I sleep on around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The CSIRO has managed to mould polyester and wool together, not just as a mixture stirred up in a pot, but by getting them to fix to one another in a cross-formation to maintain a springiness which, as we know, wool is not otherwise able to achieve over time as it packs down. I am living very comfortably under my woollen doona in Perth. I would expect that everybody with a commitment to the industry, including the Treasurer, would go out and buy one. The real requirement is that Australians know that they are available. Where is the IWS, which will rake another $89m out of woolgrowers this season so that it can spend $187m? I do not think it knows that these woollen doonas exist. I think that organisation is a waste of money. I would not give it a penny, because it cannot even promote this product. </PARA>
<PARA> There are tens of thousands of doonas sold every year in Europe and in the colder countries. We are still letting Thai feathers fill them, yet we have a product in Australia which would use the higher micron wool found in most of that stockpile. The manufacturers are using the higher micron wool, but they could probably use the very coarse micron wool. </PARA>
<PARA> Wool has other features; for instance, it is much more absorbent of fluids. The CSIRO tells me that when people sleep they exude up to seven litres of fluid a night. Those people would be much more comfortable and healthy under a wool doona. Where is the IWS? One of the worst things about this legislation is that it will continue to tax woolgrowers at 3.5 per cent-$89m-while adding reserves and other costs so that the Corporation can spend $187m on the IWS. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the AWC, the greatest effort of promotion by the IWS, as I have learned to my great annoyance, was for itself. The IWS has managed to convince Australian woolgrowers and us politicians that it is a useful organisation; it simply is not. Let me give the House the best example I can: the IWS almost wrung its hands in apology to us for being so successful in convincing Australians and the world to buy lightweight wool that it had neglected our coarser wool production, and that is why-through its success-public attention turned to fine micron wools to the consequent neglect of the coarser micron wool, which was a substantial part of Australian wool production. </PARA>
<PARA> That happens to be a load of absolute rubbish. During the time the IWS spent all its money promoting lightweight wool, that product was the result of technological change in the cloth production industry. As I discovered from papers unrelated to promotion, the simple fact is that in recent times the wool weaving industry has gone from looms that operated at 120 picks a minute, which means that the bobbin went across the loom 120 times a minute, to looms that operate at 480 picks a minute. </PARA>
<PARA> There were other reasons, such as natural economies: whereas one worker could look after six of those slower looms, today he must look after twelve of the faster looms. If the thread breaks, the principal job of the worker is to rejoin it and get the machine running again. It turns out that a piece of wool yarn, whereas it used to be able to break once every two kilometres of yarn, can now break only once every 16 kilometres of yarn. How is that achieved? By weaving more wool fibres into the same thickness of wool-in fact, 90-because union is strength. That means that producers of cloth must buy finer wool and the industry must adjust to that, other than in areas such as the manufacture of doonas and so on, which should be able to consume all our coarser wools at the drop of a hat. </PARA>
<PARA> The IWS did nothing to achieve that situation; it was a natural progression through the manufacturing industry, and the IWS fraudulently presented itself as achieving all this when it had done absolutely nothing. Tonight we allow the Council to continue to fund that organisation-the enemies of the industry. It must stop and we must ask ourselves whether we need the IWS. I understand the American cotton industry does some promotion and raises a levy; I was told that by the Wool Council so I presume I can believe it, although I tend to put the Council alongside the Prime Minister in more recent times, in terms of integrity and honesty. However, the reality is that the American cotton industry does not pay a levy in Australia, and everybody buys cotton. Why? Because it is well promoted. Who promotes cotton? The Levi-Strauss (Aust) Pty Ltd company does; it is a manufacturer and is close to the market; it will produce the product and promote it. Yet we continue to load the actual producing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, like others, I recognise that there are time constraints tonight. I deplore the guillotine which reduces the opportunity for the Opposition to draw some of these facts to the attention of Government members in the hope that they might do something about them, although, as I have said time and time again, there is a fair chance that a mob of socialists will want to intervene in everything, and that is what this legislation is doing. I inform the Treasurer that the evidence is that a 15 per cent tax is not needed and is a rip-off. The Opposition has produced the evidence without the help of banks of computers or staff from Treasury and or the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, because it is simple arithmetic. It is easy to see, as others have said, that if the Government is prepared to start the wind-down of Wool Corporation assets it can do so easily and can guarantee survival for the people who matter most-the people who grow wool. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason the wool industry is in this bind is the procrastination and stupidity of politicians, both agro-politicians-who are still queuing up for a job and a few overseas trips-and parliamentary politicians. Consequently, we must bear some of the burden of responsibility. I was amazed when in Question Time this afternoon someone wanted to know why Queensland is not getting a bigger share of the largess of the Australia Council-$40m or $50m spread around Australia so that someone can go to some show that no-one would pay the right money to see in a fit. There is simple evidence to show whether something is popular: people will pay their own money. The Government does not have to subsidise the Phantom of the Opera or a State of Origin league game or a football game. It is funny how the Labor blokes keep subsidising the opera while taxing the football; I have never been able to work that out. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that if the Government is short of money to help woolgrowers because 10 per cent does not add up-and I am sure it would-it should get a bit from the Australia Council, because I am sure that the people out on the farms need that money more than a few ballet dancers. Thousands of millions of dollars have been wasted in that regard because we have all these champagne socialists in the Australian Labor Party today who prefer the opera to saving an industry like the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the time you have given me. I thank my colleagues for not asking me to sit down more quickly, but I hope that honourable members have listened to some of the points I have made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the stance of the coalition, which is that the wool tax should be placed at a maximum of 10 per cent or at a lesser amount set by regulation as circumstances permit. I feel that 10 per cent is the absolute maximum that growers can sustain at the moment and remain viable. I believe strongly that the tax should be as low as possible for the first one or two years at least so that financially stressed farmers can get through the difficult couple of years that they are now facing, at least partly due to the `recession that we had to have'. I regret that the Government wants the tax level to be at 15 per cent and I also regret the fact that the Australian Wool Council (AWC) wanted the tax at 12 per cent, although I was told just a moment ago that it may have come back to 10 per cent; I hope that is correct. The Opposition's calculations show that the tax can be placed at 10 per cent and are based on a number of assumptions, both factual ones or quite conservative ones.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These assumptions are based on the fact that the AWC debt is at $2.63 billion. These assumptions have allowed for the fact that there is a $200m interest free loan for the first couple of years and for the fact that the stockpile will stand from 1 July at 815 million kilograms, or 4.4 million bales, which incidentally is more than double the previous historical figures of 1.8 million bales and 1.6 million bales. It also assumes that the AWC reserves and the general account will be $30m, that the promotion account will be $114m and that there will be $56m in the research and development (R&amp;) account. </PARA>
<PARA> The AWC assets have been conservatively valued at $290m-it is better to sell what one can of these assets rather than sell out farmers-and it also assumes that wool production for the next financial year, 1991-92, will be 875 million kilograms, and that the AWC can borrow at the long term bond rate guaranteed at 10.75 per cent. It also allows for the sale of 25 million kilograms of wool from the stockpile next year, that the cost of storing the stockpile and running the AWC will amount to $45m, that the AWC expenditure in 1991-92 will be $187m, plus $54m for R&amp;, and that wool will be selling at 450c per kilogram clean. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, wool is selling at about 580c, so that is a fairly conservative estimate. That comes out, after allowing for running costs of $567m and revenue income of $435m, at a shortfall of $132m, which means that growers would have to be levied 5.1 per cent at 450c a kilogram to service that $132m. If 4 per cent is added for promotion and R&amp;, that comes out at a levy of 9.1 per cent-somewhat under the 10 per cent that we are asking for as a maximum. That, of course, does not take into account that a flock reduction scheme could also be put in place on top of this and the percentage needed being lowered even further, down as low as 5 per cent or less. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party wants a tax of 15 per cent, that to be made up of 11 per cent for debt management; 3.5 per cent for promotion, which is about 20c per kilogram; and 0.5 per cent for R&amp;-a total of 15 per cent. They are the figures. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to comment on a few matters that other speakers have not commented on. I support the recommendation that the carpet wool growers be exempted from the debt management level and that they will be paying 4 per cent. I understand that carpet wool is defined as wool in excess of 32 microns. They will pay a 4 per cent levy; in other words, 3.5 per cent for promotion and 0.5 per cent for R&amp;. I point out that they already pay a 6 per cent levy-their own industry levy-which is used for marketing. In total, carpet woolgrowers will be paying 10 per cent. If they had been asked to pay 15 per cent, it would have meant that they would be paying 15 per cent, plus their own 6 per cent levy-a 21 per cent levy-which would have meant that there would be no industry in carpet wool. That would have been a great shame because we import $100m of carpet wool each year into this country, mainly from New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a remarkable fact that, even though Australia exports most of the wool that it produces, most of the wool that is used within Australia is actually imported. The carpet wool producers have not been receiving any supplementary payments since that scheme was put in place some months ago. It is interesting to note that when the reserve price scheme was lowered from 870c a kilogram to 700c, a drop of about 19 per cent, the medullated carpet wools were only lowered by the AWC by 8.8 per cent and the filler carpet wools were only lowered by 13 per cent. That made them relatively higher priced than they were before that drop took place. That made the reserve price scheme for these types of wool the dearest in the world, and it made those types of wool unsaleable. The reasons why that was done are quite beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA> Carpet Wool Marketers Ltd has already purchased the speciality or medullated wool at a considerable loss to itself. Much of that wool was poorly classed and described within the stockpile. It has offered the AWC to buy the filler wools. The letters that were written to the AWC were not answered. I understand that the letters were written to David Clarke, who will head the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, offering to buy the 14,558 bales of wool there over an 18-month period. I hope that he answers that letter and takes up that offer; I think it is a good one. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make some short comments about the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), who I note is not in the chamber tonight. If he is going to do what he said on the steps of Parliament House this morning he would do, I would have thought that he would have shown an interest in the industry. The very least he could do is to start learning something about the industry and be here tonight. I note that the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and now Treasurer (Mr Kerin), to his credit, is here and I thank him for that. However, the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has spent all his life opposing what farmers stand for and what they aspire to. He has devoted his career to having people paid higher wages for less work, maintaining rorts and idle time and all those types of things. As I remember, he opposed the loading of live sheep; he opposed the introduction of wide combs into the wool industry; and he opposed the Mudginberri abattoir wage deals which allowed higher wages for productivity increases. It is dreadful to think that this person, who has done all this, is now to oversee the rural industry. </PARA>
<PARA> On another matter, with the passage of time, I think we can say that we now all understand better what went wrong with the reserve price scheme that operated for 17 years in Australia in its present form. We all recognise that mistakes were made chasing fluctuating exchange rates in one direction and not the other. We all recognise that mistakes were made in placing the industry in a position of buying in large amounts of stocks during times of high interest rates. We all recognise that mistakes were made in massively increasing supply to a level above that which had ever been sold in this country, especially at a time of world downturn in textile demand. I acknowledge that there are still a handful of growers and others who believe that 870c per kilogram could have been sustained in the face of all this, but I think that most people in this country now recognise that this was fairyland stuff. Fortunately, growers will now get their market signals much more rapidly and accurately than before, and I am pleased to say that that ultimately will be to the benefit of the growers. </PARA>
<PARA> Wool is already priced higher in the market, in nominal terms, than it was before the last artificial price spike-that is a remarkable factor to contemplate-despite the massive oversupply that now exists and despite the overhang of the stockpile. The disposal methods of the stockpile, I believe, are crucial, and I particularly welcome the appointment to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission of someone of the calibre of David Clarke. I particularly welcome the wide range of financial skills that he has. It is imperative that the stockpile be disposed of in a transparent, a predictable and a proper manner-a manner that will cause minimal disruption to the coming markets, especially to the spring sales, which traditionally have been somewhat fragile. The viability of many growers in this country will depend on the success of the disposal of the stockpile. I believe that the Minister should assist this by keeping the wool tax down to a maximum of 10 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As usual, we are debating this wool legislation under the guillotine, and those of us who have a longstanding interest-and I declare my interest as a woolgrower-are limited in the comments that we can make. In fact, with all the crisis that this $6 billion industry has been through, not once in the last six to nine months have we had a full and open debate on the industry in a calm atmosphere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased to see the Treasurer, the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), here in the House. I am disturbed that the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) is not with us because those of us in the wool industry well recall his contribution to the wool industry in the storemen and packers strike in the late 1970s. His great contribution on that occasion was to negotiate, like the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and at the end of the day he settled for such a big figure for those storemen and packers that the whole wool industry decided that it did not want any more of his members in the industry and most of the handling is now done by mechanical means. That was his contribution to the wool industry in those early days and I am not sure that he has learnt a lot since. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) that the attitudes of the new Minister have been totally contrary to the desires and aspirations of farmers throughout Australia. However, he has got some friends down in the electorate of Corangamite. If he wants to come down there, we will show him how the good sheep operators perform, where the best cattle are and how he might come to grips with rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental issue before us is the level of taxes in this Bill. The coalition is quite clear that a 10 per cent tax is the way to go. We have had a range of taxes over the last 18 months during this whole wool debate. The Government is now suggesting a 15 per cent tax to overcome the accumulated debt problems. We have done our figures and we are recommending a 10 per cent tax and we will stick to it. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the then Minister, the Australian Wool Council and the Australian Wool Corporation have been recommending taxes of up to 25 per cent. On one occasion they were even suggesting taxes of between 40 and 50 per cent if the necessity arose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Plus quotas, which even the then Minister in his saner moments did not believe, and those of us who had been through the industry agreed that this could not happen. The AWC debt of about $2.7 billion is at present less than the $3.5 billion that most of us concerned with the wool industry thought might be the case. At least that has been an improvement. We have done our figures in relation to the debt servicing requirements, the reduction in research and development, the possible asset sales of the Wool Corporation, and the estimated price, which is anyone's guess, which has improved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The stockpile of 815 million kilograms or 4.4 million bales is again a little more optimistic and better than estimated some six months ago. The other encouraging feature is the reduction in interest rates to about 10.75 per cent. I say in passing that the interest rates the Corporation is paying are a lot less than those being paid out by hard working farmers on their overdrafts at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The key question is this stockpile and the overhang that creates in the market. The important thing is that the coalition has agreed that the stockpile should be released by volume and that there should be a predictable, clear arrangement, as the honourable member for Parkes has suggested, in the way in which that stockpile should be released so that buyers and sellers, and the market generally, will know exactly where the 4 1/2 million bales will go in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), who is at the table, would be aware, the wool industry is very happy with the fact that the stockpile will be held in quarantine until December 1991, allowing the current year's production to be sold in the first half of the selling season, which means that the larger volume will be sold in this half and then we can get on with getting rid of the stockpile. The interesting thing is that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) said that the Corporation decided to sell 100,000 bales because it saw a rise in the market, demonstrating the great problem that Mr David Clarke and the Australian Wool Realisation Commission will have in the way in which they go about getting rid of the stockpile. Tactics cannot be changed halfway through the selling season because there is a lift in the market; they have to be clear and transparent. Only on that basis will we get rid of the stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that there has been a change in the wool price. Wool has been selling and moving in the pipeline. This is very much against the attitude of the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Wool Council which had a view that wool would sell because it was a quality product and price was not a feature. That myth, that total unreality, has been smashed to the ground in recent weeks because when the price has been lowered a great amount of wool has been sold in the open market by auction. So, relative to the other fibres, cotton and synthetics, wool is now selling because its price is competitive. Buyers are coming back into the market for the first time in six or seven years because they can see a commodity from which they can make a profit. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition, in drawing up its figures and suggesting this 10 per cent levy, has taken into account the lowering of interest rates, as I have suggested. The fact is that there is a very dry season throughout Australia and drought is looming in large parts of the wool growing areas. A number of ewes have not been joined, a number are not fat and therefore the lambing percentage will be lower. In my own judgment the sheep flock could even be down to as low as 150 million, which is a lot less than the 175 to 185 million sheep which it was estimated we had. </PARA>
<PARA> The stock reduction scheme, which a number of us on this side have been suggesting as a contributing factor to reducing the number of sheep, has helped. Some 10 to 12 million sheep have been taken away from the production cycle. That has helped to reduce the supply of Australian wool where the market has been oversupplied and we will get equality between supply and demand, and the price. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of storing the stockpile and administering the Australian Wool Corporation-as the honourable member for O'Connor has said-is $45m. Some woolgrowers wonder whether they are getting value for money. The important thing in this stockpile reduction-the Government is allowing some seven years for it to be achieved-is balancing the Government's loan guarantee of $2.6 billion and getting that money back against the growers' returns. As we all know, growers are experiencing very difficult times and they are keen to get the highest price they can. If this stockpile flows onto the market in a haphazard manner, then all will be lost. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to the fact that woolgrowers have lost $1.8 billion. I think that many people around Australia have overlooked that fact. I am confident that the Government's loan will be paid back in full, but the woolgrowers at this stage have lost that $1.8 billion and they do not have much hope of getting it back. </PARA>
<PARA> The setting up of these four statutory bodies and the accumulated debt at this stage sounds the death knell to any reserve price scheme ever being re-introduced. This buffer stock type scheme has been a total failure; it should never be contemplated again. It is worth recording that it was voted against by woolgrowers on two occasions and yet, by certain political manoeuvres, it was introduced through this Parliament. The floating exchange rate did not stabilise wool prices in purchasers' hands, as the honourable member for Parkes so rightly pointed out in his speech. </PARA>
<PARA> A buffer stock reserve price scheme will not work. It has proved to be a total failure. This Bill, and this debate, should be the end of any such suggestions by woolgrowers in the future. The introduction of further statutory bodies just gives the lie to the total free enterprise position of woolgrowers who are keen to sell their own wool in a private enterprise manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Australian Wool Corporation is trying to maintain quality, promotion and standards. My suggestion is that that should be done by a privatised woolgrower body, paid for by woolgrowers, away from government and political interference, so that woolgrowers can get on with their own industry and sell wool in their own way without relying on big brother corporation or big brother government to help them out in difficult times. </PARA>
<PARA> The one encouraging feature about the Australian Wool Realisation Commission is that in seven years, under this legislation, it will be removed by a sunset clause. Some of us hope that its job will be completed in four or five years. So at least there is something to remove it from the statute books. I, and the honourable member for O'Connor, have some reservations about the role of the Australian Wool Research and Development Corporation-yet another corporation-across the industry and its value to woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA> The advisory board, headed by Sir William Vines, is an indication of the lack of confidence by the Minister, the Government and many of us on this side of the House in the contribution by the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Woolgrowers Council. During the recent crisis, and due to poor advice, it got itself into a mess. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the wool industry should proceed, with no statutory corporations and no taxes, with an incentive to innovate and change and market wool for woolgrowers in an open market option system and move away from influence by agro-politicians and by members of this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the 30 seconds I have left to me, I give this message to the present Treasurer (Mr Kerin): the woolgrowers of the western division of New South Wales cannot pay a 15 per cent tax and remain viable. They will not survive. Already a number of them will have to withdraw their children from school. They have problems already. They had problems, before this tax was even intimated, with the extra costs and charges of government. They cannot pay a 15 per cent tax, and I am asking the Treasurer to reconsider the attitude of the Government to this issue and at least drop the tax to 10 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of each Bill, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 4, page 2, omit ``15%'', substitute ``10%''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment will reduce, throughout the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills, the maximum figure from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. We have shown that that is credible, that it is sustainable, that it is sensible, and that it is essential if the woolgrowers of Australia are to survive. It is a question of making a choice between the sensible realisation of the Australian Wool Corporation's assets-$120m of Corporation assets equals 5 per cent of the levy-and the forced fire sale of assets of woolgrowers. Such a choice should be in favour of the woolgrowers for their future viability. Therefore, it is a sensible decision to require the Australian Wool Corporation's assets to be sold rather than those of woolgrowers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been some criticism of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). I specifically asked to take these Bills through the House, and I will also be taking the fisheries management Bills tomorrow. I believe, given the history of this, that it is only appropriate that I do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to join the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) in congratulating those members of the Australian Wool Corporation staff for the work and the effort that they have put into all of this during these last months, particularly people such as Jim Young, Alan Mahoney, Bob Richardson and John O'Connor. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment moved by the Opposition is all about the wool tax and asset sales. I stress that the Government is fully committed to early asset sales and expects the Australian Wool Realisation Commission to sell wool stores in the first two years. We are also realistic. The property market is depressed-hence the interest assistance for a $200m loan; that is, we are not going to shift the pressure onto the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the debate about whatever level of tax there should be, I have simply gone through this again and again. The latest bit of information, for the benefit of honourable members, comes today with a fax from the Australian Wool Corporation. We have had all the experts down there today and we have gone through it again. Here it is in terms of a fax from Jim Young, the Managing Director:</PARA>
<PARA>The conclusion . . . it seems certain that a 15 per cent aggregate tax levy would be required.</PARA>
<PARA>There has been reference to the ACIL Australia Pty Ltd report to the New South Wales Farmers Association, which says:</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, fine tuning of the original assumptions used by the Government does not justify a reduction in the total wool tax rate for 1991-92 from the 15 per cent announced. </PARA>
<PARA>I can go into this book, chapter and verse, but time will prevent me. Please be assured that the Government has taken this issue very seriously. No matter which way we look at it, we believe that we have to come up with a 15 per cent tax in the first year. We simply have to start somewhere, and it is all about risk assessment. People who say that a lower tax can be fixed are really making very optimistic assumptions about a whole range of parameters. We believe that we cannot take that risk. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is half an hour left for debate on the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill, which introduces some sweeping changes across the whole gamut of the transport industry in Australia. It is an omnibus Bill-it covers areas of aviation, areas of road transport, areas of railways and shipping-and we are given but half an hour by this Government to discuss these changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst some of the features of this particular omnibus Bill are relatively minor-there are minor amendments to the Tasmanian railway system superannuation plan being upgraded-some quite significant aspects of the Bill should be debated to a much greater extent than the half an hour that has been allowed to us tonight by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I concentrate my comments on my areas of responsibility in the shadow ministry, namely, the amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986. As I said a little earlier, while some of these amendments are really quite minor, there are some aspects of this particular Bill that require some very close examination indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I could look firstly at the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986. The amendments which are brought in by this particular Bill cover two main areas. The first is the provision of security at airports and the second is the requirement to change the accounting functions for the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC). </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that from 1 July this year the Federal Airports Corporation will be subject to income tax and these amendments change the situation so that the reporting year for the Federal Airports Corporation will now finish on 30 June rather than 31 March, as is presently the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The area covering airport security is welcomed by the Opposition. Airport security is to become a function of the FAC, which will be responsible for the provision of aviation security at all FAC airports. I understand, by virtue of these amendments, privately operated airports such as Cairns and Hamilton Island will be similarly responsible for their own security. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions will relate only to the air side of airports, and will cover all security functions, including the anti-terrorist procedures. Obviously, this will bring us in line with what happens in most airports overseas. I understand the saving to the Government by making this move is something like $15.9m. The Opposition welcomes that particular amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some matters I raise tonight on the Civil Aviation Act 1988. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) said that the amendments to the Act, governing the operations of the inspectors and investigators of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), will provide investigators with adequate and clearly defined powers. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>These will be subject to strict safeguards to protect the rights of individuals against whom the powers may be exercised. The safeguard provisions proposed by this Bill are in line with similar provisions found in other Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I have raised in the House before the very real concern, especially in the general aviation industry, of the activities of some of the inspectors within the Civil Aviation Authority. There is some concern within that particular part of the industry that the amendments tonight are really not going to help the situation as much as all of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I bring to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table, clause 32aa, the appointment of investigators. One of the areas of concern is the fact that the CAA may appoint an officer to be an investigator. The Bill really does not give any indication of what is required to be an investigator for the CAA. Whether it be a pay clerk or whether it might be someone who might be highly qualified, there is no guarantee that this will be taken into account in these particular amendments contained in this Bill. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to advise us whether or not in fact there will be that provision for the licensing of inspectors. </PARA>
<PARA> I also bring to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary clause 32ac, the monitoring powers of those investigators exercised with consent. The industry has always had difficulty with CAA investigators who enter unattended hangars without permission to search the premises and the aircraft that might be in those hangars. It would appear that this clause implies that they can do so only with the consent of the occupier. Whilst they clearly cannot enter if consent is refused, it is not clear that they can do it if the consent is not available. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to advise us, if he possibly can, whether or not the CAA investigators can in fact enter without consent when the facility is unoccupied. If that is the case, the legislation should clearly say so; otherwise it should state that access without permission is not allowed unless acting with a warrant. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also concern with clause 32ae, the offence powers exercised with consent. The section clearly states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the investigator may, with the consent of . . . the occupier of the premises:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) enter the premises; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) search the premises for the thing; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) if the thing is found-seize it. </PARA>
<PARA>There is some concern that this may conflict with clause 32ah of the Bill which authorises evidence to be seized without the occupier's consent. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area in question is clause 32aj, the power to require persons to answer questions and produce documents. This particular clause permits an investigator with a warrant to require anyone at all on the premises to answer any questions at all that may be put by the investigator or be subject to a fine of $3,000. I understand some legal opinion is being sought on this particular question, but it appears that these particular investigators would have more power than civil policemen. Even a common criminal is entitled to the right to refuse to answer any or all questions until protected by a court of law; yet, according to these particular amendments, someone could well be up for a $3,000 fine. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 32ak, relating to powers in relation to aircraft, is also of some concern. This clause causes very great difficulty because it imposes no real restrictions on the investigator's power to stop and detain aircraft. While the power to stop and detain may be necessary, the reasons for exercising it should be clearly defined. It appears to me that the operators must be in clear violation of published CAA regulations or orders and any continued operation would be such as to endanger public safety. </PARA>
<PARA> There is concern that if these definitions are not clearly spelled out perhaps we should look towards amending these provisions in another place. I am sure the honourable member will help to clear up some of those points. There has been some very real concern within the industry about the operations of inspectors in the past. If that is cleared up, I am sure the industry will feel much happier with these particular amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to section 98 of the principal Act, which is also being amended to clarify the CAA's power to make regulations in respect of the preparation and approval of all the technical documents specified in the Act. This includes flight manuals, operation manuals, procedure manuals, aircraft maintenance manuals and the like. We would welcome that particular part of these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should be congratulated on-and indeed the industry is pleased with-the fact that at last the CAA and the Government generally are moving towards allowing aircraft operators to abide by the maintenance provisions set out by aircraft manufacturers. For the life of me, I have never really been able to work out why Australia should differ from other parts of the world in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the major overseas aircraft manufacturers, they should have a pretty fair idea of what is required on their aircraft. We need the provision brought about by these particular amendments to allow aircraft operators to abide by the technical provisions of those particular manuals. In fact, the requirements set out by the manufacturers will have to be maintained by the operators of aircraft in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not my intention to speak for too long on this particular Bill tonight, except to say that I think it is a great pity that we have no more than just half an hour to debate some aspects of these amendments. They are important. I conclude my remarks at that point to allow a member of the Government to speak and to allow my colleague the shadow Minister for shipping and waterfront reform, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), to make some comments on the amendments in this Bill which concern his portfolio. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard some of the points raised by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), and I will respond to some of them on the advice that has been provided to me. With regard to the power to question persons, this is a standard provision throughout Commonwealth legislation. It is not a draconian power, because the maximum penalty is only $3,000. The matter has been raised in correspondence that obviously the honourable member for Fadden has received from the General Aviation Association (GAA). Contrary to what the GAA states, clause 32aj clearly provides that answers given to questions are not admissible in any criminal proceedings against the person. This is considered by the Government as an adequate safeguard. These powers were recommended by the independent Air Safety Regulation Review Task Force; in fact, they are recommendations 1 to 4 of the second report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of dangerous goods prosecutions have been unable to proceed because of doubts about the powers of investigators to seize and detain evidence. I am sure that I have heard the honourable member on previous occasions in this House express his great concern about the need for added aircraft security and for strict provisions to enable the enactment of measures that are necessary to protect people on aircraft and to protect the security of aircraft. On my own behalf and on behalf of the Government, I accept that his comments are made in that same similar spirit that he has shown in the past; comment not by way of criticism but by way of concern and the need to maximise aircraft security and aviation security generally. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of those prosecutions that were unable to proceed because of the doubts I have referred to, both major domestic airlines have expressed concern at this situation, and they have urged the Government to amend the necessary legislation to provide officers with the necessary investigative powers. The provisions are intended to be used only for major offences. The administrative fines scheme will be used to deal with minor offences, which is what the General Aviation Association seems to be concerned about, from our reading of the correspondence. </PARA>
<PARA> I should mention also that, in future, the Civil Aviation Authority will be concentrating its resources on areas of industry which directly affect the fare paying public and will be paying less attention to private operations. In a general sense, in reference to the opening remarks of the honourable member for Fadden, I might say that it is the practice in nations abroad that aircraft security and aviation security generally is borne by the industry. All honourable members of this House need at all times to be vigilant in the use of airports and in the boarding and disembarkation of aircraft. There is a wide variation within this country, and across the world, in the standard of aircraft security that is practised. It is one thing to have the systems in place; it is another thing to ensure that those systems operate effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that honourable members cast their eyes about them as they walk into and out of airports, remembering that the people who sit there watching those screens are performing the dullest and most boring job that anyone would want to carry out, yet that particular function of watching a screen is the most vital function of all-just the analysis and examination of the screen and the goods passing by. The fact that we are picking up a practice from across the world in requiring the industry to bear the costs of aircraft security is desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to the amendment to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983. We are a nation with a fragile and vulnerable coastal environment. Many honourable members have electorates near to major export ports, for instance, the North West, Port Kembla, Newcastle, Hay Point, and parts of the Queensland coast. Despite our having raised in this Parliament more than a decade ago the danger of the seabed being virtually polluted while, in effect, new vegetation grew on the seabed in the vicinity of those ports where vessels wait offshore as a result of the discharge of ballast waters, when I questioned it some years ago, I was ridiculed. It was not there; it could not happen. The fact is that it is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> Linked with that also is the need to ensure there is adequate protection under the international maritime conventions. This legislation deals with the major convention with respect to the discharge of oil and oily substances and garbage, but in particular, garbage. For the benefit of all honourable members, the first paragraph on page 12 of the explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Principal Act will therefore now cover both overseas and Australian ships in respect of pollution incidents committed within the territorial sea but outside State and Territory jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA>Since the principal Act was passed:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . only New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia have enacted appropriate complementary legislation. In addition, the seaward limit of the Australian territorial sea has recently been extended to 12 nautical miles from the coast or baseline, without any corresponding extension of State and Territory jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA>I read those in reverse order. The first part indicates what the Bill does to remedy that position, but the second part indicates the problem that has arisen. However, no mention at all is made of that amendment in the second reading speech. The second reading speech ought to be a layman's presentation of the major provisions of the Bill. This is an important amendment to the legislation of international maritime conventions, and it ought to have been referred to in the Bill. I welcome the fact that it is there, but I would have been much happier had more prominence been given to it. </PARA>
<PARA> In these types of Bills-sure, they are omnibus Bills-any honourable member in the chamber ought to be able to pick up a copy of the second reading speech, read through it and be satisfied that that speech covers all the major provisions of the Bill. I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed a pleasure to follow on from the two previous speakers, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), who have spoken on their own particular areas with a great deal of knowledge and expertise. Both gentlemen are recognised not only in the Parliament but, indeed, throughout Australia as being people who have an extraordinary depth of knowledge and understanding of their two respective subjects. The honourable member for Fadden, our spokesman for tourism and aviation, is recognised as being probably the best person in this Parliament in terms of a detailed knowledge and understanding of the industry. Without wishing to appear trite, I would have to say that the honourable member for Shortland, a long serving Minister for Transport, is well recognised throughout the industry as being someone who has a good understanding of the industry, and his comments in debates such as this are always welcome.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A lot of people do want him back; the honourable member for Fadden is quite right. Indeed, probably the reason he is not there is simply because Bill Kelty put the veto on him sometime ago and, of course, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) played to the tune of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It is unfortunate that he is not here because his expertise is missed on the Government front bench at present. As we heard from the contribution he made just a moment ago, he knows what he is talking about and his words are heard with a great deal of credibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Transport Legislation Amendment Bill which we are addressing this evening is an omnibus Bill dealing with a range of areas relating to transport. The area of interest to me is that dealing with the shipping side of life. The portion of the Bill referred to by the honourable member for Shortland, the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983, would be supported by all honourable members from both sides of the House. It is a Bill which we see in today's environment as essential to protect the maritime life around the Australian coastline. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week in the House we debated the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill which was designed to try to ensure that all commercial shipping in excess of, I think, 70 metres in length, had a pilot on board to guide them through the very difficult waters of the Great Barrier Reef. That was designed specifically to avoid potential catastrophes such as we have seen fairly recently, unfortunately, on the television-catastrophes such as that involving the Exxon Valdez where many millions of barrels of oil were spilled into the ocean and caused untold damage to the environment in Prince William Sound and surrounding areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Great Barrier Reef Amendment Bill was designed to try to prevent that type of catastrophe from occurring. The Opposition supported it wholeheartedly. Had it not been for the guillotine and the axing of our opportunity to speak on it, I would have had the opportunity to address an amendment which I had recorded in Hansard. It was designed to try to better protect our marine life and to ensure that pollution does not occur, and it would do that by opening up the pilotage service that operates on the Great Barrier Reef to ensure that there is some competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members would be interested to know that on the Great Barrier Reef at present there is a monopoly provider of pilot services. In order to ensure that the shipping industry complies with this legislation, it is important to keep the cost of pilot services down. For that reason, we had hoped to be able to draw to the attention of the House the fact that a little competition, either by way of an alternative pilot service operator or by enabling shipping companies to employ their own pilots full time or to have regular crew members properly qualified as pilots for those waters, would have added to the strength of the Bill by ensuring that the cheapest possible pilotage services were being provided on the Great Barrier Reef, thereby ensuring that shippers did not try to cheat the system by operating in those waters without a pilot. If we can provide an alternative to the monopoly pilot service in the Great Barrier Reef, we will have cheaper services and greater compliance with the legislation that we passed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports this legislation. I personally support the amendments that relate to the prevention of pollution from ships. The specific provisions do a couple of things. Firstly, they increase the penalties for proven pollution at sea, and secondly, they ensure that notices can be issued not just to the master of the ship or to the shipowner but also to the ship's agent. This is an important amendment to the legislation, because it has been proved that, particularly with foreign-flag vessels, if there has been an instance of pollution at sea it is very difficult for the Australian Government to serve a notice on a foreign master or a foreign shipowner. One of the most practical ways of dealing with the problem is to serve the notice on the ship's agent here in Australia and, through the agent, ultimately to the shipowner or to the master of the ship. This is a sensible amendment, one which we support and one which will ensure that people who are guilty of polluting our seaways are served with a proper notice and are properly penalised. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspects of the Bill deal with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA). Some minor amendments relate to leave for the Chairman and members of the Authority and termination of those people's service to the Authority. Once again, the Opposition has no complaint with the proposals being put forward. Interestingly enough, a short time ago the Australian Maritime Safety Authority was the subject of a great deal of controversy over the disappearance of the yacht Rockin Robin. The crew members, whilst being watched and surveyed on board a life raft, were ultimately lost and never found again. That highlighted some deficiencies within AMSA. </PARA>
<PARA> After a great deal of pressure from the Opposition the Government held an inquiry. We thought that the inquiry would be a bit of a whitewash because it was going to be an in-house inquiry. In-house inquiries tend not to really delve into the problems and highlight them. However, the inquiry did, contrary to my own opinion, highlight a number of deficiencies that had to be corrected. I hope that in the passage of time since then those things have been corrected. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that a new Managing Director of AMSA has been appointed today. We look forward to his contribution to the improvement of search and rescue operations through AMSA. As he and the people who work for AMSA-a very dedicated group of people-are aware, lives depend upon their successful operations. In the case of the Rockin Robin we can see just how easily lives can be lost if a mishap occurs within the planning and operation of a search because of some mistake somewhere down the search and rescue line. We want to avoid that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition complained bitterly about the shift of the Authority from Canberra to Newcastle. At the time we highlighted that no cost-benefit studies were being provided by the Government to justify the piling up of many millions of dollars in relation to the cost of shifting the Authority to Newcastle. We were proven to be right; the costs became quite untenable. To the great embarrassment of the Newcastle members of Parliament and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who promised that AMSA would be created in Newcastle, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) decided to renege on the promise and keep AMSA in Canberra. He did the right thing, even though it caused embarrassment to his Newcastle Labor Party colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite honestly, there were no legitimate arguments for taking AMSA from Canberra to Newcastle. The argument was very simplistically put that we had to have these things close to the sea. The simple fact is that we do not operate the search and rescue operation through AMSA with a pair of binoculars; it is all done electronically through communications methods and other things. That can be done equally as well in Canberra as in any country town in Australia, as long as there are adequate communication facilities. Taking it to Newcastle was a nonsense and was simply an exercise in pork-barrelling. </PARA>
<PARA> We are pleased to see that these matters before the House will strengthen the protection of our marine life by ensuring that proper penalties are being imposed on those people who are found guilty of polluting our seaways. We look forward to seeing more competition in Great Barrier Reef pilotage services to ensure that pilotage services there are being provided not by a monopoly operator but by a number of providers or that shipowners can employ their own full time pilots either as specialist pilots or as regular members of the crew, properly qualified, operating up and down those waters. By doing that, we ensure that people can afford the cost of protecting our maritime environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. JOBST garments are used mainly to prevent or reduce hypertrophe scarring and scar contracture at joints.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. There is no specific rebate under Medicare as rebates are not used for devices. The Medicare arrangements comprise the provision of benefits for patients using private medical services and grants to the States to contribute towards hospital and out-patient costs.</PARA>
<PARA> The latter component of the Medicare arrangements acknowledges the role of the States in providing hospital and out-patient services. Within the content of Medicare the States agreed to provide free inpatient care for public patients and to maintain the existing range of out-patient services.</PARA>
<PARA> The provision of health services, including medical aids and appliances, is essentially a State responsibility. The Commonwealth Government's role under the current health funding arrangements is limited to providing health grants to the State Governments in addition to general tax sharing arrangements. It is a matter for each State to determine its priorities and the funds that are allocated between the many competing areas of State Government spending, including hospital and health services.</PARA>
<PARA> Traditionally, all States other than New South Wales have provided garments such as JOBST garments free of charge via the public hospital systems. The New South Wales Government recently announced that it would do likewise.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) is responsible for testing of imported seaweed and kelp for compliance with the Food Standards Code developed by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). Sampling commenced on 14 January 1991, and 18 samples have been taken for analysis by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (AGAL).

<PARA> (2) There is currently no specific limitation on arsenic and cadmium in seaweed in the Food Standards Code. The `All other foods' category of the Code permits total arsenic to a maximum of 1 mg/kg and cadmium to a maximum of 0.05 mg/kg. Recommendations are going forward to the National Food Standards Council to amend the Code to permit the following standard for seaweed (85% moisture content)</PARA>
<PARA> -inorganic arsenic</PARA>
<PARA> maximum permitted concentration 1.0 mg/kg</PARA>
<PARA> -cadmium</PARA>
<PARA> maximum permitted concentration 0.2 mg/kg</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A sample of seaweed tested for AQIS contained total arsenic at a level more than 100 times the limit permitted under the `All other foods' category.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) A sample of seaweed tested for AQIS contained total cadmium at a level more than 40 times the limit permitted under the `All other foods' category.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Department of Community Services and Health advises that the Food Science and Technology (FST) Sub-committee did review the limits of arsenic and kelp in seaweed at its meeting on 15-16 February 1991. The Sub-committee concluded that on the data available it was not possible to recommend a specific listing for seaweed and kelp in the Food Standards Code separate from the``All other foods'' category.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Department of Community Services and Health further advises that the Public Health Committee, at its meeting on 15 March 1991, reviewed additional data, and concluded that there was no immediate evidence of significant danger to health by bringing inorganic arsenic and cadmium levels in seaweed into line with those applying to fish and fish products. The Committee identified a range of data requirements needed to make a recommendation on a final standard within the Food Standards Code. AQIS has been approached to undertake a comprehensive monitoring program over the next 2 years. In the interim, it has been recommended by the NHMRC that the Food Standards Code be amended to establish the limits referred to in the answer to question 2.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) All consignments of seaweed and kelp imported since 14 January 1991 have been detained pending the receipt of analytical results from AGAL on samples collected by AQIS. Pending the outcome of the meeting of the Public Health Committee on 15 March 1991, AQIS sought the advice of the Department of Community Services and Health on whether individual shipments could be considered safe for human consumption based on the test results reported by AGAL. On the basis of the expert advice received from the Department most shipments were considered to have inorganic arsenic and cadmium levels within acceptable limits and were permitted importation. Two shipments were rejected and were not permitted entry to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The Department of Community Services and Health has advised that arsenic is classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer on the basis of epidemiological evidence in situations of high natural or occupational exposure to inorganic arsenic. It has been associated with basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin as well as with a pre-neoplastic form of dermatitis, known as Bowen's disease.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The Department of Community Services and Health has advised that a Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake for inorganic arsenic in food has been established by the FAO/WHO Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants (JECFA) on the basis of toxicological data presented to it. Results of analysis for arsenic levels in food conducted as part of the Australian Market Basket Survey show levels of arsenic to be very low in the diet, well below the JECFA recommended Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake. It would therefore seem unlikely that there is an association between dietary intake of arsenic and skin carcinoma in Australia. The high incidence of skin cancer found in Australia is more likely to be associated with exposure to UV radiation in sunlight.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) I am advised that the arsenic found in fish and other marine organisms is in the form of arsenobetaine. In all of the seaweed varieties which have been analysed thus far the arsenic is in the form of arsenofuranosides.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) The Department of Community Services and Health advises that considerable evidence indicates that arsenobetaine is toxicologically inert and is excreted unchanged in both animals and humans. The evidence for the arsenofuranosides is more limited but indicates that partial metabolism to simpler organic arsenic compounds occurs followed by rapid excretion. There is no evidence of conversion to inorganic arsenic in either case and no indication of toxicity in humans.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) See answer to question 6.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) Yes, it is possible for State authorities to prohibit the sale of any foods which do not comply with State food laws.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) The purpose of introducing the imported foods scheme was to ensure that imported foods are fit/safe for human consumption and progressively foodstuffs of concern are being brought within the ambit of the sampling and testing regime. From 14 January to mid March 1991 AQIS only permitted the importation of seaweed and kelp which had been passed fit for human consumption. Since mid March, AQIS has allowed importation of these products where they comply with the interim standards for inorganic arsenic and cadmium established by the Public Health Committee.</PARA>

<PARA> Will he provide a detailed explanation of the Government's rejection of the Grains Council's submission which advocated a base price for wheat for the 1991 season.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4728" SPEAKER="Kerin The Hon J.C." NAMEID="QH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="PARKES">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government is acutely aware of the difficulties faced by wheat growers and by rural Australia generally. The severe downturn in wheat prices over the past twelve months has been caused by record world wheat crops in practically all major producing and trading countries and by the excessive subsidising practices of the European Community and the United States.</PARA>
<PARA> It is against this background that the Government gave very careful consideration to the Guaranteed Minimum Price (GMP) or so-called base price proposal of the Grains Council of Australia (GCA). It was rejected for several reasons which were detailed in a media statement I released on 26 March 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the proposal was rejected because of the production and market distortions a GMP would create, the precedence it would set and because it would not necessarily help those farmers most in need.</PARA>
<PARA> With the situation in the wool industry, and assuming a normal season, a GMP for wheat had the potential to induce substantial over-production. If this eventuated and the world market remained depressed, the Government would be in the position of having exacerbated the problem and there would be pressure to not only continue the scheme but also to provide increased national interest cover to sell the excess wheat.</PARA>
<PARA> A GMP scheme would also create additional distortions in the domestic market, with a likely massive switch from other grains to wheat causing problems for these other industries in maintaining their marketing strategies. Domestic users of wheat would be forced to pay a higher than market price. There would also be pressure from growers in other industries for a GMP scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Government's view, Australia should not attempt to enter the trade war, currently being waged by the EC and the USA, for the simple reason that Australia would be disadvantaged. Maintaining our credibility in the Uruguay Round was also a consideration in the decision. The Round offers the best hope yet Australia has of ending the damaging subsidising practices of the EC and US.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has consistently steered away from industry specific assistance and instead has targeted assistance as much as possible to the individual.</PARA>
<PARA> In the wheat industry it is clear that the problems are more of a short-term nature caused by a depression in wheat prices. While many growers are in serious financial difficulties there are also many who are managing. Evidence of this is given by the fact that when the Australian Wheat Board offered a $30 per tonne equity draw-down from the 1988-89 pool earlier this year, over $140 million was not called on by growers. ABARE figures also show that while many growers will earn a negative income this year, 25% of growers will earn over $60,000 in net farm income.</PARA>
<PARA> Given this situation, the Government believes that assistance through the Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS) is a better way of targeting assistance to those farmers who really need it. It deals even handedly to individual farming families and provides a very effective use of limited Commonwealth funds.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has therefore undertaken to increase its overall funding of the RAS from $62.45 million to up to $160 million in 1991-92. The structural adjustment component of the RAS or Part A (which includes capital restructuring and farm improvement measures) will receive $61.3 million in 1991-92. The Commonwealth's contribution to activate Part B of RAS will be $27.2 million which will provide for carry-on assistance through interest subsidies on carry-on finance for a period of two years, including the introduction of a special new provision, Debt Reconstruction with Interest Subsidies (DRIS). The balance of assistance funding is to be allocated to Part C of RAS to provide income support and re-establishment grants to farmers without prospects.</PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the Commonwealth's contributions to RAS, together with the State contribution if States provide the full amount of matching funds required for Part B and DRIS, are expected to underwrite rural borrowings to a level in excess of $1.4 billion for over 10,000 farmers. I have also indicated that total Commonwealth funding for the RAS could potentially be further increased to $220 million.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Live sheep were first traded to the Middle East region in 1959/60 with small shipments into the Persian Gulf. The trade escalated in the mid 1970's with the introduction of larger capacity ships and increased opportunities for trade with many of the Middle East countries. The expansion was generated by a demand for relatively low priced sheep to supply the expanding expatriate community within these countries, resulting in an overall trade in excess of 5 million head in 1979/80 and further expanding to a peak of 7.5 million in 1986/87.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There are currently 16 ships involved in the Australian live sheep trade to the Middle East.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Of these 16 ships 5 vessels can accommodate in excess of 100,000 head in any one consignment.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The number of days entailed in each voyage are dependent on the location of the port of loading, ship speed and the location of the port of discharge. On average the voyage lengths are between 17 and 21 days.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The principal destinations for the shipments of Australian live sheep at the present time are Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE and Oman.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Average annual mortality rates for consignments of Australian live sheep to the Middle East from 1981 to 1990 fluctuated from a high of 2.36% (1981) to a low of 1.64% (1987).</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Veterinary officers are employed on live sheep vessels in the following situations. Any vessel carrying sheep to Saudi Arabia was accompanied by a Commonwealth Government Veterinary Officer. This officer, was employed by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, to monitor the health and welfare of the consignment and prepare a supplementary health report for the Saudi quarantine authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth and State/Territory Government Veterinary Officers have also accompanied vessels on an ad hoc arrangement to undertake specific welfare and research investigations. These officers were employed by their respective Commonwealth/State/Territory Government departments. Occasionally, veterinarians may also be placed aboard the vessel by the exporter or the importer.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Canberra based veterinary staff regularly inspect feedlot and loading procedures, carry out export health inspections and, when necessary, check voyage conditions. Sheep export operations at Portland and Adelaide were reviewed in 1990 and Fremantle was reviewed in February 1991. Departmental veterinarians have also visited the Middle East (as recently as October 1990) to observe unloading and feedlot procedures at port of entry.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) &amp;(10) At the arrival in the port of destination the sheep are sold through commercial channels for slaughtering and dispersal, primarily within the country of arrival. A small percentage of sheep are slaughtered for re-consignment to other destinations, usually to cater for those countries within the immediate region that do not have adequate port facilities such as Iraq. The exact proportion of such sheep which are re-consigned as carcase or chilled meat is not available. The lack of infrastructure for handling chilled or frozen meat as well as the cultural preference for fresh meat in the market place, precludes the processing of all sheep meats in Australia. However, the volume of processed sheepmeat exported from Australia to the Middle East is expected to increase with the advent of new processing technology for chilled lamb/mutton and a predicted increased acceptance of this product within receiving countries.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Export earnings received by Australia from the export of live sheep are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 1986 $A 172.7 million</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr Dawkins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Transition from adult employment overseas to adult employment in Australia relies heavily on applying the skills and educational qualifications of the individuals concerned. The measures used to effect the transition from European to Australian employment apply equally to migrants from other regions.</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most basic issue is that of English language training. My Department currently provides over $8 million specifically for the Advanced English Program for Migrants, as well as further adult literacy and English language training opportunities which are a feature of other Government labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA> Building upon English language proficiency, the next most fundamental problem is the recognition, accreditation and application of overseas acquired skills in Australia. On 3 November 1989, I released the Government's policy statement on such issues-Migrant Skills-Improving Recognition Processes. The Statement outlined a major reform agenda in this area including</PARA>
<PARA> - establishing the cooperative development of national competency-based skill standards;</PARA>
<PARA> - improving access of skilled migrants to adequate education and training opportunities;</PARA>
<PARA> - improving information, advice and client services arrangements; and</PARA>
<PARA> - promoting relevant international developments to enhance skills recognition.</PARA>
<PARA> To coordinate implementation of this reform agenda, the National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition (NOOSR) was established in my Department in July 1989. Further, in November 1989, the Government also established the National Advisory Committee on Skills Recognition (NACSR), chaired by Sir William Keys, to provide policy advice on skills recognition issues in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> NOOSR and NACSR have a number of major achievements in employment and training of overseas trained migrants to their credit. Their activities currently range from promoting bridging courses and undertaking research into the development of national competency based standards for professions to improving assessment and accreditation arrangements and targeting employer attitudes to enhance employment prospects for migrants.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) A trust account entitled ``The National Welfare Trust Fund'' was established in 1943. Section 6 of the National Welfare Fund Act 1943 (repealed on 22 May 1985) stated that:</PARA>

<PARA> (d) Yes, the Fund's receipts exceeded its expenditures by $370 million in the period from 1943-44 to 1951-52.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) There was no relationship between the social service tax and expenditure from the Fund. As a result, Income Tax and Social Service contributions were merged into a single levy from 1 July 1950. The Act was then amended to ensure that the income of the Fund would be approximately the same as if the Social Services Contribution had remained in force. In 1952 the Act was further amended, so that the amount paid to the Fund each year (from Consolidated Revenue) was equivalent to the amount expended from it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has taken the decision to implement the Two Centre concept whereby all air traffic services (except those provided by control towers) may be supplied from two centres, planned for location in Melbourne and Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA> The CAA is currently evaluating submissions from staff and staff associations which argue for the retention of facilities to provide approach and departure services (called Terminal Control Units) at major airports. The CAA has also received proposals from other sources concerning, inter alia, the siting of the two centres.</PARA>
<PARA> The CAA has recently announced that six companies will be invited to submit registrations of interest to be selected as prime contractor for the project. The companies are Hughes, IBM, NEC, Alenia, Siemens Plessey and Thomson-CSF. No Australian companies were included as none are in the business of providing large scale air traffic systems. The CAA is also still bound by Government policies on offsets.</PARA>
<PARA> Further consultation with the industry and unions will occur as the project's planning details are refined.</PARA>
<PARA> The CAA is a Government Business Enterprise charged with operating in a commercial manner. It is appropriate for the Authority to take decisions such as this on its intended strategic direction.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government has no in principle difficulty with the proposal for an integrated air traffic control system and its key objectives of improved safety and lower costs to the aviation industry which plays such a vital role in the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The proposals do not entail any decrease in the level of aviation safety; to the contrary, they will enable Australia to experience the benefits of the best air traffic systems technology available.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Each of the two centres will be able to provide a limited back up to the other in the event of catastrophic failure. This otherwise ``spare'' capacity will be used for training in the normal course of events. If the Melbourne centre was to be disabled, Brisbane would be able to provide a service to Perth, albeit that service may be somewhat reduced from normal levels. This prospect would provide a better back up capability than presently exists in the event of destruction of the current Perth Air Traffic Services complex.</PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that Perth airport will continue to have its own Air Traffic Control Tower this will not be affected by the proposed changes.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Most of the details concerning arrangements for payments for wheat sales to Iraq are confidential to the Australian Wheat Board, the independent commercial organisation charged with responsibility for negotiating all Australian wheat export sales. The only details I am able to supply are that recent sales of wheat to Iraq have been on 2 year credit terms and supported by government guaranteed export credit insurance.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Past Australian wheat sales to Iraq on credit have been insured by the Australian Trade Commission's export finance and insurance arm, EFIC, and underwritten by the Government through the National Interest provisions of the Austrade Act, on the basis that:</PARA>
<PARA> - payments are completed over two years</PARA>
<PARA> - the Government bears 80 per cent of the risk on any default on payments (but 70 per cent for years when supplementary tonnages were approved)</PARA>
<PARA> - the Australian Wheat Board bears the remaining portion of the risk</PARA>
<PARA> - a risk premium is paid by the AWB</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Under the terms and conditions of national interest cover, claim payments are met by EFIC from funds provided by the Government after payment instalments are 4 months overdue. Under these arrangements, EFIC has already paid to the Australian Wheat Board A$146m. Funds for this purpose are provided for in Appropriation Bill No 3.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Government has decided not to compensate the wheat industry for the 20 per cent of past credit sales not insured by the Government. To ensure that exporter's properly assess the risk involved in trading with particular countries, it is the normal requirement of export credit insurance for the exporter to carry a proportion of liability in case of loss.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Commonwealth statutory marketing authorities operate in respect of the following industries: dairy, wine and brandy, honey, dried fruit, apple, pear, nashi, citrus, nursery, wheat, wool and meat and livestock (including pigs, cattle, sheep, buffalo and goats).</PARA>
<PARA> In March 1991 the Industry Commission identified the following industries as being covered by statutory marketing authorities or boards operated by one or more of the State or Territory Governments: wheat, oilseeds, peanuts, rice, navy beans, barley, grain sorghum, maize, oats, other coarse grains and grain legumes, sugar, bananas, citrus, dried fruits, wine grapes, kiwifruit, processing apples, processing tomatoes, potatoes, other fruit and vegetables, tobacco, honey, dairy, eggs, meat and livestock, poultry meat and fish.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Commonwealth statutory marketing authorities are funded by statutory levies and, with the exception of the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation, are managed along corporate lines. In each case a board of directors is responsible for determining operating procedures and is responsible for directing and monitoring the statutory marketing authority according to corporate plans approved by the Minister and annual operational plans. The boards are made up of a chairperson and government member, who are selected and appointed directly by the Minister, and five to eight nominated members appointed by the Minister following their nomination by a selection committee representative of levy payers. Nominated members are selected on the basis of a broad range of relevant qualifications and experience. In some cases the chief executive is also a board member. The boards of directors are accountable to the levy payers through a mechanism of reporting and consultation with the relevant peak industry bodies or to annual general meetings of levy payers. They are accountable to the Parliament through the Minister who must table in Parliament the annual reports of the authorities. The Australian Dried Fruits Corporation, which has not yet been fully modified along these corporate lines, will become a product Board under the Australian Horticultural Corporation on 1 July. The Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 has recently been amended to allow for semi-autonomous product boards. Further action being taken by the Government to increase the accountability of the authorities to their levy payers and to provide them with increased managerial autonomy was outlined in my media release of 18 October 1990.</PARA>

<PARA> (3) To date no tender has been successful. The Department was unsuccessful in its bid to CSIRO and in the joint venture bid to provide IT Bureau services to the Australian Customs Service. The decisions about the other bids have, as yet, to be finalised.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Department provides a wide range of services, including information technology, primarily to clients in the Australian Government. The services are provided within a framework of value for money. There has been a progressive introduction of open competition based on full costs and accrual accounting. The Government decided on this approach in 1988 following a major review of common services, and already cost reductions in excess of $150m per annum have been achieved, with more in prospect.</PARA>

<PARA>Note: Provision for the Australia Prize award ($320,000) would normally be included in the Awareness Program budget. No amount was allocated in 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. (a) The Science and Technology Awareness Program published the first edition of the Australian Science and Technology Communicators Register in late 1990. The Register lists 375 people and 191 projects in science and technology communication. (b) The production cost was $5,500. (c) The full cost would comprise production cost and staff component. It is difficult to estimate the cost of Awareness Section staff resources utilised. One ASO4 officer spent a significant proportion of time on the Register over a 4 month period but was also heavily involved in the associated S&amp; communicators conference and other Awareness Program projects. Other officers had a minor input to the Register. (d) (i) No. (ii) Yes. The Register was produced from responses to a call in the national press. Despite considerable effort, many did not respond: it is therefore not comprehensive. Nevertheless almost one quarter of the entries are of print and electronic media representatives, including many prominent players: Beyond (2000) Productions, Australian Financial Review, New Scientist, ABC TV and Radio, Nine Network, Reuters etc. The second edition of the Register is expected to be published in late 1991 and efforts will be made to ensure registration of non-respondents to the first edition.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) Yes. The Awareness Program's financial contribution was $250,000. In 1990-91, the Science and Technology Awareness Program entered an agreement with the ABC to jointly fund a prime-time TV documentary to explore the relationships between science and technology, research and development and the international competitiveness of Australian industry, recognising the strength of the national basic research effort. The resulting program, entitled ``Sheer Genius'', was broadcast on ABC TV on Wednesday, 20 March 1991. The ABC has had an overwhelmingly positive response to the screening, including congratulatory phone calls and letters from scientific and business community leaders and requests for copies of the program. The total estimated audience in the capital cities for ``Sheer Genius'' was 576,000. (b) Departmental staff provided technical advice and assistance to the ABC, which was available without incurring additional costs to the Department. As with the S&amp; Communicators Register, it would be difficult to separate the staff hours committed to this project from other projects. However, relatively limited hours were needed to successfully implement this project. (c) Accordingly it is not possible to cost the staff component.</PARA>
