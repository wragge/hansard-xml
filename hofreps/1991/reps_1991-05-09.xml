<PARA>That we, the undersigned, call for the full and total recognition by Federal Parliament and the High Court and all government agencies that Australia is a Christian Commonwealth according to law and its heritage traditions and customs.</PARA>
<PARA>That as Australia prepares for the Centenary of Federation on 1st January, 2001 AD, we celebrate our Centenary as a Christian Commonwealth as described by the Founders of Federation such as Sir John Downer, who said ``The Commonwealth will be from its first stage a Christian Commonwealth'' and as stated in our Federal Constitution-``humbly relying upon the Blessings of Almighty God . . .

<TITLE>Rights of the Child</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>1. that ratification of United Nations Conventions, such as the above, by the Federal Government, without Parliamentary debate or consultation with the people through a referendum, is a gross abuse of the Australian Constitution and is contrary to democratic principles;</PARA>
<PARA>2. that the Convention's philosophy of parent/child relationships is based on a false premise and embodies the totalitarian principles of State ownership of children;</PARA>
<PARA>3. that the Christian principle of parental authority is essential for the proper functioning of society, but phrases in the Convention implying parents' rights are virtually meaningless, with escape clauses permitting the widest of interpretation;</PARA>
<PARA>4. that Articles 12 to 16 giving children the right to seek, think, say and be whatever, where ever and with whom they wish violates the common sense of any normal parent;</PARA>
<PARA>5. that some Articles contradict other Articles and imprecise wording adds to the confusion by providing loopholes for the protection of paedophiles and certain types of child traffickers;</PARA>
<PARA>6. that some of the proposed rights are inappropriate for immature child minds and have no logical connection with the protection of children from abuse or deprivation, such protection being already provided by existing Australian laws.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislate or provide for:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) a twelve month Moratorium on the ratification of the Convention to enable the people of Australia to discuss and examine in detail the 54 Articles;</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of certain Woolgrowers and Citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the fact that despite the large amount of wool growers spent on wool promotion by the IWS, performance fell far short of what could be reasonably expected. A continual declining market share for wool fibre is not acceptable and it has become obvious that the IWS must be abandoned and an immediate focus given to the promotion of Australian wool. If we are to promote the uniqueness of our wool type then it follows that we should be guarding as well as we are able the genetic material that contributes to this uniqueness.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> We, the citizens of Australia, wish to bring to your attention our objections to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act, 1989. Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior therapeutic goods and devices, the Regulations will have the effect of putting out of business many natural therapists and small scale manufacturers of natural remedies. The clauses in the Regulations which purport to exempt Homoeopaths and Herbalists are badly drafted and the prohibition on advertising will make it impossible for Australians to use natural medicines. The Regulations therefore, represent a fundamental attack on the Australian people's freedom of choice in medicine.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on literacy needs in the workplace was tabled in the Parliament on 14 March 1991. As I finished speaking I was in the process of castigating another member of the Committee, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson). I would like to pick up from that point by quoting him. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In my opinion, the minority report represents a naive and superficial approach to the process of identifying and reacting to teaching methodology issues. </PARA>
<PARA>We who signed the dissenting report were accused by the honourable member for Moreton in his contribution of being driven by ideological dogma rather than by credible evidence. He suggested that the minority report should be ignored.</PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that, far from being ignored, the minority report that this Committee brought down has received wide recognition and, indeed, acclaim. In many ways, this was simply because it turned out to be the most important part of the report. It is the most important part of the report because it focuses on one of the most important issues. As it turns out, although the minority report deals with teaching standards in particular, it has in fact been acclaimed by many teachers. The report was featured prominently in my local paper and a number of teachers, including senior teachers, who contacted me actually agreed with it. The plain fact is that many experienced, longstanding teachers are very uneasy about the way numeracy and literacy are being taught in our school system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was essentially charged under its terms of reference with considering literacy in the workplace. Our report concluded that more than one million adults are functionally illiterate in Australia at this time. Thirty-five per cent of that one million are actually native English speakers. This is clearly an indication that for many people, for one reason or another, there was an inadequacy in their initial school education. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many people-the honourable member for Moreton, as a former primary school teacher, is obviously among them-who would be satisfied to blame the students for that inadequacy. I believe, and those of us who signed the dissenting report believe, that there is adequate evidence to suggest that teachers may also be partly to blame. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it very clear that by this statement I am not engaging in teacher bashing in any way whatsoever. I believe that we need to give greater recognition to the importance, particularly, of primary school teaching. In many ways, the primary school teacher is the most important person in a young student's life after his or her parents. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent statements made by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) which were reported in the press-that teacher salaries should be much higher-should be seen in the context of the recognition that we on this side of the House believe should be given to the teaching profession. Yet the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) stood up in this place yesterday and made light of the suggestion. He talked about the possibility of bigger classes and the additional costs that would be involved, but he failed to see the point that the honourable member for Bennelong was making. I suppose that only accentuates the failures that we see in other areas of his administration of his Department. The point is that we need better teachers, and we will only get better teachers when the value of the teaching profession is given the recognition it deserves. The statement by the honourable member for Bennelong needs to be seen only in that particular context. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that literacy and numeracy are actually moving targets. I was very pleased to receive from the Australian Council for Adult Literacy a paper entitled A National Adult Literacy Strategy. Very correctly, it makes these points:</PARA>
<PARA>For an advanced technological society such as Australia, the goal is an active literacy which allows people to use language to enhance their capacity to think, create and question, in order to participate effectively in society. </PARA>
<PARA>I underline a further point:</PARA>
<PARA>The literacy and numeracy needs of society are changing so rapidly that there must be ongoing opportunities for adults in the home, community, workplace, institution and classroom. </PARA>
<PARA>We cannot escape the fact, no matter how hard we might want to because it is embarrassing or difficult to come to grips with, that numeracy and literacy are the foundation upon which all further training and education are built. It is a fact that 70 per cent of those who will be in the work force in the year 2000 have already left school. This demands a response from both government and industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The costs of this illiteracy are in the billions and billions of dollars through reduced productivity in the workplace, but the benefits of addressing and redressing the problem are equally measurable in the billions of dollars. It will be a shared responsibility between the community, government and industry, and industry accepts that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental issue that we cannot escape, and I refer here to the minority report, is to make sure that it is not still happening in schools. To the extent that people have left school now, and I underline the fact that 70 per cent of those who will be in the work force in the year 2000 have already left school, the problem will have to be fixed, but let us make sure that the problem is not being perpetuated in schools now. That is why, contrary to what the honourable member for Moreton said, the minority report was important, because it focused attention specifically on the issue of literacy and numeracy standards in schools today. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very pleased to read in News Weekly a couple of weeks ago an article by Mary Helen Woods. She made some very poignant statements about the report, and particularly addressed the issues raised in the minority report. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> An essential first step would be to introduce nation-wide standardised testing of students with the co-operation of both parents and teachers. </PARA>
<PARA>That, in a sense, was the hub of the minority report-that we wanted to see that sort of approach to making sure the problem was not continuing. We also addressed in the minority report our concern about the standards of teaching, and the same author makes this comment:</PARA>
<PARA> Standards of primary school teaching will not improve until the teacher's colleges raise their entry qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA>We believe, and I just want to underline what we have said in recent days, that teachers' pay and conditions need to be improved, and their status in the community needs to be lifted to attract better applicants to the teaching profession. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be associated with the tabling of the report on literacy needs in the workplace Words at Work by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. In doing so, I acknowledge the astute stewardship of the chairperson of the Committee, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), and especially the leadership of the chairperson of the subcommittee, the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen), who is in the House this morning. I also acknowledge the members of the Committee and especially those on the subcommittee. The secretariat was ably led by John Cummins, as was the subcommittee by Bronwen Worthington.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Literacy is the ability to receive and transmit messages. It includes non-verbal communication and the ability to apply critical thinking. Receiving skills are reading and listening. Transmitting skills are writing and speaking. Numeracy, cultural knowledge and the ability to access information complement those transmitting and receiving skills. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to underscore the importance of the report's recommendations nor its important acknowledgment and recognition of lifelong learning in a rapidly changing, information-based and technologically driven world. However, I do wish to emphasise particularly the intent of recommendation 17, which concerns early intervention, and the intent of recommendation 18 that all students leaving school should be literate. But before doing so, the following background information is, I believe, relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1980 the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) conducted a literacy survey of 10-year-olds and 14-year-olds in Australian schools. The total test was mastered by 71 per cent of the 10-year-olds and 83 per cent of the 14-year-olds. ACER had conducted a similar national survey in 1975. There was no significant area in which student performance at either age level declined in those five years. However, the report pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA>While some will wish to emphasise the high proportions of students who could do most tasks, others will be most concerned about the educational and social consequences for the students who are unable to do some tasks. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the emphasis placed on literacy by schools, the number of adults who have difficulty accomplishing everyday literacy tasks is unacceptably high. </PARA>
<PARA> The first national survey of adult literacy was conducted in 1989. Perhaps that shows some measure of the concern of this country about literacy. That report No Single Measure found that at least 10 per cent of the adult population-more than one million adults-are estimated to be functionally illiterate in English in terms of the demands of contemporary Australian society. About 700,000 of those people are, in fact, of English-speaking background and about 300,000 of non-English-speaking background. Some of the latter group may have been able to speak English with some fluency, but were unable to complete everyday reading and writing tasks in English accurately. The alarming cost to the nation of those functionally illiterate Australians has been estimated at $3.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is no doubt that the starting point to remedy literacy problems lies in our education system. The Committee report quoted the Harrison submission, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>An adult with literacy problems has first been a child with literacy problems.</PARA>
<PARA>Some members of the Committee have previously acknowledged that over 90 per cent of people in our prisons are illiterate and that the cost of people in prisons is $140,000 a year. Their lack of skills is directly related to poor literacy. The result is violence, drug reliance, crime and anti-social behaviour, et cetera, because they cannot resolve conflict, participate positively in our society or communicate effectively at the lowest or the most simple level. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in my mind that schooling between the ages of seven and 11 is the most powerful single determinant of future success in literacy or anything else for that matter. Yet, if we were to examine the resources that are available to state and private primary schools in this nation, we could not be anything but alarmed if we compared those resources with the resources given to secondary, technical and further education (TAFE) or higher education sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting that the resources to secondary schools, TAFE and higher education are inappropriate. What I am very strongly suggesting-in fact, I want to scream about it to everyone in this nation-is that in primary schools we have got the fundamentals very wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Take the following example of two schools-one primary and one secondary-with exactly the same enrolment of 430 students. I have always believed that in this country something magic happens at Christmas time. One year kids need one set of resources; six weeks later a new set of resources is needed. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3J4">Mr SAWFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is absolutely marvellous. It explains a lot of things about how education is organised in this country. Take the year 1988, the State of South Australia and two schools-one primary and one secondary-with 430 students each. On a comparative basis, the secondary school has 170 per cent more basic staff-not counting the add-ons-a ratio of 34 : 20; 400 per cent more senior staff, 8 : 2; 225 per cent more ancillary staff; 500 per cent more base State government grant; and 244 per cent more per capita State government grant. Teachers in a secondary school have a minimum of 250 per cent more preparation time than teachers in a primary school. Unlike teachers in a secondary school, primary school teachers are responsible for all the curriculum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the magic educational rationale for that huge differential in the allocation of those resources? There is not one. There has never been one. If there is one, it contains no substance at all. Those allocations reflect power-the power of higher education, TAFE and, to a lesser extent, the secondary education sector and the impotence and weakness of representation from the primary sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I assure the House that, if one continues those comparisons between the allocation of resources to primary schools, TAFE and higher education, the figures are even more dramatic. I have taught in all those levels and I know what it is like to teach in them. The demands put on a primary school teacher are greater than those on a secondary school teacher and certainly much greater than those on a TAFE or higher education lecturer. </PARA>
<PARA> Resources allocated to our nation's primary schools force the fundamental organisational practice of one teacher and a class of 30 kids for a year. That practice is seriously flawed, as anyone who has any knowledge of education knows. In 25 years in schools, I have never seen one primary teacher able to fulfil the expectations of a contemporary educational program. It is impossible. It is a rather stupid and silly expectation. That is not to have a crack at primary teachers who are, without doubt, amongst the best and most hardworking teachers in the country. It is merely stating what ought to be obvious and what apparently is not obvious. The expectations society puts on primary teachers are impossible to fulfil. The representation given them by bureaucrats, union leaders and governments alike is, to this stage, totally inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> In recommendation 17 and indirectly in recommendation 18, the Committee has, quite rightly, made a strong case for early intervention. It is totally unacceptable that between one million and 1.8 million of a population of some 17 million Australians are functionally illiterate. In a nation that has as its greatest challenge the need to be internationally competitive, it is totally unacceptable that between $3.5 billion and possibly $6.5 billion is lost in productivity because of basic literacy problems. Not only do we need to catch up with the clever countries like Japan and Germany; we also need to create an edge to get in front. It is not good enough just to catch up. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations in the report suggest a wide course of actions, but the key to the successful implementation of those recommendations will be the urgent need to address the largely unmet needs of the foundation stone of our education system, the Australian primary school. Unless those needs are met, all attempts at redressing this nation's literacy problems will be wrongly focused and the results will be highly marginalised. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very pleasing to have the opportunity to continue my remarks on the report on the review of student financial assistance by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, which was tabled on 11 April 1991. On that occasion we did run out of time so I am pleased that the Selection Committee has allowed us a little extra time today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As indicated in my brief contribution on that day, I believe that this report has thoroughly canvassed the issues surrounding student financial assistance and has made recommendations which are worthy of consideration and implementation by the Government. The submissions received covered a wide range of issues but only a few of those submissions were actually opposed to the concept of student financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The main issues covered in the submission included the complexity of the program; eligibility criteria, particularly relating to independent status; income and assets testing; differences between Austudy and the Department of Social Security rates of payment; assistance for rural students; apparent payment of benefits to those who could well support the costs of their own education; payment to students with little interest in staying at school; delays in processing and answering inquiries; and the provision of incorrect information by Department of Employment, Education and Training staff. As you will gather from that list, some of the areas covered were not only very contentious but also very important in the context of the population's understanding of Austudy and the credibility of that payment in the community.</PARA>
<PARA> In its evidence to the Committee, the National Union of Students stated that one of the basic problems in any historical overview of the Commonwealth's financial support to students was that there has never really been a comprehensive statement by the Commonwealth as to what the policy intentions were for either the tertiary education assistance scheme-TEAS-or Austudy. It appears, however, that when the program was established, its intention was to meet basic living expenses. I point to paragraph 2.2 on page 11 of the report where it says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister when introducing the student assistance legislation in 1973 observed that student allowances ought to be sufficient to give students the leisure to think as they pursued their studies. </PARA>
<PARA>The union also observed that the scheme gradually changed from one of supplying full income support to one of income support which was to be supplemented by the parents and/or part time work. I am sure that the House will realise that, in that change, we have removed in some instances the capacity for students to have the leisure to think, which was one of the things the Minister wanted in the beginning, and we have given some advantage to people whose parents are in a position to assist them financially. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the stated objective of the Austudy program is to overcome financial barriers to continuation of secondary and tertiary education by providing income support to financially disadvantaged students undertaking full time studies. Specific program goals are to increase overall retention rates in the post-compulsory secondary school years, participation rates in tertiary education, and higher education participation rates of the financially disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> In its evidence to the Committee, however, the Department of Employment, Education and Training believed that the aim of improving access to education was almost certainly being met. Unfortunately, much of the data relating to the socioeconomic mix is now dated and it is difficult to ascertain whether this is in fact the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Participation rates in all education sectors are increasing and, in fact, accelerated following the introduction of Austudy in 1987, so it would appear that Austudy has assisted to some extent in keeping people at school and in education. All governments are currently working towards achieving a year 12 retention rate of 65 per cent by 1992. In recent years, Australia has experienced rapidly increasing year 12 retention and completion rates and increases in secondary and tertiary participation rates. This is no accident, of course. As the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, would be aware, the Government has had a very strong thrust in this area of keeping people in education and providing education opportunities when they required them. </PARA>
<PARA> Year 12 retention rates have increased from the pre-Austudy figure of 48.7 per cent in 1986 to 60.3 per cent in 1989. If this trend continues it is expected that the Government's goal of achieving a 65 per cent retention rate by 1992 will be met. Another indicator of the relative effectiveness of Austudy in achieving its objectives of improving educational outcomes is the estimated year 12 completion rate. The overall completion rate has increased substantially between 1984 and 1989, from 43 per cent to 58 per cent. These completion rates are clearly increasing for each socioeconomic status level. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that in 1991 about 42 per cent of tertiary students and 36 per cent of secondary students will be assisted under Austudy. In 1990, 46.5 per cent of tertiary students and 40 per cent of secondary students were on the full allowance. The improvement in retention rates in high schools to year 12 is one example of the effective use of Austudy, but even that has been questioned to some degree because people do not always understand the environment in which student financial assistance operates. For instance, a study conducted by the Institute of Family Studies into youth incomes and living costs found that it was not clear whether Austudy acted as an incentive to young people to remain at school but thought that it certainly assisted low income families to maintain their children at school. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institute concluded that Austudy did not appear to be an incentive to young people to return to education, particularly those young people who perhaps need that opportunity most-those who had left school before the completion of secondary education. The Institute's view, while valid, overlooks the fact that Austudy for post-compulsory secondary students, those over the age of 16 in years 11 and 12, was not meant to be an incentive; rather, it was meant to remove the pre-existing financial disincentive presented by the existence of unemployment benefit for which many 16-year-olds from low income families would have been eligible. </PARA>
<PARA> The choice, therefore, was one between continuing on at school with no financial assistance and leaving school and receiving unemployment benefit. To its credit, the Government recognised this quandary and dealt with it by means of an age related payment which equated the level of unemployment benefit. In other words, it was a balancing act which the Government was endeavouring to perform. </PARA>
<PARA> It is imperative that eligibility for Austudy be simplified and that its relevance to the watershed decision of whether or not to continue with education be increased by making it more realistic as a mainstay of income support. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen), said that the report on student financial assistance was worthy of consideration. I want to place a stronger emphasis on it; this report is very important in enabling the Parliament to look at the area of student financial assistance. I come to this debate not as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training but as a person who is interested in education and has read the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that in this day and age, when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) says that we need to become a clever country, this report has some very poignant points to make to whoever is administering education at the Federal level. When I read this report I found that there were some quite significant-in fact, very important-recommendations. They are to be found right at the beginning of the report. I want to preface my remarks by saying that the role of a Minister in this Parliament is to ensure that there is good management of the programs under his administration. The first recommendation of the report was:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government develop clear policy objectives for student financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had student financial assistance since 1973 in this country and it appears to me on reading this report that still, 18 years later and at a cost of $1.1 billion a year, we do not have clear objectives for the expenditure of this money. I regard it as totally unacceptable that we are managing $1.1 billion of taxpayers' money without clear objectives. I say that particularly in the climate we are facing in this country at the moment. We are going through tough financial and economic conditions. I believe that money really has been squandered in this area because of a lack of clear objectives as to what we were trying to do-what the Government, and previous governments, were trying to do in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> It behoves all of us to take note of this report and ensure in the future that there are clear objectives, so that recommendation No. 2 of this policy can also be put in place. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Employment, Education and Training develop performance indicators in line with the Government's policy objectives . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If there are no clear objectives there cannot be clear performance indicators, and if there are no clear performance indicators the third recommendation of determining the effectiveness of this program cannot be achieved. This is the crunch of this report. It is really saying that whoever is the Minister for education in this country really has to get a handle on this program and ensure that it is effective. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Auditor-General's report which inquired into the effectiveness of Austudy. On reading that report I found that in a couple of areas it refers to the number of times that overpayments were made. Here is a scheme put in place to assist young people in their education, but we find that between 12 and 27 per cent of students receiving assistance under different schemes were overpaid in 1988. It is unacceptable that in up to 27 per cent of cases students were paid more than they were due. One might ask: how can that sort of thing happen? There will always be some mistakes in public administration, but not 27 per cent of the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I can say from personal experience with the number of young people-and parents, in particular-who have come to me in regard to Austudy and pointed out the mumbo jumbo that has come back from the Department that it is absolutely incredible. I would need two hours to go through two or three of those instances in this Parliament and show the House the reams of paper. It takes hours and hours to make sense of it. Yet here we have a very large program trying to assist our young people-as I said, over $1 billion is being spent in this program-but we do not know whether it is being effective. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Committee. I think it has done an excellent job. I commend the Committee because it has really hit at the heart of the recommendations which this Government and future governments need to look at in regard to student assistance. Certainly, in respect of many of our young people from the regional parts of Australia there is no equity with regard to getting into tertiary education. Compared with urban children, I think only about one-third get through to tertiary education, and that is a great tragedy in this country. There is a need for assistance, but our responsibility in this Parliament is to ensure that that amount of money which we allocate is effective in getting the maximum number of young people into education where they need assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous speaker, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who took a great interest in this report, I understand, regards it as a damning indictment of the Minister. Having read through it and thought about it, it is, really. Whoever had been administering this-and it would not have mattered if it had been somebody on the coalition side-if this report came out, it would be a damning indictment of the person who had the responsibility in the Federal Parliament for $1.1 billion. Yet we still do not have clear objectives and we do not have performance indicators to tell whether this program is being effective. We cannot measure whether it is being effective. </PARA>
<PARA> Because we have lacked that clarity of thinking in this area, I believe there will now be young people in this country who have missed out and who will miss out on financial assistance for their education because the administration of this area has been slack. I think that is a great tragedy. We do need to improve our human resource base in this country so that we can be competitive in world markets and so that we can be a productive country. But the essence of being productive is to develop our young people. </PARA>
<PARA> In the previous debate here one of the honourable members from South Australia was saying that it is important that we ensure that people get a good education in primary schools. There is absolutely no doubt about that. It is a great tragedy that many people are functionally illiterate. It is partly-and largely-due to what happens in the first two or three years of education in this country of ours. In this area, unfortunately, there have not been those clear objectives, there have not been effective ways of testing whether the goals have been achieved and, as a consequence, there will be young people who should have had financial assistance in this country who have missed out. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless we take note of some of these reports which have these very serious recommendations to make to us, then I do not believe as a parliament we will effectively address some of these areas we are faced with. This is about education; it is about financial assistance. I ask the Government to look at this report very seriously and do something about it so that the money which is provided is targeted more effectively and so that the system is run more efficiently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your cooperation in making it possible for me to speak this morning. I am pleased to stand and talk about the report The Injured Coastline, and I will be followed by my colleague the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) who I know has similar interests in these matters. This is a very important report for Australia. It is to the credit of the Committee chairperson, the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) and her predecessor, the former honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton), who have had this as one of their priorities over the years. I would also commend colleagues on the Committee and the secretariat for the work they did. It is a very impressive piece of work, and it is not a subject that is easily encompassed in such a report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps that is the way I shall lead into my remarks today. How do we understand the problem of coastal management in Australia? The best way to describe it is by saying that some 90 per cent of Australians use the coast each year. Many of us, of course, live quite close to the coast, as do I-some 800 metres from the Indian Ocean. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) lives quite close to the coast as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just list some of the uses made of coastal areas: swimming, surfing, windsurfing, boating, fishing, transport, sadly, for dumping sewage in, stormwater, the development of marinas, canal developments, sand mining, hotel developments and, more recently of course, those pernicious things called jet skis. They are just some of the uses made of the coastal area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is little wonder that the pressure upon certain coastal regions is extreme. Many of those uses are conflicting uses. We do find from time to time, for example, there are conflicts between people who want to use an area for swimming or surfing and, as I commented, for jet skis. At times jet skis will come in quite dangerously and intrude into areas used for swimming and surfing. </PARA>
<PARA> My local shire, the City of Stirling, has a lot of problems in managing that, because it has no control. To its credit, it would really like to prohibit jet skis from the surf beaches, such as Trigg Point and Scarborough, but cannot do so. Because jet skis qualify as a boats, they are able to get into the ocean and it is very difficult to manage them; and now they are one of the real problems we are encountering on the coast. </PARA>
<PARA> An example of the problem of management of coastal regions can be provided by looking no further than Scarborough, the major surf beach in my area, where difficulties have arisen because a very high rise hotel has been created. I was not opposed to moderate development at Scarborough, but the creation of a very high rise hotel-and I said this before the matter was dealt with in terms of building-puts very large numbers of people into an area where there are already large population pressures. From a planning point of view, it is bad to engender such conflict of use for a major surfing beach, because it happens to be a major surfing beach, and so there is engendered conflict in use, which is a bad way to do planning. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many issues-and they are going to be addressed later, incidentally, in terms of the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters-but the fact is that the conflicts which have developed in Scarborough have developed because of piecemeal planning: there was no overall management. This is interesting because, generally speaking, the City of Stirling has been very good with its coastal management: it has had a coastal management plan and it has tried to work to it. Unfortunately, however, that Scarborough special beach development zone has tended to fall outside its coastal management pattern and, as a consequence, there is the absurdity-many people who come to Perth think it is absurd-of this very large hotel right on the beach front, when there could have been a moderately sized hotel which would have still met the purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> In talking about coastal management we also need to look at marina development, and I instance Hillarys Marina. It is interesting that in many respects it is now a white elephant. It is a white elephant financially, and many people have gone broke over the place, because in fact it was too large. What was needed was a series of boat ramps for people to get their boats into the water in the northern suburbs of Perth. There did not necessarily need to be a deep-keel area in which people could, so to speak, moor their boats. It was not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Something like 90 per cent of the boats that were owned in metropolitan Perth were owned in that area around Dalkeith, Swanbourne, Nedlands, Cottesloe, et cetera. Interestingly, if a marina had been required, it probably would have been better near the Cottesloe groyne. One can imagine the outcry there. </PARA>
<PARA> In many senses it was a fault of planning. One of the difficulties, as a consequence, is that we are getting this pattern in Western Australia of marina development proposals which cause enormous trouble. Where there is a high energy coastline, such as there is in metropolitan Perth, and sand is being moved up and down the coast, putting up marinas and groynes willy-nilly will cause all sorts of problems, including siltation. There is now a major siltation problem at Trigg Point, which used to be a very popular surfing spot. It is still very popular, but the surf is no longer very good because Trigg Point in fact is silted up; and it is very difficult to get a good clean wave over the reef any more because there is sand underneath it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not had the full hydrological studies done, but I think that, if we were to look at studies before we made these moves, we would begin to wonder whether it was always wise to undertake these developments. As I pointed out, I think that one of the real difficulties is that, if developments go ahead willy-nilly, there are these sorts of side effects. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area that has to be addressed is the question of canal developments. They have become very popular in Australia. If we face rising sea levels-and many of these canal developments, of course, by definition, are only slightly above high water levels-there really is a difficulty in terms of future security if there is a rise in the sea level. There is no way in which enough barriers can be built to protect the canal development if there is in fact a rise in the ocean level. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that we need a management system to deal with jet skis in terms of modern beaches. I have found very few people who at some stage have not found them to be inconvenient. The surf clubs in my area complain of them; the fishing people complain of them; the surfers and windsurfers complain of them. They are really a high energy vehicle, being used often within close proximity of more passive activities that usually have no exhaust effects and no sound effects. Surfing and windsurfing are quiet activities. There is a problem that has to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very impressed by the attempts of local groups, including beach inspectors, to ensure that we do not have conflicts between surfing, windsurfing and swimming. They are trying to get areas of beach allocated for those activities. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to another matter, which occurs in the area of the honourable member for Forrest-the proposals for resort developments at both Dunsborough and Prevally Park. I hesitate to interfere in somebody else's electorate, but I am concerned by the obsession of developers who say that they must have immediate access to the coastline. We can have developments, but they do not have to have immediate access to the coastline; they do not have to have a private beach as such. This is the great fallacy we must challenge continually. People do not necessarily have to be opposed to development, but there does not have to be a private beach to go along with it; developers can come back from the coastline. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have to say to our developers is that we are not blind in opposition to development, but, if they say they want a private beach by locking off some coastline, the answer to that proposal from me is, `No, you do not'. The coastline should be a popular resource, a community resource. It is not something that can be privately acquired. I have mentioned previously the difficulty we have with private ownership of coastal areas such as surfing beaches. Three Bears, which is up from Yallingup, is privately owned. It is to the credit of the Department of Conservation and Land Management and the owner that we have not had difficulties with that being closed off, but we may have to have a protocol where these things are gazetted in future. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter is the difficulty that arises in relation to ocean pollution. One of the big problems is the disposal of bait straps and plastic bait bags by people in the crayfishing industry, and there is massive ocean pollution. I call upon that industry to address its responsibilities in this area. I am sketching out a number of issues that I think highlight the importance of this report. It talks about national responsibilities, working with State and local governments to improve coastal management. I am sure that everyone in Australia shares the view that we need a proper approach to coastal management. We can overcome many of these things that I refer to here in a very sensible way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great pleasure in speaking to the report entitled The Injured Coastline. Being on the committee that produced the report, the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, was one of the highlights for me in the 25 years since I was first elected to the Australian Parliament in 1966. When we talk of environment and actions that need to be taken to overcome the problems which now present themselves, we should never lose sight of the fact that many violations were committed unwittingly. Whether they were committed unwittingly or not, as members of this Parliament we should not shrink from the requirement to see that these problems are resolved. At the same time, we as environmentalists of fair and reasonable nature should see to it that those people and those far sighted corporations which have taken action are duly recognised as having done so. We must see that carping criticism plays no part in the environmental debate which will continue as long as humans occupy this planet Earth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report before the House is a particularly comprehensive, fascinating and informative document, as has been noted by other speakers in this debate. As my colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) remarked, it is also an eminently readable document. I recommend to anyone who has a little more than a passing interest in environment matters to get themselves a copy and browse through some of the major recommendations and some of the more anecdotal pieces. It certainly helps to put a national perspective on this issue. It is an approach which has been sorely needed for some time. Australia has, after all, one of the single largest coastlines of any nation-some 36,735 kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a coastline which faces major problems in terms of erosion, pollution, degradation and inadequate management. Coastal pollution is a problem which has yet to be meaningfully tackled at the national level. As the Chairman, the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh), said in her speech, as long ago as 1970 the then Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution observed that the discharge of sewage and industrial wastes into the sea and coastal waterways was the major cause of water pollution in Australia. It was at this time that I spoke on the matter of coastal pollution for the first time in the Parliament. I can remember advising members of the House, of whom very few remain in the Parliament, that it was not aesthetically pleasing to share a wave with what was technically called solid waste. I am pleased to tell the House that this is no longer the case at the Cronulla beaches. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason that, after a very long time of involvement in the problem of coastal pollution, I welcome the report now being discussed. It must be regarded as a first step not only for the present Commonwealth Government but for all other governments well into the future. The Parliament must recognise the important responsibility it has to the Australian community in playing a crucial and decisive role in the preservation, control, use and rehabilitation of this vitally important national resource. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I go any further I want to take time to congratulate the chairmanship of the Committee: Peter Milton, no longer in this place, on his having started the investigation; and the present Chairman, the honourable member for Phillip, on being the driving force in bringing this report to its successful conclusion. Like the Chairman, I have been on this inquiry since its inception. In congratulating the Chairman, I would also like to congratulate the staff not only on their unremitting efforts in preparing the report but also on their unrelenting labours to see that we had as many members of the Committee as possible present at all of the venues we went to around the whole nation and in every State. </PARA>
<PARA> The report has been almost two years in the making. It having been made over the life of two parliaments, one must pay tribute to Ian Dunsdon, and particularly to David Crawford. As the Chairman said, the excellent work of the whole secretariat is the reason we have such a good report. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also an apposite and timely document, as not only have we seen a burgeoning public interest in all matters environmental in recent times, but for those of us who have been concerned for conservation and protection all our lives it is equally significant that this burgeoning interest has brought with it a community concern for solutions to be found and effective action to be taken by all levels of government. For any person in public life to ignore the necessities and responsibilities attaching to this generation is a dereliction of duty in providing for the well-being of future generations. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I would like to praise the work that has not only been considered but also been achieved by the present Minister for the Environment in the Greiner Government, the Hon. Tim Moore. Only two weeks ago in my own electorate of Cook the Environment Minister dedicated a further 78 hectares of marshlands at Towra Point in Botany Bay south. Not only does this realise a long term ambition of mine, it also provides a rare photo opportunity for the Minister and me standing in, and almost under, the marshlands at low tide. We must then hope that the action taken by the Greiner Liberal Government will act as a forerunner to action which should be taken by all other Ministers in Australia having this responsibility. I include everyone in that position in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Having spoken about nearly being swamped by the marshlands in my own electorate, I would be quite wrong if I did not mention the incredible number and variety of sewage plants which we not only visited but entered as well. I have never served on a committee in this place over the last 25 years which examined the outflow of sewage systems more than we did. I am sure all members of the Committee who went on these visits will congratulate each other on this aspect of the investigation. I resisted the temptation on all occasions to drink the water that was offered as being pure at these places. </PARA>
<PARA> There are 19 conclusions and recommendations in this report. I do not intend in the short time available to each speaker to list these conclusions and recommendations, but I do say to colleagues in this Parliament that they would do well to read these recommendations. I mean all members of the Parliament in all parties. </PARA>
<PARA> It cannot be denied that we have allowed the honourable member for Phillip some tolerance and poetic licence in her description of Bondi. There is no question that Bondi is the best known Australian beach in the world. I know she will permit me the same poetic licence to say that the Cronulla beaches, which just happen to be in the electorate of Cook, are as naturally beautiful as any beach in an urban area anywhere on our planet. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member interjects; I suggest he reads the report. I could go on, but time is running on and the Chairman's indulgence must be wearing thin about my talking of Cronulla all the time. However, I would like to stress to the House that it is the care and concern that the honourable member has for her beaches and the care and concern I have for my beaches have made us as one in raising the problem of beach pollution with some degree of success. That is not merely because these beaches affect places of beauty, but also because without the care that has been, and is being, given to them-such as that given by the Greiner Government in New South Wales-to make them healthy and safe for all, the vast number of Australians could not enjoy spending their leisure hours in these particular coastal waters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The title of the report The Injured Coastline says it all. The Australian coastline has been injured most grievously by both nature and mankind. As this report concludes, and as I shall end my speech, considered, serious and fair dinkum action must now take place to overcome the injuries we know to exist. I also thank the Standing Committee of this House for having been aware of this need and for having been generous in allowing debate on this report to have such an extended time in this House. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) deplores the appalling abuse of the Kurds in Iraq by Saddam Hussein and his military;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) notes that the UN Security Council resolution on the ceasefire did not include provisions to protect minorities in Iraq;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) regrets that the Australian Government failed to lobby for the inclusion of such provisions; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) urges the UN Security Council to take such action as is necessary to end this human tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA>We have all been shocked in recent weeks by the spectre of people in flight from an oppressive regime. They flee from a regime that has sought to subjugate them totally and brutally over the course of many years. Since 1975 four out of every five Kurdish villages in Iraq have been levelled, forcing some 300,000 Kurds into the southern deserts of Iraq. Over 4,000 traditional Kurdish settlements, many with mosques and churches of historical significance, have been destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> In its 1988 report Amnesty International said that the killing of the Kurds in the immediate aftermath of the Iran-Iraq war was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a systematic and deliberate policy on the part of the Iraqi Government to eliminate large numbers of Kurdish civilians, both as a punishment for their imputed political sympathies and in retaliation for the activities of Kurdish opposition forces. </PARA>
<PARA>The report states that late in 1987, 6,000 Kurds, mostly civilians, and whole families, were deliberately killed by government forces. Other information was received about the deliberate killing of hundreds of others. Over 400 Kurdish civ- ilians, among them women and children, were reported to have been executed on 2 April 1987 at the Tanjaro military gar- rison. In August 1987 hundreds of unarmed Kurdish civilians were deliberately killed and thousands wounded when Iraqi government forces attacked Kurdish villages in the north. </PARA>
<PARA> Thousands of Iraqi troops were reported to have launched attacks using tanks, helicopter gunships, artillery and chemical weapons on hundreds of villages in the provinces of Duhok, Mosul and Arbil. In August, Iraqi Government forces arrested 1,000 people wounded from chemical weapon attacks and summarily executed them and buried them in mass graves nearby. </PARA>
<PARA> On 16 and 17 April 1988, 5,000 Kurds were deliberately killed and thousands wounded as a result of chemical weapon attacks by Iraqi forces on the town of Halabja. Many of us saw those vivid and most oppressive scenes on our television screens. Most of the victims were civilians-many of them women and children. Thousands of political prisoners continued to be detained without trial or charge. Children of political opponents were also arbitrarily arrested and detained as hostages. Mirza and Mardan Rasho, two brothers aged six and 13 respectively, were arrested in July 1985 and their fate is unknown. The fate of some 8,000 Kurds, among them 315 children, known to have disappeared following their arrest in August 1983 is still unknown. </PARA>
<PARA> Some 1,900 Kurds returned to their homes in Iraq from refuge in Turkey after the Iraqi Government announced an amnesty for Kurds in September 1987, and it is unknown what has happened to them. It is this brutality that we have seen in the past which the Iraqi Kurds have experienced and from which they have fled. Now we have a situation where, in the aftermath of the Iraq or desert war, involving Australia amongst other countries, more than two million Kurds have fled their country to the northern border areas of Turkey and Iraq. In order to understand the magnitude of that, there are nine million Kurds in Turkey, 12 per cent of Turkey's population; five million in Iran, 3 per cent of Iran's population; and there were four million in Iraq, 20 per cent of Iraq's population. There are 800,000 in Syria and smaller communities in the Soviet Union and Lebanon. So, two million people have fled the country out of a total of four million people. </PARA>
<PARA> Treacherous terrain has hampered relief efforts and last week it was estimated that, on the Iranian border alone, some 2,000 people, mostly babies and children, were dying each night. The United Nations (UN) High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that there would be approximately 30,000 refugees as a result of the Gulf war and prepared for such a contingency. However, the swiftness and vastness of the refugee problem caught them unprepared. Of an estimated $1.2 billion which they believe they will need just to keep these people alive over a period of three months, approximately $96m has been pledged. </PARA>
<PARA> The international community must bear some of the responsibility for this tragedy. At the end of the war, the allies, and Australia among them, encouraged the Kurds in the north and the Shi'ites in the south to rebel against Hussein's regime. The brutal crushing of the twin uprising has caused the massive flood of refugees which we now see. We must not shirk our responsibilities. Some laudable initiatives have been activated. British Prime Minister John Major's plan to establish a UN safe haven for the Kurdish refugees hopefully will lessen the scale of the tragedy. But, as both the British Ambassador to the UN and the United States have pointed out, safe havens are not long term solutions: they are a purely humanitarian concept, not a juridical or political concept. </PARA>
<PARA> The UN has no mandate to create an independent nation of Kurds and nor should it be given one. Article 6 of the UN's covenant deals with that. The only long term viable solution for the Kurds is to make it safe for them to go home. The United Nations Security Council resolution 687 on the formal cease-fire, adopted by the Council vote of 12 to 1 on 3 April 1991, contained no protection for Iraq's minority, although we note that the Iraqi legislature voted to accept the conditions of the resolution on 6 April. At the beginning of the war, the Opposition continually stated that the international community should turn its attention, along with Australia, to the postwar situation and the possible impact of the war on groups such as the Kurds. </PARA>
<PARA> From the time President Bush called a unilateral cease-fire on the night of 27 February, Australia could have, and should have, lobbied for the inclusion in the Security Council resolution of the protection of minorities as a condition of peace. We failed to do this. Senator Evans's response as to why this was not done was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> We made the judgment that, particularly given our status as not being a current member of the Security Council, there was little we could add to a very lively debate on these issues that was already proceeding. That is the view that we continue to hold. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia, however, on its past record, has lobbied for many variations to Security Council resolutions. A resolution condemning Iraqi action against its citizens was finally adopted by the United Nations Security Council on 6 April, but only after the enormity of the plight of the Kurdish refugees became apparent. In view of the time, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the terms of the UN Security Council resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The UN Security Council passed resolution 688 on April 6 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>* The resolution reads after the preamble,</PARA>
<PARA>``The Security Council . . .</PARA>
<PARA>``(1) Condemns the repression of the Iraqi civilian population in many parts of Iraq, including most recently in Kurdish populated areas, the consequences of which threaten international peace and security in the region. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) Demands that Iraq, as a contribution to remove the threat to international peace and security in the region, immediately end this repression and express the hope in the same context that an open dialogue will take place to ensure that the human and political rights of all Iraqi citizens are respected:</PARA>
<PARA>(3) Insists that Iraq allow immediate access by international humanitarian organisations to all those in need of assistance in all parts of Iraq and to make available all necessary facilities for their operations;</PARA>
<PARA>(4) Requests the Secretary-General to pursue his humanitarian efforts in Iraq and to report forthwith, if appropriate on the basis of a further mission to the region, on the plight of the Iraqi civilian population, and in particular the Kurdish population, suffering from the repression in all its forms inflicted by the Iraqi authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>(5) Requests further the Secretary-General to use all the resources at his disposal, including those of the relevant United Nations agencies, to address urgently the critical needs of the refugees and displaced Iraqi population;</PARA>
<PARA>(6) Appeals to all Member States and to all humanitarian organisations to contribute to these humanitarian relief efforts;</PARA>
<PARA>(7) Demands that Iraq co-operate with the Secretary-General to these ends;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The resolution strongly suggests that Iraq must solve the Kurdish exodus and stop repression of that minority before it is granted a formal peace. This resolution did not have the full support of the Security Council members, since it was considered by some that it would set a dangerous precedent if the UN were to interfere with domestic issues. The United Nations can involve itself in a member state's affairs only if it raises issues that transcend its immediate borders. Several members of the 15-member Council considered that the Kurdish resolution took the international nature of the exodus too far. So there were these difficulties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly, in passing this resolution, the United Nations has indicated that there are sufficient international ramifications for the tragedy of the Kurds to allow it to act. Having failed to protect the Kurds, Australia should now act itself to ensure that the Kurds are not further displaced. The Opposition has argued strongly in those terms; particularly the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). The Australian Government has responded-and I acknowledge this-by providing aid, and a number of initiatives have been taken. Government members will no doubt elaborate in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention one final matter: the situation that we have heard about in the latest reports is that Kurdish leaders have made an agreement to establish an autonomous region in Kurdistan. That is a welcome development. The determination of refugee status if Australia is to accept people for resettlement is a matter which I do support, but I want to make the case strongly that there needs to be consistency in applying long-standing rules that do apply in this instance and ought to apply on the same basis as they do in other circumstances. </PARA>

I am not sure, first of all, how accurate that is, given that the Australian Government is not on the Security Council and has had only a secondary role in relation to the determination of the contents of the agreement and the resolution on the cease- fire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, there is also the question of whether the cease-fire agreement could have been unanimously accepted if there had been an attempt to include those provisions. As the honourable member for Dundas has pointed out, Australia has supported a further resolution at the United Nations; and that was supported by most, though not all, members of the Security Council. So it is not as if the United Nations has failed to act on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dundas has failed to give a analysis about what has actually happened in this matter. There are the deplorable actions of Saddam Hussein in the way he has treated the Kurdish people not merely following but also prior to the war. It is probably one of the most disgraceful condemnations of most nations of the world that they failed to condemn the regime of Saddam Hussein at the time he was actually using chemical weapons against the Kurdish people-people who are part of Iraq. Many nations-and we are guilty as well-failed to condemn him and his government at that particular time. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context it is important to note that we should be forthcoming in our condemnation when international events of this kind occur. It is very interesting in this context because there have been more recent events. Saddam Hussein is to be condemned for his actions and what he has done to the Kurdish people in this round following the war. But not only Saddam Hussein is to be condemned. It is interesting to note what happened to those people when they were forced out. Many of them went into Iran. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding its previous reputation, Iran opened its borders and took all the Kurdish people. Interestingly, in light of the fact that we have the President of Turkey, Mr Ozal, here, what happened on the Turkish border? On the one hand, of those people pushed out by Saddam Hussein, some were able to get into Turkey, but at a given moment, in the middle of that crisis, when most people were up in the mountains, the Turkish Government ordered the border to be closed. On the other hand, those people were being pushed into the mountains by the forces of Saddam Hussein. There were freezing temperatures and they had hardly any possessions or clothes. They wanted to go into Turkey but the Turkish Government closed the border. Many of those people died in those mountains-tens of thousands according to the United Nations and Amnesty International. </PARA>
<PARA> I am surprised that the honourable member for Dundas has not mentioned that situation. If we are concerned about the Kurdish people-and we all are-we should be talking about not merely Iraq's but also Iran's and Turkey's treatment of them. The fact is that the Turkish border was closed at a time when they needed that humanitarian assistance and thousands and thousands of those people died. That act is to be condemned. The Turkish Government has a lot to answer for because of its recent action, never mind the previous treatment of the Kurdish people. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Dundas said, it is not up to the United Nations to determine an independent Kurdistan. However, when there is a people such as the Kurds, spread around that whole region-Iran, Iraq, part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Turkey-and, as a people they are continuously denied recognition and autonomy by most of those governments, we in the international community ought to be concerned. It is one thing to say they should have an independent state. The fact that they do not have an independent state is a controversial issue. But certainly not to be ignored is whether they should have autonomy and whether there should be recognition of their cultural rights, their rights as a minority and their right to practise their language. They have been denied these rights in those three countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Iran recently has decided to relent and give some recognition to the Kurds. However, the record of all three of those countries in relation to the Kurdish people has been appalling. It is no wonder, therefore, that the Kurdish people in Australia are pretty upset about the visit and, especially, about the awarding of the Order of Australia to the President of Turkey. </PARA>
<PARA> The rights of the Kurdish people need to be protected by the international community. I would have liked this motion to have gone beyond merely mentioning the recent actions of the United Nations Security Council and, instead, to have recommended what should be done to ensure the future autonomy of the Kurdish people and the genuine recognition of their human rights. I think the proposal to establish a safe haven for the Kurds is a great initiative. However, the safe haven was proposed because the Kurdish people were dying in the mountains. They had to come down from the mountains because they could not get into Turkey. Once they came down from the mountains they were faced with the prospect of being butchered by the forces of Saddam Hussein. That is why the international community had to move. I must congratulate those who initiated the idea of a safe haven. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has supported the proposal for a safe haven. Not only did we support the concept of a safe haven but also we are now sending personnel over there. We have sent Army personnel to help protect the Kurdish people, to help set up camps and to do a number of other things. I congratulate the Government for doing that. The implication in the motion of the honourable member for Dundas that the Government has not done enough is incorrect. Of course, we have done enough. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In seconding the motion now before the House I want, at the outset, to point out that the Kurds are the self-styled descendants of the ancient Medes-with a very noble history reaching far back to the dawn of civilisation. However, in modern times, and particularly since the peace settlement following World War I, their existence has been marked by division, subjugation, neglect and, more recently, in the case of the Iraqi Kurds under Saddam Hussein, cruelty in the extreme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tales of pillage, rape and slaughter perpetrated on the Iraqi Kurds by the forces of Saddam Hussein are now a matter of grim record. They present a shameful account of attempted genocide, never to be erased from the pages of world history. With the final defeat of Saddam by the United Nations forces, principally those of the United States, one would have supposed the agony of the Kurds to have ended. However, this was not so. The Americans withdrew, unexpectedly, and, tragically for the Kurds, left a portion of the Iraqi fighting force, including its Republican Guard, sufficiently intact to redouble its own brand of punishment on those rebel Kurdish guerillas who had risen in response to Saddam's weakened position. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether the United States withdrawal simply did not take the plight of the Kurds into account, or whether, as was suggested in the Melbourne Age editorial of 4 April, President Bush `understood that the legitimacy of any new regime in Baghdad would be undermined if it were seen as Washington's puppet', we will never know. We do know that the Kurds, who represent 20 per cent of Iraq's population, were once more open to Saddam's cruelty and are now open to his revenge. A transcript of the United States World Report of 15 April stated:</PARA>
<PARA>As flag-waving Americans welcomed home their heroes, Saddam Hussein's humiliated army finally found something to cheer about too . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I am certain this black humour is not lost on honourable members. The butchery had recommenced. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I feel strongly, and I am sure many of my colleagues would agree, that the United Nations Security Council resolution should have included provisions to protect all minority groups living in Iraq, including the Kurds. Further, it is a matter of great regret to me and, I am sure, to other Opposition members, and possibly some Government members as well, that the Australian Government failed to lobby for the inclusion of such provisions. I would point out, in response to comments from the honourable member opposite, that in fact non-members of the Security Council can, and do, lobby. However, since the making of the resolution the course of events appears to have improved prospects for the Kurds. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the appalling conditions being suffered by the Kurdish people as they move from their squalid camps and make their way home, there is now a light on the horizon. According to the Australian of 6 May, correspondents in Tehran and northern Iraq reported that Kurdish officials and the Iraqi Government were holding talks in Baghdad on the possibility of an autonomous homeland in northern Iraq-the Kurdish free zone, as it is called. Meanwhile, countries of the world are pledging help to the Kurds. In fact, in this context I commend the Australian Government for the aid it has pledged recently in the form of a medical and sanitation team to be sent to northern Iraq for Operation Habitat.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it is to be hoped that the Government of this country will heed the words of Mr Chanin Baker, spokesman for the Australian Kurdish community, who stated recently:</PARA>
<PARA>There should be an international guarantee to ensure that the Kurdish people will not be subjected to genocide again. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia should play its part to ensure that such a guarantee is effected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If this motion had been debated at the time the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) gave notice of it, I might have found myself pretty well in agreement with what he had to say. Unfortunately, I think the motion was formulated about three weeks ago and events have overtaken it. I would, of course, at that time have deplored the appalling abuse of the Kurds in Iraq by Saddam Hussein's regime. I would have noted that the United Nations Security Council did not seem to pay sufficient attention to oppressed minorities within Iraq. I would have said that I felt that the Australian Government might have been urging on its American allies a bit more action with respect to the protection of the Kurdish minority. I would have been in great sympathy with the honourable member's suggestion that we urge the United Nations Security Council to do more for the Kurds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, over the three weeks since the formulation of that motion, things have proceeded apace. Action has been taken along the lines that the honourable member quite rightly felt should have been taken three weeks ago. Indeed, at that time, in a speech to this House, I criticised American foreign policy for its inactivity towards the Kurdish minority. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the motion was formulated, the Kurdish situation has improved somewhat. However, that situation does revolve around what the international community is prepared to do for the Kurds. The Kurds, by most tests, are a nation, but they face the misfortune of being spread across five major countries-Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria and the Soviet Union. Trying to create a nation state for the Kurds at this stage would involve taking on five principal states of the United Nations and asking them to have their territory carved up by international action-a wholly unreasonable demand on them. </PARA>
<PARA> The most that can be expected for the Kurdish people, as their leadership has been admitting this week during the negotiations with the Iraqi Government, is an autonomous area for the Kurds in Iraq, and this is the objective that I believe we should aim at. Their present situation is caused principally by the repressive nature of the Iraqi regime, but also partly by the American postwar diplomacy in the sphere of Iraq. Having been enormously successful with force of arms against the Iraqi military regime over its occupation of Kuwait, the American Government then ill-advisedly, in my view, encouraged the Kurds and the population of southern Iraq to engage in an insurrection against the Iraqi regime. This insurrection proved unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences in southern Iraq were not quite as dire as they were in the north, because American forces were in a situation to protect the failed insurrectionaries. In the north they were left to their own devices and the Iraqi regime seized on the first opportunity it had had for some time for the successful force of arms and wreaked its revenge on the Kurdish rebels. </PARA>
<PARA> The Americans then changed their diplomatic posture-to their credit they changed it-and they have now intervened in order to create a situation in which the Kurds can negotiate an autonomous area for themselves to which their 1 1/2 million to two million refugees living in destitution, unloved by the Turkish border guards, can return and live a life in reasonable peace with the Iraqi Government. The Kurds' leadership recognises that it cannot create an independent Kurdistan and that the best it can do is, with American and other Western support, get a better deal from the Iraqi Government. I support that position. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that the Australian Government has acted in support of that position. Between August and now it has provided $6m for emergency assistance for the Middle East, some of it going to the Kurds; it has the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) at present in the Middle East looking at what can be done in terms of providing a safe haven for some of them in Australia; and it has announced this week the dispatch of 70 Australian military personnel with a view to assisting particularly the British in their protection of the Kurds in the negotiations with the Iraqi Government, so that they can have a safe haven to which to return. </PARA>
<PARA> In general, however, I would commend the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) for moving his motion, although I fear that events have overtaken it, but to the good fortune of the Kurds. I do not have any principled disagreement with what he says other than to say that things have improved, and I commend the Australian Government for assisting in that improvement during that three-week interval. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House recognises the need for a special national priority in funding for the Pacific Highway. </PARA>
<PARA>I move this motion with the weight of a great deal of knowledge of the need for that special priority. When I first started my campaign to get a new Pacific Highway in 1984, I was virtually a voice in the wilderness. It delights me to say that my continued efforts since then have produced a major turnaround in this nation in regard to attitudes to the Pacific Highway. When I started off, people said I was fairly crazy to want a four-lane, dual carriageway, divided highway from Hexham to the Queensland border, but that is not the case now. I now have the support of every political party in Australia; the total support of the New South Wales Government; and also the support of the present Government in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> I had hoped that I would be able to introduce this motion on 21 December because that was the day before the first anniversary of the Clybucca bus smash, the worst road accident in Australia's history. On that first anniversary, the Kempsey Lions clubs opened a marvellous memorial garden at Clybucca in memory of the people who lost their lives. I have sympathy still for the families of those people and also of those who lost their lives in the Cowper bus smash in the Clarence Valley. </PARA>
<PARA> The emergency services-all of them right round Australia, not just those in the MacLeay Valley and the Clarence Valley that were involved with those two bus smashes-deserve a special tribute. Those of us who are fortunate enough not to be involved in assisting dead and dying and badly injured people do not know what those emergency service people go through. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to comment on the growth of the driver reviver program on the highways. I think this is incredibly valuable because we must cut down the number of deaths. The Pacific Highway has something like 8,000 vehicle movements per day, of which 13 per cent are heavy vehicles. We can expect the traffic to grow by 4 per cent per annum every year to the year 2000. I venture to suggest that the national priority for the Pacific Highway is recognised right throughout Australia. Everywhere I travel and speak about it, I get total support from everybody with whom I come into contact. I have had the opportunity of presenting nearly 50,000 signatures on petitions to this Parliament, to this House, seeking special priority in funding for the highway. It is an Australia-wide recognition that extra funding is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time available, I cannot detail the enormous benefits that come from good roads-benefits in terms of reduced pain and suffering and certainly also enormous financial benefits. I am very pleased that I will be supported by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and that the two Government speakers are the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) and the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods). I know that they support what I say on this. We need a bipartisan attitude to get both sides of the Parliament working together with the State Government to provide more funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The high cost of bad roads is incredible-increased travel time for domestic or commercial purposes; frightful vehicle costs; fuel costs which go up by 15 per cent when driving onto a rough road surface from a smooth one; extra fuel consumption when driving on a bad surface, which has a cost nearly three times the cost of regular road maintenance; and the wearing out of tyres two to three times faster on a poor surface. While the details of the benefits from road construction are fully documented in my 1986 publication The Pacific Highway Towards 2001, I should just quote:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Bureau of Transport Economics . . . found that there was an approximate cost-benefit ratio for the economy of 1 to 3.16. </PARA>
<PARA>So that for every $1m spent on road upgrading and reconstruction, the economy benefits by $3.16m. </PARA>
<PARA> The savings that pass through to the community from better roads and road construction are, to name just a few: lower vehicle wear and tear costs; lower fuel costs; less occupant travel time; lower freight costs; less road maintenance; lower accident costs; less government expenditure on hospitals, health and emergency services; lower insurance costs; and lower third party and property legal costs. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1990 fatal accidents in New South Wales totalled 17 on freeways with 17 deaths and on State highways 191 accidents with 224 deaths. That is appalling indeed. I have a particular interest in the Pacific Highway, and on it in that year there were 49 fatal accidents with 60 people killed, compared with 31 fatal accidents and 34 deaths on the Hume Highway, 27 fatal accidents and 25 deaths on the Great Western Highway, and 17 fatal accidents and 23 deaths on the New England Highway. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important though that we do not get carried away by the accident statistics. They are valuable, they are essential; but we need to take the positive view that work is going on. In fact, in 1990 those 60 deaths on the Pacific Highway represented a figure that was down by 55 per cent on the figure for the previous year. Of course, the previous year with 133 deaths included those two horrendous bus smashes at Cowper and Clybucca. </PARA>
<PARA> But to put these figures in perspective, the total of 60 deaths last year is lower than the 10-year average for the Pacific Highway in the 1980s, which was 71. Things are improving; there is no doubt about that at all. I pay tribute to the New South Wales Deputy Premier and Minister for Roads, Mr Wal Murray, and the Federal Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), because things are improving. In the current three-year period, the State and the Federal Governments will be spending $300m. That is nearly three times the figure in the previous three years. </PARA>
<PARA> I know, and other members of this chamber who drive on the Pacific Highway know, that work is going on. I want to take the very positive view that it is happening, but that it needs to happen faster. I know the Minister, were he here, would probably interject-as he has in the past-that on the one hand I want more money but on the other hand I want fewer taxes. That is true, but it is a question of the allocation. With the fuel levy and the amount of money that is being collected from fuel, surely another one or two cents a litre could go back onto the roads. That is what we need. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be pointed out that the $300m State and Federal initiative will increase the number of overtaking lanes between Hexham and Tweed Heads to 130. The total length of dual carriageway will be 38 kilometres. No way is that enough. Sharp bends will be eliminated at 50 locations. All known black spots on the highway will be eradicated. One hundred and thirty-five kilometres of poor road surface will be repaired. Four narrow bridges will be replaced. We will have overtaking lanes every 10 kilometres between Coffs Harbour and Tweed Heads and every five kilometres between Raymond Terrace and Coffs Harbour. A great deal of work is going on and will continue to go on. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make one point about the Minister. I notice that on 7 May he put out a press release announcing 50 overtaking lanes with $36.4m new work. I think the Minister is just a little naughty, shall we say, in re-announcing work that has already been announced. This is part of the work announced by the Minister and Mr Murray last October. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I never want to see another Cowper accident and I never want to see another Clybucca bus smash again. I want to see roads so good that there are no serious accidents. I want to see our roads so safe that our hospital casualty wards are only needed for heart attacks and strokes and for kids falling out of trees and breaking their arms. I want a four-lane dual carriageway divided highway between Hexham and the Queensland border. I want a new Pacific Highway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can certainly fully understand the concerns of the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) about the Pacific Highway. Anyone who lives on the north coast of New South Wales, and has done so for a few years, cannot help but be concerned for the safety of those who travel on that road. We have seen two terrible bus crashes on that road in the past few years. It has made north coast people particularly sensitive to the issue of the improvements to the Pacific Highway. The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) recently drove himself over that route, and I know that he and the Federal Government share in that concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Pacific Highway is a major arterial road which serves industry, tourism and various communities along the New South Wales north coast. It carries an average of 8,000 vehicles a day, of which about 13 per cent are heavy vehicles. Traffic is expected to continue to grow at a rate of about 4 per cent until the year 2000. Various studies have acknowledged that the road is not providing an adequate level of service for its users. It has a poor accident record which is significantly higher than the State average. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, the Federal Government is very much aware of the community's concern at the condition of the road and its poor crash record. It also recognises that the road is a key rural and tourist link which is essential for the continued economic development of the north coast of New South Wales. For those reasons, the Federal Government has already made a strong commitment to give the road a higher national priority and to work, together with New South Wales, towards that. I believe that the honourable member for Cowper recognises that. That commitment is to improve the worst sections of the road as quickly as possible, to upgrade it to a four-lane divided standard over time as this becomes economically warranted and to enhance the safety of that road. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the horrific bus crashes which occurred near Kempsey in Cowper, and in my electorate which cost a total of 55 lives late in 1989, there were many calls for the Pacific Highway to be declared a national highway. Really, the status of the road is not the important issue. What is going to change the safety of the road is the funding, and that is the best indicator of the commitment of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's joint funding effort with New South Wales has meant that more funds are available to upgrade the road faster than if it were a national highway. A total of $300m is to be spent on the highway and that almost trebles the funding effort on the road over the previous three years. By any measure, this level of funding is a significant commitment by both the Federal and New South Wales governments, and it will provide a sound basis for achieving a very much improved and safer road for tourism and other uses. </PARA>
<PARA> This $300m program is expected to deliver a number of major improvements. It will result in a large increase in overtaking opportunities by the construction of an additional 50 overtaking lanes and 28 kilometres of dual carriageways; a 33 per cent reduction in the existing narrow stretches of the highway by widening 96 kilometres of road pavement and shoulders; a 24 per cent reduction in the number of existing sharp curves at 50 different locations; and a 25 per cent reduction in the number of existing narrow bridges. One in particular that I am pleased about is Mororo Bridge just north of Maclean which I nominated a few years ago as a particularly dangerous spot. That is to be duplicated so that it will provide for the four-lane divided highway in the future. It is one particular spot where trucks coming towards it radio ahead on their citizen band radios to check if anything is coming the other way because they cannot both fit on the bridge at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major improvement will be the elimination of all the currently listed accident black spots. These improvements should result in a reduction of 20 per cent in road casualties and should bring them down to under 1,200 in 1994. Both the New South Wales and Federal governments recognise that the highway cannot be upgraded to an optimum standard in only three years and, therefore, a strategy for the longer term upgrading of the highway has to be developed. </PARA>
<PARA> That strategy will include undertaking a total transport study in the corridor to identify the traffic task to be performed by road and rail. That is sensible. We have the parallel systems running together and it is sensible to identify the tasks that each should be performing. There will be an economic evaluation of the benefits and costs of upgrading the total route to four-lane divided standard. It is recognised that that is what we are aiming for, but it needs to be evaluated and examined as to the benefits and costs and as to when that should happen. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a study of the extent to which an upgraded summerland way from Grafton to Brisbane could provide an alternative route for heavy traffic currently using the Pacific Highway. That is an item in which I am particularly interested. I believe it could give definite benefits to towns like Grafton, Casino, Kyogle and that whole northern area. It also includes an assessment of how to maximise private sector involvement, perhaps through tollways, to accelerate the upgrading of the Pacific Highway. </PARA>
<PARA> When this strategy is completed in about the middle of this year, governments will then be in a better position to consider the upgrading of the highway beyond the current three-year program. But until the results of this strategy study are available, it would be premature for governments to give a commitment of funding beyond 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Cowper mentioned fuel tax, and tax generally, and that more of that tax should go back into roads. That really does not have much to do with putting a higher priority on the Pacific Highway. It does indicate his feelings, but he really does not go far enough because if he is to enter into that argument, the honourable member for Cowper should say where that tax has to come from. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, out of the fuel levy, but the honourable member for Cowper forgets that that money is already spent and, if it is spent, is he to take it out of the welfare budget, the education budget or the health budget? It has to come from somewhere. From the point of view of the colleagues of the honourable member for Cowper that might be extremely hard to do. After all, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has announced that he favours a $3 billion cut in the Budget to start with. On the other hand, maybe he has some ideas of gaining additional money from the consumption tax favoured by that side of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If that is so, it is really an admission that that tax will not be revenue neutral, that it will raise additional money, and it is a tax that will hit the poorer hardest-the lower income sections of the community. It is not to be revenue neutral, and it has been designed to tax the people of Australia more. If the Opposition is going to say it wants more tax on the roads, it has got to say where it is coming from, but it is not going to say anything. After all, that was raised. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of our commitment, the Pacific Highway continues to have one of the highest priorities in developing Australia's national network of roads. That priority is evidenced by the fact that the Federal Government has spent more money constructing projects on the Pacific Highway in the past seven years than it has on the New England Highway. </PARA>
<PARA> The task of upgrading the Pacific Highway is ongoing, it is a cooperative partnership between New South Wales and the Federal Government to fund a $300m joint upgrading program over the next three years. After all, the people know where that additional money that is being spent comes from. They are quite aware that it is not going to be taxed from any other source, and those items need to be made perfectly clear when we call for additional money for roads or for any other purpose. The Hawke Government's strong commitment to the current $300m program and to the development of a longer term strategy for the upgrading of the road shows that it places a high priority on making the Pacific Highway a safer and a better road. </PARA>
<PARA> One comment made by the honourable member for Cowper was that he would like to see the road so good that there would be no accidents on it. Whilst I agree with his feelings, I do not believe it is possible. I think that people's attitudes, drivers' attitudes, must play a part. Education for drivers, on drugs and all those types of things, need to play a part; not only the improvement of the roads. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support my colleague the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) in recognising the need for a special national priority in funding for the Pacific Highway. In doing so, I just want to draw the attention of the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), who just spoke, to some of the sad realities of this situation. He referred to the fuel levy. He said that the levy was totally committed. That may well be so, but let it not be forgotten that the fuel levy for many years has cheated the road users of Australia, as it was a levy introduced many years ago to effectively provide adequate funding for road development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The truth of the matter is that a minority of the levy goes towards road development and most of it goes to Consolidated Revenue. It is surely the Government's responsibility to face up to that fact and make the necessary changes in the interests of the Australian people. The people are prepared to fund roads. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence in New South Wales is clear: the Greiner Government in recent years has introduced an additional fuel levy which the people have been prepared to pay. What the people simply say is, `We want to see results for our money and, regrettably, on the Pacific Highway of New South Wales in particular the problem is critical'. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government is going to do something over the next three years-and we are delighted to hear that-the truth is we have been waiting for most of the last eight years for something to be done, and hundreds of people have died in the meantime. How many more have to die before we see a serious improvement in the road situation? I would suggest that the National Roads and Motorists Association should consider issuing a certificate at either end of the infamous Pacific Highway. That certificate, for example, could say, `Congratulations, you have done it and you are still alive'. </PARA>
<PARA> People who have taken that road, especially in wet weather or at night time, know that they have taken their lives and those of their children into their own hands for that most dangerous few hours. When day breaks and the rain stops, drivers might have a strong black cup of roadside coffee, sigh with relief and say that they will never, never drive on that appalling road again, if they can possibly avoid doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> We all keep wondering when that wretched stretch of road will be divided into four lanes with a decent surface and people's lives will stop being put at risk. No-one would argue that taxes from the back of Bourke should not go to fund a road that is allegedly not seen as being in the national interest, although I am delighted to hear from the honourable member for Page that the Government is now giving, at a somewhat late stage, a high priority to its development. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is, as I have said, many Australian families have at some stage used the Pacific Highway. It is therefore a national artery of significant importance, and the statistics show that more traffic uses that highway than the so-called national highway-the New England Highway-which is to the west. Imagine what the international tourists must think on that road? They have decided to travel from Brisbane to Sydney, through one of the highest population densities in Australia. They know it contains many popular tourist spots, with magnificent beaches and so forth. They have decided to go along the coast, to take a swim at world class beaches and to have a holiday. What they find on that part of the coast is a two-laned, potholed bitumen track. This is supposed to be a civilised country with high standards of living, which we know are now falling, and a decent road system. </PARA>
<PARA> Some facts about the Pacific Highway: overtaking is effectively restricted for nearly half its length; 77 per cent of the road is of only two lanes, with overtaking lanes on only 13 per cent of the highway; nearly a third of its length has shoulders less than a metre in width and 64 per cent of shoulders are in either fair or poor condition; there is a total of 92 curves along its length of 965 kilometres, and the speed one can travel is 35 kilometres below the speed limit; and there are a total of 79 no-overtaking zones longer than 1.5 kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA> The position is critical and, clearly, the Government must further upgrade that road-the sooner it does so the better-otherwise how many more Australians are going to die before this disgrace of a highway is significantly improved?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) for putting this motion before the House today, and I thank him because it allows us to put on record, from the Government and the Opposition sides, our attitudes and our feelings about this particular piece of highway, which is a problem in the sense of the density of traffic that now travels on that particular highway is not commensurate with the facility that is actually provided. I will admit that. The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) will also admit that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The commitments that the Minister for Land Transport has made on behalf of the Government are in recognition of that, and the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) has announced those particular commitments. I would like to mention some of them again. The Government did make the commitment to improve the worst sections of that particular highway, and we are obligated to put on record our preparedness to upgrade the highway to a four-lane highway, as economies allow, and also to upgrade the safety of sections of the highway through things like the `black spots' program. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that as money becomes available and the commitments are met, as the highway does improve, all those things the honourable member for Cowper adverted to with regard to casualty rates and hospitalisation of people and those unfortunate things, which we tend not to give a great deal of thought to but which are associated with the transport of people by car, will be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The commitment announced by the Minister in February 1990 actually culminated in an announcement of a bipartisan approach with the New South Wales Minister for Transport, Mr Baird, last May, about the joint funding package to accelerate the upgrading program. It was a joint effort and it was certainly welcomed by both the people of New South Wales and at a Federal level by my colleague, the honourable member for Page and me. The agreed program was launched by the Minister and actually the New South Wales Deputy Premier, who was part of that opening. He is a member for the National Party, as the honourable member for Cowper will know. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Page also mentioned that $300m will be spent on the highway over the next three years. The Federal Government contribution of $130m was to provide $16m from the Australian land transport development program, some $16m from the new provincial cities and rural highways program, and $10m from the new accident black spots program. As part of the Federal Minister's commitment to that, he spent four days travelling that highway and looking at the particular black spots, the nasty little bits of the highway; and we have certainly had action. I know that in my electorate, and the honourable member for Page agreed, we have had a good response from the Federal Government to eliminate black spot accident areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention has been made by honourable members in this debate of the need for further funding and the lack of spending in the past on the highway. The past is the past, and we will not forget it, but let us not be ungrateful about the extra money that has gone into this particular highway. It is not a federally funded highway as such, but the Government has taken on the responsibility to spend money there because the need has been shown. The fuel levy has been given to State and local governments in untied grants. It is not as though it goes into Consolidated Revenue and disappears; it has been given back. </PARA>
<PARA> The 3 x 3 levy from the New South Wales Government is also going a long way to improving the highways. I do not begrudge that, but what the honourable member for Cowper and the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) seem to have forgotten is that the Opposition has also called for cuts of $3 billion from government spending. How will they ask their side to finance further improvements in the highway when they are faced with that sort of call from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and no doubt from other members of the Opposition?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) the disposal of glass products and non-biodegradable containers in national parks and other areas protected by Commonwealth law should be a specific offence if the materials are not placed in areas designated for their disposal;</PARA>
<PARA>(2) persons convicted of committing such an offence should be liable to a penalty not less than 8 hours supervised rubbish clearing in public areas or national parks which would not include time travelling to the designated area;</PARA>
<PARA>(3) where the offence includes the deliberate breakage of glass products, the sentence should be a minimum of 24 hours actual time;</PARA>
<PARA>(4) recurring offences after the initial conviction should attract a doubling of the penalty on each occasion; and</PARA>
<PARA>(5) the House requests the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to take this matter up with State and Territory Ministers for the Environment in order that uniform legislation, particularly covering National Parks and wilderness areas, can be enacted. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not the first time that I have raised this matter. It is one that I have considerable feeling about. I believe too few Australians care about the areas which are preserved for their enjoyment and for future generations, in that too many treat those areas with a contempt which deserves to be noted and treated in specific ways. The motion calls for those people found guilty of disposing of glass and other non-biodegradable products in national parks and other areas under the control of the Commonwealth, in places other than those which are set aside specifically for the disposal of those products, to be dealt with in a specific way upon conviction. That means that, rather than a fine, which for many of those involved is meaningless, or a day or two in prison, which can lead to notoriety in some peer groups, they be required to attend at a place to be nominated and, on the first occasion, to spend eight hours cleaning up the areas that they have abused and used as their private rubbish dumps. On subsequent offences, that penalty should be doubled. </PARA>
<PARA> For persons who break glass products in particular, that penalty would be trebled. There is a good reason for that: the dangers to others caused by the irresponsible actions of a few who-usually after a few drinks or in order to show their virility or that they are smarter than the rest of us-smash bottles and other things against rocks, in parks, on paths and on beaches. Those actions place children, in particular, in danger. Those wilful actions cause a potential danger to all other persons. </PARA>
<PARA> Glass products do not fade away; they do not rot. They remain and accumulate for years. Those who are so contemptuous, so irresponsible and so unconcerned about other members of the community should have it drawn to their attention in the strongest possible way that their actions are unacceptable and are not going to be passed off by a stern warning from some person in a court or paid for by a fine which may or may not be a serious impediment to the person concerned. It will be drawn to their attention that our society expects them to go out, in their own time and at their own expense, to repair the damage they have done. </PARA>
<PARA> The adoption of this type of formula will deal with what I consider to be a very serious problem. Most honourable members are aware of cases of children standing on a broken bottle, usually at a beach or somewhere else where they are entitled to feel safe. We are all aware of the very substantial efforts that have been made in recent times by Australians to clean up the mess made by other Australians on their beaches-the days of work and the tonnes and tonnes of rubbish that have been removed from our parks, recreation areas, beaches and riverfronts. But there are still those in our community who see littering, the throwing away of products which do not rot and do not disappear and the risk they impose on others by disposing of glass and the breaking of glass products in areas frequented not only by adults but by children, in which areas they are entitled to be, as something that other people should worry about or something that they should have no concern about whatsoever. They treat us and the country that we want to protect with utter contempt. </PARA>
<PARA> If someone turned up and broke the windows in their house they would be racing off to the police and insurance companies and wherever else, asking that the persons concerned be punished. But they are prepared to do this damage elsewhere and to do it without any concerns at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion also asks that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) raise this type of approach for uniform adoption by Territory and State governments. This would apply these rules to our beaches, rivers, parks, recreation areas and public areas in general. It would mean that a uniform penalty would exist. I believe the fact that people would have to actually go out to clean up the mess they make would encourage them in future to pick it up and to take it with them when they leave. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite appalling that, when one walks along the Barwon River in my area, where councils have made very strong efforts to provide attractive areas for people who walk, jog and want to picnic along the river and have attempted-I use the word advisedly-to increase the number of trees for beautification of the area, one finds that their attempts have failed because someone has thought it smart to consistently break off or pull out the trees that have been planted. </PARA>
<PARA> One council, the City of Newtown, has since 1988 planted 3,000 trees in an area of about 25 hectares. If there are 50 trees still left there, I would be surprised. If 50 trees had died by natural causes, I would also be surprised. The other 2,900 have been destroyed by wanton vandals in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same areas where this takes place one can walk along on a Sunday morning and find the paths littered with broken bottles, Coke cans and beer cans. These are paths where kids ride their bicycles and where people jog and walk. They are accidents waiting to happen, and the accidents happen too often. </PARA>
<PARA> I am proposing that we adopt a system of penalties which befit the crime. If one wants to be what once was called a litterbug, but what I would now call a vandal, then so be it. These are people with no concern whatsoever for their fellow human beings and no concern at all for the areas which are being preserved more and more and which are becoming more and more important to Australians. They are the people who want to throw away their glass products, their biodegradables and the things that will not rot. They are the people who want to throw away the things that someone else has to get paid to remove-and that is another factor; councils are unnecessarily being forced to pay very substantial sums of money to pick up what people could carry away in a few moments. </PARA>
<PARA> Cans and bottles are dumped where cars have been parked 10 yards away from a rubbish bin. Some people are too damned lazy to get out of their cars, walk over to the rubbish bin and put their rubbish in. The penalties imposed would have those people who do the damage clean up the damage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on the very fine job that you are doing. I intend to take a slightly different tack this morning from that of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). Few, if any, of us would argue against any practical or worthwhile initiative aimed at further reducing the litter problem. Unfortunately, the motion put forward by the honourable member for Corio hardly comes within that category. Whilst the underlying concept may be sound, the suggested method of implementation is totally impractical, if not impossible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This proposal is so significantly and obviously deficient in so many respects that it is difficult to take any of it seriously. It may be well-intentioned but it is certainly ill-conceived. Firstly, for some reason best known to the mover, the motion is confined to glass products and non-biodegradable containers. I have attempted to grasp the rationale behind this decision but, try as I may, I cannot understand why someone who thoughtlessly and carelessly discards an empty plastic bottle is any more of a villain than someone who thoughtlessly and carelessly discards an old car tyre or who discards soiled, so-called disposable nappies which are, for obvious reasons-including their popularity and the difficulties associated with their proper disposal-widely regarded as being one of the worst and most offensive types of litter. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the terms of this motion, one may roll up with one's newspapers, food scraps or perhaps a trailer or two of garden refuse and deliberately dump the lot, secure in the knowledge that their very biodegradability will save one from the compulsory supervised litter pick-up duty which is specially and specifically reserved for one's non-biodegradable littering counterpart. Even non-biodegradable items are okay as long as they do not come within the category of containers. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, it is not clear from the wording of the motion whether the proposed penalties are in addition to or instead of the existing penalty of $500 for the illegal disposal of rubbish or litter in a national park or reserve. Apparently the mover of this motion is unaware of the recent trend away from supplying rubbish bins or designated litter disposal areas in national parks and other relatively remote or isolated recreational or wilderness areas. Increasingly, visitors to such places are being encouraged to take their rubbish away with them and to deposit it at centralised and easily accessible litter disposal points often located along highways or major roads. </PARA>
<PARA> This `take it away with you' system occurs, for example, in the World Heritage listed Cradle Mountain Lake St Clair National Park in Tasmania. It has also been widely adopted by councils in the remote north-west areas of Western Australia from Carnarvon to Wyndham-where `Don't Litter: Penalty $ . . . ' signs at popular tourist designations, parks and remote beauty spots are being replaced with notices exhorting visitors to `Show your Aussie pride; take your litter for a ride'. These notices include details of the nearest travel litter disposal points. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only does this system have a positive, rather than punitive, approach, but also it saves significant amounts of time and money. Previously, numbers of rubbish bins were scattered throughout these areas, hopefully, but not necessarily, at places where people may stop for meals or to camp or pursue other activities which may result in the generation of litter. All these bins had to be regularly checked and serviced, whether or not they had been used. Sometimes council employees and park rangers would drive long distances, often along unmade bush tracks, only to find the bin empty. In other instances, bins could be serviced on a daily basis but still be full to overflowing. With the introduction of the special travel litter disposal points, public rubbish disposal facilities can be readily located, identified and accessed by the public and regularly and easily serviced and maintained by the authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the demonstrable success of these `carry out whatever you carry in' programs, it is likely that in future tour buses entering Uluru National Park will be encouraged to voluntarily take their rubbish with them, or will be required to do so as a condition of their commercial permits for operating in the park. In Kakadu, where a commercial garbage contract is let at a yearly cost of about $80,000 to clear the rubbish bins provided at the major visitation areas and campsites, signs have now been erected to encourage visitors to take their rubbish with them as they leave. This is increasingly being recognised as the best solution to the problem of littering in public places. It works, and the costs involved are minimal, but, most importantly, it is based on encouraging people to recognise that the environment is their environment and that they have a responsibility, and indeed an obligation, to look after it. Surely this is a better way to go than trying to impose silly penalties on offenders who have little, if any, chance of being caught. </PARA>
<PARA> A famous cook, Mrs Glasse, whose book The Art of Cookery was published in 1747, is attributed with prefacing her recipe for hare soup with the instruction `First catch your hare'. In regard to the motion currently before the House, one could paraphrase this instruction to read `First catch your litterer'. Though not a betting man, I am prepared to back the possibility of snaring the hare, rather than snaring the litterer, any day. At least with the hares, if one is so inclined, one can use a gun, a net or a dog. Not so with litterers. In regard to the motion currently before the House, we should look at the vastness of the areas concerned and the very small number of staff available to police them. </PARA>
<PARA> Undoubtedly, the greatest deterrent to any offender is the fear of detection. Bearing this in mind, I would be obliged if the honourable member for Corio could explain to me how, in relation to this motion, he proposes to trace the owners of glass products and non-biodegradable containers not placed in the areas designated for their disposal. Does he really believe that deliberate litterers wait until they are being observed by some representative of officialdom before dropping their unwanted rubbish? Does he seriously think that these people will seek out one staff member of the, on average, 43.84 staff who service the almost two million hectares of Kakadu, or one of the 19 staff responsible for the 132,538 hectares of Uluru, and brazenly deposit their little piles of litter at their feet? Perhaps he envisages a special patrol of non-biodegradable container dropper spotters, continually on the prowl, or a team of fingerprint experts ready to dust off each offending glass product and match the prints against the National Crime Authority or Interpol fingerprint registers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no way known that the existing park staff, whose meagre numbers include maintenance, scientific, management and administration personnel, park rangers, guides and the people who care for the native flora and fauna, could ever hope to adequately police the vast areas under their control. It would be a Herculean, if not impossible, task. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative would be to appoint additional staff whose singular responsibility would be litter control. Certainly the numbers required would be considerable and may help to make a dent in the spiralling unemployment figures; but who is going to pay for these detection teams? Who is going to supervise the persons, if any, convicted of incorrect disposal offences? It reminds me of the old song, `Who takes care of the caretaker's daughter while the caretaker's busy taking care?'. Under the terms of the motion we are debating this morning, persons convicted of littering in national parks would be liable to not less than eight hours supervised rubbish clearing. In some instances-for example, the deliberate breakage of glass products-the suggested sentence is 24 hours actual time. Item 4 provides for a doubling of the penalty for recurring offences. Is it possible that a recidivist deliberate glass-breaker could be looking at weeks-even months-of supervised rubbish clearing?</PARA>
<PARA> The motion does not specify who would be responsible for the supervision. Certainly it could not be the existing park staff, who would have to be diverted from other more important tasks. In any event, with the current fiscal restraints on park management, not enough staff would be available for this sort of supervisory activity. Therefore, in addition to the detection teams, we are looking at employing squads of supervisors who will spend unproductive hours watching other people pick up rubbish. That will mean more wasted time, effort and money. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal is-and I make no apology for the pun-littered with deficiencies and impracticalities. For example, what if the offender is incapacitated or disabled in some way and cannot physically spend X number of hours picking up rubbish? What if he or she does not have the financial resources to revisit the area? In the case of the deliberate glass-product breaker, is the 24-hour minimum sentence to be carried out over a single unbroken period, over several days or over a week? In fact this very idea may encourage an increase in littering-a `Why not drop it unnoticed, because someone else may be caught and will need something to pick up' mentality. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) will examine in greater detail some of the many other unworkable and unclear provisions contained within this motion, and the costs and difficulties associated with attempting to police it. However, in the 15 minutes allowed we are hardly able to do the job justice. Unfortunately, the whole thing is rubbish. Perhaps the best outcome would be to gently and carefully biodegrade it or recycle it into something more practical. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the motion put forward by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). I think the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) has gone off on something of a tangent on this issue and has not done justice at all to the motion moved by my colleague, or to the seriousness with which the issue is taken by people in this chamber, in the gallery and in the wider community. It is a matter of great interest to all of us who have care and concern for national parks and try at all times to make appropriate provisions to ensure that people obey and comply with the basic rules relating to pollution-free nature that we seek in national parks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Casey suggested basically a hands-off approach-`Let us have an education campaign; hopefully that will do the job and we will not have to worry too much about the polluters, because they will take care of things themselves'. In New South Wales there are examples of polluters being left to run their own race. For example, in respect of the disposal of chemicals and the pollution of areas such as the Hawkesbury-which the member for Lindsay (Mr Free), who is in the chamber, could talk about-the State Government has said, `Let's leave it to these people to self-regulate and self-control pollution'. As result we have the worst possible conditions prevailing. </PARA>
<PARA> In areas such as the Parramatta River, which rightly should be seen as an area of great national significance, polluters have been allowed to engage in any sort of activity, and when the matter is raised with the New South Wales Pollution Control Commission, it says, `Well, we do not have the resources to regulate it; self-regulation will be the way'. That is what the honourable member for Casey was talking about today when he referred to people disposing of glass products and other sorts of things. Rather than come into the chamber and say, `Well, we will talk about developing recycling strategies and so forth for products', he said, `No, we will not talk about that. We will let people do basically what they like'. I agree; it is healthy to have education campaigns, anyway. But that is not an end in itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Corio, in putting forward this motion, sought to come to grips with the problem. He did not speak negatively about the need to have recycling, and he has drawn the logical distinction between non-biodegradable products and biodegradable products, for obvious reasons. It is clear in respect of the long term implications-the damage and destruction that will be caused to national park and wilderness areas-that glass items and so forth will continue to be a litter, pollution and environmental problem for a long time to come. I think it is right that we demand that the whole community treat this issue as one very much in the public consciousness, which is what this motion seeks to ensure. </PARA>
<PARA> Under existing arrangements with the penalty provisions that have applied, little positive action has been taken to ensure any enforcement. The inconsistencies between the State and Federal requirements in this field are part of the problem that occurs when one tries to ensure that there is a real, constructive and concerted campaign against polluters. It is not fair enough to say, as the honourable member for Casey said, `Well, let us opt out of this area; let us say that it is not our problem. Educate the people; they will do the right thing and that will be the end of the problem'. We have to take a genuine and committed interest in our national parks and wilderness areas. It is only by having firm and constructive processes in place that we can ensure that happens. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the fundamental experience based on this self-regulation model outlined by the honourable member for Casey has been tried and is an absolute failure under the Greiner Government in New South Wales in that area. Environmental protection in that State has become a joke. For example, no environmental protection against chemical pollution of the  atmosphere is carried out west of Parramatta in the Sydney metropolitan area. That is an absolute scandal. Now we are getting reports about the tremendous problem with smog which occurs in Sydney. I know as a representative of one of the electorates in western Sydney how great that problem is, and yet we still have members of the Opposition saying, `Let us not bother about any form of regulation, prevention and proper enforcement provisions in regard to polluters and their activities in national parks; we can just accept that occurs automatically'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Putting all of Sydney's air pollution into biodegradable containers would be a great task. I am not sure whether that meant the previous speaker, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), was unable to sustain a debate of five minutes on this motion. I support the speech of the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) because of the impracticalities of the motion. It is not that the Opposition thinks the motion does not have merit, but, like all pieces of legislation, proposals and motions which come before this chamber, it has to be practical. It is obvious that the proposal brought to the House today has some serious gaps.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know the honourable member for Casey is concerned about ensuring that in his area there is no littering of rubbish and so forth occurring in areas such as the Healesville Sanctuary, which is well known to many Australians as a beautiful spot to visit. He is concerned, as are other members of the Opposition, about national parks and reserve areas to ensure that people do not litter them. I do not think anybody in Australia would not be concerned about that. However, as legislators, when we look at proposals like this we have to ensure that they are practical and that there is no duplication and inconsistency with other legislation in place. As the Federal Parliament, we have particular roles to play in the federal system of government in Australia, yet we are talking about our responsibility for rubbish bins around the country. That is largely the responsibility of other people and other levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at a couple of the impracticalities of this motion. One relates to Commonwealth areas, which are covered by Commonwealth law. Are we also going to ensure that all the post office areas and all the defence areas are going to be maintained in the same way? The motion now before the House is very loosely worded. The Opposition does not object to its sentiments; the Opposition is opposed to littering and wants to make sure that offenders are dealt with. However, the practicalities in the wording of this motion mean that it is questionable whether it should be debated. Why limit it to containers? The honourable member for Casey pointed out that many other things, such as old tyres and nappies, are left around in these areas. Why do we not cover those things? They are just as bad as litter as the items that are mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> There are literally thousands of sites covered by Commonwealth law in Australia, including post offices, defence areas and Commonwealth buildings throughout the length and breadth of this country. It will take a massive number of people to police these areas and sites, and it is just not possible to do so. With the release of the unemployment figures today, maybe this is what is really intended by this motion. Maybe a few tens of thousands of people will be soaked up to do the policing. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area indicates that the person who has offended will be supervised while collecting the rubbish in, say, a national park or reserve area. On the one hand, we will have a person who has offended, probably by breaking one bottle, having to spend eight hours in a national park collecting rubbish and being supervised by another person. Really, it defies logic when we think about the cost involved, particularly at this time when we understand the severe pressure on the Federal Government's Budget. Through this motion we are suggesting that there are ample funds to police all these things. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, we agree with the sentiments of the motion. We would like to see all our reserves and national parks kept neat and tidy and offenders dealt with. In reality, this motion is impractical, it has inconsistencies and it duplicates some of the measures already in place. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak in one of those rare parliamentary debates which brings before us, as law-makers, the question of first principles. I rise to speak on and in support of the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> In making my comments today, I am conscious that the debate concerning abortion is very complex. It has medical, legal, theological, ethical, social and personal aspects. It is a highly emotional subject and involves acutely painful dilemmas. I have presented this Bill, however, and have sought to have it debated because for too long the Parliament has avoided the issue of abortion, precisely because of that complexity. In that regard, I thank the Selection Committee of the House, under the Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), for its decision to allocate time for this debate, however brief it might be. </PARA>
<PARA> In presenting this Bill in this place on 6 December last year, I outlined both the reasons for and the objectives of the Bill. It is appropriate now to summarise both briefly. The Commonwealth's main involvement with abortion is through Medicare subsidisation of abortion procedures, almost without exception. Therefore, the Bill addresses the Medicare subsidisation of abortion and seeks to allow Medicare funding only for abortions performed to avert the death of the mother, and in cases where the procedure is for a different purpose and where the doctor was unaware that an abortion would occur. The Bill also requires doctors to certify that the reason for any abortion was to avert the mother's death or that it occurred indirectly, and there is absolutely no incursion into the privacy between the doctor and the patient, as many would seem to imply. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now refer to some economic trends which add to the pressures to use abortion as a means of birth control. In individual situations, very often it revolves around a conflict between the continuation of the pregnancy and the effect that this will have on the mother's or father's individual or collective financial situation, their future plans and their current lifestyle, or whether a boy is wanted and an ultrasound test shows that a girl has been conceived. </PARA>
<PARA> In these conflicts the unborn baby has no choice and too often loses out, essentially because it is small, unknown, defenceless and voiceless. Those responsible know that the community will turn a blind eye to the killing of its youngest members. Recently a circular was put out by the New South Wales-based women's abortion action campaign in opposition to the proposed Abortion Funding Abolition Bill. In this circular the group, which is said to have close ties with particular abortion centres in Sydney, admits quite openly that the main reasons for abortion are social and economic factors and not life-threatening medical conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> We can address this problem by legislative, legal and other means, including advertising the availability of the support services for pregnant women through public education campaigns, and articulating the arguments in defence of human life. We must make every effort to reduce the economic pressures which weigh on the mind of the mother so heavily that often the baby becomes expendable. There is no doubt that deliberate abortion has become entrenched in the Australian community as a form of birth control. There are no nationally collated statistics for abortion in Australia, but some guide as to numbers can be obtained from the statistics for Medicare claims made under the abortion items 6469, 274 and 275 of the Medical Benefits Schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> Since abortion item 6469 became part of the Medical Benefits Schedule on 1 April 1975-without the vote of Parliament-it is estimated conservatively that successive governments have subsidised over 750,000 deliberate abortions at a cumulative cost for this item alone of $80m. The inescapable conclusion is that the Commonwealth Government is underwriting the Australian abortion industry and is lining the pockets of a relatively small number of abortionists at taxpayers' expense. </PARA>
<PARA> An alarming fact is that the number of abortions is increasing each year. The latest abortion statistics show that during 1989-90 abortionists were directly subsidised by the taxpayer for almost 70,000 abortions at a cost of $7.8m. There were other associated payments which netted the abortionists several million dollars more. The latest figures, which were released to a Senate Estimates committee in September 1990, represent an increase of 4,800 over the previous year and an increase of 7,600 in the past two years. Any increase in the number of births has been almost offset by an increase in subsidised abortions. Abortions are increasing at a proportionately higher rate than births, which is a most disturbing development. </PARA>
<PARA> I have put the following question to honourable members before: is the embryo-foetus a human person some of the time or any of the time before it is born? If only some of the time, what is the suggested non-arbitrary marker point? Why is it right for the community to involve itself in the affairs of a seven-months-pregnant woman but not a two-months-pregnant woman? If the foetus is worthless and a woman's property, what would be wrong with women falling pregnant with the intention of having an abortion for the purpose of selling foetal tissue to transplant or research clinics?</PARA>
<PARA> Those outside the House who have followed the debate on this Bill will know that its opponents wish to focus not on the primary question of rights recognition for the unborn, but on the question of whether the Bill will have a greater impact on low income women than on high income women. I acknowledge that there are many compassionate men and women in this place whose concern for the poor, and poor women in particular, and whose anger at the capacity of the rich to buy their way around their moral and legal obligations blind them to the question of first principles. In failing to focus on the primary question, however, their response to this Bill is misdirected. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to those who see their opposition to this Bill as an act of solidarity with the poor that the problem facing a pregnant poor woman or a dependant woman is not the pregnancy but the poverty and the dependency. It is the poverty that is unwanted, not the child. As I can understand but never institutionalise desperate acts of infanticide by poor women, I understand but cannot institutionalise abortion by poor women. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not deny that a society marked by inequality will place unbearable burdens on many women facing parenthood, but I say to honourable members: let us not take the easy and cheap path of paying Medicare money to suppress the problem on an abortion clinic table. Let us develop family policies that sustain a woman in pregnancy and parenthood. There are those who speak mindlessly of unwanted pregnancies leading to abused and neglected children. To those people I say: look at the staggering growth of abuse and neglect and at homeless youth in a society with free and legal abortion. Is it not possible that the subversion of respect for life by the abortion industry and abortion philosophies is responsible for the increasing violence against children? Is it not likely that there is some deeper spiritual problem in our society at the root of violence against both the unborn and children?</PARA>
<PARA> In Australia laws on abortion are often attacked on the ground that parliaments have no business imposing their moral views on citizens. The problem with that argument is that virtually all laws are based on morality, or at least on someone's view of it. In considering the Bill, we, individually and as a Parliament, have before us only two choices: we can choose life or we can choose death. There are no in between arguments or debate. We cannot be pro-choice; we are either pro-life or pro-death. I urge honourable members to think very hard about all the issues involved and to choose life. I urge honourable members to support this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill. Each day society is outraged when it hears of the rapes, murders and other violent crimes committed to our fellow men or women, yet most sit mute when, at whim, a young innocent unborn life is terminated in the time it would take to snap one's fingers. Yet the termination of young unborn babies in this country is not only tolerated but also legal-what a tragic indictment on our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) has eloquently articulated his private member's Bill. No-one can doubt his obvious sincerity in introducing it. To my mind this Bill deserves much more consideration than the limited time available for debate here today. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had the unfortunate experience of listening to a number of women confess to serious emotional disorders because of aborting a child years earlier. An address by John O. Anderson in 1989 on post-abortion grief in part highlighted some of this grief. I quote from part of his paper:</PARA>
<PARA> It had been about a year since she had had her abortion. At the time she had felt relief; and no apparent problems since. </PARA>
<PARA> But now she was walking alone down a shopping mall. Coming toward her was a young husband and wife, happily pushing a stroller with a baby. As she eyed the infant, she mentally calculated, `If the baby I was carrying had been born, it would be about the age of this one.' And then it happened: she was suddenly gripped with anguish; she wanted to cry; struggling with her emotions, she hurried out of the mall. </PARA>
<PARA>What happened to this young woman? Did she suffer from post-abortion grief, the syndrome that just in the past few years has been given a psychological designation? Most likely she did, and her story could be repeated thousands of times. </PARA>
<PARA> Only recently have we come to grips with the reality that abortion has emotional after-effects. However, society has not understood or perhaps even wanted to admit that this problems exists. It seems that no matter which side of the abortion question we are on, we should honestly face this issue. Let us be clear that post-abortion grief for many women is not a myth, but a reality. We are finding that hundreds of thousands of women who have aborted their children exhibit a deeply disturbing trend of psychological distress and physical harm. Through a growing number of studies and from the testimonies of the women themselves, evidence is piling up to show that abortion is adversely affecting society. Much of the evidence has been collected only recently. </PARA>
<PARA> One woman wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Little did I know at 19 years of age that my abortion was the beginning of years of pain, heartache and guilt, such trauma that led me to drinking and drug abuse to numb the pain, that I couldn't change what I did. </PARA>
<PARA>Another woman wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Post-abortive stress, it is real. Like a person who goes to war and comes home only to have people tell him, `Oh that is behind you'. A woman who undergoes an abortion can no more follow that kind of shallow advice than a veteran suffering from post-war stress. You don't just `put' the taking of a human life from inside your womb `behind you'. It never leaves your memory. </PARA>
<PARA>Post-abortion syndrome, which may well afflict millions of women, is still surrounded by a conspiracy of silence in the largely pro-abortion media and medical organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> In our society it is easy to become isolated. Many women are alone without family or friendly support systems and their pain can go unrecognised. Couple this with poverty, low self-esteem, feelings of uselessness and purposelessness, confusion about relationships and their own identity and on top of this an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and where do women turn? Sure, pregnancy support centres do meet some needs. Initially, most centres provide assistance for those women who are distressed about an unplanned pregnancy, but as time has progressed these support centres are providing caring, supportive counselling services to all pregnant women in need. Apart from this one-to-one work, there are often opportunities to do other types of preventative work, for example, sex education in schools and natural family planning. But more needs to be done to help these areas of support. </PARA>
<PARA> We, as legislators, have a responsibility to accept that challenge. The private member's Bill introduced by the honourable member for Macquarie is the catalyst for that challenge. I urge the House to support his Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) in speaking to his private member's Bill, the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 1990, which is also sponsored by the Parliamentary Pro-Life Group, of which I am proud to be a member. I do so in the knowledge that the issue of Medicare funding for abortion is a subject which arouses great emotion within the Australian community. I do so in the sure knowledge that many in the community support abortions on demand, but that should never be a final determinant of the position of a member of parliament on any issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To influence me in making my decision as to whether or not to support the Bill, the pro-abortionists have pushed the argument that in recent years pro-life legislators have suffered electorally as a result of their beliefs. I do not believe that is in fact the case, but even if it were, that also should not be a final determinant of a member's position. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the fact that I am a male discussing an issue that physically affects the lives of women and I am aware that many women in the community believe the matter to be a matter of decision making only for women. I reject the latter proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Our responsibility in debating this Bill is to choose whether or not we believe that taxpayers' funds should be used to pay for abortions where there is no risk to the life of the mother. The Bill raises fundamental questions as to the concept of the beginning of life and where our responsibility for the preservation of life begins. </PARA>
<PARA> On a previous occasion the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) commented that there is no clear agreement on when human life begins; that, taken to its logical conclusion, the objection to interfering with the chance of a human life eventuating would preclude contraception or family planning. He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>The best way to reduce the number of abortions is to have better sex education, better and more family planning and indeed more support for those who find themselves in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with the honourable member's latter statement. However, in the context of this Bill, it is not the central issue. The debate on this Bill turns on whether or not a community should pay for the termination of the life of an unborn individual whose fate is determined by circumstances other than the risk to the life of the mother. </PARA>
<PARA> If we accept the use of taxes to fund abortions on demand, we are in essence concluding that there is a period of embryonic development where there are no inherent rights attributable to the unborn individual which are equal or superior to those of the rest of the community. In other words, we are making a judgment as to when the rights of an unborn individual begin. In supporting abortion on demand we are saying that those rights begin at a stage after the stage of embryonic development that physically permits a termination of the pregnancy. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate is not one about freedom of choice. An individual's right to life is not a matter of choice. If it were, we would be making a determination about the relative value of a particular life that is not ours to make. In the end there is no greater responsibility for a society than to ensure that it survives. Those of us entrusted with making decisions on behalf of our greater community, the Australian nation, have a basic duty to provide for measures that are consistent with that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> We are tolerating a situation where taxpayer funded abortions are increasing at a rate greater than the increase in the number of births. As a society, we have a significant number of adult members who are precluded from adopting Australian-born children because of the decline in our birth rate. As a consequence, they are often faced with the prospect of going overseas to seek potential adoptees. The decline in our birth rate is ageing our society and forcing us to rely on immigration for replacement members, rather than on native births. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the measures that we, as legislators, have taken in this situation? What is the conclusion that can be drawn from our financial support for the voluntary termination of the lives of unborn individuals? In an article in the Melbourne Sunday Age on 10 March this year, Jo Wainer, a leading pro-abortionist, stated that the recession was forcing more and more women to seek abortions. A senior counsellor at the Fertility Control Clinic, Mrs June Dryburgh, contended that economy was always a factor for women considering an abortion. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest argument used in opposing the abolition of Medicare funding for abortion on demand is that only the wealthy will be able to afford proper medical supervision, while the poor will be forced to resort to backyard or unsafe procedures. That is at the heart of the argument of those who claim that abortion on demand is a matter of freedom of choice. In the end, the nub of their argument for abortion on demand is one of economy. Human life itself becomes subservient to financial considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> The preservation of life is fundamental to our society. One cannot equivocate when considering that principle. The use of taxpayers' money to fund the termination of the lives of unborn individuals is wrong and should be discontinued. This Bill sets out to right that wrong. I commend the Bill to the House and congratulate its mover, the honourable member for Macquarie, on taking this historic step towards restoring a basic human right-the right to life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have mentioned before in this place, I respect the views and opinions of the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster). I believe he is very genuine and sincere; I just disagree with him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The argument that is used is very subtle in a number of ways. One of the ways in which it is subtle is that we do not refer to doctors; we refer to abortionists, as though the people who carry out these procedures are not medical practitioners with the highest ethical standards that we would expect. We also use an argument which equates termination with murder. If that is the case, and if that is in fact the argument that we want to use in this circumstance, then what we should be doing here is providing that all of those medical practitioners who engage in this activity should be charged with murder. Indeed, that is a logical consequence of what the honourable member is suggesting although, of course, he never goes that far because he understands, as I do, that when it comes to moral questions it is a case of what it is better than or worse than; it is a case of making fine judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member suggested that this is a very complex issue. None of us would suggest that there is not a difference between the man who steals to feed his starving children and the man who steals because he wants a new swimming pool in the backyard. We would make a moral judgment as to stealing in those circumstances and it is necessary in each circumstance to make those sorts of judgments when we talk about moral issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, when does an acorn becomes an oak tree? Where do you draw the line? This is one of the great problems in this debate, and I accept that. It has been mentioned by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), and it is the case, that if one is going to draw the line at contraception, and say that contraception is okay but anything that happens after that is different, then why should one not draw the line at birth? Indeed, there is no-one who can come up with a convincing argument one way or the other. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look for scientific evidence, as has been suggested, the scientific community cannot arrive at a consensus as to where life begins. There is a great deal of conflict in that regard. In my last speech in the House on this matter I mentioned that evidence and, indeed, a large body of very eminent scientists came to the conclusion that they cannot make a judgment on where life begins. </PARA>
<PARA> If one goes to the Catholic Church, which of course is one of the strongest bodies that opposes abortion, one finds that there is no consensus amongst its members, either. The way in which they treat a miscarried foetus and a newborn child that has died is different. If the Catholic Church makes that distinction, then who are we to question its position?</PARA>
<PARA> I oppose the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill for two reasons. First, I do not think that it will achieve its very laudable aim of reducing the number of abortions, an aim that I would support. Second, I believe that a significant issue in this respect is freedom of conscience and the freedom of people to make those decisions for themselves in our society. I would argue that the rights of the mother and the rights of the child change during the period following conception until birth. Indeed, perhaps there is a time when we have to say, `Okay, the rights of the child, when this foetus is viable, become stronger'. But that is a difficult question. Nobody has satisfied me with respect to an answer to it. Those who want it in black and white are fooling themselves; they are looking for a simple solution which does not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Moore mentioned the issue of taxpayers' funds being used for things that people should disagree with. This is a facile argument and one which should be destroyed because, consistent with that same argument, those taxpayers who do not have children at school should object to school funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Removing Medicare funding for abortion will not change what is available. Abortions are not underpinned by Medicare funding; they are underpinned by the fact that there are unwanted pregnancies. Unwanted pregnancies are a result of ignorance, poor education, rape in some circumstances, failed contraception or just a mistake. Those unwanted pregnancies will remain and the choice will remain for women. It needs to be understood that there are ways of combating this: better sex education, as has been mentioned; family planning; better support from us; more tolerance and compassion; support from family members; and support from other members of the community. Those things are important and necessary if we wish to decrease the number of abortions. If this legislation is passed, it will change the available treatment. That would be a mistake; it would be undesirable. That is why I oppose this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, support the private member's Bill of the honourable member for the Macquarie (Mr Webster), the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 1990. There is no doubt that this would be one of the most emotional issues to come before this Parliament and it is an issue that concerns all members of the community and all members of Parliament. It is not an issue of Christian versus non-Christian or Catholic versus non-Catholic or Labor versus Liberal; it is matter of fundamental concern to everybody. I hope that this Parliament will ultimately vote in support of this historic Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In answer to some of the questions that the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) raises-and I note that he would like to see a reduction in the number of abortions and I consider that a very positive contribution-I do not question the ethics of those medical practitioners who are involved in carrying out abortions, but I do question their morality. I do question their theology and their motivation. The real question here is: why should Australians in the broad sense fund abortion on demand? I guess the fundamental issue that is raised in this Bill is the question of why abortions should be provided at the cost of the taxpayers. Of course, in a broader context it raises the whole issue of abortion. Therefore it is a very important Bill that deserves to be discussed to the full extent. </PARA>
<PARA> In the end, it boils down to a question of economics. The question then becomes one of why human life itself should become subservient to financial considerations. I pose the question: how many of those who espouse human rights would suggest that those rights should be circumscribed by financial considerations? For that matter, in taking the line of those who contend that the availability of abortion provides freedom of choice, is a person who chooses to terminate a human life because of financial pressures making a valid choice or is the so-called choice, that of abortion, actually made for her? Are we, if we allow for the continuation of funding for abortions, in effect making that choice for people?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot recall the number of people who have contacted me after applying for public housing and being told that nothing is available. Indeed, many have been informed that their names would go onto the waiting list and that suitable accommodation may not be available for up to three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Inevitably, these people are on low incomes. Often the main breadwinner has lost his or her job and can no longer afford to pay private rental accommodation or, in an increasing number of cases, families have lost their homes because they have been unable to meet their mortgage repayments. Previous record high interest rates and now rapidly escalating unemployment have meant that a growing number of Australian families are unable to stay in their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the circumstances, the only option for these families is public housing. Consequently they are devastated by the news that there is no accommodation available and that they face a wait, in some cases, of up to three years. They come to me desperately searching for alternatives. Many are looking for a way in which their applications can be speeded up and the names brought to the top of the list. Unfortunately, in most cases, this is just not possible. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the human side of a serious problem stemming from our State and Federal public housing policies. The deficiency of these policies has been highlighted by the impact of the current economic recession. Housing, particularly public housing, is a national problem which will not be resolved until the Commonwealth, in conjunction with the States, adopts a new and innovative approach. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia, especially in my own electorate of Forrest, the shortage of public housing is well documented. Each of the main centres in Forrest has experienced a significant increase in the demand for public housing in recent years. As a consequence of this, the waiting period for housing has also increased considerably. In Albany, the southernmost tip of my electorate, a single person could currently have to wait for over four years for public accommodation; a pensioner, 3 1/2 years; and a family, just over 2 1/2 years. In Denmark, a family may wait for up to three years before being placed on the public housing list. In Busselton, the average waiting period for a family is 2 1/2 years, while in Bunbury, a family can wait three years depending on the size of the house and the location required. </PARA>
<PARA> The experience of my electorate reflects the national situation. The number of individuals and families waiting for public housing around the country currently stands at nearly 200,000, an increase of some 40 per cent in just five years. For all of these families the difficulty lies in trying to meet the cost of rental accommodation in the private market while waiting for a house to become available. A recent national study indicated a significant number of low income families not in public housing spend more than 40 per cent of their income on rent. As the Government's recession-induced policies continue to bite, unemployment becomes more widespread and real wages continue to fall, the demand for, and strain on, public housing will continue to worsen. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia this is happening at a time when the State Government can least afford it. The State's notorious big leather satchel, its Consolidated Revenue Fund, has suffered under the combined effects of the national economic downturn and the State Government's many misguided and highly dubious business dealings. </PARA>
<PARA> This year in Western Australia the State Housing Commission has budgeted to spend $65.5m on the construction of public housing. This is a massive 47 per cent reduction in real terms in the amount spent in the last financial year-that being $110.1m. Land acquisition and development spending has also been savagely cut from $78m in 1989-90 to $52.5m in 1990-91. While the State was able to prop up its spending in the last financial year by calling into account some $101m in internal funds, this source has now been exhausted and the result has been savage cutbacks in government services, including public housing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is imperative now more than ever that the Government get best value for every dollar spent on public housing. This must extend not only to the construction of public houses, but to their management, administration and maintenance. Similarly, checks on tenants of public housing must be frequently undertaken to ensure their circumstances have not changed and that the system has not been abused. </PARA>
<PARA> I previously suggested that the Commonwealth encourage or even provide incentives for the States to make better use of their housing grants. It is time for the States to become more innovative and forward thinking in the area of public housing. For example, the States should look seriously at an accelerated plan to sell off public housing to long term tenants. In doing this, they would be giving a large number of Australian families the opportunity of realising the great Australian dream of owning their own home. </PARA>
<PARA> Most Australian State governments offer limited home purchase finance schemes, but these rely essentially on government capital as the source of funds. Consequently, the schemes do little or nothing to free up resources which can then be redirected to increase the stocks of public houses. Instead, by offering public houses for sale on favourable terms and finance on a commercial basis, there is scope for governments to raise additional revenue. However, a fundamental feature of any such proposal would be to have that revenue raised and channelled into increasing the supply of public housing. </PARA>
<PARA> A second benefit accruing to government would be a reduction in maintenance costs. Collectively, the States currently spend just over $240m per annum on maintenance. If public houses were sold off, particularly the older houses, State governments could realise significant savings, which again would be directed to increasing the overall stock of housing. The Commonwealth could also encourage the States to utilise private sector resources to complement the existing government services. For example, some public housing authorities already contract out maintenance duties to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other innovative measures which can be actively pursued by the States-measures which involve greater cooperation with, and participation by, the private sector. One such measure has been developed recently and implemented by the New South Wales Government. I take this opportunity to congratulate my colleagues in that State on their innovative approach to the issue of public housing. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Government, concerned about the growing public housing waiting list and yet mindful of the State's limited financial position, looked to the private sector for assistance in increasing the stock of public housing. It recently entered into a partnership with the AMP Society, the aim of which is to provide 1,000 new homes for rental for those on the public housing waiting list. While the 1,000 new homes will be constructed or acquired as part of the New South Wales Department of Housing capital works program, the finance, totalling some $145m, will be provided solely by AMP. Thus the housing stock available for public tenants has been substantially increased without the associated government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The properties will be managed and maintained by the New South Wales Department of Housing in the same manner as all other government housing. Returns to the investor are a consumer price index floor on capital gain and a real rental return. If State governments are to have any hope of catering for the growing demand for public housing they must become more progressive and forward thinking. They need to cooperate more with the private sector to maximise the funds they have available. Equally, there is a role for the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth must encourage the development and the use of these schemes, whether it is through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement or the Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, the Commonwealth must create the right economic environment so that the public housing system will not be overburdened. A healthy economy and full employment will offer the greatest assistance to the States in ensuring that only those in genuine need move into the public housing system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Over the last few weeks in Federal Parliament we have heard the Opposition, in particular the Liberal Party of Australia, posturing about accountability and raising as a high principle its opposition to slush funds. This comes from a party that for 26 years was in bed with the National Party in Queensland-the most corrupt and sleazy Party in Australia's history; a Party that showed how to put one's head in the trough and rip off the system without any controls or accountability over a period of 32 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the Liberal Party is entitled to raise matters of accountability, honesty and integrity, it is interesting that I have before me, on Liberal Party of Australia, Queensland division, letterhead, the following release called `Sallyanne's Slush Fund':</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee to Elect Sallyanne Atkinson was established in 1984 in the lead-up to the `85 BCC election, primarily to provide non-Liberal party funds for her Lord Mayoral campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's first Chairman was National Party identity, Geoff Dee. He was later replaced by property developer Rod Samutt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Forde knows a lot about those two characters. The release continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Much of the estimated $220,000 raised for Atkinson's first campaign by the committee came from local property developers and southern business interests.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, as we know, in Queensland, under the former National Party regime, as long as a person had white shoes and he had the right connections and a brown paper bag, he could get anything through the system-anything at all. The release continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Apart from Samutt and Dee, other members of the committee included John Alpass, Julian Beirne, Digby Mcleay, Lyn Everingham, Rod Williams, Barry Paul.</PARA>
<PARA>Only Atkinson can authorise access to the funds. The Liberal Party is not permitted to scrutinise donors in accordance with its funding codes. No Liberal Party official has dealt with the committee for the past 2-years. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee is now a law unto itself. It has, of course, been renamed the Committee to Re-elect Sallyanne Atkinson. </PARA>
<PARA>Following Atkinson's `85 victory, the committee's fundraising really took off. Liberal Party officials now estimate that the committee has raised in excess of $600,000 since `85 although it's believed only a fraction of this amount actually went to the `88 Liberal campaign. </PARA>

<PARA>Samutt has been rewarded with the Chairmanship of the Office of Economic Development. </PARA>
<PARA>Disquiet within the Liberal Party to the growth of the un-audited slush fund is growing but new Party President Bill Everingham is attempting to keep the lid on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA>Former Party Vice President Grant Cameron resigned in disgust several months ago at the committee's activities, particularly given the Liberal's financial crisis. </PARA>

<PARA>Of course, what it shows is the hypocrisy of the other side of the House over the last three weeks talking about accountability and honesty. We have just seen a waste disposal company gain about $8m with the sweetheart deal that was done with the Liberal Party, rushed through just before the last local government election. It would be interesting to know how much went from that shonky company into Sallyanne Atkinson's secret slush fund to promote the Liberal Party in the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Lord Mayor is trying to change the arrangements. It is a matter of whether the legal deal that has been tied up can be broken or not. Brisbane has been saddled with something that no-one wants. The gain to that company was about $8m and it would be interesting to know how much money went into the Liberal Party slush fund. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest example of hypocrisy is that this comes from the Liberal Party that was in bed with the most corrupt government in Australia's history, the Queensland National Party Government, for 26 years. Although they are agrarian hillbillies, those in the Queensland National Party showed how one puts one's head in a trough and how one rorts a system-whether it is by drought rorts, graft or corruption, it really does not matter. One of the examples of this was how the police had to queue up--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could talk about a wide variety of matters today, but the Australian Labor Party mateship never ceases to amaze me. I would have thought the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) was too far away from Perth to get tied up in this, but he has been caught up in the scam as well. Perhaps he should read the Brian Burke election manual which is written on both sides of a paper bag; but that is another story.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to grieve on a large number of matters today. The first one, and I think probably the most important, is the diabolical position that the people of Bangladesh find themselves in at the moment. I was horrified to read this morning that the government owned paper is now talking in terms of half a million people. I think that is quite horrific. I know the Government has increased the amount of aid that it is sending and I urge it please to increase that. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I wish to grieve on today is the meat industry inquiry. Honourable members will know that the likes of Wally Curran and his cohorts in Victoria have totally destroyed the industry in that State. We have seen job losses in the thousands. We have seen export earnings reduced in the millions.</PARA>
<PARA> I think everyone was of the view that the meat industry inquiry was probably going to be a means to an end. That has not happened because the union, after 14 months and with three sitting days to go, has pulled out. This has cost a lot of money. It has been a bipartisan approach to the problems in the meat industry. Yet, with three sitting days to go, the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU) has pulled out. The reason is that it is not happy with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It is not happy with the wage decision of a month ago. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intriguing, as reported by Shane Green in the Australian this morning, that the very man who was heading this meat industry inquiry, Mr Harrison, was formerly an assistant national secretary of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union. He has told the meat workers union to get back into that inquiry because he knows that the work practices that have riddled and wrecked that industry for year after year need to be solved. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the union done? It has pulled the plug on the inquiry with three sittings days to go. I believe it is a despicable performance and I hope that Senator Cook wins in his battle with the union to get it back there. It is a further indication that the leaders of the union movement in this country are totally out of step with what the grassroots trade unionists want. They want jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to another point-the 9.9 per cent unemployment rate that was announced this morning. I will be pleased to see the would-be Prime Minister come in here and tell the Australian people that it is a good figure and it is on track. It is off track. His leadership ambition is off track. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know and everyone in this House knows of the toing and froing over the last few months. Those in the New South Wales Right have been trying to get their boy up; it has been going on. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I know that positions would be offered to various people if the coup comes off. </PARA>
<PARA> I challenge the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to come in here today and to tell the Australian people whether he is healthy or otherwise. If he comes back in here in two months time and says that he is unhealthy and has to give it away, we will know and the Australian people will know that it was a con job and that a deal was done with the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to get him out. Let us hear what the Prime Minister has to say. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us hear what the Treasurer has to say on this 9.9 per cent figure. I have been here for 13 months and every single day during Question Time we hear about `Howard in 1983'. If we combine the unemployment rate and the underemployment rate, guess who has got the worst figures? It is the Treasurer-not the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), but the Treasurer. That does not take into account the April underemployment rate. We are as close to 10 per cent as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, we have not even had a drought yet, and you know full well that that drought was a major component of the recession that we went through in 1982-83. Every person in this House had better keep his or her fingers crossed that the winter drought that we are potentially facing at the moment does not come off. Honourable members from Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria know very well that we are in an extremely dry period at the moment and heaven help us if we do not get a lot of rain shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics was reported yesterday as saying that wheat planting will be potentially down by 25 per cent and the farmers' groups are saying that it could be down by 50 per cent. That will potentially spell further disaster for a rural sector that is already in depression and not recession. </PARA>
<PARA> If my colleagues from both sides of the House took the time to go out to rural electorates, they would know very well the depth of that depression. They know very well the depressed state of mind of country people. In regard to my home town of Ballarat, I have not seen the relative unemployment figures today, but I can tell the House that the youth unemployment rate two months ago was approaching 29 per cent. Twenty-nine per cent of our young people are unemployed. That is frightening, in my view. They will not be given the opportunity to get that work experience and the potential is there for them to get on the social security wagon-the birth-to-death syndrome. Quite frankly, we owe our young people considerably more than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Just getting back to the AMIEU, I challenge it to get back before Mr Harrison today, and I challenge it to take very seriously the threat of the National Farmers Federation that if it does not do so, it should be deregistered. If Senator Cook is really serious about this problem he will support those moves and he will have that union deregistered. </PARA>
<PARA> Victoria, as a result of the Cain-Kirner Government over the last eight or nine years, quite frankly, is an economic mess. It is a total mess. The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) knows what it is like. He knows what the state of mind of the Melbourne people is. I can tell him that it is three times as bad in the country and at the moment they are holding no hope for their future. The sooner that Government goes, the better, and the sooner this Government goes, the better. I tell honourable members on the other side to spend a bit of time here during lunch to pick themselves a seat with a view because they are going to be on this side for a long time and the better the seat, the better the view. </PARA>

<PARA> Tim Colebatch, in the Age this morning, referred to the Government's construction forecasting committee which yesterday forecast new pictures of deep gloom for the nation's building investment prospects. We get the Treasurer coming in here day after day telling us that investment is taking place and that investment is on track. Mr Colebatch writes:</PARA>
<PARA>The experts predict that not only will the building slump be worse than previously thought but there will be no real recovery for years. Total building activity in three years' time will be even lower than it is now. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Colebatch writes that the Committee forecasts that-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The economy will remain `subdued' before slowly recovering to a growth rate of about 2.5 per cent by 1993-94. That is barely one-third the growth rate experienced in the 1984 recovery, implying that the country faces the worst run of years since the Great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA>This is pretty strong stuff. This is coming from the Government's own committee. Mr Colebatch writes that the Committee forecasts that-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The annual value of non-residential building activity will slump by $2.4 billion this financial year and keep falling for three more years. By the time it touches bottom in 1993-94, it will be adding $5 billion, or one-third, less to the economy than it did four years earlier. Investment in factories and other business premises will decline by about 30 per cent over four years, while hotel and office construction will decline by 40 per cent. Education and health buildings will be the only areas showing any growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Investment in housing-seen by the Treasurer, Mr Keating, as the first step in recovery-is set to fall still further. Far from recovering, it is forecast to slump another $700 million or 3.8 per cent over 1991-92, having already fallen $2.9 billion or 14 per cent this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>The realities are that this Government has made an unmitigated mess of this economy. It is about time that it either took some very hard decisions or took its decisions back to the Australian people. I challenge it to do one or the other. It should either do that or go back to the people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was honoured recently when I was asked to be the speaker at a function to launch the establishment of a new group in Queensland called Medical Aid for El Salvador and, subsequently, to become the patron of that organisation. The invitation provided me with an opportunity to learn more about the continuing tragedy in El Salvador and to realise that we still have an enormously long way to go to achieve the basic principles of social justice, peace and freedom for many peoples throughout the world. It also makes one pause and reflect on the fact that, although we may be going through some tough economic times in Australia at the moment, we are still very fortunate indeed to live in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The war in El Salvador has been brutal and has taken a major toll of the country and its people. El Salvador's conflict has claimed some 75,000 lives, more than 40,000 of them civilians, leaving an ever widening circle of shattered families, orphaned children and homeless people. Such problems are exacerbated by the continued abuse of human rights, harassment and torture inflicted on civilians considered to be troublemakers or assisting the forces opposed to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Medical Aid for El Salvador was established in 1982 by a group of United States citizens who were brought together by a common concern for the citizens of El Salvador who had found themselves in the middle of an American-sponsored war. The founders were opposed to the United States Government's policy of providing tens of millions of dollars of military aid to El Salvador. Over the past decade the US has given more than $1 billion in military aid. The US involvement in this conflict props up a repressive, unjust and undemocratic regime and exacerbates the suffering and pain of the people of El Salvador. </PARA>
<PARA> El Salvador has had a long and violent history in which the populace have long opposed the repressive measures of the Government. Its history is characterised by savage repression against any challenge to the economic interests of the powerful. It is the level of social injustice which keeps the war going. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an immense disparity in the distribution of wealth which maintains the large-scale social injustice for the people. The history of El Salvador, and it still remains the same today, tells us that a very small percentage of the population, namely 20 powerful families, owns the vast majority of the country's economic resources. The citizens of El Salvador cannot express their dissatisfaction with the Government by any means except through social unrest.</PARA>
<PARA> With the high level of violence there are, of course, major health problems. The destruction of infrastructure and the pressure on hospital places leave the overall health standard in a poor state. Extra pressure is put on the few health places through the large number of internally displaced people. As a result of the war some 600,000 people are displaced, with 70 per cent of these being women and children. The military coup of 1979 heightened the violence and repression of the workers. Since that time, military and paramilitary death squad violence has occurred. The continual repression of the people by the military has caused a massive allocation of resources to the military and away from basic health and other community services. </PARA>
<PARA> In the mid-1980s more than 40 per cent of the budget was allocated to military expenditure. As well, the continued civil unrest has caused a considerable reduction in health facilities for the local people. Those who oppose the Government are also afraid to go to the state-run hospitals to seek treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1981, for a country of more than four million people, there were 46 state controlled hospitals with a total capacity of only 7,375 beds and 1,793 physicians. The war has seen this number tragically reduced. In 1987, the El Salvadorian Government allocated the equivalent of $A32m towards health or approximately $7.50 per person per annum. The Australian Government allocates more than $750 per person per annum to health care. </PARA>
<PARA> Budgetary pressures, made worse by an annual population growth rate of 3 per cent, have seen the standards of health care, housing and general welfare fall substantially. Only 37 per cent of Salvadorians have access to even minimal health care and, according to the Salvadorian Ministry of Health, 75 per cent of children suffer from malnutrition. </PARA>
<PARA> The flight of professionals, combined with the lack of transportation and other problems, now means that the country has one of the worst health care ratios in the central American region. In 1989, for every 10,000 Salvadorians there were only 3.2 doctors, 2.1 nurses and only 12 hospital beds. Extreme poverty brings major health problems in terms of providing basic dietary requirements, sanitation and drinkable water. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic situation in El Salvador has continued to decline with a fall in prices for agricultural exports and accelerating inflation. Twenty per cent of the population earns 80 per cent of the income, creating a mass of urban and rural poor. There are more than three million Salvadorians-some 60 per cent of the population-who, according to official statistics, live in extreme poverty and do not earn enough to cover what is termed as `the basic shopping basket'.</PARA>
<PARA> The task of caring for those in need and the integration back into society of those displaced has not been assisted by the government authorities and the security forces. The military has often undertaken indiscriminate bombardment of rural areas and has prevented church and volunteer agencies from entering such areas for many days afterwards. These attacks have left many people with poor access to even basic health services. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the United Nations Children's Fund, only 40 per cent of rural Salvadorians now have access to safe water and basic health services. The level of violence in the country has caused a constant flow of peasants to the shanty towns which surround the cities. In and around San Salvador alone are more than 300 shanty towns which have been erected by hundreds of thousands of people fleeing the conflict. These towns are crisscrossed by gullies, along which streams carry the sewage and waste of the city. According to the Government, there is an estimated housing shortfall of nearly half a million homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Demands on humanitarian organisations are extensive and outstripping all capacity to provide for those in dire need. Many volunteer aid agencies-and most noticeably the Catholic Church-are attempting to supply basic drinking water, improve the streets, build housing and set up clinics in many of the shanty towns. These efforts are not always welcomed by the El Salvadorian Government. There is ongoing persecution and selective violence applied to community organisations that are working for the welfare of the poor. </PARA>
<PARA> As with some other countries, those who work to redress the injustices suffered by the poorest and most needy in the community arouse the suspicion of the authorities. There are many brutal accounts of selective terror against those working for social justice: the murder of four church women from the United States; the assassination of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Salvador, Oscar Romero; the slaying of two United States union representatives; and, most notably, in November 1989 the massacre by the military of six Jesuit priests. As recently as three months ago, there was a massacre in the countryside of 15 Salvadorian church workers by the Government's First Brigade-an incident which has gone largely unreported by the Australian media. </PARA>
<PARA> It is this level of persecution of aid workers which has led to the call by the Australian Council for Overseas Aid for the Federal Government to seek diplomatic help to protect aid workers. Of the more than 100 international aid workers who were in El Salvador before the fighting intensified in late 1989, only 20 now remain. Many have been detained, run out of the country, or have left after receiving death threats. It is only with the support of the international aid agencies and workers, such as Medical Aid for El Salvador, that Salvadorians can survive. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States Government continues to sponsor and support a regime that operates a system of fear, terror and repression and which is based on injustice. We have the situation where the self-appointed world policeman can continually oppose injustice in one part of the world, namely the Middle East, yet can sponsor repressive regimes in central America. </PARA>
<PARA> The health problems will not be solved until there is an end to the war. The war will not end until there is an end to the injustice in El Salvador. There must be action to end the levels of poverty and the continual repression. Only when the war ends-and hopefully this will be soon-will organisations, such as Medical Aid for El Salvador, be able to properly address the health needs of the people who have been so tragically neglected. I commend the organisation to all honourable members and urge their full support. </PARA>

<TITLE>Rural Recession-National Defence Effort</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OJ4">Mr TAYLOR</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Groom)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.11 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time available to me today in this grievance debate, I would like to speak on two aspects of public policy, perhaps at opposite ends of the perception spectrum. One is a very real and ongoing problem directly affecting people now, as well as being a vital element of our national economy; and the other is a less visible-but nonetheless increasingly important-aspect of our national will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I speak, firstly, of the paralysis of the rural recession and, secondly, of the impending ministerial announcements-which are reportedly to be made early next month-into major government initiated changes in the direction of our national defence effort. Both are driven by a common theme-money. </PARA>
<PARA> On the first point, I speak with some first-hand electorate experience as a representative of one of the most productive rural regional centres in our nation. On the second point, I speak as someone not only with three decades of defence service behind him-until three years ago-but also as a private citizen and parliamentary representative who has an increasing unease that we are being led up the proverbial garden path by two defence Ministers who, no matter how hard they try, continue to be dominated by the Russell Hill legacies of the previous Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley). </PARA>
<PARA> On the first point, the rural crisis is arguably a crisis of the greatest proportion in 50 years, wherein the range of international commodity downturn is perhaps unparalleled. The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) said of it in this place earlier in the week, and I think very appropriately:</PARA>
<PARA>This feeds into country service centres where people who service rural producers are no longer able to make good incomes. We are seeing a basic wind-down in rural infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>The mood out there in the bush is one of desperation. Regrettably, as the people turn to this Parliament in general, and this leaderless Government in particular, they find few, if any, solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) spoke in this place in the last sitting week of the spiralling and unsustainable on-farm costs. Today, I would like to reiterate what I said in that same debate about the impact of the recession on provincial centres, relating that to my home town of Toowoomba on the Darling Downs in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Toowoomba is the second largest inland city in this country and with 90,000 residents it is now a microcosm of everything that happens in our day-to-day economic life. Regrettably, it is a city which is in danger of degenerating into a city without a soul. Why do I say that? I give this House but a few examples. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, we find that the central business district has about 80 empty commercial spaces. This, of course, is indicative of the general economic downturn. Next, we look at the Southern Cross Corporation Ltd-a company with a high national and international reputation in the production and supply of irrigation equipment and accessories for the motor vehicle industry. Ten years ago, that company had over 2,000 employees; today, it is down to a little over 400 with 50 employees having been retrenched in the last few months. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, we turn to what was one of the largest department stores which had serviced Toowoomba and the Darling Downs region as a family company since early this century, until it was taken over by the McDonnell and East Retail Pty Ltd chain several years ago. On Christmas Eve, with two hours notice, the store was closed and 130 employees were added to the unemployment queue. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, we look at Palila Clothing Co. Pty Ltd-a factory which was established 40 years ago and which local Chris Carter ran as a very reliable subcontractor in the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. Only a month ago, that company went to the wall, throwing nearly 150 people onto the unemployment queues. There are other examples within the city which time today does not allow me to explore, other than to say that while the on-farm situation continues to be critical, the flow-on effect has a traumatic effect on such enterprises as seed merchants, farm machinery producers, general retailers and, very importantly, the boarding education sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish my brief comments on the rural crisis by saying that whilst some farmers out there may have extended themselves financially, very few are seeking simply a government handout to redress their situation. What they are looking for from the Government, with the support of this Opposition, is a reversal of a situation which has in large part been generated by a government that increasingly does not want to know, despite what the rural task force chairman, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) has to say. </PARA>
<PARA> The 700,000 small businesses across our country are feeling the pinch and an important subset of that small business sector is rural enterprise, which produces about 40 per cent of our national export income. It is, therefore, incumbent on all of us at the political level to do whatever we can to correct their increasingly desperate financial situation. While they remain in trouble, so does our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the mooted Defence Force changes on which we have seen a wide range of media reports in recent weeks. In the Bulletin on 7 May, journalist David Barnett wrote an article titled `Wanted: someone to defend the defenders'. I consider the article to be both accurate and timely. Implicit in that article and consistent with a line that I would take is that Defence Minister, Robert Ray, and his junior Minister, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney), will both be tested as they come to grips with the contents of the major Defence statement to Parliament early next month. Both know that the large shadow of the previous Defence Minister still prevails on Russell Hill, and that one of his legacies is a proliferation of politicians-regrettably, both in and out of uniform-in those departmental corridors. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister for Defence may have achieved for the Defence Force in terms of capital re-equipment programs and strategic thinking, but at what expense to our Defence Force? One has only to look at the statistics of his time in office to see both the unparalleled manpower experience losses and persistent question marks about the apolitical nature of certain aspects of the Defence hierarchy under his portfolio management. I do not intend to elaborate on the latter today, other than to say that those civilian officials and senior uniformed officers in the Department know to what and to whom I refer. The former Minister for Defence's party political management of some elements of the Department of Defence was never a feature of previous coalition governments and I know that it will not be a feature of a Hewson government in 1993. Perhaps those to whom I refer might get out of the kitchen before it gets too hot. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Executive Director of the Australian Defence Association, Michael O'Connor, criticised both the Defence Department and its departmental consultant, Alan Wrigley, for their proposals for the expanded role of the Reserve element of the Australian Defence Force. In my view Michael O'Connor is correct when he says that the Wrigley militia concept is both unrealistic and unattainable given the present Defence budget. The Defence Department's recently leaked proposals on a ready reserve, if correct, may perpetuate a new version of the 1960s emergency reserve, which, I can say from personal experience, was a resounding failure. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic problems are that both Defence Ministers still see the 1987 Defence White Paper has a non-negotiable tablet of stone. Both skirt around the real issues of the need for defence strategic review, which the Opposition has in train, together with the importance of the need for the widest public debate on such issues as force structure, civilianisation and Australian industry involvement in the defence infrastructure, of which we have read so much in recent weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministerial briefings by the Ministers of selected journalists in advance of the parliamentary statement next month are nothing more than a self-indulgent softening up of the public. Both Ministers suffer from a lack of in-depth understanding of either what a national strategy or its resultant defence strategy is all about. Selective media briefings are no substitute for parliamentary and public debates. I therefore say to Senator Ray, in particular, that he needs to reassess his opposition to a Defence Green Paper which would allow the fullest debate rather than an inadequate parliamentary statement of the sort that I suspect we are about to face. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, for example, clearly is unable to sustain the specific thrust of the Defence Force logistic review announced last year. The Minister knows, Defence Department officials know and I know that the review is not substantiated by any definitive cost-benefit analysis. I am not surprised, therefore, that we see such articles as I saw in yesterday's Australian Financial Review, which talked of the depressed property market threatening to delay such logistic reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasingly, government decisions on Russell Hill are being made in a policy vacuum of financial desperation. On this side of the House we have put defence back on the political agenda and we look forward to next month's statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I might finish by referring to what the honourable member for Hinkler said in this House a little while ago about ex Lord Mayor Sallyanne Atkinson. All I would say to the honourable member is that people in glass houses should not throw stones. What about the new Lord Mayor, Jim Soorley, and his gambling debts? Will the Australian Labor Party reveal the extent of those debts and the extent to which it has paid them off? Nobody minds a gambler, but everybody minds a welcher. </PARA>

<TITLE>Home and Community Care Program</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9U4">Mr NEWELL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Richmond)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.21 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this House in December I drew the attention of members to some of the grave problems being encountered by the frail aged and those with disabilities within the electorate of Richmond. At that time I told the House that the home and community care program, which is jointly funded by the Federal Government and the New South Wales Government, had been the subject of much media discussion and comment within the electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The program was initiated by the Hawke Government when it came to power to provide all frail older Australians with the opportunity to live independently in their own homes for as long as possible or, more importantly, for as long as they choose to. This Government's aim was to vastly expand the range, quality and spread of services available to people and to ensure that those in need of the services would have access to them. To this end the Government invested large amounts of growth money into the program. Since 1985 the program has experienced funding growth of some 140 per cent in real terms. The number of actual funded services has increased by 104 per cent and covers all regions of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Until 1988, when the Greiner Government took power in New South Wales, New South Wales benefited from the national expansion of the home and community care program that was taking place. However, since 1988 the New South Wales Government has shown its willingness to cut services to people and to stifle the expansion of desperately needed home and community care services. The Greiner Government is thwarting the aims of the Federal Government to have services delivered to people in need in New South Wales. The Greiner Government prefers to direct the funds made available by the Federal Government into anything but services for people. There is no clearer example than that which has occurred in the electorate of Richmond. </PARA>
<PARA> The projects funded under the home and community care program allow many people who might otherwise have had to move into residential care to remain in their own homes. At the time that I spoke to the House in December I had met with home and community care organisations to discuss the whole question of the delivery of services because of the many representations which had been made to me. The major problem for home and community care workers and their clients at that time appeared to stem from policy decisions of the Home Care service of New South Wales program which operates under the home and community care umbrella in New South Wales, but is controlled by a statutory body under the broad control of the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services. </PARA>
<PARA> Public concern at that time related to the effects of Home Care's policy decisions which had led to 131 people in the city of Lismore being axed from the program and 163 people having their hours reduced. The anecdotal evidence of the distress the cuts imposed on the frail aged in Lismore by suddenly being removed from help which was vital for their day-to-day life was, to put it mildly, horrifying. </PARA>
<PARA> It was, to say the least, very difficult to explain to people that the Family and Community Services Department was overseeing the reduction of service delivery when at the same time the Federal Government was making available a significant amount of growth money to expand the home and community care program. </PARA>
<PARA> I was not surprised to learn recently that the New South Wales Government is trying to direct money out of the home and community care program to pay for an inefficient health system by claiming that hospitals that prepare about 53 per cent of the delivered meals in New South Wales should be immediately paid double the amount that they are currently receiving at an approximate cost to the taxpayer of over $3m. This cost would result from a simple doubling of the home and community care program meal subsidy in New South Wales which is paid to all delivered meal providers. The New South Wales Government wants hundreds of thousands of dollars to be paid into its health system this year out of the program. That is money that is wasted, money that could go to provide people with services. Try explaining this to the people who need community care and support!</PARA>
<PARA> That program of removing people from the support program is continuing, despite the adverse publicity, the insoluble problems and the heartache and tears which those cuts are causing. Lismore people are still being axed from the service despite previous savage cuts. Those who use Home Care services in Lismore thought that the axe-wielding had finished, but it has begun again. Those cuts which were initiated by the New South Wales Government were made by Home Care in the name of regional equity. That means that the service is taken away from one person and given to another in another area so that Home Care can achieve some sort of balance. </PARA>
<PARA> We were told last year that Home Care was simply readjusting the formula to make it more equitable for the people of Ballina and Byron Bay. Some of my New South Wales colleagues have told me that the same kind of pattern of cutting and reallocating of services is occurring in other parts of New South Wales. But-and I emphasise this-it is not occurring in other States. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people cut from the service should not be dumped in this way. They have already been classified as `at risk' and may be forced into premature institutionalisation. The irony of it is that some of the people now receiving Home Care in other parts of the electorate, while needy, are as desperate as some of those struck from the service in the name of regional equity. This has been confirmed by Home Care workers. I am not suggesting that those people who were given help by Home Care following the readjustment are not in need, but I fail to understand how the State Minister responsible can sleep at night while presiding over a service which has compelled its workers to create so much havoc in the lives of people by removing necessary services from them. When I last addressed the House on this question, I said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . anything the Minister . . . can do to persuade his colleague . . . in New South Wales to prevail upon home care to review the north coast situation would be gratefully welcomed by many people who are now worried about their future when just a few dollars or a few more hours would make all the difference and at the same time save the taxpayers of this nation much more in the short term as well. </PARA>
<PARA>For older persons or persons with acute disabilities, the lack of assistance with housekeeping services can often be the deciding factor in their ability to live in their own homes. In this case the calls for reason and compassion by the Federal Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) are falling on the callous, deaf ears of the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Without doing a disservice to the vast number of Home Care workers who give much more than they are paid for under the Home Care and home and community care banners, I have to raise the question of the competence of the administration of the New South Wales State Minister responsible for Home Care, Mr Webster. Doubts have been expressed to me about the competence of his administration of this service. Those doubts, which are really accusations, are made by people who know the administration and Webster's maladministration. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that Home Care, indeed many of the home and community care programs, has many problems to face. No planning method has yet been devised which can accurately predict what the need for such services will be in our ageing population. Nevertheless, in my electorate, people have been deliberately removed from a support service when they had been assessed by competent people as needing care and support. The administration of Home Care seems to be obsessed with State-wide standardisation of its provisions when the effort should be towards meeting different needs. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some concerns too about the use of private consultants in this process and the value of their work. Dr Brian Pezzutti MLC, a local Liberal apologist, recently came to the defence of Mr Webster in the columns of the Northern Star, a regional daily. Dr Pezzutti in part said:</PARA>
<PARA>Fluctuations in the number of consumers occur normally as needs change. The Homecare service . . . regularly reassesses its consumers to determine the relative need for service that each consumer has. This can result in service changes to individual consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Pezzutti proceeded then to pour cold water on the media comment about the cuts in an attempt to dampen down the vehemence of local criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not deny the problems which the Home Care administration might have. I know that it has a massive turnover of staff, but frankly the clinical analysis which Dr Pezzutti advances and which seems to be endorsed by the State Minister lacks the warmth and compassion which we learned to expect from the administration of Wran and Unsworth. It is too cold. It is just not good enough. I again ask the Minister to use his best offices to prevail upon the State Minister, Mr Webster, to review what is happening on the north coast and indeed in all New South Wales. People in need and assessed to be so by competent people should not be taken off support services merely for the purported sake of regional equity. </PARA>
<PARA> Other home and community care services and voluntary groups who are having to deal with the results of those cuts report tragic cases to deal with. In one case a woman who was ill on a Thursday had a doctor visit but, because she was not mobile, sat with no medicine and no help over the weekend until the following Tuesday. Like many people who have come to the north coast she had no local family and no neighbourhood support. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other questions about the delivery of services which I want to address at another time. However, I wanted to highlight before this House the dreadful plight people are in as a result of Home Care New South Wales axing very needy and many now desperate people from its programs. We should all question the claims coming from the New South Wales Government that regional equity is the reason for visiting such hardship upon frail older people and younger people with disabilities. Talk of regions may be important in the long term but the hard-hearted, well-paid bureaucrats and politicians in New South Wales must immediately start to recognise that the focus of the delivery of home and community care must be the individual who relies on the service to live. Abandoning frail older people in the short term because of the statistics runs counter to any talk of equity. </PARA>
<PARA> I have asked the Minister to take this matter up again with his State colleagues to see whether he might be moved to exhibit some of the compassion which was a hallmark of previous State Labor Governments in New South Wales. I emphasise again that the cost-cutting and the shifting of costs that is occurring in home and community care is not occurring in other States of Australia. It is simply occurring in New South Wales and I ask the Minister to address those facts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the grievance debate I wish to speak principally on the primary industries in Australia and the way that the economic situation is affecting them. Of course, 60 per cent of New South Wales is now affected by drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to speak particularly about the Government's cattle transaction levy. I think that honourable members generally will be aware of the fact that some months ago we passed legislation that places a levy on practically all the cattle that are sent to meatworks, which go through the saleyards or change hands by way of private deals. </PARA>
<PARA> I am grossly concerned about the cattle transaction levy because, due to the drought, in recent weeks and particularly in recent days a number of auctioneers-and certainly a lot of stock owners-within my electorate and elsewhere have been in touch with me because they are most concerned about it. As an illustration, the north coast area-from Newcastle to the Queensland border-is a breeding area for young stock. We breed the cattle there and much of it is purchased by people from the western parts of the State, Victoria and Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been particularly brought to my notice by M. Webb Bros Pty Ltd, the auctioneers of Gloucester, that at its sale the other day it sold young calves, which we term bobby calves, for only $8 a head. This is a scandalous price to give a farmer for stock. But there is a transaction levy on that particular beast. I have the dockets here. Whilst that is the price, the levy is $1.09 per calf. To that must be added the cost of freight, yard dues and, of course, the debt that is owed to the auctioneer by the owner of the stock concerned. This situation is occurring not only in the Gloucester area, but also at Taree, other yards throughout the State and, I assume, throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it was a levy that was actually sought-and there may be some exceptions so far as dairy stock is concerned-the actual principle of the levy and the change were sought by the Cattle Council of Australia. I am not blaming the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) for this; I am saying that the Government virtually responded to the request of the Cattle Council of Australia. I have advised the constituents who have actually spoken to me that they should contact the organisation and seek from the Government some change to the levy. </PARA>
<PARA> Stock in the yards at the moment is selling at about half or one-third of the price it was six months ago. The farm is, therefore, receiving a very small return and, of course, the auctioneers concerned have the responsibility of actually collecting the dues. </PARA>
<PARA> This particularly applies so far as the coastal area in New South Wales is concerned. This area at the present time is severely affected by drought. I speak of the graziers that are running the stock and also the dairy farmers concerned. I appeal on their behalf to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to review the levy. It has been suggested to me by Mr Denver Webb of M. Webb Bros of Gloucester that the transaction levies should be abandoned in the drought affected areas of the State. I know that that is going a long way, but it is a sensible suggestion when one appreciates the disadvantages to the owners of the stock concerned. Mr Webb says that, alternatively, no transaction levy should be charged on an animal that realises less than $10 a head. He goes on to make some other very sound suggestions about this levy. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to bring to the notice of honourable members the concern of those breeders involved, and the auctioneers who give an excellent service to the stock owners, so that they know that that problem is there and to ask them to request the Government, particularly the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, to look seriously at the problem as it affects those breeders. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no need for me to emphasise the very great problems that are facing those engaged in primary industry today because it is done daily here in this House by members from both sides. This comes, of course, at a time when our economy is down, when costs generally are rising and when, unfortunately, our farmers are looking at declining markets throughout the world for wool, wheat, dairy products, sugar and beef. These are the major industries that bring income into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me emphasise here that the farming community of this country has received very little government support from either the Commonwealth Government or the State governments concerned. In other words, our farmers are dealing on a free market throughout the world against competitors who are dumping their products, who are being subsidised by their governments. I particularly refer to the European Community countries and the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we have a group of people who are stabilising and supporting Australia's economy and have done for decades. These people are not asking for a lot of support but, when the time arrives, they expect a government, either Commonwealth or State, to support them for the purpose of saving the national herd, for the purpose of keeping the quality of our soil and for the purpose of enabling them and their families to stay on the land. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixty per cent of New South Wales is in drought at the present time. We are approaching the winter months and throughout the entire State the nights are cold now. The ground is no longer warm. So, even if we get the rains now, it will not save the situation so far as our pastures and our crops are concerned. Let me say that our farmers meet all of the export inspection charges for meat. This is something that has been brought about by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Our superphosphate bounties have completely gone. There is no support today for superphosphate. I think that the diesel fuel rebate is the only support that a farmer receives. If we examine the taxation legislation we will find that a lot of the concessions that were available yesterday have been taken away today. There has been a reduction in wool promotion. </PARA>
<PARA> We can go further and look at the issue of roads that I raise constantly here in this chamber. More money should be going to our smaller gravel country roads that cart the produce of the farms to market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning the Australian Capital Territory Minister for Health criticised Medicare. I want to point out that the main health problems in the ACT and the region around it relate to the ACT Government's administration of health care, not to Medicare. Some weeks ago, a financier told a parliamentary committee that Australia ought to offer to run health insurance in other countries. That is how good Medicare is. The ACT Minister, Mr Humphries, claimed that too many people who could afford to take out private health insurance are not doing so. Firstly, it is clear from a recent survey that only a small proportion of such people are not taking out private insurance. Further, such people are required to be covered by Medicare now, charged on the basis of income. Before Medicare, many people, rich and poor, were paying no health insurance at all. Now, at least those who are well off are paying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been brought to my attention by the Royal Canberra Hospital Committee that the ACT Government is replacing public hospital services with private services. The ACT Government is closing public hospital beds, thus forcing people to pay for private hospital care. The public hospital service in the ACT has deteriorated. The waiting time for elective surgery is 12 months and the list had risen to 1,558 by December 1990. In 1962 there were 650 beds for a population of 60,000 people. In April 1991 there were 820 public beds for a population of 288,000. That does not include the people in surrounding areas who use those hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to see how the people of the surrounding regions will be able to continue to use ACT hospital beds in the way that they have been because of the shortage of public hospital beds in the ACT. The Committee convenor, Regina Slattinger, tells me that people are actually dying from the lack of public hospital beds. How many more will die if the closure of Royal Canberra Hospital North goes ahead? All human beings are entitled to health care when they are sick, regardless of whether or not they pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA> People are more important than buildings. Doctors, nurses and other health providers who dared to come out into the open about this to voice their concerns on the fast-tracking of the redevelopment of the Woden Valley Hospital and the closure of the Royal Canberra Hospital were labelled troublemakers and were black-listed. The fast-tracking is purely for political reasons. The ACT Government wants to remove the public hospital and health service from the public agenda before the next election. It will not succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, 48,000 citizens of the ACT and the surrounding areas have signed a petition to stop the closure of Royal Canberra Hospital on Acton Peninsula. They were refused a hearing in the ACT Legislative Assembly. The petition was presented by Rosemary Follett, the Australian Labor Party Leader of the Opposition, on three separate occasions and the ACT Government ignored the wishes of the people by disallowing any discussion. The people are demanding their democratic right to be heard. </PARA>
<PARA> I plan to speak on this also in the adjournment debate as I know that this debate will end shortly. But I want to say now that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) recommended in December 1990 that there should be more cooperation between the three tiers of government. This is imperative if we are to receive social justice for all people-not only in Canberra, but also in the region. </PARA>

But because a specialist did not want to treat him there, he was sent to Royal Canberra (South) hospital, at Woden. Not so long ago, he would have been kept in Royal Canberra (North) hospital and operated on there. This is the sort of thing that is happening with the downgrading of Royal Canberra (North) hospital and the shunting of people from one area to another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A large number of people are suffering in Canberra and the region because of the failure of both the New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory governments to come to a firm agreement about the treatment of regional people while the Australian Capital Territory Government is unjustifiably downgrading the hospital services in the ACT. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to highlight the difference between the policy of the Opposition and that of the Government in the wool tax debate. I will point out how the different percentages of tax will affect woolgrowers in the coming 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The impact on families and woolgrowers of the Government's proposed tax of 15 per cent will be quite significant, in spite of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) telling us that it will be insignificant. If we look at tax on $4.50 a kilogram clean, the average price for the next 12 months, we will see that a 15 per cent tax would be $2.02 per sheep and that a 12 per cent tax would be $1.62 per sheep; the difference is 40c. For the average woolgrower running 5,000 sheep, that 40c would equate to $2,000; if he were running 10,000 sheep, that 40c would equate to $4,000. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the Opposition's policy, we will see that with a tax rate as low as 8 per cent, the saving could well be $4,700 for 5,000 sheep and $9,400 for 10,000 sheep. That money is significant in the very hard times that woolgrowers will be confronted with in the next 12 to 18 months. That money could very well put food on the table; it would certainly keep a child at school. I urge the Minister to look at the 15 per cent tax and not be so adamant that it is the percentage that will be applied. </PARA>

<PARA>The Municipal Association of Victoria have advised the Council of the City of Ballarat that the Treasurer and the Australian Taxation Office are considering the imposition of PAYE tax instalments on allowances paid to Councillors, and to imposing Fringe Benefits Tax upon alleged benefits (such as meals provided at Council meetings,) and the attendance of Councillors at Civic functions.

He has had the responsibility for overseeing the most dramatic transformation of the economic structures and form of regulations of this country to make it a more competitive economy than ever before in the history of this country.

What those opposite do not like-and why do they not give the Treasurer the credit he deserves for this?-is the fact that that rate of employment increase of 1.4 million represents a rate of employment growth something like four times faster than in their period in office. Those are the facts. They had seven years in office. They can be judged in this question of employment and unemployment on that performance.

It criticised us because it said that we did not have interest rates high enough and, when we started to take them off, it criticised us for the timing of our taking them off. According to the Opposition, we should have left interest rates in this country higher for a longer period than we have done.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has already taken up in substance some of the material facts of today's release of labour force figures. They reveal that the unemployment rate has risen from 9.2 per cent to 9.9 per cent, which is, of course, much too high and is a rate which is unacceptable to the Government and is a cause of great concern to the Government. I said in my speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council last month:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . increased unemployment is a great cost to the economy and an ordeal for the families of those who lose their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>However, there is an encouraging sign in today's figures.</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members-Where?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where? The answer is that employment rose by 10,000, whereas in March employment fell by 80,000. If the 10,000 rise in employment is indicative, it means that it is possible that the bottom of the fall in employment could have been reached. That is coupled with the very amazing fact that in a recession we have actually got the participation rate rising, which must be a phenomenon unique to this month and to this series in Australia. I cannot think of any other country in the world where the participation rate has risen during a recession. The participation rate did not just rise; it rose by 0.5 per cent, which by any measure is phenomenal in one month, and particularly in a recession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister indicated, it means that the rise in the unemployment rate has come from the rise in the participation rate or, to put it another way, if we had the same participation rate today as we had a month ago, unemployment would be the same. I know that a few of the Opposition's slower characters would be flat out spelling `participation', let alone knowing what it is.</PARA>

In particular, some spokespersons for the Opposition, including the honourable member for Bennelong, have questioned the value of such programs.

The Jobstart program in particular has continued to have a high rate of success, with some 60 per cent of participants, three months after having completed the program, being either in employment or further education and training. So it is an utterly spurious claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might also say that there have been an awful lot of distortions in the media recently about the Government's approach to this broad problem of how we help the long term unemployed under current labour market circumstances.

There have been a host of distortions about that-and I am not going to address the terms of the legislation, but I am going to talk in general terms about the Government's approach.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that we have heard suggestions that the Government is about to do something from 1 July with the introduction of the AES, and is about to implement a terribly draconian program in which all the long term unemployed are going to be cut off and junior officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) are going to be involved in making decisions to terminate benefits.

It is a very substantial increase which, on current projections, should exceed the rate of growth of the long term unemployed. As at March 1990 there were 180,000 long term unemployed, and we are planning to implement 245,000 labour market places in 1991-92, so it is a very substantial response to that problem.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that the Government has withdrawn the pipeline from its assets sale program. That is the consequence of the refusal of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats to allow the passage of legislation which was designed to put the pipeline's current non-commercial haulage arrangements onto a reasonable commercial basis. Without that change, the pipeline is a totally unattractive investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the fact that the current contract specifies that up to the year 2006 it shall operate on a cost recovery basis only for about 95 per cent of its business. In other words, there will be no profit and no return on investment up to the year 2006. From the year 2006 to the year 2016, the contract allows only a very limited profit. For the next quarter of a century the gas haulage rates are on a totally uncommercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's view was that, if the pipeline was to be sold, it should be sold for something like its real value. That involves putting its operations on a reasonably commercial basis. From the time we came to office we attempted to negotiate with the Australian Gas Light Co. (AGL), the other party to the contract, to put the pipeline on a commercial basis and to change the haulage arrangements, to make them more satisfactory. That proved to be impossible, so we resorted to the legislation, which has now been rejected by the Opposition. To proceed with the sale would be to sell it for a fraction of its real worth-that is, to dispose of an asset and deprive the nation of hundreds of millions of dollars in the process.</PARA>
<PARA> As has been mentioned before in the House, it is the case that the implications for the Budget are very substantial, and they bear repetition. The actions of the Opposition effectively sabotaged the Budget for about three-quarters of a billion dollars-no minor act of sabotage, I might say. We had a figure of about $700m written into the Budget, but we expected that we would have got more than that. The action taken after the Budget, up to the time of the Opposition's act of sabotage, certainly gave us reason to believe we would have got more than $700m.</PARA>
<PARA> As regards the prospects of future sales, so far as the Government is concerned there are no such prospects, unless the current uncommercial haulage arrangements can be changed. As for the Opposition, it seems to have recently reaffirmed, through the shadow Minister for privatisation, that it is still its intention to privatise it, despite the action it has taken to stop it being put on a commercial basis. Apparently, what the Opposition really means is that it would virtually give it away. On the basis on which it currently exists, who would pay any substantial amount of money for it? Something with a replacement value of over $1 billion but operating on a totally uncommercial basis would not attract much of a price. Effectively, the Opposition would give away a major asset of the people for a very small amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has said in the past that it would attempt to negotiate with AGL to get a revision of the contract. We have been doing that for the last seven years. That proved to be totally unrewarding. It would be no more likely than us to succeed for the same reason that we did not succeed through negotiations-that is, AGL, the other party to the contract, has absolutely every commercial reason to reject any change in the contract. There is no way in which it is going to act for the Opposition in the way that it refused to act for us, because it is totally against its commercial interests.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is really saying that, by rejecting this proposal to put it on a commercial basis through legislation and then keep it in its privatisation lists, it is quite happy to pursue a course of privatisation for privatisation's sake. It is pursuing a political agenda, rather than an economic one. To give him some credit, the shadow Minister for privatisation said that. On the ABC a couple of months ago, 25 February, he was asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Would you say that assets can only be sold when the market is buoyant or that they should be sold to suit a political rather than economic agenda?</PARA>
<PARA>His answer, in part-I will not read it all-was:</PARA>
<PARA>I really think that we should be selling to suit a political agenda.</PARA>
<PARA>Later he elaborated on that and said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I'm saying that we're in politics and we have political objectives so we would be selling these primarily, not entirely, but primarily to suit the political objectives, yes.</PARA>
<PARA>Now we know where the Opposition stands. Quite clearly the Opposition stands in the position where it would privatise for privatisation's sake, in pursuit of which it would be quite prepared to hand over the assets of the people to its business mates for a fraction of their real value.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If one looks at the participation rate, one finds that it has now risen to 63.7 per cent. The Opposition when it was in government had an unemployment rate of well over 10 per cent, with the participation rate down at a level of just over 60 per cent. The Opposition did not have the participation rates which have developed under this Government, because people have seen the opportunity of getting into work as we have had an expanding economy, which has grown at a rate roughly twice that of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average, and at a significantly higher rate than the Opposition was able to achieve when it was in government. People have made themselves available to enter the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With that increase in the participation rate, it has been that much more difficult and there has been that much more demand for jobs. Had the Opposition in its time in government had the participation rate this Government now has, its unemployment rate of 10.4 per cent would have been significantly higher. It is the responsibility of government, when it is confronted with circumstances which require a tough decision, to take that tough decision; that is what this Government did.

In those circumstances, with an existing tough, tight fiscal policy and a tight wages policy, the only thing available to the Government to bring that back into equilibrium was to tighten monetary policy. It gave the Government no pleasure to do that, but it had to do it. As I said in answer to a previous question, as the Government did that it was criticised for not going higher and, as it took the rates off, it was criticised for taking off rates too soon. The fact is that this Government had the courage to take the decision which was necessary.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will come out of this recession in quite a different way from the recession which the Opposition inflicted upon the Australian community. As I said yesterday, because the Opposition's Treasurer had no control over wages, the Opposition had an 18 per cent blow-out in wages and a double digit inflation figure. In this situation the Government is providing for Australia a lowering profile of inflation and a situation where the Australian inflation rate will be comparable with that of our major trading partners. That is the major distinction between what is happening at this period and what the Opposition engineered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition when in government not only engineered double digit unemployment but also simultaneously engineered double digit inflation. Against that, because of the Government's wages policy-where the Opposition had none-Australia will come out of this with a permanently lower rate of inflation. As the Treasurer and I have said, Australia will also be able to make a significant impact upon its current account deficit problem, where it now has a 24 per cent better situation in the first nine months of this year as compared with the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA> So I repeat: I, the Treasurer and the whole of the Government regret that this has been a necessary outcome of our having to slow down the level of activity in this country. At the same time, we are producing a restructured economy with lower inflation, which will mean that as we start to come out of this recession, as we will in the second half of this calendar year, we will emerge from it with a much stronger, more efficient and more competitive economy with a significantly lower rate of inflation.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3405" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Newcastle for his question. He is certainly entitled to ask it because, with his brother, if I might say so, he has been a constant advocate to me and the rest of the Government to ensure that the Government does everything it possibly can to assist the people of Newcastle in the aftermath of that tragic event. If I can slip parliamentary propriety for a moment, both the Morrises deserve congratulations and the great appreciation of the citizenry of that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having given those well earned congratulations, may I say that following the earthquake in December 1989 I met with Premier Greiner and we agreed to special relief measures under the natural disaster arrangements which would involve New South Wales and the Commonwealth sharing equally the task of rebuilding Newcastle. The special arrangement meant that the Commonwealth Government would pay half the costs of the New South Wales Government, and we would also pay all the costs of repairing our own buildings. Of every dollar that New South Wales spends on Newcastle, 50 per cent comes from the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> One major Commonwealth building requiring repair after the earthquake was the Customs House, a major heritage asset of the city of Newcastle. Following the detailed preliminary work by the Hunter Federal Task Force under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Shortland and with the support of the honourable member for Newcastle, an attractive proposal has been put forward which would see this building transformed to be part of a strategy to revive the east end of Newcastle, and that is a proposal involving the expenditure of over $3m.</PARA>
<PARA> On the broader question of earthquake relief, to date the Commonwealth has provided $250,000 to the Lord Mayor's fund; additional funds in the form of tax deductibility; assistance through the use of defence personnel; financial assistance in other areas outside the natural disaster relief arrangements; $10.8m in 1989-90, and it will provide an estimated $29m in 1990-91 and $13.5m in 1991-92. It is probable that expenditure will continue beyond 1991-92. Finally, we intend to carefully monitor the situation to ensure that Newcastle continues its recovery from this disaster, and I will be receiving further advice from the Hunter Federal Task Force on this matter. Again I thank the honourable member for his question and congratulate him and his brother on their continuing commitment to their constituencies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I answered this question first up today, Mr Speaker, but I will give it to them again. Not only will the Government not be sacking the Treasurer, but we will be continuing to work with him to ensure the continuing restructuring of this economy. I repeat that we are confident that in the second half of the calendar year 1991-this year-we will see the beginnings of economic recovery.

<PARA> We believe that that recovery will continue strongly into 1992 and, importantly, that the Australian economy will be in very much better shape than it has ever been before. That will be because, in addition to having the appropriate macro- economic management to produce recovery, we will continue assiduously with our program of micro-economic reform to fill in the neglect which we inherited from previous conservative administrations. We will have had massive changes on the waterfront, in our maritime industry, in our telecommunication industry and in our road transport system, as well as the continuing reform of the tax system for which the Treasurer has been particularly responsible.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we all know, the primary industries have problems, particularly with wool and wheat, and the Government's response has been measured, consistent and principled. I say measured, because we required an analysis which would demonstrate the most efficient and effective means to provide support; consistent, because we have applied the same criteria to all industries; and principled because, for the first time in the history of this country, the Government applied the most rigorous principles of equity when we framed our responses. The response from the Commonwealth has been to contribute directly to the wool industry, to the wheat industry and to farmers generally through the rural adjustment scheme and through this very testing economic time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recovery is not aided, however, by comments recently made by the Federal Leader of the National Party, for example. The National Party is in a complete mess on this issue of wool. In a media release he described the 15 per cent wool tax as `pure thuggery' and the `death knell' of the industry. He tried to clarify his comments on the day. When he was asked on radio what he meant, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I'm not reaching a view point that there is another agenda operating out of Canberra out of the bureaucracies of Canberra, indeed perhaps even Minister Kerin to somehow bring about a greed of agony and adjustment in the bush at far too faster rate and this wool plan yesterday is an example of that.</PARA>
<PARA>So we understand the thinking of the Leader of the National Party. If we interpret the gibberish after deciphering the agonising syntax, the Leader of the National Party is either suggesting that I am deliberately conspiring to bring about the ruin of the wool industry or that impartial, dedicated and competent professional public servants are conspiring to the same end. This is a popular slur in the best or worst National Party tradition.</PARA>
<PARA> Members of this House will recall that the Opposition announced its `wool plan' on 18 April and that at that time the shadow Minister for primary industries and energy said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Coalition's plan for the wool industry, if implemented by the Government, will ensure its long-term viability, allow a grower levy substantially below 12 per cent which covers all stockpile and debt costs as well as promotion and research and development, and will not need Government advances.</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . .</PARA>
<PARA>However the Coalition believes the Government should provide assistance only as a last resort and every effort must be made by the industry to ensure that there is no deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a reasonably responsible position from the Opposition when it is so confused.</PARA>
<PARA> In a bizarre way, the crux of this issue is not really the crude popularism of the Leader of the National Party, nor is it the arithmetic optimism of the shadow spokesman; rather, it is the indifference or incompetence of the Leader of the Opposition. On 30 April, in his contribution to this debate-12 days after the announcement of the Opposition's wool plan; this is an interesting quote-he said, in answer to a question on radio:</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly the judgement has to be made about the levy of a fair sharing of burden, if you like, between the industry and the rest of Australia and you want to make sure that the industry accepts the problem that it has substantially created and puts in place policies to deal with it . . . Now, I don't know, standing here, whether it is 12 or 15 or where it is and we need to look at it. As far as the detail goes, we have got to wait to see the Government's legislation to see precisely what they have in mind.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know how many times those opposite need to be told. The Treasurer and I, and the rest of the Government responsible for the formulation and implementation of Government policy, take no pleasure at all from the fact that in the community there are many people suffering from unemployment. As distinct from members of the Opposition who seem to continually make glee the worse the news becomes, as they see it, we have a sincere regret. We take no joy from these figures at all. I have said that if we had not acted in the way in which we have done the world would have imposed upon Australia a significantly more draconian resolution of the situation with which we were confronted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are proud of the fact that, confronted with the realities we were, we had the determination to take those decisions which have avoided inflicting on this country what would have been a very much greater disaster. It is the case that if we had not acted in the way we did, we would have had many more people unemployed now. The world would have marked us down. The rest of the world is not doing that. They are recognising, in a variety of ways, the appropriateness of the action that had to be taken and the determination with which the Government is doing it under the economic leadership of the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA> I have been asked whether I regard my economic leadership as superior to the Treasurer's. The fact is that the Treasurer and I have said from day one of this Government that we act in concert. I have been proud to be shoulder to shoulder with him when our employment figures have been rising; when our unemployment figures have been coming down. I have been proud to stand beside him and to take the credit with him, when we should get that credit. I am equally prepared, and always will be, to stand next to him, shoulder to shoulder with him, when the figures are going the other way. That is the way it has been for eight years, and that is the way it will be for many, many more years yet.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the Minister for Science and Technology concerns the future of Australia's aerospace industry.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that this is a significant development not just for the country but also, specifically, for his electorate because of its employment implications. The recent agreement is a very significant advance for the aerospace industry in this country. It is, in fact, a significant vote of confidence by the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world in relation to its next generation of aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The aerospace industry in this country has carved out a significant niche for itself in international markets. It is a supplier to all of the prime aircraft manufacturers-there are not many of those. That is what makes the arrangements easier. It is world competitive; it is innovative; it has a skilled work force. The restructuring that the Government insisted upon in relation to Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA) has seen it move from the military aircraft industry into the domestic aviation industry.</PARA>
<PARA> This industry now has export growth to the value of $150m in elaborately transformed manufactures, and $340m in total exports. This represents a growth in exports in the last 12 months of 20 per cent. This growth has been brought about for a number of reasons but, significant to this, has been the Government's offsets strategy whereby it required the suppliers of aircraft to undertake certain agreements in this country to manufacture.</PARA>
<PARA> In the 12 March statement what this Government did was to indicate a preparedness to waive those offset requirements if, in fact, the manufacturers were prepared to commit themselves to long term contracts. Boeing is the first such company to enter into an agreement. That involves an arrangement involving $455m worth of exports in relation to this country providing significant contribution to its new 777 aircraft for tail structure surfaces. ASTA and Hawker de Havilland are both involved in that exercise. Boeing is the first. An agreement with Airbus is imminent. In relation to the other aircraft manufacturers, the arrangements are well advanced.</PARA>
<PARA> The new strategy that has been developed by this Government sees a combination of trade liberalisation, to the extent to which we are prepared to waive the offset requirements, in return for a commitment to long term contracts with significant export potential based on our international competitive strengths.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result, the aerospace industry has been strongly positioned for participation in global markets. But it is not content to rest there, because we cannot just rest on our laurels. The other significant addition to this industry that the Government has fostered has been the recent granting of the Cooperative Research Centre to the aerospace structures consortium, which will involve itself in the development of advanced fibre reinforced composite constructions, which have the potential to develop smart structures for the aerospace industry. It is the commercialisation, again involving Aerospace Technologies of Australia and Hawker de Havilland, and the linkages with those companies that is a key component for ensuring that we will not lose the competitive edge. So I am very optimistic about the future for this industry. Boeing is the first of but many success stories that will come from it, and it has happened only because this Government is prepared to take a strategic approach to the aerospace industry and back it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RJ4">Mr TICKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The reports I have just tabled are historic documents. They must command the attention not only of the governments and the parliaments of Australia but of the nation itself. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody evolved into an unprecedented national inquiry into the conditions of Australia's indigenous people operating under letters patent issued by the Governor-General, Governors in all States, and the Administrator of the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 11 volumes of the reports, ranging over 5,000 pages and containing 339 recommendations, provide an agenda for the nation over the coming decade. As honourable members are aware, one of my priority objectives as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has been to build a movement of cross-party and community support for initiatives in Aboriginal affairs. This objective will take on greater significance as governments across Australia respond to the Royal Commission reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission was established on 16 October 1987 and inquired into the deaths of 99 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the custody of police, in prison or in youth detention institutions. It also investigated action taken by authorities subsequent to these deaths. The inquiry was established with the support of the Federal Opposition and as the direct result of the perception of both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people that Aboriginal deaths in custody were both far too common and the public explanations too sketchy to discount the possibility of foul play. </PARA>
<PARA> Commissioner James Muirhead, QC was requested to report by 31 December 1988. The huge scale of this task became evident only too soon. Commonwealth and State letters patent were subsequently amended to increase the number of commissioners to five, to extend reporting deadlines and to extend the Royal Commission's jurisdiction to the important social, cultural and legal factors contributing to the deaths. Mr Elliott Johnston, QC became National Commissioner in April 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset, I would like to place on record the Government's appreciation of the work of commissioners Johnston, Muirhead, Wyvill, O'Dea, Dodson, Wootten and their staff. The Royal Commission has examined in close detail both the lives and the deaths of the individuals concerned, and the huge range of historical and social factors operating to produce the situations these people faced. Public hearings were held, families were represented by legal counsel, relevant people were interviewed wherever poss- ible, and all aspects of custodial care and legal processes were examined. The views of Aboriginal people were sought, particularly through the work of the Aboriginal Issues Units. Reports on the circumstances of individual deaths have been presented in the relevant jurisdictions and tabled as they became available. I know I can speak for the Parliament in expressing on this occasion the deepest sympathy to the relatives of the deceased. </PARA>
<PARA> Although some individual reports recommend consideration of further action against individuals, the Royal Commission's final report does not accord with initial expectations of foul play. The commissioners have not found that any deaths were the result of deliberate unlawful violence or brutality by police or prison officers. To that extent, families and friends in their continuing grief and anger have found the findings of individual reports difficult to accept. But they cannot, I think, doubt the sincerity, dedication and compassion with which the commissioners have carried out their task. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the report stands as an indictment of the operation of the legal and corrective services system in respect of the most disadvantaged group in Australian society, and of our society itself, in allowing that situation to develop and persist. The Royal Commission finds that there has been a failure to live up to the standard of care owed to those in custody; it has found many system defects and many individual failures to exercise proper care and basic human compassion. </PARA>
<PARA> Particularly prior to the establishment of the Royal Commission, in very few cases were initial investigations into deaths other than perfunctory and limited in focus, leading invariably to deteriorating relationships between Aboriginal people and the broader community; leading to increased anguish and cynicism on the part of the families and friends; and to neglect of opportunities to avoid future deaths. </PARA>
<PARA> The report contains an extensive charter of law reform related to the criminal justice system, police and prison authorities, which falls primarily within the responsibility of State and Territory Governments. The recommendations range through the full extent of the criminal justice system to include: diversion from police custody; imprisonment as a last resort; reform of police and prison practices; and reform of custodial health and safety practices, including a formal recognition of the States' duty of care to those held in custody. The report also makes wide-ranging recommendations about future post-death investigations and the independent monitoring of deaths in custody. </PARA>
<PARA> In all these circumstances and on these issues, I must stress that this Royal Commission report must not be seen as some prison officer bashing or police bashing exercise. It is not. The report puts forward constructive and practical proposals for law reform. Significantly, it acknowledges that improvements have already been made in Aboriginal-police relations and puts forward proposals to further advance this process. It is vital that Aboriginal communities and Aboriginal organisations, such as Aboriginal legal services, play a key role in developing these reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to Commissioner Johnston's consideration of the issues underlying Aboriginal deaths in custody. In response to this aspect of its work, the Royal Commission has proposed a transformation of relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people in this country. Put simply, too many Aboriginal people are in custody too often. They are over-represented in custody at a rate-calculated nationally-29 times that of the general community. In some cases that rate is considerably higher. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, Aboriginal people die in custody at rates that have been the subject of international attention. The circumstances of these deaths are set out in chapter 3 of volume 1 of the report. Thirty of the 99 deaths resulted from hanging. In those 30 cases, the following objects were among those used for suspension: strips of sheeting, strips of blanket, football socks, a length of electric flex, a belt, the sleeve of a jacket, a shirt, a mattress cover, a shoelace, the sleeve of a cardigan, a bandage and a pair of jeans. Other deaths occurred as the result of shocking self-mutilation such as a razor to the throat, and the driving of a paint brush into an eye. </PARA>
<PARA> I give these examples not to sensationalise or shock but to bring to this House a sense of the human tragedy which underlies a death in custody. The finding that foul play on the part of authorities was not a factor in the deaths in no way diminishes the standing of the Royal Commission or undermines the reason for its establishment. History will record that the Royal Commission has played a vital role in laying open before us the harshness and oppression experienced by so many contemporary Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the House to consider the damning picture of the lives and deaths of these 99 predominantly young Aboriginal Australians who died in custody. The average age at death was 32 years. Of the 99 Aboriginal people who died, 43 had experienced childhood separation from their natural families through intervention by State authorities, missions or other institutions; 83 of the 99 were unemployed at the date of their last detention; 43 of the 99 had been charged with an offence at or before the age of 15-just kids; only two of the 99 had completed secondary schooling; 43 of the 99 were taken into custody in the period immediately before their deaths on matters directly related to the over-use of alcohol and, in the remaining cases, the Royal Commission concluded that alcohol was a contributing factor in their being taken into custody for the last time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission concluded that the standard of health of the 99-whose average age, I remind the House, was 32-varied from poor to very bad. The average age of those dying from natural causes was a little over 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many reasons why I am proud to be an Australian but these statistics can be no source of pride for any of us in this House or in any elected sphere of government in Australia, or any non-Aboriginal Australian. Fundamentally, the disproportionate number of Aboriginal people in custody stems from the underlying factors which bring Aboriginal people into contact with the law in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> The report finds that the single most significant contributing factor to incarceration is the disadvantaged and unequal position of Aboriginal people in Australian society in every way, whether socially, economically or culturally. Much of the national report and the associated regional reports is devoted to demonstrating the existence of that inequality and disadvantage. The report documents, in a way never before achieved, the impact of European settlement upon Australia's indigenous peoples, their dispossession and subordination within a dominant and often hostile society frequently motivated by self-interest, the development of racist attitudes both overt and hidden and the way in which these attitudes became institutionalised in the very practices of legal, educational, welfare and Aboriginal assistance authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> That these attitudes were themselves the product of a particular time or society and often well intentioned, does not excuse our society from attempting the task of reconciliation and redressing disadvantage. The report documents the impact of these things upon the lives of individual people and the way that that impact continues to be felt and demonstrated today, especially where Aboriginal people have lost their way and where despair and hopelessness have been bred of the destruction of Aboriginal culture and the stifling of independence and initiative. The report demonstrates the close link between this continuing inequality and disadvantage and the refuge sought in alcohol over-use and high custody rates for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The report refutes at every level the myth sometimes put forward that the special assistance available for Aboriginal people has put them in a position above that enjoyed by other Australians. It is evident that there are no quick and easy answers to these continuing problems. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, however, one principle which looms large as central to change for Aboriginal people. The Royal Commission describes as fundamental the issues of empowerment and self-determination. As a senior and experienced lawyer with considerable knowledge of Aboriginal issues, Commissioner Johnston acknowledges that he had no real idea of the degree of `pin pricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter paternalism, open contempt and total indifference' which confronted Aboriginal people in their everyday lives, with no personal control over one's own children, one's employment, personal savings and decisions as to whether to buy a car or other personal belongings. He points out that communities today are still faced with a multiplicity of grants which effectively mean that agendas are being set elsewhere, that assumptions as to what is best for Aboriginal people are made elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Commissioner Johnston highlights what he describes as the first prerequisite of the empowerment of Aboriginal society-the will for renewal and for self-determination. He also stresses the important role played by Aboriginal community based organisations. The role of these organisations is continually emphasised in the recommendations of the report. At every level control of lives and communities must be in Aboriginal hands, in the same way that non-Aboriginal Australians expect to control their lives and communities. </PARA>
<PARA> For this to happen, the report makes clear, Aboriginal Australians must themselves have the will and capacity to put an end to their disadvantaged situation, and to take charge of their lives. Commissioner Johnston quotes impressive evidence of the efforts being made all over Australia by Aboriginal organisations and communities, at the local and wider levels, to demonstrate that this can be done, indeed is already being done. Aboriginal people do have the determination and capacity to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> A prerequisite for Aboriginal self-determination is the creation of conditions which will eliminate the systematic and entrenched disadvantage which permeates every aspect of Aboriginal life. The Royal Commission's report contains detailed and comprehensive recommendations to address that disadvantage which are directed to governments at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the time available to me it is obviously not possible to refer to the hundreds of recommendations to government directed towards overcoming the continuing and critical disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal Australians. However, to convey some understanding of the breadth of those recommendations I note that they include, in no order of priority:</PARA>
<PARA>- a national survey of Aboriginal population and infrastructure;</PARA>
<PARA>- Commonwealth, State and Territory governments to develop a system of single block grant funding for Aboriginal communities with a model accounting system;</PARA>
<PARA>- triennial funding of Aboriginal communities;</PARA>
<PARA>- the Commonwealth to negotiate with the States and Territories to achieve the equitable distribution of local government funds to Aboriginal residents, as a condition of funding;</PARA>
<PARA>- the development of codes of practice by the media industry and media unions;</PARA>
<PARA>- a progress report on the Australian Law Reform Commission's customary law report;</PARA>
<PARA>- the urgent provision of funds to enable implementation of the national Aboriginal health strategy-I note that the Commonwealth has already made a significant additional allocation for this purpose;</PARA>
<PARA>- review of liquor licensing legislation, notably in the Northern Territory, with a view to reducing the availability of alcohol and meeting the needs of Aboriginal communities;</PARA>
<PARA>- support for the Aboriginal employment development policy, including specific inter-government agreements on objectives and outcomes, and the establishment of a peak industry body and local industry, community and local government groups to promote employment equity in the private sector;</PARA>
<PARA>- a review and extension of the community development employment program, including to rural towns with large Aboriginal populations; and</PARA>
<PARA>- the Commonwealth to act to provide a right of individual appeal on human rights violations to international committees. </PARA>
<PARA>- funding to be provided to organisations such as Link-Up for the purpose of allowing Aboriginal people to re-establish links with families separated by past government policies;</PARA>
<PARA>- the establishment of a national task force on alcohol abuse;</PARA>
<PARA>- an urgent requirement for governments and Aboriginal organisations to negotiate to devise strategies for Aboriginal youth to reduce the rate at which Aboriginal juveniles are involved in the welfare and criminal justice systems;</PARA>
<PARA>- Aboriginal communities to be given equitable access to ongoing expenditure by the Commonwealth, State, Territory and local authorities on roads;</PARA>
<PARA>- the Department of Employment, Education and Training to be responsible for the development of a comprehensive national strategy designed to improve opportunities for the education and training of those in custody;</PARA>
<PARA>- high priority to be accorded to the development of social, economic and cultural development plans by Aboriginal communities on a local and a regional basis;</PARA>
<PARA>- recognition that the success of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education policy will depend on the success of pre-schooling initiatives;</PARA>
<PARA>- the establishment of a small unit of Aboriginal people from northern Australia to study the means of achieving greater self-sufficiency in remote northern communities;</PARA>
<PARA>- the implementation of a strategy for the training of Aboriginal people to build and maintain essential community infrastructure; and</PARA>
<PARA>- all jurisdictions are urged, where this has not already occurred, to provide a comprehensive means of addressing the land needs of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to the critical issue of the process to be adopted by governments in responding to the Royal Commission report. Australia has a commendable international human rights record and acknowledges that human rights issues are of international concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledged at the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations in Geneva last August that the Government is aware that the Working Group, Amnesty International and other international non-government organisations will be monitoring the implementation of the Royal Commission's recommendations. In a very real sense the world is watching. </PARA>
<PARA> However, our motivation in ensuring a coordinated and comprehensive national response to the Royal Commission's report will not be, and should not be, international scrutiny. It is the historic and comprehensive nature of the Royal Commission report itself, and our commitment as Australians to a fair go for all, which should drive us to ensure such a response. As a nation we must not squander the opportunity presented by the Royal Commissioner's report to act on an agenda of reform in Aboriginal affairs for the coming decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to receiving the Royal Commission's report I had already indicated my predisposition to support an open and publicly accountable process to monitor the response of all governments to the report. I was, therefore, gratified that the first recommendation of the report proposes a public and comprehensive reporting process by the Commonwealth, States and Territories in consultation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Commissioner Johnston also stresses the need for extensive consultation with and involvement of Aboriginal people in the implementation of the Royal Commission's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of the utmost importance for me to emphasise that the Royal Commission report does not impact solely on the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio at any level of government. The recommendations are addressed to the whole range of government departments at Commonwealth, State and Territory levels. It will be necessary, therefore, for there to be a response from the whole of government in each Commonwealth, State and Territory jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> I report to the House that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has asked me to assume responsibility for coordinating the Commonwealth Government response across all portfolios, supported by the Aboriginal Reconciliation Unit within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. This report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody demands careful consideration by all governments. Its recommendations have implications for a range of government activities, from Australia's international obligations down to the everyday contacts of individual police, prison, hospital or welfare officers with Aboriginal people, and for every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not pretend that all the changes proposed can happen quickly, even though a number of recommendations may be capable of fairly rapid implementation. The recommendations reflect the linkages between many areas of policy affecting Aboriginal people, and point to the need for coordinated action between and within governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has already set in train a process for consideration of the report which acknowledges the status of that report as a joint Commonwealth-State investigation, and the overlapping nature of responsibilities in many areas. The Prime Minister has written to Premiers and Chief Ministers in every State and Territory seeking their cooperation in a joint strategy of response. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to meeting with Ministers from those portfolios most immediately concerned in the near future to discuss the implications of the report and to agree on a timetable for implementation. The need for empowerment is at the heart of many of the recommendations, and governments will need to allow adequate time for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves to consider the report and formulate a response. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to what is the final and perhaps the most important recommendation of the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I appeal to all honourable members of this House and to the wider community to give this section of the report deep consideration. As honourable members would be aware, last December I issued a discussion paper as the basis of future legislation to enable our nation to embark on a process of reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, it has been a fundamental objective of my time as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to create a climate of cross-party cooperation in and community support for significant progress in Aboriginal affairs. I was, for this reason, delighted by the final recommendation of the Royal Commission report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that all political leaders and parties recognise that reconciliation between the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities in Australia must be achieved if community division, discord and injustice to Aboriginal people are to be avoided. To this end the Commission recommends that political leaders use their best endeavours to ensure bi-partisan public support for the process of reconciliation and that the urgency and necessity of the process be acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA>In discussing the framework of the report and the other recommendations in the report, the Royal Commission describes the reconciliation process as `the fundamental backdrop to reform and change'. The Royal Commission further states that reconciliation of the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities must be an essential commitment of all sides if change is to be genuine and long term. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Royal Commission observes, the process of reconciliation proposed by the Government will have as a principal focus the need to educate non-Aboriginal Australians about the cultures of Australia's indigenous peoples and the treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by European settlers and their descendants. This sad history-which includes the dispossession and dispersal of Aboriginal people, confinement in reserves, removal of children from their families and the destruction of much Aboriginal culture-needs to be recognised as a primary cause of the current disadvantaged position of Australia's indigenous peoples. All Australians need to understand this country's past and the place of Aboriginal people in it. We must come to terms honestly with our own history as a nation, with the intention not of creating guilt, but of building compassion and empathy for Aboriginal people and their disadvantaged position in society, as well as appreciation of Aboriginal cultures and achievements, and the unique position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the indigenous peoples of this continent.</PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission recognises, as I do, four key issues essential to the process of reconciliation: first, the taking of concrete measures to tackle disadvantage and establish self-determination as being essential building blocks to that process of reconciliation; secondly, the reconciliation must have cross-party support and support from Aboriginal people; thirdly, the focus should concentrate on the process of reconciliation and not on a document or instrument which might be one of the outcomes; and finally, the process should not be impeded by either Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal people setting preconditions in advance. </PARA>
<PARA> The report suggests that if we are to remove the cause of distrust and enmity between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people and build good community relations, we must not only eliminate existing disadvantage but also recognise Aboriginal rights, cultures and traditions. This process of reconciliation must carry with it the complete rejection of the concepts of superiority and inferiority which have informed Australian society over the past 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, the Royal Commission's report emphasises the extent of past cross-party cooperation in Aboriginal affairs. The report traces the history of Aboriginal affairs policy and recognises that the first step in the reconciliation process-and the one which achieved the clearest endorsement from the Australian people-was the 1967 referendum. These are the words of Commissioner Johnston:</PARA>
<PARA>Since 1967 there has been an evolution of thought on the part of non-Aboriginal Australians which has been reflected in the actions of successive Commonwealth Governments irrespective of party composition. </PARA>
<PARA>In the final chapter of the report, the Royal Commission chronicles in some detail the changes that have occurred. The Royal Commission also recognises the widespread community support which, at the time of writing, had already been forthcoming for the process of reconciliation. I can report to the House that the ground swell of support for the reconciliation process has continued with endorsement coming from a wide range of Aboriginal organisations and individuals as well as from diverse sections of the non-Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a responsibility on the occasion of the tabling of this report to invite the Opposition to join with the rest of the Australian Parliament to give unanimous backing to the proposal for the process of reconciliation endorsed by the Royal Commission. I embrace wholeheartedly the concluding aspiration of the Royal Commission, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>In the end, perhaps together, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, the situation can be reached where this ancient, subtly creative Aboriginal culture exists in friendship alongside the non-Aboriginal culture. Such an achievement would be a matter of pride not only for all Australians but for all humankind. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia, as a nation, had been able to achieve this recognition and reconciliation before this date, these tragic deaths may have been avoided. We might have been able to spare families the suffering they have experienced. It is not too late, however, for other deaths to be prevented. The Royal Commissioners have given us their insights, their advice and a clear direction for change. The families of those who have died, and indeed all Australians, have a right to expect that governments at all levels and of all political persuasions will act together to make sure that that change takes place. I commend the report to the House and I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the past the Opposition has been critical of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Today I intend to put that behind us and address the report and the very important issues raised in it. This is a report of some 5,000 pages and 339 recommendations. In spite of the fact that I speed read, I have been able to have only a very cursory glance at it today. So what I say is very much first impressions and very much personal feelings that one experiences when one tries to address an issue such as this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On looking at Commissioner Johnston's work I was overwhelmed not only at the size, scope and complexity of the report but also at the issues raised in it. When the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) asked me to take on the job as shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs I had a telephone call from my friend and colleague the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney). He said to me, `You're very lucky. This job will change you. No-one does this job and remains the same'. I did not know what he meant, but after having had the job for 12 months I do know. It is not possible to spend the whole of one's time travelling around the country talking to Aboriginal people-looking at their hopes and aspirations and the problems they face-without having a different attitude to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> As I read Commissioner Johnston's report I very much felt emotions of joy, frustration and anger. They are also the feelings one gets in doing a job such as this: one feels joy at some of the successes happening around the place; one feels frustration at the scope of the challenge and at the pace in which opinion moves in Aboriginal society; and one feels anger when one sees Aboriginal people being manipulated by outsiders for other agendas, and one feels this far too often. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission has found that the conclusions in this report-in its own words-`will not accord with the expectations of those who anticipated that findings of foul play would be inevitable and frequent'. That is not the conclusion the commissioners reached. The conclusion they reached was that Aboriginal people die in custody at a rate exactly equal to that of non-Aboriginal people. A very large number of Aboriginal deaths in custody are purely a function of the imprisonment rate. Then they go on to discuss in length why Aboriginal people are so often in prison. </PARA>
<PARA> If I had one area of disappointment with the report it was that while it identified poverty as a major factor in the Aboriginal condition it did not look at poverty in itself in relation to the imprisonment rate. My experience as a doctor is certainly that if one were to compare a group of non-Aboriginal people in similar poverty one would find a much higher imprisonment rate than the normal population. In spite of that, Aboriginality is obviously an important factor in the imprisonment rate. </PARA>
<PARA> It also looked at the inequality and disadvantage that Aboriginal people face. From time to time when I am in rural and remote Australia I really have pangs of conscience. Many of the problems Aboriginal people face are also faced by all people in rural and remote Australia. This came home to me very much the other day in Cunnamulla when I was travelling with the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). I was talking to a local, who said to me, `I have lived here 37 years and in that time only two people from this high school have ever gone on to tertiary education'. I do not mean to belittle the problems of Aboriginal people in any way, but I cannot help remembering that many of their problems are faced by many other people. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few recommendations that I would particularly like to take up because they touched a chord with me. Some weeks ago, the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), and I, both registered doctors, actually went to Hermannsburg in the Northern Territory for a week and practised as doctors in an Aboriginal health service. We treated kids with diarrhoea, some of whom had to be evacuated because they were in a life threatening situation. We saw people under 40 years of age with advanced aggressive diabetes, who would be lucky to live for a matter of months. We saw health data going back to 1945 which showed very clearly that people in Hermannsburg are dying younger now than they did in 1970 or in 1945. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things mentioned in the report relates to health data. Recommendation 246 states:</PARA>
<PARA>That the State, Territory and Commonwealth governments act to put an end to this situation where insufficient accurate and comprehensive information on inputs to and activities of Aboriginal health programs is available. Such information is needed if Aboriginal organizations, governments and the community are to be in a position to understand and monitor what is taking place in this area . . .</PARA>
<PARA>When I first became shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs I asked for what health data was available over time to try to get a sense of what was happening and whether what we were doing in Aboriginal Affairs was having a positive or negative effect, or no effect at all on the health of Aboriginal people. I found that the only available information came from the Pitjantjatjara lands and from the Aboriginal Congress in Alice Springs where a 1981 and a 1986 health survey had been done. That was the only place in the country where I could get any reasonable serial health data on Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> What that survey found was that, for all our effort, the health of Aboriginal people had not changed one jot in five years. The people at the Congress were actually rather embarrassed and defensive about it. That did not concern me at all. In fact, I was absolutely thrilled that at least somewhere in Australia they had the data to allow them to be honest enough with themselves to say, `Is what we are doing having any effect or should we perhaps look to modify it because we are not having the changes that we effected?'. </PARA>
<PARA> It makes it impossible to have an honest debate with oneself, within one's Party and within the broader Australian community, unless we actually know where we start from, where we are trying to get to and how we are going to know if what we are doing is having an effect. Quite frankly, activity does not equate with outcomes. They do not have to be our outcomes. They have to be outcomes that are negotiated in consultation with Aboriginal people and they have to be outcomes that they have a stake in. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also talks about the evaluation process, in relation particularly to Aboriginal health services. Chapter 31.3.56 states:</PARA>
<PARA>It is clearly beyond the scope of the Royal Commission to seek to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the approximately 70 AHSs in operation in Australia. Indeed, no agency has done so. </PARA>
<PARA>So after 19 years of operation of independent Aboriginal health services, no-one has ever sought to look at their efficiency and operation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not to criticise the health services themselves, but, really, the situation is crazy. Aboriginal people should not tolerate a situation in which they are getting a service which is not good value for money. If nothing else, I hope that this report will seek to provide some impetus to the really urgent need to look at performance indicators through all areas so that Aboriginal people themselves know they are getting good value for the money that is being spent. </PARA>
<PARA> The report talks about health workers and the Northern Territory's experiences in this regard. Recommendation 262 states:</PARA>
<PARA>That the States recognise the contributions of Aboriginal Health Workers and, in doing so, review the Northern Territory's experience of the establishment of appropriate career structures and the registration of them. </PARA>
<PARA>The experience of the shadow Minister for health and I when we were working at Hermannsburg was that the Aboriginal health worker system is one of the most exciting and innovative in the country. It really can provide a lead to the rest of Australia. It highlights one of the problems that remote Australia faces; not just Aboriginal communities, but anyone living in remote Australia. I refer to the problem of providing medical or para- amedical services. People in these places never see a doctor. By and large, the health facilities are run by nurses. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the fallouts of this report was Sister Sophie Heathcoate in Wilcannia who was criticised in an earlier report, struck off the nursing register and, only in recent weeks, has had that overturned by a court in New South Wales. Unfortunately, the board that looked at her and the royal commissioner who criticised her, missed the point. In doing so they sent ripples throughout remote nursing areas in Australia. Remote nurses are being asked to provide services for which they are not trained. They are providing services for which they do not get adequate backup or adequate assistance. I hope that in looking at the whole area of Aboriginal health and remote Australia health services we can realise that there are people who are doing quite extraordinary work and need far more backup than they are getting at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The report raises a number of other issues which I will only just touch on. It talks about vouchers. I raise this matter for a reason that will become obvious. In volume 5 of the report, under Northern Territory issues, two recommendations have been made. It is recommended that there be an amendment to the Social Security Act to prevent cheques from being mailed and cashed to alcohol outlets and, secondly, that schemes such as the Tangentyere food coupons scheme, which allows people to bank with the Tangentyere branch bank and withdraw savings only as food coupons, be supported and extended. </PARA>
<PARA> Some months ago the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory wrote to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) and suggested that possible schemes involving food coupons should be looked at. I have a copy of the Minister's reply. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>You should already be aware that I have no intention of supporting the Northern Territory Government's failure to act in this area by introducing racial discrimination into the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention this not to score points off Senator Richardson but to highlight the point that Aboriginal affairs is an area that has entrenched political views and entrenched political antagonisms. There may be an element of truth in arguments on both sides of politics. There is also a very great element of mistrust. The mistrust is not just on one side of politics. However, with letters such as the above, the mistrust is on both sides of politics. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to reconciliation. Reconciliation is mentioned at length in the report and the Minister mentioned it. In the overview, Commissioner Johnston talks about reconciliation and says:</PARA>
<PARA>The process of reconciliation demands a very strong commitment to the elimination of that Aboriginal social, economic and cultural disadvantage which is the basic reason for the disproportionate number of Aboriginal men and women in custody--</PARA>
<PARA>The discussion paper that has been released by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) is necessarily vague. That makes it very difficult to give a firm reply at this stage before we have seen the legislation. However, I say to the Minister now: if he wants to take up Commissioner Johnston's recommendation on page 25 of his overview and have a process of reconciliation that focuses on the social, economic and cultural disadvantage of Aboriginal people, there is a good chance that he will get support from right round the country. There is a good chance that we can take a small step in trying to remove that mistrust that exists on both sides of politics. </PARA>
<PARA> Yes, we have accepted for a long time that reconciliation is important, but reconciliation is difficult because it means a lot of things to a lot of people. However, if we want to look at the economic, social and cultural disadvantage of Aboriginal people and the ways of removing them, I think we have somewhere where we can go together. </PARA>
<PARA> This report comes 24 years after the 1967 referendum, mentioned by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. That is a generation of people. It shows how Australian people have really let down Aboriginal people in that generation. The Minister commented that the report stands as an indictment of the operation of the legal and corrective services system in respect of the most disadvantaged group in Australian society. I would go further: I would say all areas of government have failed, and are failing, Aboriginal people. Where the successes have occurred-as noted in this report, and in my strong experience of travelling around the country-they have occurred in spite of government, not because of government. They have occurred because Aboriginal people have been prepared to take their problems into their own hands and do something about solving them. </PARA>
<PARA> So, in as much as this report focuses on how people can help themselves, how they can obtain economic independence, how we can have practical services on the ground and practical solutions to complex problems, then there is somewhere where we can get cross-party support in the Parliament for the recommendations in this report. The loss of a loved one is a catastrophic event, and this report is the culmination of the loss of 99 people. That may be little consolation for the families of those who are involved, but the report does give us the opportunity to move forward. I would hope that sometime down the road those who have been touched by this might feel that something good has come out of it. Certainly we in the Opposition will do our very best to see that that happens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am proposing today what I believe to be a very important matter of public importance (MPI). But yet again, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) does not grace this Parliament and offer a response. I think it is the ninth matter of public importance that I have taken since I became Leader of the Opposition, and again I say that the Prime Minister has not got the decency to front this Parliament. Indeed, the only way we can get the Prime Minister to come into this Parliament and debate the economy or debate his leadership is to censure him. When we do that of course, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) runs around all over the place and all over the gallery saying that we are abusing the privilege of censure. The Prime Minister's failure to take matters of public importance does not really trouble me, but it is a sign of the disrespect with which he holds this Parliament and his unwillingness to be held accountable for his policies and his policy failures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This matter of public importance is about integrity, competence and leadership in government. The MPI in particular is about the Prime Minister's lack of integrity, his pronounced incompetence and his decided lack of leadership. His Government has been guilty of many things, many catastrophic blunders in fact. It has engineered a recession we never needed to have, and the magnitude of that has been evidenced by today's unemployment data. It has presided over the worst fall in living standards in living memory; it has presided over an explosion of our international debt that prejudices the future of many Australians that are yet unborn; and it has failed to deliver on so many promises, but particularly promises relating to substantial reform. These have not just been honest mistakes by this Government. They have been a demonstration, really, of this Government's fundamental incompetence, and they have also been a demonstration of the corrupt frame of mind within which it operates. It has been a government which has put its survival first and the interests of Australians last. It is a Prime Minister who puts mateship ahead of integrity and ahead of leadership. He looks after his mates, but he forgets about the rest of us. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister is a failed leader of a failed government. He is showing an appalling lack of integrity, an appalling lack of confidence and an appalling incapacity for leadership in what are the most difficult circumstances we have seen in this country in 60 years. Indeed, ever since the last election, he and his Government have staggered from one crisis to the next. They are out of ideas, they are out of touch and they are out of time. This Government has-I think this is a point worth noting-betrayed the people whom it is supposed to represent. Just 45 years ago, Ben Chifley said that the Labor Party was:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a movement bringing something better to the people; better standards of living, greater happiness to the mass of the people. We have-</PARA>
<PARA>said Chifley-</PARA>
<PARA>a great objective-the light on the hill-which we aim to reach by working for the betterment of mankind not only here but anywhere we may give a helping hand. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government, the Hawke Government, has put that light on the hill out for some 350,000 people, the people who have become unemployed in the course of the last 18 months in the recession the Treasurer (Mr Keating) says we had to have, but everyone in Australia knows we never needed to have. </PARA>
<PARA> Last month, for example, the Prime Minister boasted that the foundation of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) was `advancing the interests of the ordinary men and women of Australia'. Let us look at today's unemployment data and see how he has advanced the interests of the ordinary working men and women of Australia: the unemployment rate in April was 9.9 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis. It is the highest since October 1983. But youth unemployment most disturbingly has already reached 27 per cent and is well on the way to confirming the worst fears of most people, namely, that it is headed for 30 per cent, which will be an unequalled historical record. Most importantly, perhaps, the adult male unemployment rate hit 10.3 per cent today, which is the highest on record and, as I said before, 350,000 people have been thrown on the unemployment scrap heap since October of 1989. This month, the month of April, has seen an increase in unemployment of 66,900 people, which is the largest since that survey of unemployment begun. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, and I think most pointedly, when we look around each of the States we see that it is the Labor States where unemployment has rocketed away. In Victoria, it is 10.5 per cent; in Queensland, it is 10.7 per cent; in South Australia, it is 10.3 per cent; in Western Australia, it is 11.1 per cent; and in Tasmania, it is 10.8 per cent. Only in one State, a Liberal managed State where the Greiner Government is about to be re-elected because of its good economic management, the unemployment rate has risen to 8.6 per cent. Perhaps the most sobering thing about the unemployment data is to look beyond that published data to some other data that the Government no longer publishes but which was recently obtained as a result of a freedom of information request. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) data shows that there are already now in excess of one million Australians looking for work. With the current survey if a person works more than one hour he or she is dropped out of the unemployment data. But let us take the number of 15 hours and add those who have worked less than 15 hours in a week to the official data that was released today; we find that there are 1.6 million people looking for work or an unemployment rate of 19.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has gone out of its way to fudge the unemployment data over a very long period of time. It has pushed people off into other benefits. It has stopped releasing key pieces of unemployment data, like that CES data, which hide the full extent of our unemployment situation which is clearly approaching now the order of magnitude of the Great Depression of the early 1930s. As I say, this Government has betrayed the people that it is supposed to represent. Those people want to know, all Australians want to know-in terms of the Prime Minister's statement of looking after the best interests of the ordinary working men and women in Australia-how it is that we have an unemployment rate approaching 19 per cent; or how is it that the 350,000 people, who have been thrown onto the unemployment scrap heap just since October 1989, have had their best interests served by this Government?</PARA>
<PARA> In recent weeks, I have walked around a lot of factory floors in Australia and gone down a lot of mines and spoken to a lot of people-car factories like Ford and Nissan, mines all over Western Australia and Queensland; I have spoken to workers at the Shepparton SPC Cannery and talked to people about how this Government has betrayed their best interests. All those people make one particular point. They do not want any more special deals to help Labor's rich mates. They want a realistic plan to make this country prosperous again. They know that all that Labor offers is simply more deals with union bosses; more soft options with weak management; more sleazy, grubby deals to save a few votes here and a few votes there in a desperate effort to secure re-election. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Labor there have been eight years of grubby deals, of putting its political survival ahead of the best interests of the people of Australia. The people of Australia do not mind tough action and tough medicine. They just want to be given a chance to compete on equal terms. They just want to be able to put things right at their workplace and have the opportunity to negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment with their employers. They are tired of union blackmail, they are tired of union influence and they are tired of a government that is dominated by union control. </PARA>
<PARA> There is only one party in Australia which is a party of privilege and that is the Australian Labor Party. The parties of the workers now in Australia are the Liberal and National parties. I make this point to Leader of the House, who is sitting at the table and scoffing: how many honourable members opposite thought they would be defending people such as Laurie Connell and Alan Bond as members of the ALP? Australians deserve a fair deal and we should challenge the Prime Minister to give them that fair deal. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of questions I would like to put to the Prime Minister on behalf of the people of Australia. Why does the Prime Minister not give the Australian people a fair deal by stopping all the special deals that he has done with his mates? Why does he not tell the Australian people, for example, the truth about the recession that he engineered before the last election or that he allowed his Treasurer to engineer before the last election? Why does he not tell the Australian people the truth about why we have such a shoddy transport system or why we have such a hopeless waterfront or why the waterfront is a national disgrace in this country? Why do we have such awful railways, such excessive taxation and such inefficient labour markets? Why does he not tell them the truth about that? It is because of his special deals with his special mates in the trade union movement. People are beginning to understand the cost of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, I ask the Prime Minister why he does not tell the people the truth about why we have such archaic rules in particular industries, such as the airlines and the media. The people of Australia are starting to understand it is because of the special deals that he has done with his special mates in big business. So why does he not just tell the people of Australia the truth about his Government?</PARA>
<PARA> It is supposed to be a labour government; it is supposed to be a government by, of and for the workers of this country. Instead it has turned out to be a government by, of and for the Prime Minister's rich mates. It is no wonder there is so much talk about a leadership challenge on the other side of the House these days. Probably nobody has done greater harm to the real cause of the working people of Australia than our Prime Minister. Our Prime Minister is in fact our national problem. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know, of course, the magnitude of the reform agenda that should be embraced if we are to put our house in order. There are no easy solutions, no quick fixes and no miracles. We have to have decided, hard-headed, clear-cut leadership, and it will need to be sustained over a period of time. We need to lower interest rates and we need thereby to produce a more competitive exchange rate. We need to do that by doing a lot of other things, in particular moving to enterprise bargaining at the workplace level so that the workers that I described before can control their own destiny and can get a fair return for effort and initiative and by lifting their game. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to reduce the role and influence of government in our society to the extent to which people cannot so easily put their hands out for support rather than putting their hands up to help themselves. We need to lower tax as a consequence of that so as to restore incentive. We need to fix up those transport and other infrastructure industries. We are not just fixing them up for the sake of reform: we want to deliver lower transport charges; we want to deliver lower waterfront charges; we want to deliver lower telephone charges; we want to deliver lower air fares, because they are the benefits that the people of Australia are looking for as a result of a genuine reform process. But they are the benefits that the people have been denied by a government which is incapable of truth, honesty, integrity and leadership. We need to boost national savings, not erode them and make fun of them as the Treasurer has done in recent days. We need to boost our productivity, we need to boost our exports; we need to do a host of other things, including improving the quality of our education and our health schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister knows all that. Indeed, in his most cynical moods, he embraces the rhetoric-he picks up the words, he uses the phrases-while he knowingly continues to inflict pain and hardship on the average Australian. Today's unemployment numbers are a very clear-cut example. They are the bottom line, in effect, of miserable economic management on the part of the Prime Minister. There is a lack of concern, a lack of compassion, a lack of understanding. He is simply looking after his own political survival, as I have said, at the expense of average Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I would put it to honourable members opposite that, in terms of the words of Ben Chifley, it is time to rekindle the light on the hill; it is time to dump the Prime Minister; it is time to dump the Prime Minister's rich mates. Is the best Labor leader really a cigar-puffing mate of millionaires or is a better Labor leader a clock-collecting, Mercedes-driving yuppie who tends to forget where he lives on occasions? I appeal to honourable members opposite: do something for the unemployed in this country-make the Prime Minister and the Treasurer join their ranks now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is meeting with the National Catholic Education Commission at this moment and, subsequent to that, he will be meeting with the employers of waterfront labour. The Prime Minister will be doing what he has been doing for the last eight years, and that is governing this nation, just as the Opposition will be doing what it has been doing for the last eight years-marching into this place with a series of meaningless slogans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask honourable members to look at all the internal contradictions in the speech by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). There were tears for the unemployed. We wish they were genuine. But at the same time he says that the Government should stand back, that the Government should not be involved in handouts, that the Government should cut $3 billion off the welfare system-not $3 billion off the welfare system when there are people back at work but $3 billion at any particular point of time. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the man who said he does not defend the top end of town. Yet the one policy on which we have absolute clarity from the Liberal Party of Australia is this: there will be a 15 per cent consumption tax on the food of the ordinary people of this country, on the clothing of the ordinary people of this country, on the necessities of life of the ordinary people of this country and on the telephone bills of the ordinary people of this country. Far from going down, they will go up by 15 per cent. On every single item that is essential to the livelihood of people of this country he will impose a 15 per cent tax. Who will benefit? The beneficiaries will be the people from whom the capital gains tax is removed. And who are the beneficiaries from whom the capital gains tax is removed? The top end of town. So those millionaires that he so laughingly referred to during his speech, many of whom have gone broke but still have residual properties, will be the massive beneficiaries of the changes in capital gains tax that the Opposition wants to bring about. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say this: when the next election comes around there will be no recession; when the next election comes around it will have bottomed out. What the Opposition will be doing to the people of this country is marching into them and saying, `Right, well, the recession is over, you are all back to work, or most of you are back to work. What we have is a really great idea for you. Because you might be used to a bit of suffering, we will make it permanent; we will whack that 15 per cent on your necessities of life. But, you lucky people, you will know as you do that that the Laurie Connells, the Alan Bonds, the businessmen who are a darned sight more respectable than either of them down the line, but are of course part of the top end of town, will have their tax removed'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a disgraceful position for any political party to come in and argue, at the same time coming out with a string of mealy-mouthed slogans, as has the Leader of the Opposition. I have listened to the Leader of the Opposition many times in this place. It is my melancholy duty as Leader of the House to do so. Every time I have heard him speak he has had a string of platitudes. Sometimes the platitudes have force, if the circumstances permit, if the circumstances outside give them force; sometimes they do not. But they are always platitudes; there is no argument. We got those platitudes again here today from the Leader of the Opposition. He had his statistics to cite; let me now cite some. </PARA>
<PARA> In the current recession, total employment has fallen by 2.5 per cent. In the 1982-83 recession, total employment fell by 3.3 per cent. The 1982-83 recession wiped out 40.1 per cent of the total employment growth the Fraser Government achieved between November 1975 and the start of that recession. There was a 40 per cent reduction under the advice given by the current Leader of the Opposition as a political adviser to the Treasurer of the day, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who has just entered this House-both of whom would wish to return to the job. </PARA>
<PARA> The employment fall since last year's July peak has wiped out only 12 per cent of the total employment growth achieved by the Hawke Government between its election in 1983 and last July. Under Fraser, the labour force participation rate fell from 62.7 per cent in November 1975 to 60.4 per cent in March 1983. The highest it ever reached, in the so-called resources boom on which those opposite hung so much and on which 18 per cent wage rises occurred as they let wage rises rip uncontrolled, was 61.5 per cent. Under this Government the labour force participation rate has shot up from 60.3 per cent in April 1983 to a peak of 64.2 per cent in July 1990. It is now 63.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The only way Fraser, Howard and Hewson stopped unemployment rates in the teens was by running the economy in such a way that tens of thousands of people became discouraged from looking for work and disappeared out of the figures into hidden unemployment. That is when there was hidden unemployment, not now. </PARA>
<PARA> What hypocrisy there is from those opposite. When the Liberal Party was running with those unemployment figures of over 10 per cent, it was running at an inflation rate of 11 per cent. The inflation rate at this stage of the game is around 5 per cent, and going down. When the Liberal Party was in government, the rate was 11 per cent and going up. The Liberal Party laid waste to this country's manufacturing industry, which has since been in a process of recovery. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We get smart alec comments from the toppletoy opposite-the fellow who falls over and bounces up again, the fellow who cannot get a decent press conference going because, fundamentally, everybody accepts that he is an economic illiterate. The honourable member for Flinders is the man who would be Treasurer if the Liberal Party were to come into office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those opposite come into this place baying that they will introduce reforms into the economy. Who deregulated the exchange rate? Who deregulated the banking system? Who allowed the currency to fall to a level that at least allowed people and industry in this country a fighting chance? Who has removed the tariffs? Who has introduced that program of phasing tariffs out? All Liberal Party members can say is, `Gee, that is pretty good; we will do it faster'. They say, `We do not have to worry you out there in industry'. They will laugh at industry on this one. They say, `We do not have to worry those out there in industry, because we will achieve reform on the waterfront'. `Oh, yes', they say. </PARA>
<PARA> How do they intend to achieve reform on the waterfront? `Well', they say, `we will introduce a law which says that if you are a member of a trade union it is on a voluntary basis'. They say that will cure the waterfront. Will the Liberal Party actually involve itself on behalf of the shippers or anyone else in the negotiating process? Oh, no. Those in the Liberal Party say it is a matter for the employees and employers to work out after they have introduced their proposals and after they have introduced legislation which takes away the right to lifetime employment on the waterfront-the sort of legislation that they normally put in place to ensure that the ordinary people in Australia benefit. They say that when they have done that we will find ourselves in a situation where the waterfront actually cures itself. If it does not, they say they have a great fall back position: put the troops onto the waterfront; put the soldiers onto the waterfront. They say that, in order to benefit the ordinary people of Australia, they are going to put the soldiers in whenever they have a disagreement with those on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party does not know how to operate industrial relations systems. The honourable member for Bennelong had plenty of good words of praise for Ben Chifley. I am one of the few people in the House who has had experience of the utilisation of the armed forces in industrial disputes. It does not happen off the top of one's head, because the armed forces do not want to be in it. They particularly do not want to be in it when they are doing somebody else's job. They will tolerate being in it when they are in a situation where they are doing their own job in the ordinary way. </PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances in which they found themselves in the pilots dispute, that is exactly what they did. However, it was the Transport Workers Union of Australia which handled the baggage, it was the clerks and others who handled the tickets, and it was the TWU and the other transport unions which were running cargo to and from the airports. That was fine, because there was agreement. If one does not get that agreement, what will happen on the waterfront, of course, will be that every product that comes off it will be black-listed. I have not yet seen anywhere in the Opposition's expenditure plans a proposal to expand the armed forces to something like 500,000 to take care of such a situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say something else about the soldiers. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott), who is in the chamber, is a soldier. He is one of the group of soldiers who actually do the work on the waterfront. If people go through our ranks, they will find that it will not be the officers in the defence forces, but the ordinary soldiers, sailors and airmen, who will be the people required to do that work. It will be the brothers and sisters, fathers, uncles and cousins of the people on the waterfront and elsewhere in the transportation system. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot walk into either a store or a base for a major transport company and not find a substantial proportion of the work force who are members of the armed forces. Honourable members opposite would not know that, but let me tell them that they could not do it. If they think for one minute that the soldiers are going to tolerate the way in which those in the Liberal Party, in their careless, ignorant manner, would choose to exploit them in that fashion as far as the waterfront is concerned, then they have another thing coming. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell those opposite something else about what they will confront when we go to the polls two years from now. They will not be confronting a recession. They will be arguing about their wages policies; they will be arguing about their decisions to introduce a 15 per cent consumption tax on the ordinary Australian's necessities of life; and they will also be arguing about $3 billion of welfare cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the Liberal Party's opposition, in the last eight years we have cleaned up the welfare act of the Commonwealth. Over the coalition's collective political dead body, we have introduced more effective means testing and assets testing arrangements. Members of the Opposition have been shrieking away at us at election after election. They have had no theory about how they can decently conduct welfare policy in this country, and they still do not have one, because they have not specified where cuts are coming from. They cannot get the required levels of cuts unless they start dealing with the unemployed, for whom they weep tears here, the pensioners of this country or, probably, both. A third area, of course, concerns those who are in receipt of family assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> What depths of hypocrisy those opposite have managed to get themselves into. They are riding reasonably high at the moment. In a recession, what bunch of political mugs do not if they are in opposition? Who does not ride high in opposition in the middle of a recession? Those opposite are riding high at the moment, but they carry the baggage of years of defence of privilege, which they cannot get out of their policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to know where the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is. Why is the Treasurer not down here to talk about and to defend his policies in respect of unemployment? Why is the Treasurer skulking in his office on the day that we get the worst set of unemployment figures for nearly a decade? When is the Treasurer going to have the guts to come into the Parliament to defend the failures of his policies? When is he going to have the decency to admit the failure of his economic policies? How much longer is this Parliament going to have to put up with the rubbish that we get from this Treasurer and this Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the so-called recovery coming through? How long is it going to take for it to dawn on this Treasurer that his policies have been an absolute disaster for this country? How thick can the Treasurer be? He is yet to equate the fact that he is the first Treasurer, the first Deputy Prime Minister, to have full time security outside his own home to the disastrous economic policies which he has imposed on this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These figures are a disaster-9.9 per cent and rising, and a clear breach in the making of yet another promise from the Prime Minister and others that unemployment would not go beyond 10 per cent. What an indictment on Labor, not just federally but at the State level as well. If we take out New South Wales we see that all the Labor States are now at 10 per cent or more. The excuses we have had from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer today simply will not wash. There is no excuse for the fact that we now have 844,000 people unemployed, and many of them unable to look to their families. It is no good talking about the participation rate; that is a sick joke. What is motivating the participation rate figures is that this lot, the Government, has forced the mums of Australia out to work just to make ends meet. That is the only excuse the Government could offer during Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government promised increased living standards. What do we get? Lower living standards. The Treasurer promised a golden age for this country. We now enter one of the darkest periods of Australia's economy since the 1930s. What a sick joke it was when someone declared the Treasurer to be the world's greatest Treasurer. What effrontery it was from the Prime Minister today when he said that we had one of the world's best Treasurers. He repeated it. It is just incredible at a time when unemployment has reached massive heights. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has got a few things right. The Treasurer had John Stone cheering him on the economy for the first few months that he was in; but basically the Treasurer is a phoney, a miserable creature who has wreaked havoc on literally thousands of Australians. Now we get the ultimate arrogance; this bloke desperately wants to be Prime Minister. I have got news for this Treasurer. He has long been a bridesmaid and he will long remain the bridesmaid of Australian politics. </PARA>
<PARA> I was not surprised when I saw the figure of 9.9 per cent. This is what the Government planned. This is the unemployment we `had to have'. For the Treasurer, this is a beautiful set of numbers. The Government literally deliberately set out on a clear policy for the Australian economy of bash, burn and bury. It has stopped this economy in its tracks, and we get virtually no regrets whatsoever but a repetition of the fact that it has been an intentional policy all along. What do we also get from the Treasurer? He said, `The good news is it is going to be a good recovery'. The Government's line is that there are structural improvements. I say to the Treasurer that he ought to come into this Parliament and say to the young people of Australia what the structural benefit for them is-the figure is 27 per cent and rising-to have a time on unemployment benefit. He says that it is a good recession. What good will it do for young people? It is character building, I suppose. For eight years we have had disastrous economic management. When we ask for an explanation the Government gives us the great response, `It was worse under you lot'. </PARA>
<PARA> Last November, the Treasurer said-this was a classic line-`Don't you ever compare me with John Howard'. Never will we compare him with John Howard. When we look at the average unemployment under the Fraser Administration, we see that for the whole time of the Fraser years, it was 5.8 per cent. What is it today, and what has been the average unemployment under Labor? It is 7.7 per cent and rising. So if the Government wants to make comparisons with the Fraser years, let us have those comparisons because there is no comparison. The figure is rising. Not only that, things literally are getting worse. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer was at Port Pirie the other day and he said that the recovery was coming through now. That is not true. I do not call the Treasurer a liar.

For males it is the highest unemployment rate ever recorded since the Depression. Government members should take that figure back to their electorates. This month it is the biggest jump ever. The recovery argument relies on four points. One is that things are better on the balance of payments. I would just say that any idiot could bring on a reduction in imports by bringing on a recession; that is it. The Government says that stock building is going to help. People will not be building up stocks if there is no demand for the things they sell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government says that housing is going to lead the recovery. Government members should read the Age today, because it contains a report of the Government's own forecasters, the Australian Council of Trade Unions leading bureaucrats, looking at what is happening in construction, both residential and non-residential, and engineering. It is a stunning figure that they forecast-and remember the Treasurer said that this is going to `lead the recovery'. The Government's own forecasters said yesterday that the total of that building activity in three years time is going to be less than what it is today. The Treasurer is relying on that for a recovery. That is just an illusion and shows that the Government is fiddling with figures. And I will tell the Government what-they will come back to haunt it. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point of the Government is that inflation is coming down. Of course it is. There is a recession. In the whole boom and bust cycle of the Australian economy, if there is a bust, there will get a cutback in inflation. It happened in 1982-83. Following that, we had a fall-back in inflation. For the Government to crow about the inflation record as a result of the recession is obviously nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to have an appreciation in this Parliament that, beyond the recession, this economy has some basic structural problems. It is those problems, which the Leader of the Opposition referred to, and the solutions to the problems that ought to be driving people's focus when we get a figure like 9.9 per cent unemployment. In a sense we ought to say, `Here's a figure. It's not good. There are a lot of people unemployed. Let's now take that constituency and get it behind the changes that we've got to make to our economy'. There is yet much to be done. Next week we will celebrate the fifth anniversary of the announcement of the coming of the banana republic. How appropriate it is that that should be preceded by today's unemployment figures. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring to this simple graph. At the end of this term Labor will have been in office for 13 of the last 20 years. It has basically been running this country-at Federal and State levels-for the last 20 years. This is a misery index, showing interest rates, unemployment and whatever. It shows the record of the last 20 years. The index went up after Whitlam-misery rose; Fraser held the line and started to get it down, and ever since we have seen a worsening situation for the average Australian family. It is time for change. It is time for the Government to go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some little while ago we received advice from many quarters about interest rates. Just after the last Federal election this Government received constant criticism from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) about its decision to reduce interest rates. We were told then that we were bringing down interest rates precipitately-that the time was not yet economically responsibly correct to bring down rates. Yet today we see the very people who were counselling high interest rates to us, and the retention of those rates at levels that we said needed to be reduced, turn around and say that we kept them too high too long and put forward the most populist and short-sighted responses to what everybody would say is a situation of extreme difficulty for those who actually face the tragedy of unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not at all an effective response from those on the opposite side to simply dig out rhetorical flourishes to criticise government. This Government has made hard decisions, and is continuing to do so. In the middle of what must be one of Australia's most difficult circumstances, where its export industries are having to face lower prices internationally in a whole range of commodities, this Government made courageous decisions on the question of tariffs. This Government has continued to confront issues, time after time, the hard way-the only way-that is, to confront them where they actually exist and to deal with the real forces that any government in office must come to terms with. </PARA>
<PARA> It is too easy, as has been the case in the debate today, for the Opposition simply to say that things are crook in Tallarook. Time after time we have had the moan of the Hanrahans-the Opposition really does have that flavour. `We'll all be rooned', is the consistent theme that is echoing from the Opposition. It comes time and time again without ceasing. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Opposition is actually asked to put its finger on any positive outcomes that it would urge on government we get evasions, we get generalities and we get the kind of emptiness that really degrades the whole process of this Parliament. For example, there is the commitment of the Opposition to massive decreases in public expenditure to the tune of $3,000m. Where is that going to come from? Which unfortunates are going to be hurt? Does the Opposition endorse the New Zealand experience where, after pledging commitments to pensions-pledging that pensions would not be cut-the incoming conservative New Zealand Government has slashed pensions by about 20 per cent in real terms? What about its pledge about unemployment beneficiaries at the last election-that after 12 months no unemployment benefit would be extended? What are people to do? Starve?</PARA>
<PARA> How can this patronising attitude today where concern is expressed about the plight of the unemployed be equated with a policy that would condemn the unemployed to the scrap heap? Basically, the Opposition is trying to sell itself to both sides of the street. It is trying to say, `We are a warm-hearted, compassionate party', but its policies would strip away the guts of the Australian social welfare system. They would strip away the protections that the Australian people have built up over generations so that they can expect a decent pension. If they do fall into trouble they can at least rely on a safety net of unemployment benefits and support. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the courage of the leadership? There has been instance after instance where the Leader of the Opposition has not had the support of his own party. On the subject of asset testing family allowance proposals so that scarce government resources could go to the most needy, he was rolled in his own party room. Even on a minor matter such as charges for the Australian War Memorial he was rolled in his party room. </PARA>
<PARA> On the Burke matter-an issue that I will be debating later today-the Leader of the Opposition has found it conveniently simple to attack his opponents on the basis of standards that he says ought to apply, that is, that when people's character and judgment are impugned before a commission of inquiry they ought stand aside, but there is a conspicuous failure to apply those same tests to those on his own side, in particular, in the case of the Tasmanian Premier, Robin Gray. </PARA>
<PARA> The bottom line, in a sense, is demonstration after demonstration not of leadership but of a very galling capacity to speak softly about issues and say to all, `Yes, certainly, we sympathise with you, we offer you a better future, we are concerned about the decline of living standards', yet endorse policies that are designed to reduce real living standards. All this discussion about concern for living standards is really simple hypocrisy. The basic criticism that has been made by the Opposition of the wages policy of this Government is that it has held up real wages at a time when, in its view, in significant areas of industry real wages should be coming down. So we get this double standard-trying to walk both sides of the street. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose most galling to me, in terms of seeking to get some comprehension of what ought to be a response to very difficult circumstances, is the failure to recognise that we need to look constructively at measures that are appropriate, not on a rhetorical basis, but on a substantive basis. There are real changes in the labour force that have occurred over the last decade. The fact that the participation rate has stood up so strongly over the last 12 months really attests to the fact that for the first time in Australia's history women are an integral part of the work force. It is not a case any more that women are an optional extra. In previous times in Australia's history, if there were hard economic circumstances the participation rate collapsed. That meant that women withdrew their efforts to seek work. This has not occurred and will no longer occur and we have to deal with new and changed circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> That presents great challenges for Government because not only must it seek to provide employment for school leavers entering the work force but also to incorporate new entrants from female members of the community who in the past did not see it as part of their vision of themselves to be in the work force. Women now see themselves as having a right and an entitlement, even at times of economic downturn, to participate in the work force. That is something we have to take into account. That is not to say that I do not believe the Government ought to be looking at other measures-there are many-but to condemn this Government for lack of courage and vigour in pursuing a bold policy at a time of hardship is frankly the stuff that deserves contempt. </PARA>

I think it is the case that we need to find some mechanisms to make sure that in addition to the industry measures announced by the Government, we find new initiatives to bring investment into venture capital and commercialisation of research and development for Australia's domestic industry infrastructure. On a number of occasions I have proposed initiatives for the superannuation industry and more recently to investigate tax exempt special savings accounts as a market-driven alternative. That would use the model of the British scheme, modified so that it would actually adopt and influence our industry program and use it in a constructive way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the fourth report of the Committee for 1991 relating to the construction of the Australian Embassy Complex, Jakarta, Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I thank the House. The report I have just tabled deals with the construction of a new chancery and associated recreational facilities in Jakarta. The Committee has concluded that there is a need to provide a purpose-built complex for the Australian Embassy in Jakarta to enable the mission to fulfil its representative functions. The new complex is also needed to provide cultural activity, space and staff amenities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed complex will be built on a recently acquired site in the Jakarta central business district. When referred to the Committee the limit-of-cost estimate for the work was $11.6m at December 1990 prices. However, as a result of the unexpected need to provide for on-site power generation, the estimated cost at the time of the public hearing in January 1991 had increased to $12.4m. However while it appears that on-site power generation will not now be required, the Overseas Property Group wishes to retain the additional cost in the estimate until this is confirmed. The Committee also recommended that a further cost of $800,000 be allowed for expansion purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> In recommending that the work proceed, the Committee recognised Aus- tralia's need to develop a positive and constructive relationship with Indonesia. Although the relationship between Australia and Indonesia has not been easy for either country in recent years, there is interest and willingness on both sides to improve those relations. The Committee believes it is important that, as the relationship continues to grow in substance and depth, the Embassy remains capable of effectively monitoring and coordinating the full range of interactions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Embassy is currently located in two physically separate buildings in the central commercial district of Jakarta, which is now dominated by large multistorey buildings. The chancery premises-one owned by the Australian Government and the other leased-are separated by a very busy, 10-lane major thoroughfare. The owned accommodation, which is a five-storey building opened in 1967, is located on a narrow site which is congested by open air car parking, maintenance workshops, store and plant rooms and recreational facilities. This building has been progressively supplemented by leased space in nearby premises as the Embassy's functions and staff numbers have expanded over the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as detracting from the Embassy's efficiency and cost-effectiveness, through the separation of functions and staff, the present office accommodation is inadequate to satisfy existing needs, provides substandard office accommodation and is adversely affecting the ability of the mission to realise its goals and objectives. Therefore the proposal is based on the need to house all Embassy staff in one building in an acceptable standard of office accommodation, to favourably reflect Australia's image in Indonesia and to meet the Australian Government's obligation as an employer to accommodate properly its employees. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter of concern to the Committee was the proposed size of the complex. As a result of the importance of Australia's relationship with Indonesia, it is inevitable that staff numbers will expand, thus requiring disruptive works to provide additional space. This was reinforced by the views of the Ambassador and Embassy staff in Jakarta. Therefore, the Committee has recommended that the project be expanded during the initial construction phase to include the shell of an additional floor and space for lateral expansion at a further cost of $800,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded that the site chosen for the new Australian Embassy complex in Jakarta is in a suitable location for its representative and administrative functions. It has also requested that it be provided with a copy of the energy audit of the complex, which is to be undertaken following its completion. </PARA>
<PARA> Concerns were raised by the Ambassador and staff in Jakarta over the architectural merit of the proposed project. The mission did not believe the design of the complex adequately reflected the importance of Australia's relationship with Indonesia. While not wishing to enter into a debate on the architectural merits of this project, the Committee believes the design rationale for Australian embassies should be reassessed. In particular, the Overseas Property Group should determine what the designs are meant to achieve-for example, a sense of Australian identity, a prestige image or merely a functional solution to suit a particular design requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Due to the restrictions in the Public Works Committee Act 1969 on meetings of the Public Works Committee outside Australia and its external Territories, the Committee was unable to inspect the proposed site or the existing Embassy complex in Jakarta. This is completely contrary to the normal practice of the Committee, which has always regarded site inspections as an integral and extremely important part of its work and consideration of a project. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter has been raised before and the time will come given some of the complexities of the projects about to be referred to the Committee-that the Committee will decide that without a site inspection it is impossible to discharge adequately the mandate given to it by Parliament. The Committee is aware that there are costs involved, but given the nature and the costs of some of these projects, it would sometimes be cheaper for the Committee or a sectional committee to conduct an on-site inspection than the present unsatisfactory arrangements, which often require local embassy staff and design and construction personnel to travel to Canberra to appear at our public hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the current Embassy project, due to the absence of a site inspection, the Committee was hampered in its consideration of the project, particularly in relation to the issue of size. The Committee believes that section 12(1) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 should be amended to allow it to meet outside Australia and its external Territories. The Committee has approached the Minister for Administrative Services-without much success, I might say on this matter. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill will give legislative effect to the package of measures associated with the petroleum resource rent tax (RRT) announced by the Government in the 1990-91 Budget. The Bill will extend, from 1 July 1990, the resource rent tax to Bass Strait, replacing the complex and arbitrary excise and royalty regime. The measure will not only permit the generation of a fair return to the community from the production of hydrocarbons, but will do so in a manner which encourages the producers to efficiently drain the Bass Strait province in a manner which has greater regard to the producers' capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also introduces a generous concession to exploration activities, permitting the deduction of exploration expenditure incurred from 1 July 1990 in respect of all offshore operations subject to the RRT, against RRT liability on a wider basis than at present. Exploration expenditure incurred by a person will now be deductible for the purposes of the resource rent tax against the RRT liability of any of the projects held by that person, rather than only those projects undertaken in the relevant permit area as at present. This is a significant reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The package of measures will provide a more certain and efficient basis for the taxation of petroleum production and encourage exploration activity in offshore Australia, our most prospective area. The resource rent tax is based on achieved profits rather than production levels and is, therefore, sensitive to changes in prices and costs. This responsiveness will remove the pressure for continual changes to the taxation regime in the Bass Strait as production declines or market conditions vary. </PARA>
<PARA> The extension of the resource rent tax to Bass Strait will, as I indicated earlier, promote the optimal recovery of Bass Strait petroleum reserves. New fields will become viable and recovery from existing fields will be enhanced. This is expected to lead to the recovery of a further 200-300 million barrels of oil from Bass Strait and, over the longer term, it can be expected that gas production will also be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of wider deductibility for exploration expenditure will improve the efficiency of the resource rent tax and stimulate the exploration effort in offshore Australia. Previously, deductibility was limited to individual permit areas. The new arrangements make the after tax cost of exploration within RRT paying permits the same as the cost outside those permits. The current disincentive to explore in frontier areas will, therefore, be removed, an important change for the discovery of new hydrocarbon accumulation. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the significant benefits to industry of wider deductibility of exploration expenditure, the existing carry forward arrangements for undeducted expenditures under the RRT will be modified. The new arrangement will reflect the relative likelihood of recovering exploration and development expenditures, in contrast to the existing composite carry forward rate. The carry forward rate for general expenditures incurred from 1 July 1990 will be reduced from the long term bond rate plus 15 percentage points to the long term bond rate plus five percentage points. Undeducted exploration expenditure will continue to be eligible for compounding at the long term bond rate plus 15 percentage points. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, at this point I announce a minor change in the treatment of resource rent tax payments under the income tax law. Under the existing provisions, RRT is deductible for income tax purposes only after the final assessment has been made-typically in the income tax year following that in which the instalments are made. The Government has decided that instalments of RRT should be deductible for income tax purposes in the income tax year in which they are paid. </PARA>
<PARA> This change, which will apply to payments of instalments made on or after 1 July 1991, is consistent with the general principle that an income tax deduction should arise when a payment is made. Legislation giving effect to this change is expected to be introduced into the Parliament as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government has been aware of concerns that the transition from excise and royalty in Bass Strait to the more efficient resource rent tax could cause changes to Victorian gas prices, with possibly disruptive consequences for industry and domestic consumers. The Government has, therefore, decided to provide the Victorian Government with a special grant of $30m for each of the first two years of application of resource rent tax, to minimise any transitional pressures on gas prices. </PARA>
<PARA> This payment is in addition to the commitment made in last year's Budget to ensure that Victoria will receive revenues in 1990-91 and 1991-92 equivalent to the royalty revenue it would have received under the excise/royalty regime. In this way, Victoria will not be exposed to any significant short term adjustment pressures as a result of the extension of the resource rent tax to Bass Strait. At the same time, the Victorian economy, and Australia generally, will benefit from the long term improvements in efficiency and additional investment and production that resource rent tax will generate in Bass Strait. I now turn to outline some specific features of the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>Bass Strait</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Resource rent tax will apply to petroleum recovered from 1 July 1990 in the area of the Bass Strait permit known as VIC/P1. For the purposes of the tax all production licences related to the Bass Strait permit will be treated as one project and all expenditures incurred before 1 July 1990 will be taken to have been deducted. Although the resource rent tax is the effective secondary tax regime applying to Bass Strait from 1 July 1990, producers have continued to be liable for excise and royalty. The amount of excise and royalty paid by the producers up to 30 June 1991 will be used as a credit against their final resource rent tax assessment for the 1990-91 year. Any excess payments will be refunded to the producers. </PARA>
<PARA>Wider Deductibility</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Where a person has excess deductible exploration expenditure from one project that is incurred on or after 1 July 1990, that excess will be transferable to other projects held by that person that otherwise have a tax liability. For company groups expenditure will be transferable on a groupwide basis. To prevent potentially significant revenue losses under wider deductibility, compounding of undeducted expenditure at the long term bond rate plus 15 percentage points will be limited to expenditure incurred within five years before the year in which the production licence was granted in relation to the project against which the expenditure is being deducted. Exploration expenditure incurred more than five years before the relevant year will be eligible for compounding at the GDP deflator. This is consistent with the existing project basis carry forward arrangements which limit compounding of the long term bond rate plus 15 percentage points to expenditure incurred within five years before a project's production licence came into force. </PARA>
<PARA> The transfer provisions for wider deductibility of exploration expenditure will contain certain anti-avoidance measures. These will require a person to have an interest in both the project in which the expenditure was incurred and the project to which the expenditure is being transferred at the time the expenditure was incurred, at the time of transfer and any intervening period. This will prevent a person from, say, acquiring a project with an income stream only to absorb undeducted exploration expenditure. In all circumstances transfer must be made to the project with the most recent production licence and the oldest eligible expenditures must be taken up first. </PARA>
<PARA> To minimise the risk that project specific expenditure for unsuccessful or marginal projects would not be deducted, the amendments will provide for an order of deductions that will ensure project specific expenditures are written off first. The order of deductions for RRT liable projects will be non-transferable project expenditure, including general expenditure and pre-l July 1990 exploration expenditure, project specific exploration expenditure, closing down expenditure and other project transferable exploration expenditure. These important changes to the resource rent tax have an estimated cost to revenue of $305m in 1990-91 and $450m in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> A revenue positive outcome is expected in 1992-93 and in subsequent years. These changes come at a substantial cost to fiscal policy in the first two years of the operation of the new measures. The Government believes that this is a price worth paying for the greater efficiency and certainty which these taxation arrangements provide. It is important, therefore, that the elements of the resource rent taxation regime be held constant in future years when the new RRT arrangement starts to recoup revenues for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Put more bluntly, the producers will have secured a windfall benefit in these early years of the new arrangement and will not be entitled to a change of arrangements when the RRT starts to bite in subsequent years. I present the explanatory memorandum which contains a more detailed explanation of the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and, in so doing, thank my colleague the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) for his important involvement in the negotiation of these new arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Customs Amendment Bill proposes to amend the Customs Act 1901 to:</PARA>
<PARA>(i) implement certain reforms to the current anti-dumping subsidisation regime which were announced by the Government in the 12 March industry statement, and</PARA>
<PARA>(ii) effect technical drafting changes to the internal body search provisions of the Act to clarify the nature and function of judges' orders made under those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments to Part XVB of the Act, relating to the anti-dumping and subsidisation provisions, focus on three aspects of Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing system:</PARA>
<PARA>* clause 7 of the Bill proposes the inclusion of several new subsections modelled on the relevant sections of the United States Tariff Act of 1930, to expand the definition of an Australian industry, and thus effectively allow material injury suffered by vertically integrated agricultural industries as a result of the dumping or subsidisation of processed agricultural products to be taken into consideration when determining the material injury caused by the dumping of such processed products;</PARA>
<PARA>* clause 8 of the Bill proposes to simplify the determination of provisional dumping measures by providing for the calculation of a full dumping margin at the preliminary finding stage of a dumping or subsidisation inquiry; and</PARA>
<PARA>* clause 9 of the Bill proposes a modification to the provision in the Act relating to the three-year sunset period for dumping measures, to ensure that any such measures which may be in place for a particular product apply for three years, unless earlier revoked. </PARA>
<PARA> In making these changes, the Australian Government retains its commitment to promoting a fair and orderly international trading system under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Government will, as appropriate, review and if necessary amend Australia's legislative provisions and actions taken under the Act in the light of future developments in the international economic and trading arena, particularly in regard to our continuing obligations under the GATT and the GATT anti-dumping code. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal objective of the anti-dumping amendments in this Bill is to provide that, where agricultural producers who are vertically integrated with the processors to whom they sell their products suffer material injury as a result of dumping or subsidisation of processed products, the agricultural producers will be included as part of the relevant Australian industry and thus will be taken into consideration in cases involving those imported processed products. </PARA>
<PARA> The new provision in clause 7 of the Bill will apply to those involved in the production of crops, including viticulture, horticulture and apiculture, as well as the rearing of livestock, and the conduct of forestry and fishing operations. These changes recognise the vulnerability of vertically integrated agricultural producers, who are generally price takers in their markets, with the prices they receive dependent on the prices their buyers are able to command for their processed products. Agricultural producers can, therefore, be materially injured as a result of the impact of dumping or subsidisation on the processors to whom they sell their produce. </PARA>
<PARA> The new provision in relation to the definition of `industry' has been modelled on existing United States legislation which serves a similar purpose. It includes strict tests of vertical integration. For a primary producer to be considered part of a processed agricultural product industry, the raw agricultural goods of the primary producer must be devoted substantially or completely to the processed agricultural goods and the processed goods must be derived substantially or completely from the raw agricultural goods. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, vertical integration is subject to an economic test requiring either a close relationship between the movement in the prices of the raw agricultural goods and the processed goods, or that the raw agricultural goods constitute a significant proportion of the production cost of the processed agricultural goods. </PARA>
<PARA> The second objective of the anti-dumping amendments in this Bill relates to the three-year sunset provision on anti-dumping and countervailing measures. This was introduced into the Australian system in 1988 as a safeguard against the use of anti-dumping and countervailing measures as a means of long term industry protection. The Government continues to regard the sunset provision in section 269tm of the Act as a valuable aspect of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, however, new anti-dumping or countervailing measures imposed while a measure is in place against the same product from a different source may only be applied for as long as the existing measure on that product remains in place. The implications of this are that, where companies engaged in injurious dumping into Australia seek to avoid duties by relocating their operations, any new dumping measures imposed on the relocated source will terminate at the same time as the original measure-no matter how short a time the new measure has been in place. Given the time, effort and cost involved in pursuing action against dumping, the shortened life of such anti-dumping measures is a disincentive for Australian industry to seek action where companies dumping products move their source to avoid the penalties for dumping. Clause 9 of the Bill will therefore ensure that, except in the case of a successful request for revocation, all anti-dumping and countervailing measures will be applied for the full three years. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, with regard to the anti-dumping amendments in this Bill, clause 8 effectively provides that the Australian Customs Service will no longer calculate `non-injurious' free on board values for the purpose of setting provisional dumping measures. While that calculation, which attempts to set the price at which a product could be exported to Australia without causing injury to the Australian industry, will continue to be used at the final finding stage for the setting of dumping or countervailing duties, the elimination of it and use instead of the full margin of dumping or subsidisation at the preliminary finding stage will simplify the investigation process and will assist with the reduction in the time taken to process anti-dumping and countervailing cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments proposed by this Bill effect technical drafting changes to the new internal body search provisions of part XII of the Act, and relate in particular to the conferral of power on judges to make the detention and internal search orders which were part of the Customs (Detention and Search) Act 1990 which was assented to in October last year and commenced operation on 24 April this year. These amendments, contained in clauses 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the Bill, are explained in detail in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments in this Bill have no direct financial implications. I commend the Bill to the House and present the accompanying explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The national unemployment rate continues to climb. The official rate is 9.9 per cent. Everyone in this House knows that when the shibboleths of the Government are stripped away the reality is that there are in excess of one million Australians who are seeking full time work. It is indeed a catastrophe for those people and for their families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While we hear Ministers in the Government doing their best to defend an intolerable and impossible situation, the sorry facts are that today we are facing a recession which, in the words of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), we had to have. It is therefore very timely that we should be debating in this House, both yesterday and today, the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill 1991 together with cognate Bills dealing with the Job Search and Newstart arrangements. This package of arrangements was determined by the Government in its February 1990 economic statement. It was in response to-and I emphasise this fact-the view of the Opposition throughout the last Parliament that the Australian people expected nothing less than a far more active approach to the handling of the unemployment problem. I hasten to add this fact: after the last major recession facing the Australian people in the early 1980s, it took over six years to see the end of that large proportion of the population who lost their jobs. They found great difficulty in getting back to the work force over subsequent years. Nevertheless, the package before us today has the support of the Opposition in general terms. It is at least a step forward in the right direction, although one could question, in detailed terms, whether it goes far enough. </PARA>
<PARA> Leading economic forecaster, Phil Ruthven, has predicted that Australia's unemployment rate will reach 14 per cent to 15 per cent by 1993, if not before. If one looks at the 1982-83 recession one sees that it took at least six years for the unemployment rate to recover to pre-recessionary levels. We ask the Treasurer and the Government: how long will it take this time? As of February there were 28 unemployed people for every job vacancy. This was caused by a Treasurer and by a government which, as I said, gave us a recession which we had to have. According to the latest seasonally adjusted figures, there are almost 845,000 people unemployed in Australia. Of those, nearly 600,000 are receiving unemployment benefits, a 55 per cent increase on the annual average of the previous financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has failed to address adequately the fundamental changes occurring in the workplace internationally. In the last few years we have witnessed dynamic economic and political change across the world. As the ground has shifted between east and west, and new alliances and trading blocks have emerged, world markets have become increasingly unsettled and increasingly more competitive. The future for Australian industry is, at best, uncertain. The rules have changed. As we still try to comprehend the impact of the information and technological revolution, the future becomes much harder to predict. But as the world moves closer together, there is a general consensus that industries have to become leaner and more competitive. To cope with the technological and information revolution occurring across the world, Australia needs a flexible workplace. While there has been a recognition of the need to become internationally competitive, the Government's failure has been that it has not adequately addressed the challenges of the future over the last eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> With the Government's reliance on accord mark 6, despite the recommendations of the Industrial Relations Commission, and the strict regulatory approach to employment, Australia will continue to adjust poorly to the rapid changes in the international economy. There is no alternative except to take the approach of the Opposition parties. We must move much more rapidly towards a freer market situation where employees and employers can negotiate their own terms and conditions of employment. Unless that is done, unemployment will continue to grow. A small domestic economy such as Australia will never be able to afford to retrain everyone who loses a job. As I have said twice now, I wonder how many years we will have to wait before the unemployed of this current recession will once again find their way into the labour market and how many will never find their way into that market. </PARA>
<PARA> Increased international competitiveness means only one thing for this country-a huge overhaul. Top heavy with self-perpetuating bureaucracies, intransigent unions in the sectors that matter the most, and a gutless guiding hand of the present Government which is trying to keep its mates and selective interest groups happy at any cost is not preparing Australians for the necessary changes for a better future. If this Government wants to keep long term unemployment levels down, it must act as a facilitator for industry to move in the appropriate directions. It must encourage industry in developing regional economic links, not just ad hoc grants that do not even cover the cost of one regional meeting. We must be tangibly encouraging trade and professional organisations to establish networks throughout the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> Services form the largest sector of the Australian economy and now account for about three-quarters of gross domestic product and employment. However, at present there is not even an adequate statistical base on the export of services from which to develop and plan appropriate policies and strategies and it is the largest and fastest growing sector of the Australian economy. The Government also needs to gain a greater understanding of the rapid changes in technology, telecommunications and the economic nature of information and develop appropriate planning and policy responses. We failed to capitalise on the computer age. At this rate, we will also fail to capitalise on the information age. By failing to capitalise on the international growth areas, our long term unemployment queues will only lengthen. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the obstacles for development of our industries that have a natural or developed international comparative advantage must be removed. When we have to import coloured wool to knit a jumper, something is terribly wrong with the industrial base of this country. We must ensure that there are no impediments to the development of industries where value is added to our abundant natural resources through the development of higher stage processing.</PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia said that in developing successful clusters of internationally competitive industries we must tackle transport, construction and energy costs, and infrastructure provision. The coalition alone is seriously tackling these reform issues. We can no longer afford the cost of this Government's failure. If the Government continues to move at its present snail-like pace, we will be left behind in the competitiveness race and hundreds of thousands of hard working Australians will find themselves in a lengthening dole queue with no future prospects of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The first critical problem areas to surface are the unemployment rates for young people and people aged over 45. The proposed changes to unemployment policy which have been put forward in this legislation are done so in the context of substantial and rising rates of unemployment. The legislation has elements to protect the hardest hit age groups but, in many respects, the changes merely formalise existing practices. It is yet another bandaid approach by the Hawke Government. This is the so-called active employment strategy. As I said, it was the Opposition parties that previously urged the Government to go from a reactionary policy of income support to a pro-active policy of income support and job development. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet even today not enough training places are available. In many other countries training and education facilities are used virtually 365 days a year-morning, noon and night. By contrast, many of our facilities lie dormant for a large part of the year. The United States of America, for the last 30 years at least, has had a semester system ensuring some prospect of effective utilisation of resources for the four quarters of the year. Not only are more training and educational opportunities created but we give a future to our academic community, so many of whom today are leaving this country because they simply see no opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of expanding training and education opportunities must be tackled far more seriously by this Government and impediments removed. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless limitations are removed a further consequence is that there will be no opportunity for the private sector also to get into the fundamental role of better training for employees to ensure that they have the qualifications and the experience necessary for Australian industrial development. As the Government will never realistically be able to adequately train or retrain, at its cost, all the jobless resulting from the expected economic changes of the future, surely we need to consider selective work for the dole programs. Considering the horrendous levels of youth unemployment, more flexible training programs need to be assessed. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been my experience that youth work programs can be successful if they are established in areas with high unemployment, a supportive community, a strong local government structure and where suitable work is available. All options need to be considered when we are facing a continuing increase in the number of long term unemployed, especially unemployed youth. It is interesting to note that long term unemployment was defined as six weeks in 1974, whereas in 1987 the mean duration of unemployment was 64 weeks and the median duration was 31 weeks. I wonder what the figure is today. I think the evidence is clear: it is well in excess of even the median duration of 31 weeks or the 64 weeks mean duration that I cited. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Opposition's policy of providing benefits for the long term unemployed, we have proposed that a special benefit be made available to eligible people after nine months. I have heard on many occasions Ministers and members of the Government making fun of this policy and claiming that all we are proposing to do is to extend the period of unemployment benefits for an indefinite period while calling it by another name. This is not our intention.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said initially, the whole objective of our policy is to have a pro-active policy, not a reactive one. While the changes the Government is making are an improvement, its policy is still basically a reactive policy. Our view is that if people know that they are on unemployment benefits initially for a maximum period of nine months, the onus will be on them to do whatever is conceivably possible to ensure that they are available for work, if work is available, and that they utilise their opportunities to seek that employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence which came forward a number of years ago in the Cass inquiry into unemployment benefits emphasises a need for this type of policy approach. It is quite clear that when people lose their jobs, their initial reaction after the shock of that failure is to say, `I will go and get another job'. They work extremely hard for six weeks to three months to achieve that objective. However, at the end of nine months, morale is beginning to fail-if there is a continuous stream of failed efforts in their attempts to find adequate employment. That is the time at which we should be helping those people-at nine months; not at 12 months as is proposed in the legislation. Frankly, by 12 months, so many people have thrown in the towel; it has been too difficult. They have made a few efforts, but they have failed. </PARA>
<PARA> To simply say, as this legislation does, that those people will be required to present themselves every fortnight at the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) office to fill in a form to show that they have applied to at least two companies during that period, frankly, is rubbish. There is no adequate system in place by which the information on those forms can be tested. Nor is there any prospect, with over one million people now going through the process, that CES will have adequate resources to make that policy effective. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's doctoring of unemployment figures for the under-twenties has been exposed by unpublished official regional labour force statistics of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). These show that, over the last year, 110,700 full time teenage jobs have been lost in Australia, but total teenage unemployment has gone up by only 41,000. That means that almost 70,000 young people have disappeared from the statistics. The real unemployment rate among under-twenties looking for full time work in Australia is 36 per cent-the worst ever recorded-rather than the 25 per cent official figure cited by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst capital city figures for youth unemployment occur in Melbourne. Melbourne's horrific youth unemployment rate of 27.1 per cent has been massively understated and really stands at around 45 per cent. More than 33,000 young Melburnians are still looking for either full time or part time work. More than half of the 96,400 young people still with jobs have only been able to get part time work. The pressure on their families is massive. Is it any wonder that so many are now living on the streets?</PARA>
<PARA> The second worst capital city for youth unemployment in Australia is Hobart. The official youth unemployment rate of 31 per cent massively understates the real level of youth unemployment, which is about 42 per cent. According to these unpublished regional ABS labour force statistics, we can also adjust Adelaide's 26.2 per cent full time youth unemployment rate to around 35 per cent; Perth's 26.6 per cent, to 40 per cent; Brisbane's 24.6 per cent, to 33 per cent; and Sydney's 18.1 per cent, to 29 per cent. In all of these cases, with the exception of New South Wales, Labor governments are in power. The statistics sadly illustrate the failure of their administrations. </PARA>
<PARA> For the older unemployed, Department of Social Security (DSS) data shows that, while a smaller proportion of people become unemployed, those who do tend to stay on benefits far longer. The DSS statistics show that older people find it very difficult to re-enter the work force. We will be amending the proposal to relax reporting requirements for older unemployed workers, as the provisions proposed by the Government are discriminatory. It is not acceptable to imply that people over 55 years of age do not have to attempt to seek work and to remove their requirement to put in a form every two weeks, as does everybody else. It is precisely because of such attitudes that some employers fail to accept that people should be given work on the basis of ability, not on the basis of their age. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANZ Bank figures for April indicate that the number of job vacancies have dropped by 46 per cent since the same time last year and by 68 per cent since April 1989. The Skilled Vacancy Survey (SVS) released by the Department of Employment, Education and Training has revealed that for the three months to April 1991 the SVS index dropped by 58 per cent from the figure for the three months to April 1990. It also showed that the largest decreases in the index occurred in woodworking trades, 56 per cent; construction trades, 41 per cent; food and services trades, 34 per cent; and health occupations, 29 per cent. The total number of advertised vacancies in trade occupations for the three months to April 1991 dropped by a massive 68 per cent from the figure for the three month period to April 1990. I referred earlier to the Newstart activity agreement. We do not regard the Government's proposals in this area as adequate. We believe that no distinction should be made between beneficiaries purely on the basis of age. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to draw attention to the mythical growth in employment bandied about by the drowning rats in the present Government. For some time, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) have gloated about how their economic policies have resulted in the creation of 1.4 million new jobs since 1983. This figure is a fraud, and a complete distortion of reality. What the Government has neglected to add is that it has not allowed for the normal increases due to population growth, which have been calculated in an analysis of the ABS labour force survey. </PARA>
<PARA> The distortion is enormous. Nearly all of the 1.4 million figure was as a result of population growth, not economic policies. Certainly, it was not as a result of the policies of this Labor Government. The most alarming finding of this analysis was that the increase in the number of people in full time employment from March 1983 to March 1991 actually was less than the increase we should have seen through population growth alone. In fact, factors other than population-factors such as the economic policies of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer-have caused the expected increase in the number of people employed through population growth alone to drop by 45,300. You cannot get more rubbery than that. It is a sign of a government on its last legs that doctors such serious statistical evidence of the state of the economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, will address the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill. It is not really very easy to be putting forward such tough legislation in such tough times. Today's unemployment figures are, of course, unacceptably high to all of us. No-one, least of all those who are unemployed, can deny that the Government's top priority must be to get people back to work, and everyone is agreed on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The big difference between us in government and the coalition forces in government is that if unemployment is high-which has now occurred under both governments, and it is shameful-the coalition has little concern for the victims of unemployment. It has no programs. Indeed, the usual tactic of the Opposition when it is in government as a coalition is simply to transfer blame to the unemployed themselves, and then to dump them. We do not. We recognise our responsibility and, I repeat, the first responsibility is to get people into jobs and for those who are unemployed to have some decent programs. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is certainly tough, as I have said. Indeed, it is fair to say that it would be easier to introduce it in less tough times, as when it was first proposed. Nevertheless, it is part of a concerned and careful approach by government to the problem of how best to assist those who are out of a job. </PARA>
<PARA> For a start, we will not make the mistakes that were made in relation to those who became unemployed as a result of the previous recession in 1982. We must avoid the problems that were caused then. Those problems included the erosion of skills and the resultant increasing difficulties in finding suitable jobs. The expanding labour market from 1984 to 1990 which we created-the 1.6 million new jobs-nevertheless left the unskilled or deskilled workers behind, and they became the long term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) figures show that the percentage of people unemployed for over 12 months has fallen now from 31.2 per cent of unemployed people in July 1988 to 23 per cent in July 1990. That is since our labour market programs, like Newstart and Skillshare, got under way-the programs that the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) was just imagining he had proposed but that we actually put into place. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, other figures show that the average duration of unemployment in 1984-that is, after the 1982 recession-was 47.8 weeks. It went up to well over 12 months but by 1990-that is, after our labour market programs were in place-the average had fallen again to 46.7 weeks. Government policy with respect to reducing long term unemployment has had a positive effect, and the positive measures of assistance to long term unemployed people do work. This philosophy is continued with this Bill. Job Search will remove the risk of long term unemployment by giving newly unemployed people special Job Search assistance within the first three months of unemployment where it is most needed. Newstart will provide specialised and intensive assistance for those people who become unemployed for 12 months or longer, with a view to retraining those people, and income support will continue while this is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) said in his second reading speech, Newstart aims to integrate income support measures with labour market assistance training programs to assist the long term unemployed-that is, those unemployed for more than 12 months. Job Search, on the other hand, will help prevent long term unemployment wherever possible-in the words of the Minister, deal with problems before they become entrenched. With Job Search, the early intervention of the CES must help. Beneficiaries will be required to participate in labour market programs and/or vocational training programs with the aim of improving skills. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only in the last 10 years that long term unemployment has become a serious problem. The 1982-83 recession, we now know, created a large pool of long term unemployed who, if they are to re-enter the labour market, require retraining assistance. Newstart hopes to give such assistance by integrating income support measures with retraining assistance. Under the procedures outlined in this Bill, the CES will have a far greater role in assisting the long term unemployed than is the case now. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that the Government ensure that the CES has sufficient people to take on the extra load; if it does not, the active employment strategy will be ineffective. I repeat, it is absolutely essential that the CES has sufficient and well trained staff. I understand that the Minister is fully aware of the need to ensure that the CES is given sufficient resources to make the active employment strategy work. I urge him to continue to monitor this level of resources once the strategy is up and running. </PARA>
<PARA> Some Opposition members have spoken about bureaucratic nightmares and other alleged problems that the active employment strategy would cause. It has been asserted that Newstart will not work because of the workload on CES staff. The Opposition's answer is simply to reduce the length of time available to a person on Job Search allowance from the 12 months proposed in this Bill to nine months-and after nine months, what then? There is no plan to help. There is no program. The real distinction that we are making is not on age, it is on experience; it is on the amount of time a person has had to spend out of the work force; it recognises what happens to people when they have been out of the work force for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is full of concern for the unemployed whilst the Opposition is in opposition. In government, it quickly shifts the blame for unemployment back on to the individuals and makes them fend for themselves. Also, the Opposition's programs have been extremely sloppy when in government. For instance, it talks about being pro-active and about having labour market programs which, of course, we introduced. When in government it talked about dole bludgers and yet there was no work test to get the unemployment benefit; there was no requirement to register with the CES to get the unemployment benefit; there was no requirement for the individual to front up to the social security office-people could send their aunt, uncle or cousin. It was sloppy. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Opposition did not have the mentality to care for people who were the victims of unemployment. This Government recognises that in the overwhelming majority of cases the individual loses his or her job through no fault of his or her own-through the fault, probably, of a recession as now and as in 1982-1983 and, therefore, the Government has a responsibility to help those people find work. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to hear the Opposition quote the Cass report. It was under this Government that the Minister, then Minister for Social Security, set up the first review of the social security system for 40 years under Professor Cass. It was Professor Cass who found that what people most want to do is get back into work; and it was Professor Cass who forced this Government to look at the specific needs of specific groups in the population and the different needs of different unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> The CES does help people find work, but this Bill will build on that philosophy and give unemployed people intensive assistance to help them find a job. Retraining forms a major part of the strategy and, particularly with the recession we are now in, it becomes essential that the Government allocate additional resources to training programs. In fact, that is what has happened. The Minister outlined in his second reading speech that an additional $227m is to be provided for labour market programs until the end of 1993-94, giving over 50,000 additional program places each year. Also, an additional $105m for training was announced in the recent industry statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill should ensure that when the jobs are available again-and, I repeat, getting people back to work and building on the 1.6 million jobs created since 1983 must be the top priority-unemployed people will not be left behind as they were before. They will be able to have access to skills training programs which will assist them to re-enter the work force, not leave them to languish without help as the Opposition would have them do and as the Opposition always does. </PARA>
<PARA> A crucial part of this is the Newstart activity agreement proposal. Concerns have been expressed about these activity agreements by, amongst others, the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) and the Welfare Rights Centre. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention some of these concerns because they are very important. First, there are too few training places. I have already mentioned the large boost in places, but the Government must continue to monitor these and, if necessary, provide more. The active employment strategy demands that sufficient places be provided so as to ensure that when employment does pick up, when jobs are available again, everyone benefits and that the long term unemployed are not left behind. </PARA>
<PARA> ACOSS has also mentioned the problem of CES staffing, and it is spot-on. I repeat-and I will say it as often as I can-that we must ensure that the CES has staff to carry out this program as it wants to carry it out. The determination, the will and the understanding is there in the CES staff on whom we rely and on whom we have relied in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> A third concern that has been mentioned is the nature of the agreements themselves. These will be negotiated on an individual basis with each client receiving a separate agreement tailored to specific needs. ACOSS has expressed concern about the compulsory nature of these agreements and about the fact that the client is in a disadvantaged position; that is, it is feared that some clients may be told, `Sign this agreement or you will get no income support'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also true, as ACOSS points out, that about 25 per cent of the long term unemployed who get to 12 months unemployment will probably have some sort of learning difficulty, so extra care is needed with these people. ACOSS also mentions the notification period, the need for a cooling off period and that there is a need to ensure that the agreement negotiation process is genuine and not harsh. I said before, it is tough legislation. We must ensure that in its implementation it is totally fair. Of course, compulsion already existed in the old unemployment benefits system with the work test. As I said, we introduced the work test. The Opposition did not care at all. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard the guidelines being drawn up to guide CES officers in such negotiations are crucial. I urge the Minister to ensure that groups such as ACOSS are fully consulted and involved in this process. I urge, too, that CES officers are consulted and are part of getting this process together as a fair process. One of the major concerns of ACOSS was the lack of appeal rights. I am very glad that the lack of appeal rights in the original Bill has been overcome and that the Government amendments have resolved that. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the philosophy of the active employment strategy should be supported, but the concerns expressed by groups like ACOSS should and must be addressed if the strategy is to work. This program confronts attitudes on all sides. It confronts the long held attitudes of the employers and of some of the unemployed. Those attitudes will change. It may well be 18 months before any really good results come from this new strategy. Some people are simply not work ready after long periods of unemployment. Unfortunately, employers have shown that they are wary of the long term unemployed; they are far more likely to put them on last. That is their attitude. They will have to change that attitude. They will have to understand that the long term unemployed are being made work ready by these programs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that employers-and all of us-understand the new strategy. This is the biggest change to deliver help to the unemployed since the 1940s. Every one of us has to understand the impact of these changes. It has been suggested to me perhaps there should be active employment strategy briefings for all backbenchers in their electorates. Certainly the public must be made more aware of the changes than they are now so that unemployed people fronting up to a CES office will understand exactly what responsibilities they have and what responsibilities the CES has to them. So I hope there will be a lot of publicity for this program. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude as I began. It is a terrible thing for a government to have to confront the fact that unemployment figures are so high. There is no more important priority for us than to get the unemployed back to work. I repeat that the big difference between us and the coalition is that in Government we still care about those who are unemployed. This Bill brings in measures to assist them better than they have been assisted in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The very last words of the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) were of interest to me. The honourable member said, `We still care'. Honourable members opposite should care-they put the unemployed there; no-one else. They have created the disaster which has been brought to our attention today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in its labour force figures for April 1991 when it tells us that unemployment has now almost reached 10 per cent-this double digit figure that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was so scurrilous about when he reported those circumstances that occurred as a result of the national drought in 1982-83. This Government has no excuse such as a drought, although that might be impending. If it is, one might wonder what figures we will be debating in this place in another few months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do know that the price drought is upon the rural industries. I do not believe the effects of that price drought have yet totally affected the metropolitan areas which are the principal beneficiaries of the money that is earned and produced in country electorates such as my own. </PARA>
<PARA> We are debating the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill relating to changes in the unemployment arrangements. Of course, they carry some good names-Job Search and Newstart-but basically they are still unemployment benefits proposals. I am reminded of one of the Government's other efforts in this area. I wonder how many people remember Priority One, the disaster which nevertheless allowed the Government to spend taxpayers' money on advertisements such as the one I am holding? This evening government members will bring to this place the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill. That is part of their $250m to $260m program of spending the taxpayers' money to advertise dud programs. </PARA>
<PARA> One might wonder what they have already prepared of this nature which they will bring in to tell people what a wonderful thing they are doing for the unemployed with these new things which will waste more of the taxpayers' money. No, they do not want anybody to be able to advertise on television-they want to know where every penny comes from. I believe they are correct in that. But I wonder what will be in their new disclosures legislation about this sort of caper?</PARA>
<PARA> Priority One had a full two page, $30,000 advertisement advertising something but not saying one word about it-not one word. There were pictures of kids and pictures of the Prime Minister, but not one piece of information as to how the program might work. One might wonder whether this will happen with the next lot. </PARA>
<PARA> One might wonder how truthful and decent this Government is when it sets about addressing party funding, which is what we will be talking about when we talk of disclosures and putting limits on this Government and governments of the future as to how they use or abuse taxpayers' funds in announcing their projects. We will see how dinkum the Government is in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that this legislation was announced by the Government during the election campaign at a time of substantially more economic buoyancy. It was announced as a reaction to the proposals announced in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan. Members of the Government panicked. The community at that stage-in a time, as I said, of somewhat better economic circumstances-had had enough of seeing people advertising thousands of jobs and nobody applying for them, yet there was a very substantial hard core of unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting how the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) finds himself so frequently in conflict with his own party these days. He is a great electoral strategist. He has a wonderful Labor electorate-lots of hardworking miners, lots of hardworking pastoral workers and, even a substantial degree, I would imagine, of public servants-all in remote areas. They are people who call a spade a spade. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kalgoorlie over time has woken up to some of their attitudes to the unemployed. These are hardworking, good Labor voters, and they were fed up, just as they were fed up with most of the other things that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie seems to be putting on the agenda all the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I make this point because the facts were that the Government made these decisions because it discovered huge support for what the Opposition was talking about at that time, and that was to discontinue unemployment benefit-dole payments, as we have known them to date-after nine months and require people to demonstrate that they genuinely needed assistance if they were to continue receiving government assistance: to make it harder, to make sure that people had genuinely tried. </PARA>
<PARA> That is basically what these two proposals are about. The first stage has been extended to 12 months and the second, of course, to as long as is necessary, but with conditions; and the conditions relate primarily to a person seeking training and making some genuine effort to become useable in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, day after day in this place the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) get up and say, `Your policy'-which they have copied and which we are dealing with today-`cuts off the dole at nine months and leaves people on the scrap heap'. What an outrageous statement! It is part of the good old Australian Labor Party's Goebbels technique-tell an untruth often enough and people will begin to believe it. It was never our policy. It was quite clear and, as I recollect, the annual allowance for the special benefits we proposed was of the order of $800m a year-quite a significant sum. Yet they stand up here, as they have in the last week or 10 days, trying to create a myth that in fact unemployed people were going to completely lose support under our proposals. It is not true; it never was true. It is clear to be seen in black and white. It is supported by the Government's copy cat action here today. Those opposite believed they had to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another difference: the Opposition chose to do it for proper reasons; the Government chose to do it because its pollsters told it that it had better get on the band wagon. This is the Government of pollsters; this is not the Government of well programmed decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is worth while to look at the massive unemployment situation that is confronting Australia today. There have been generally very buoyant world economic conditions throughout the life of the Hawke Labor Government. This Government has not had the recessions of international standing that occurred during the Fraser Government. It has not had the oil shock, with its massive effects on international inflation. And for all the words that we get around here about inflation under the Fraser Government, nobody ever again wants to make that international comparison which showed Australia's inflation rate in quite a good light; we just get these broad statements. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day the Prime Minister was going crook because, he said, someone had selectively quoted from a document. Let us get down to selective quoting. The Treasurer, in eight years, has mentioned the 1982-83 drought once, and that was when he pointed out that Gittins had used that year as a tax base-and, of course, it was very low because farmers had no income. We are just finding out again the economic effects of farmers having no income. That is coming on the tail of what the Government did to the employed people of Australia through its economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the economic policy of high interest rates that did it. In fact, that was just another reactionary move of this Government. The real reason that we have the circumstances we have today is that the Treasurer misread the economy in his first Budget, when he came in, as some might remember, with his inherited deficits theory. That is the same argument as someone going along to his bank and saying, `I have gone bankrupt over that business I bought two years ago, but it is all the fault of the previous owner'. Once one is given control of the shop, it is one's job to get the figures right. As we know today, of that $8 billion of Budget deficit, $7.6 billion was new spending initiatives, and they were there deliberately. Going back to the old Hayden economic theory, his responses to just about every Fraser Budget was to attack it for having insufficient deficit. Of course, the Treasurer, having got his lectures from Jack Lang and Rex Connor, came to his office with a high deficit theory and Keynesian economic solutions to the then recession, which, he continues to tell us, was caused by bad economic management, when in fact it was caused by the worst drought in recent history.</PARA>
<PARA> When he fired up the Australian economy with $8 billion in the first year and a total of $26 billion in the first four years, he overlooked the naturally occurring recovery substantially caused by rain and the excellent practices of the Fraser Government which financed farmers during that drought to keep their breeding stock on hand so that there was a very speedy recovery in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> When he put all that extra money in, it was more than the economy needed. But he did not stop there. For quite proper reasons, he decided to float the Australian economy, but he never ran around to see what people were going to do about that. Today we are actually imposing a training levy on people. It would not have been a bad idea if we had given a bit of training to our entrepreneurs as to how to handle their first taste of freedom. They literally went mad with money. I heard an instance the other day of one of those entrepreneurs who made a major take-over offer. He rang the manager of his bank in the same building and said, `I could need $800m this afternoon', and that afternoon he got the cheque. He got the cheque for $800m!</PARA>

<PARA> Let me just get back. Having overheated the economy with borrowed money-borrowed by government and by the private sector-at the very point when we had a cyclical commodities peak, the Treasurer decided to put the fire hose on, with high interest rates. The end result was that as the economy started to slow up he drove it into recession with a fire hose. The evidence is here before us today in the figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics: the April 1991 seasonally adjusted estimate of unemployed persons rose by 66,900 to 844,000. It is the largest monthly rise recorded by the survey. </PARA>
<PARA> A little while ago the Treasurer was in here trying to turn that into good news; I honestly wish it was good. But there are some aspects of the legislation that also concern me. In a simple sense, I do not think people over 55 wish to be treated differently from other people. Whether all people should report at two weeks or none should report at two weeks is one issue, but it is outrageous to suggest that a person who is 55, and therefore unlikely to get a job, will be told not to bother calling around. It is age discrimination and it should not be in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people want to be perceived as trying as hard as anyone else. I do not think we should be sending them messages that there is no hope. Quietly, there is hope for them. Notwithstanding the dreadful economic circumstances and the very genuine circumstances of many people who literally cannot find work, I hope we have all learnt that by making the situation too easy we do not give people the incentive to get back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make another point. I think it is the most important point of all; I paid a lot of attention to it when I introduced the policy of the Opposition on employment and training before the last election. The point is that, wherever possible, we should not pay people to do nothing. It is not in their interests and it is not in anyone's interests. It is certainly very bad for people. </PARA>
<PARA> I have experienced four months in hospital. I lost incentive; I lost the desire to do anything. It is amazing how quickly the days passed. It astounded me how quickly I lost interest in wanting to do something. For that very reason alone, we should be creating circumstances where people who are unemployed are encouraged to do something. We have talked about community work, and that can be in all sorts of areas. People laugh when I ask, `What is wrong with some of the unemployed having to visit people in nursing homes?'. I make the point that some of the young may learn from the elderly. I receive letters from people asking, `Could you send us young people with a little responsibility who will stand in our swimming pools with our elderly when they go for their water treatment so that our qualified nurses can get on with looking after those in need of qualified treatment?'. Currently, they have to put their bathers on to stand in a pool. There are things like that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the opportunity for on-the job-training as a replacement for the dole. I do not want to talk about exploitation, but I believe agreements could be entered into with employers who say that at least for the time being they will not reduce their work force but will take one, two, six or 10 unemployed people to be taught and to gain job experience. The first part of work experience is learning to turn up on time and to knock off on time. They will get no more than the dole for that. I think it would be an ideal process if the employer held the dole cheque and handed it over. I think this would get a mass of people back into the employment sector. They would be trained and on the spot when the next job opportunity occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> By that process, we would get rid of the phantoms. Nobody wants to say they do not exist; I know they exist because I meet them. I knock around in a few industries where there are plenty of them. Anywhere there is cash there are phantoms. They are not the highest percentage, but they exist. All these processes would make that harder. We should consider those things not because we want to punish the unemployed but because we want to give them opportunities to get back into the work force. It is very important we do those things. It is unfortunate that this program does not appear to allow for that simple solution to the problem. It does not make enough use of private employment agents. We have to have ever increasing government bureaucracy when, as a employer, I know that, when I want someone, I go to a private agency because I know I will get somebody quickly and get someone who genuinely wants a job. All those things count, and why not?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill represents a further development of the Government's strategy to combine income support to the huge army of unemployed with training and labour market assistance. In the process, it makes the receipt of income assistance subject to even more rigorous eligibility criteria. For example, Job Search allowance is payable for 12 months only and then is dependent upon the jobless person satisfying an activities test. In plain English, this means that unemployed people must be looking for work, be willing to work and, if requested, undertake an approved training course or involve themselves in a labour market program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, after 12 months it will be necessary for an unemployed person to enter into a Newstart activity agreement in order to be eligible for further payment of the Newstart allowance. These agreements stringently require the recipient to search for that elusive job, to accept training or retraining, paid work experience, and education, if necessary, to remove any perceived labour market disadvantage such as, say, total illiteracy, poor reading and writing skills or poor English language skills. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the current high-and in my view totally unacceptable-levels of unemployment, there is obviously scope for several important amendments to this legislation. New section 521 allows males of 55 to 64 1/2 years and females of 55 to 59 1/2 years to continue to receive Job Search beyond 12 months if they are considered unlikely to get a job. These age thresholds should be lowered, in my view, to 50 and 45 respectively. I have a totally different viewpoint to that put by the previous speaker, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). </PARA>
<PARA> What is the point of pursuing the rigid eligibility requirements of Job Search and Newstart for people of late middle age when at the same time the Opposition tells us that over one million people are looking for jobs and are unable to find them? Similarly, why persecute poor families by enforcing a 13-week waiting period for assistance upon education leavers when they cannot find a job or if they are turned away from a university or technical college? In this context, the waiting period is seen by many as almost vindictive in its treatment of young Australians. This waiting period should be reduced at least until the recession eases. </PARA>
<PARA> It cannot be denied that the underlying strategy of income assistance being linked with training and tougher compliance measures was designed for completely different labour market conditions from those which now exist in this country. To make it brutally clear, what we are proposing is not a strategy for the here and now; it was devised in early 1990 when different economic conditions prevailed. At best, it is now a strategy for the future. It may help to produce better trained people for future jobs, but it is not a strategy for the current economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We face an extremely serious policy induced recession and very depressed conditions in the national labour market. There is not one person in this Government who would deny that. Already, unfortunately, in some of the national media, this legislation is being seen as an attack on the victims of government policy. That is not meant to be so but, unfortunately, that is the way it is being seen. </PARA>
<PARA> The April 1991 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey, released today, indicates that 844,000 people, or 9.9 per cent of the labour force, are now unemployed. This is 320,000 more than a year ago, when the participation rate was virtually the same as it is now. The Budget forecast was for an unemployment rate of 7.25 per cent by June 1991. In my Budget debate speech I said that this estimate was too sanguine and that, as a result of high interest rates and an overvalued Australian dollar, unemployment could rise to over 8.5 per cent. I find it personally quite depressing and distressing to be proven more than correct. </PARA>
<PARA> I must ask myself this question: how could the Government's advisers and senior bureaucrats, especially in the Treasury, get it all so tragically wrong? There is evidence that the figures of the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) are higher than the sampling estimates produced by the ABS. I understand that the CES figures of people registered as unemployed or looking for work may now exceed one million Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I also understand that in my area in the Illawarra region, which includes the Wollongong-Port Kembla industrial complex, which I represent in this Parliament, approximately 24,000 people are seeking employment. That is in the region between Nowra on the south coast and just north of Corrimal on the near south coast. I am told that 7,000 people have registered in the last six months. Furthermore, over 6,600 of these 24,000 are under 24 years of age and approximately 3,200 are under the age of 19. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say to this House that I am dismayed by this waste of talent and ability, by the human despair and loss of self-esteem that are involved and by the lost opportunities for business and for the individual that these statistics represent. I have to complain about the sheer waste of it all. </PARA>
<PARA> While this Bill is important, given that it presents a strengthening of the commitment to labour market training, it is really not much use training people for non-existent jobs. It is an absence of jobs, not an absence of labour market programs, nor reluctance on the part of the unemployed to participate in those programs, that is causing massive unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it now becomes more important to consider ways and means to alleviate the recession itself, to implement strategies to encourage domestic savings and increase investment in export and import replacement industries. The measures announced in the 12 March industry statement were most welcome and comprehensive, but in my strong view they did not go far enough. In short, what is to be done now? The Opposition, dominated by hard line Tory values, is of no assistance whatsoever. With its proposed $3 billion-plus of cuts on social justice program outlays it would further deflate and screw down the domestic economy. It would overturn the only positive outcome of the recession-that is, lower inflation-by imposing a hefty tax on goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear to me that this recession is much deeper and more enduring than most economists, and indeed the Cabinet, anticipated. It is true that as a result of tight monetary policy and high interest rates, imports are down, slumping some 10 per cent in March and resulting in a $642m trade surplus for that month. The current account deficit has improved-24 per cent down on the figure for the same nine-month period of last financial year. When we get the consumer price index (CPI) figures for the March quarter next week, they will show a much improved performance on inflation-and that is good-of, say, 0.4 per cent for the quarter. But, welcome as they are, these gains are the results of a recession. They are the results of excessive unemployment. They are not a harbinger of a brave new trade world, nor are they an indication of an early economic recovery. Maybe they portent the reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> Three months ago, perhaps the expected impact of the January tax cuts and the six successive reductions in official rates were seen-certainly by me-as sufficient to get the recovery effectively under way in the September and December quarters. But what appeared eminently feasible in February now seems to have receded in May. In my view, the concern in February that an early, strong and sustained recovery, followed by a resurfacing of an inbuilt structural deficiency in the current account, would result in a secondary surge in imports, and then a 1992 upward trend in interest rates, is now completely dated. The more pressing danger is an extended recession and continued hardship in the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is now time for some moderate stimulation of the domestic economy. The need is for moderate economic expansion, coupled with several measures to encourage savings, investment and further exports-that is, measures additional to those announced on 12 March. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill and the measures in it are all right as far as they go, but we need to do something about the root cause of unemployment. I strongly reject the argument that fiscal policy has already been significantly loosened just because the expected Budget surplus of $8.1 billion has declined to approximately $1 billion. The decline is recession induced. We have seen unemployment benefits payments and reduced tax revenues. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a perversion of economic logic to screw down the domestic economy with high real interest rates and then say that the resulting lower surplus represents a looser fiscal policy. Those who subscribe to this view would probably advocate an even tougher crackdown on the unemployed-the human fallout of the economic downturn. That is exactly what the Opposition wants to do. It wants to further deflate the economy with $3,000m worth of social welfare cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> Official interest rates need to come down by at least one per cent over the next two months. An immediate reduction of 0.5 per cent is now justified. I hope the Reserve Bank does it tomorrow. If it does not do it tomorrow, it ought to do it next week. If it does not do it early next week, it should do after the consumer price index figures come out next Wednesday. The March quarter CPI figures will be good. Real housing and business rates are still historically very high, even given the actions to reduce rates already taken. Real variable housing rates are now about 9 per cent. Even more relevant, the differential between international and Australian rates allow scope for a fall. For example, domestic rates on 90-day bills are now 11.15 per cent. The Euro official rate in US dollars is now 5.9 per cent, a differential of 5.25 per cent. As well, United States discount rates are down 0.5 per cent in the last few days. </PARA>
<PARA> These significant differentials are the prime reasons why the Australian dollar is currently trading so high to the detriment of our international trading sector. The Australian dollar should and must fall, ideally to around US71c and US72c and several points on the trade weighted index. Given the deep recession, such a lowering of interest rates and the Australian dollar will not impact very greatly on inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that exports of manufacturing goods have increased, but I believe that there are grounds for caution here. There has been a recent and severe decline in business investments, down by 9 per cent in the year to December last. For example, of the $24 billion of foreign investment in Australia during 1989-90, $14.4 billion was in property and tourism and only $3.1 billion was in manufacturing industry. Further, economic analysts Syntec forecast a 33 per cent fall in business spending over the last two quarters of 1991, compared with the same period in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> My point tonight is not to propagate despair but to push the case for further measures to encourage domestic savings, investment, value added exports and employment to combat unemployment, which is what this debate is all about. The export facilitation scheme which offers credits against import tariffs for value added to the final export product-which has already been implemented in the motor vehicle industry and is to be implemented in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries-should be expanded to cover a much wider range of elaborately transformed products. Why not? Australia has already reduced protection-an action which I support-by a greater margin than any other trading nation. Given their own track records, I cannot take seriously any alleged hidden subsidy-type objections from members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, including the European Community nations, the United States of America, and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the recent negative Industrial Relations Commission decision on the additional 3 per cent employer contribution to industry superannuation, as proposed in accord mark 6, the superannuation investment portfolios will continue to expand. The Government should consider legislation to require a small percentage of these funds to be invested in certain broadly defined business and industry areas. This does not involve `picking winners' on a company or project basis. It means that government and superannuation funds should not resile from their responsibility to ensure that a moderate proportion of this investment arising from industry and award based superannuation should be steered towards the industries which must provide future exports, efficient and competitive import replacement and, above all, jobs and growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the United Kingdom initiative of tax exempt special savings accounts should be considered by this Government. This scheme offers tax relief to small savers through tax exemptions for accrued interest on limited investments for a fixed period; for example, investments to #9,000 sterling for five years without the withdrawal of capital. Another option would be to tax only the real interest over the period of the investments. We need to encourage domestic savings and the small savers of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's current recession is home-grown, brought on by the Government's perceived need to restrain imports and inflation by tight monetary policy and very high real interest rates. At this time, as we strive to emerge from a recession against the background of having achieved success on current account deficit and inflation, our efforts are being undermined by the international economic downturn, particularly in the United States where economic growth was down 0.7 per cent in the March quarter. This means that there is a double imperative to take further action at this time. There is also great concern about the aging of vital public infrastructure, and to renew it will create jobs. Constraints imposed on the provision of vital new infrastructure should be eased at the next Premiers Conference. Certainly, it is necessary to closely monitor and control the public sector borrowing requirement, but this need has to be balanced against the burden imposed on industry by aging and inadequate infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> Improved interface between road and rail transport into ports is a prime requirement. For example, borrowing constraints have prevented the completion of the $120m Maldon-Dombarton rail project to the coal and grain handling facilities at Port Kembla in New South Wales. This project was brought to a grinding standstill by the New South Wales Greiner Government. Even after that Government had spent approximately $40m on the project, it brought it to a stop as the recession was getting under way. That project could obviously have provided employment to some of the 24,000 people on the south coast I spoke about earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the world trend will be for a developing capital shortage resulting in long term upward pressure on interest rates, right now the opportunities to shoot for improved growth and investment are available to us. The Government should act on these opportunities. Lower interest rates, a lower Australian dollar, plus moderate and selected stimulative measures must be implemented, together with initiatives to encourage savings and investment. It is really only against such a moderate expansionist policy background that the Job Search and Newstart measures in this legislation make any economic and social sense at all. </PARA>

A number of speakers today have spoken about unemployment, the nature of unemployment and why currently the situation is as it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all have our own hobby horses and pursue them and whatever economic policy we happen to follow, but central to this debate is the whole notion of the unemployed, the way in which they should be treated, the kind of value they should have in the community and the kind of dignity with which they should be addressed. Indeed, the whole philosophical basis on which the unemployment benefit was first introduced, and the way in which we go about things, was brought home to me last week when I happened to be in Barcaldine for part of the Australian Labor Party's historic 100th year celebrations, celebrating with a group of women. </PARA>
<PARA> The kinds of changes which have emerged in our society and the reason for workers seeking parliamentary representation, in many ways, have not changed. It is for those of us in the Labor Party and in this Labor Government to voice the needs of the kind of people we represent. We are here to speak for the powerless, the voiceless and the most disadvantaged in our community. Certainly those who are currently unemployed fit into that category, unfortunately. </PARA>
<PARA> Job Search and the Newstart activity agreement attempt to look realistically at the problem and address the major problem in a new and different way. Indeed, the introduction of the Newstart allowance for the long term unemployed will enable us to meet this problem in the specialised way that is needed. I think none of us would argue about the fact that we have a dramatically changing world and a society which is changing, and that the needs and demands of the work force are dramatically changing. </PARA>
<PARA> Many honourable members in this place have heard me relate the story of Queenslanders. Most Queenslanders over the age of 42 years have not have secondary schooling. That is partly because the school system was structured in such a way that they went to school to year 8 and did a scholarship. If they did not pass that scholarship, they did not go on to high school. I know people show an enormous amount of disbelief about that, but if they were to go to any social gatherings or discussions anywhere in Queensland-certainly in rural Queensland-they would find that to be a fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Such people were in the work force for a very long time and now find themselves in the situation whereby the kind of skills which were once used in the work force and the marketplace have changed dramatically. I instance one small example within my own electorate. The Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd steel plant there employed over 480 people. It was automated and now employs 26 people working in two shifts, and produces enough steel to export to Asia. The 26 people who currently work there are very highly skilled technicians and computer people, and there are a number of out-posted industries which supply the kind of equipment needed for that business. </PARA>
<PARA> However, that is a very real indication of the changing nature of the work force, the kinds of skills needed and the kinds of demands made on us as a community as a whole to ensure that people who previously have not had the opportunity to be educated, develop skills or pursue any kind of skill-based training, be given that opportunity. We find realistically that few of the many people who are currently unemployed say that they lack the necessary skills and education-13.4 per cent in July 1990 said that they lacked the necessary skills or education to pursue any kind of work. Five per cent have insufficient English skills to be able to pursue any other work once they find themselves unemployed. Given the number of people that I see in my office and the needs they have, I think that figure is somewhat low. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the dinner break, I was speaking about unemployment and the nature of unemployment, and the Government's response to that through the new programs of Job Search and Newstart. What we all need to remember is in fact the nature of people who are unemployed and the kinds of requirements that they have and the kinds of processes which have moved us towards this particular step. Unemployment benefits were first introduced in a very different kind of market in post-war Australia, and long term unemployment at the time was largely unknown. This was for a whole variety of reasons-the nature of the work force, the way in which society operated and the fact that over 50 per cent of the population, once they married, were unable to participate in the paid work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Society has changed dramatically and with it the kinds of demands made upon it. So, experience has shown that the key to tackling successfully the problems of the longer term unemployed lies in the integration of income support and other forms of assistance. What we see in this program is the Government's response to those kinds of needs. Indeed, between February 1989 and December 1990, 134,000 people in the Newstart group have left unemployment benefits. That is a dramatic saving to taxpayers. Indeed, it has been assessed that approximately $12,000 to $18,000 per year is saved, because not only do we save on the payment of unemployment benefits but also a gain is made in terms of the tax paid by people who have moved into the paid work force. Trials have revealed that this was a process which could also assist people to participate and improve a whole range of employment prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of unemployed in the long term fell from about 38 per cent in February 1989 to 25 per cent in November 1990, so such programs have made quite a dramatic impact on the nature of long term unemployed people. From the figures released today, which I think we would all decry and certainly wish to see lower, one of the things that has been quite remarkable is a rise in the participation rate. So, we have 0.5 per cent more people moving into the work force at one end, quite an extraordinary situation. Therefore, the Government has responded to the kinds of demands made by the community at large and to the kinds of things which we know will work, as have been experienced through the earlier Newstart program. With the creation of Job Search and Newstart, we have a very different kind of arrangement. Thus, assistance and requirements will be tailored far more closely to individual needs and capacities. </PARA>
<PARA> At this juncture I might say that many very able CES officers in particular have been doing this for quite some time. Near my own electorate office at Woodridge, unfortunately we have a very large Department of Social Security and CES office. We see quite a lot of clients. The Department has responded to training programs, the provision of training programs, and to using the local TAFE college, which, I might add, is a new initiative of the Labor Government-we did not have one prior to its construction-where 7,000 people are assisted to have an opportunity for tertiary education who did not have that opportunity three years ago. All those things together make an important inroad to the kinds of training opportunities which people have and need. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I mentioned the quite dramatic needs in Queensland in terms of the nature of people, the level of people's education, the fact that many people over the age of 42 have no secondary schooling whatsoever because of the nature of the education system that existed, the fact that they have always had very low tertiary places and in fact a very small TAFE sector. We are seeing an expansion of that. That will assist in helping people to develop skills, training and to obtain certificates, diplomas and degrees providing them with a realistic chance in a 1991 job market. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Newstart program enables people to look at themselves and to recognise realistically their own talents for employability. I am chair of the management committee of a job care project funded under the job club program and we deal exclusively with women. I might say that many of these women are well into their forties, some are in their fifties and sixties, so I find it interesting that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) claimed that people over 55 years of age are being discriminated against. Certainly within the process of Newstart their needs will be assessed differently, as they are currently. We find at the job club that many of these women have talents and skills which they have not recognised themselves and have been unable to sell on the open job market. </PARA>
<PARA> What is interesting is that, despite the rise in unemployment and the recession and economic circumstances, we are still able through that job club to find work for people. The number of people who successfully complete our courses, address the issue and acknowledge the kinds of skills that they have and what they have to market and so are able to move into full time paid employment, is continuing to rise. </PARA>
<PARA> We must appreciate that, for very many women, particularly in their late forties and early fifties, this is actually their very first opportunity to be in the paid work force. Their needs are quite dramatically different. Often they have child-care needs or family needs. As well, they have very special transport needs as we are also located in one of the fastest growing cities in Australia-Logan City-with a population of 130,000 which has no public transport at all. That creates a very real problem and a great difficulty for people. I am interested to see figures which suggested earlier that one of the problems that people have is transport. In fact, 5 per cent of people who are unemployed have such difficulties. The urban and regional planning groups, which are addressing this issue, recognise that, as people move further from the centre of a city, not only are the infrastructures unavailable but transport becomes a very real problem. Whilst they may have saved money on a house, they need to spend money on a car. Often they find that difficult when their job is not near where they live and they need to be able to travel. So, public transport becomes a very key point in this argument. </PARA>
<PARA> We are hoping that through the activity agreements those kinds of issues will be realistically addressed and perhaps some ways in which people can tackle the transport problem may be raised. Indeed, we also acknowledge that there should be no misunderstanding about the activity agreement: it will be a requirement for payment. If people are not prepared to enter into and abide by an agreement, they will not be paid the Newstart allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, my own experience is, contrary to that of the honourable member for O'Connor, that almost all people, with very rare exceptions, are very anxious to return and participate in the work force, and to find themselves able to purchase goods, to have friends and to maintain a social life which comes from being in the paid work force. So, people will be anxious to enter into an agreement because they see this as a very real opportunity for them to be able to acquire skills to better place them for the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> Other important issues which are raised by the active employment strategy-and some of these concerns have been raised by a number of groups within the community-relate to the nature of the way in which it will be delivered. As I have said, my personal experience has been that the sensitivity very often shown by officers in dealing with unemployed people will be heightened because, of course, the agreement will need to be tailored for people, guidelines will be set up and the arrangements will require careful implementation by the CES. To this end, guidelines are being drawn up and will be developed in consultation with the Australian Council of Social Service. They have to be approved by the Minister. They will contain provisions of natural justice for clients and important review rights for clients. So the kinds of processes and requirements which we have for other clients dealing with government departments will also be here. </PARA>
<PARA> The important issue in the whole question of the Newstart and Job Search allowances is that the system will be tailored to meet individual needs and that there will be an acknowledgment of the very special qualities which people have and the very special needs which some of our unemployed people have. I instance the issue of literacy, which is very close to my heart and which I have dealt with. I have been on the literacy committee and have been horrified to learn that close to one million Australians are unable to read and write in English. Literacy has become a very major issue in the workplace in terms of award restructuring and what is happening there. It is also a major barrier to people trying to enter the work force. That kind of issue will be realistically addressed, and I know that it will be responded to in a sensitive and careful manner. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have people whose limited schooling, whose educational skills, whose ability to communicate with people, and whose ability to pursue their efforts in the marketplace are such that over a time they are really lost. The special treatment which they will get through the activity agreement will provide a very real opportunity for them to look at themselves and to look at the job market and see where they may fit. I know that we have heard people here tonight talking about jobs and the need for jobs, which we would all acknowledge, but it is also interesting to note that there are quite a number of companies that are expanding quite dramatically. So unemployment in many areas is very patchy. There are areas with skill shortages. A realistic assessment of what the labour market holds and offers for people may help them to re-enter the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important issue, which has been raised by the honourable member for O'Connor, was government bureaucracy. The honourable member for O'Connor holds the belief that governments should not do any of this and that private providers should provide work experience for people for nothing. This seems quite extraordinary. We would send a number of unemployed people along to a company, where they would work for nothing, and we, the taxpayers, would continue to pay unemployment benefits. The employer, of course, would gain profit from such people; at the end of the day, we, the taxpayers, would continue to pay an unemployment benefit. It is quite an extraordinary situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Realistically, we are not interested in such exploitation of people. What these programs attempt to do in a very real, tangible and accountable way is to look at people who have needs, to assess those needs and to attempt to meet those needs within the current framework of the marketplace. That, surely, is the role of a government committed to looking after every person in our community, including those people who are in most in need of us. As I said at the beginning of my speech, it is the Government's responsibility to ensure that their talents are used, that we as a community gain from what they have to offer, and that those individuals gain. So it is very much the role of government to pursue this. I say to the honourable member for O'Connor that government bureaucracy is shrinking, and has shrunk, under the current Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a question not of expanding government enterprises, but of using the government enterprises which we have to acknowledge the needs of people who are unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed, to realistically address those needs and, in the longer term, to meet them in a realistic way in which there is quality, integrity and a realistic relationship between the person who finds himself unemployed and the Government and the deliverer of that service. We have seen that Newstart, as a pilot, already has put 134,000 people into the work force. I have no hesitation in suggesting that the programs, as they now stand, will in fact produce the same results. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to take the opportunity to speak on the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill. I listened to the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) correcting some of the anomalies that were put forward by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) this afternoon. It was quite enlightening. The honourable member for O'Connor certainly has a different view from honourable members on this side of the House about how we look after our people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to begin my contribution to this debate by reminding honourable members opposite that it was actually a Labor government that introduced benefits for unemployed Australians and, following that tradition, it will always be a Labor government that introduces reforms, where necessary, to improve the provision of benefits to these people. Obvious as it may seem, behind all the rules and regulations of social security are people. Some of those people have families and some are on their own, but they all share one factor: they are all people in need. For this reason, when changes are proposed, it is important that people affected by the changes be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us embraces that quality, particularly in its attention to people issues in the area of financial assistance for the unemployed. The new structure will be made up of two distinct payments: a short term Job Search allowance payable for the first 12 months of unemployment and the Newstart allowance for those who are unemployed for 12 months or more. The new look system of providing benefits will see a two-phase approach to tackling unemployment. The first of these, the Job Search allowance, will apply to unemployed people aged 18 years and over and will bring about a better prepared work force in a number of ways. </PARA>
<PARA> With the assistance of the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES), unemployment benefit recipients will be encouraged to undertake more active and effective job search. To reduce the likelihood of unemployed people falling into a long term mind set, by way of a new clearly defined activity test recipients of Job Search allowance will be required to actively seek work or undertake a course of vocational training, or participate in a labour market program or any other course that the CES considers will improve or assist a person's prospects of obtaining work. </PARA>
<PARA> Provided the person actually undertakes CES approved courses, they will continue to receive both the Job Search allowance and any accompanying training allowances that they may be eligible for. The Government's all-encompassing approach to unemployment is seen in the continued payment of Job Search allowance to people under 18 and over 55 in special circumstances who are undertaking voluntary work in recognition of special labour market difficulties faced by these groups. While this voluntary work concession will not be available to 18- to 55-year-olds, all unemployed persons who have identified labour market disadvantages will be targeted at an early stage to participate in labour market programs and vocational training courses. </PARA>
<PARA> If a person is still unable to gain employment after 12 months, Newstart, the back-up stage of the Government's strategy to return people to the work force, comes into force. It will see these people enter into a Newstart activity agreement with the Commonwealth. Contrary to some emotive claims, this does not mean that people have to sign themselves over to multiple forms of psychoanalysis to see whether they are worthy recipients of benefits after a year; rather, it means that the Commonwealth takes a heightened interest in identifying the reasons why people may be having difficulty finding work and looks at ways of improving the person's chances of re-entering the work force.</PARA>
<PARA> It will achieve this by requiring the person to undertake such activities as Job Search, vocational training courses or labour market programs, training designed to assist a person in searching for work, or measures designed to eliminate or reduce any labour market disadvantages, such as medical treatment, rehabilitation or paid work experience. A person may also propose an activity such as voluntary work. </PARA>
<PARA> Reflecting their ability to best determine local conditions and needs, it is proposed that regional offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service must consider a number of variables when negotiating their contract. These include a person's education, experience, skills, age and physical condition as well as the state of the local labour market and the training facilities available. That these reforms are bringing about changes to the original financial assistance for the unemployed, as introduced by Curtin in 1945, is indicative of a willingness of Labor governments to adapt to the needs of the day. Let us not forget that people's needs are time specific. </PARA>
<PARA> Given changes that can occur in any of the aforementioned variables, it is intended that from time to time the CES will be able to renegotiate an agreement. Similarly, the recipient of Newstart allowance may request that his or her agreement be varied if he or she feels that circumstances have changed. The Job Search and Newstart measures build on other initiatives of this Government aimed at preparing Australia's work force for the next century through using policy measures which work in a coordinated way towards this goal. </PARA>
<PARA> The new payment structure clearly indicates to job seekers, and to the community generally, that receiving income support while unemployed is not just a matter of receiving payment. On the contrary, it will be strongly linked to a process of client contact, assessment, assistance and obligations designed to get people back into employment as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise the community side of unemployment as well here, for one of the most unjustified sides of being unemployed is the unfair assumption made about unemployed people by the community at large. I am pleased to speak on reforms which will remove redundant stereotypes about dole bludgers and replace them with self-esteem developed by greater and more extensive consultation with people out of work. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact of life that, while there is money to be obtained, a small minority will always be willing to use unscrupulous means to wrongfully obtain a financial benefit. Previously introduced initiatives of the Hawke Government have removed many of the loopholes that have cost the fair pay as you earn taxpayer in the past. The days of unemployed people spending their days on the beach and posting their forms to offices of the Department of Social Security each fortnight have long since gone. </PARA>
<PARA> While I give thanks to the Opposition for its support in the introduction of some of these measures, I remind the House that it has been this Government, not previous conservative governments, which has had the courage to stand up for pay as you earn taxpayers and bring about the genuine equitable reform to the provision of social security in this country. It has also brought about taxation reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Significantly, the restructuring of unemployment benefits is being accompanied by a major reform of labour market programs to link the two more effectively. The reform of labour market programs will see an additional $150m spent in this area over three years. However, the overall efficiency of this exercise is best reflected in the estimated net impact on government expenditure, which will be considerably less because of the increase in people returning to work due to Job Search allowance and Newstart programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The two-part benefit system also contains a heightened focus on obligations. This is both on the part of the Department of Social Security and of the client. Under the reforms proposed, there would be enhanced requirements for job seekers to take advantage of all suitable opportunities to improve job opportunities and find work and for the Department to make all clients aware of all the options open to them. As an incentive for both parties to adhere to the new guidelines, it is proposed that payment of benefit continue only if client obligations associated with each payment are met. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also aware of the need for a continued committed form of assistance to the families of the unemployed. It is determined to see a smooth transition to the new system of benefit provision. The intent of the legislation is that all those on unemployment benefits current at the time of implementation be transferred to the new payment structure and subsequently introduced to the associated obligations and assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> In my introduction I referred to the longstanding commitment of Labor governments to social justice. I am proud to be part of another Labor government that shares that passion for caring and providing for the less well off in our community. Under the unemployment benefits scheme, as it was first introduced by the Curtin Government, benefits were paid to people who were out of work, who were capable of undertaking and willing to undertake suitable work, and who had taken reasonable steps to obtain work. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1947 the Chifley Government provided provision for a partial additional payment for a partly dependent wife and extended eligibility for benefits to wives who had permanently separated from their husbands. The Whitlam Government increased sickness and unemployment benefits to the same level as pensions. It introduced recognition of de facto status for unemployment and sickness beneficiaries by making an additional payment for the partner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government's recognition of families in need has built on these proud achievements. Sweeping reforms in the areas of youth, rent assistance, disability reform, family assistance, child support and the retirement incomes policy are all integral pieces of this Government's social security network ensuring an all-encompassing strategy to tackle the social problems facing today's families. We recognise that provision of payments goes much further than looking at one particular benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefits won for Australian families by Labor governments are made all the more impressive when we look at the chronology of social security events in Australia. Indeed, perhaps the blackest mark on that chronology was the relentless push by the Fraser Government in 1981-82 to prevent the payment of unemployment or special benefit to the spouse of persons participating in industrial action-another attack on the workers. I note with disdain that on three separate occasions the Fraser Government introduced legislation to amend the Social Services Act 1947 to this end. The Australian community can be thankful that this proposal was rejected in the Senate on each of these occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> The presence of some members of that Government on the front benches of today's Opposition stands as a stern reminder for those in need of what social security framework would exist under a Liberal-National Government today. Instead of a planned coordinated approach to providing assistance to those Australian families in need, there would be a mismatched group of organisations with limited ability to coordinate resources determining eligibility for and provision of social services. </PARA>
<PARA> What honourable members opposite seem to forget is that there is more to social security than just finding a suitable person to dish out the money. Given that we have not heard any more from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) since the good doctor gave his last doorstop, we have to assume that he still has it in mind to go about providing social security the same way one sells newspapers. There comes with the responsibility to provide for people financially the need to recognise the different aspects of social security. That is something that neither the milkman nor the newsagent can do. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence of the Government's recognition of this can be seen in the commitment made to maintain the benchmarks of adequacy in family payments. Specifically, these are to maintain the total value of family payments; that is, the first child rate of family allowance plus the family allowance supplement (FAS), equivalent to the married rate of pension for children under 13, and 20 per cent for children aged 13, 14 and 15. These benchmarks were achieved in July 1989. Accordingly, the Government increases the rates of FAS each January by the amounts necessary to ensure that the 15 per cent and 20 per cent benchmarks are maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Put simply, the rule of thumb when initiating and revising social security policy is to keep in touch with the targeted group. This is precisely what the Government has done through the changing of the family income supplement to FAS in December 1987. This step has resulted in a more than fourfold increase in the number of families in receipt of FAS from 46,000 at its introduction in December 1987 to 183,000 in December 1990-an increase of which the Government can be justifiably proud. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also made a continuous effort to increase the awareness of the FAS program. Results from a FAS evaluation showed that 79 per cent of potentially eligible families were aware of the program. The Government has undertaken a range of measures to ensure the policies implemented are those best suited for the intended beneficiaries and that those people have every opportunity to take advantage of these benefits. Some of these activities include extensive publicity using a wide range of outlets from television to milk carton advertisements; social security regional offices developing an extensive range of publicity and information material for schools, hospitals, employers and other community groups; and market research to improve the quality of information products and publicity strategies. Because of the anticipated turnover of the FAS client group, a great deal of importance has been placed on continual and regular outreach programs. </PARA>
<PARA> As proof of the benefits of the constant feedback that comes to the Government through our ongoing analysis of the state of play in social security, to make the tasks easier for the families in need of help, since 1988 the separate family allowance and FAS claim forms have been combined into a single document. I ask the question: how would one derive such information under a system where assistance was not being provided by one central agency? How many butchers, bakers and candlestick makers would need to get together to determine the effectiveness of a particular benefit?</PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members opposite are left trying to work out the answers, I regret to say that I have to give them some more bad news. Through the united effort of a national social security system, the Government has been able to maximise take-up of benefits by pensioners and beneficiaries who have made the transition to the work force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come back to that later. Terminating beneficiaries and pensioners are advised of possible eligi- bility for FAS as a matter of course, while, in cases where an ex-beneficiary or ex-pensioner is eligible for FAS and claims within six weeks of that pension or benefit being cancelled, FAS is backdated to the payday following the last receipt of pension or benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic requirement of being able to ascertain the effectiveness of programs through determining the level of the take-up of a specific program can only be further complicated as the number of variables increases. Overseas experience shows, for instance, that there will always be difficulty in achieving, maintaining and measuring levels of take-up of income tested family payments, given that there is no single reliable source of data on the eligible population. Yet, through a national social security network, the Department is currently constructing a micro-simulation model which will have the capacity to impute FAS eligibility and take-up-something which is expected to be available later this year. </PARA>
<PARA> These cases are not only examples of how the Government is able to keep in touch with the needs of those requiring assistance through a national social security system; they also demonstrate the hypocrisy of the Opposition in its support for the re-write of the social security legislation on one hand-something the Government welcomes-while, on the other hand, desiring to tear apart the very system which is effectively providing for Australians in need of a helping hand. </PARA>
<PARA> The social security option put forward by the Opposition should also be seen as part of its bigger picture when it comes to providing for those in need or for workers. It would seem that, as far as the Opposition is concerned, recipients of social welfare deserve to be hit with the same big hammer as do workers-especially in light of the Opposition's attitude to industrial relations. The question could well be asked: what section of the community will be spared this hammer of repression?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us picture the Opposition's Australia. Workers would be playing off each other for jobs-something which would take their standard of living back 100 years. The workers who could not keep up with the scarcest of wages to keep their families would have no choice but to join the queues at the soup kitchens to fill their bowls and their pockets with whatever a particular agency thought was a fair thing. If the breadwinner of the family had the misfortune to be out of work for more than nine months, the Opposition would even take that benefit away and leave the family with absolutely nothing. There would be no coordinated approach to training in that scenario, just a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor, with the situation only able to get worse. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative before us is much better. Families need not fear the removal of benefits. Uniform guidelines and working through a nationwide coordinated system of offices mean that there can be no cases of discrimination preventing eligibility for benefit. The outcome is that those people who are genuinely seeking re-employment will continue to be supported and will be able to devote all of their attention to that very end, instead of spending half their time wondering how close they are getting to the end of the road. What is more, there is every likelihood that, thanks to the heightened attention to individual cases, time spent on benefit will be greatly reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> As has already been seen with the success of the jobs, education and training program, which aims to return sole parents to the work force, the Government's strategy of applying programs which are specifically related to the needs of one target group has worked well. That policy will continue to do so in regard to Job Search and Newstart. As with the social achievements of Curtin, Chifley and Whitlam, I believe that the job creation that will flow from this reformation of unemployment benefits will stand as one of the most significant and equitable initiatives of the Hawke Government. I am pleased to support that aspect here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) interjected a moment ago about unemployment. I can assure the honourable member that this Government is greatly concerned about unemployed people. I am certain that no-one on this side of the House takes any joy in the present unemployment figures. That has been indicated by other Government speakers today and, certainly, by our leaders as well. I think it is rather hypocritical of honourable members opposite to criticise this legislation, which will certainly help in a lot of ways to provide training and greater opportunities for people who are unemployed when eventually they get back into the job market. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to acknowledge some of the areas in my own electorate-such as the technical and further education college and the Skillshare programs, which actually undertake a lot of this work-that will be enhanced by the legislation tonight. I would like also to acknowledge the commitment that people in my electorate-certainly in the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service-have in trying to get people trained and back into the work force. I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to support the legislation tonight. I am sure it will be passed later this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I support the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill, I am concerned about some issues arising from the legislation. However, I will first make some introductory comments about the context in which this legislation was developed. The idea for the legislation originated at a time of high employment and low unemployment. In that situation, the general ideas that were proposed were good. Clearly, they were ideas which were worthy of consideration in that context. However, as has been mentioned by a number of honourable members, the unemployment situation has dramatically changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that context, it is very important, given that we are to proceed with these programs, that we ensure that they are sensitive to the times. By `sensitive to the times', I mean that these programs need to be sensitive to the fact that we have a high level of unemployment at the moment and that in many areas of Australia there are not enough jobs. Given that situation, it is important that people not be penalised for something which is not their fault, namely, the fact that there are no jobs in a particular area or a particular city for them. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, both Job Search and Newstart were significant programs in the context in which they were developed. However, I want to refer to some of the features of the programs which I think need to be emphasised in order to ensure that, as I say, the programs are implemented with great sensitivity in the current situation. I refer in the first instance to the contract which will need to be signed by people after they have been unemployed for a period of time in order for them to continue to receive assistance. I think it is very important that the contract be signed only in the context of other alternatives being available. It is proposed that:</PARA>
<PARA>Under the terms of the agreement a person will be required to undertake such activities as job search, vocational training courses or labour market programs, training designed to assist a person searching for work, measures designed to eliminate or reduce any labour market disadvantage such as medical treatment or rehabilitation, or paid work experience. A person may also propose an activity such as voluntary work. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very important, therefore, that such programs be available. I have been told by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) that many of the programs will be taken up on a voluntary basis by unemployed people. If, therefore, there will be very few programs left for other people, this factor should be taken into account. In other words, people should not be forced into an agreement if such programs are not available for them. I think it is a matter which the Government ought to have clarified in the second reading speech on the Bill. The Government should have stated that people in the current economic situation would not be forced to sign an agreement if there were to be no such programs available. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to another important clause. When negotiating the agreement, the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) must consider a person's education, experience, skills, age and physical condition as well as the state of the local labour market and the training facilities available. This is an important matter because, as shall been seen later, very substantial powers are being given to CES officers in relation to these agreements. Therefore, it is important that this particular clause be up in lights so that it can be seen by the individual officers of the CES. I will repeat: they must consider a person's education, experience, skills, age and physical condition as well as the state of the local labour market and the training facilities available.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it clear that what we do not want as a Government and as a Parliament is to be told in a few months time that there are officers of the CES who are abusing these powers and who are not taking into account people's education, experience, skills, age and physical condition. In other words, while it is clear that people should be expected to seek employment-and I think the Australian community does expect that unemployed people should make every reasonable effort to find employment and that, if there are training programs available for them, they should go into those programs-it is quite absurd to suggest that people who have, for example, a very high level of education or experience or skills should be required to do totally unsuitable jobs which differ completely from their education, experience and skills. To suggest that and to say to a person, `Well, unless you sign a contract or an agreement to the effect that you will do this, you will not be paid an allowance' is in fact to force experienced, educated and skilled members of the work force into demeaning situations from which they may not be able to escape. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia contains a wide spectrum of people, both skilled and unskilled. Unfortunately, at the present time Australia has unemployed people, both skilled and unskilled. So it should be possible, if this program is carried out sensitively, for people to be asked to seek work and take up jobs, if those jobs are available, in those particular areas in which they have the education, experience, skills, age and physical condition. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that, given the wide powers that will be given to the officers of the CES, it is important that these provisions not be abused, and it is important in this context that people be given some flexibility in this matter. This is not to say that if a person is a university professor, he or she may not be required to go and teach in a school. That is fair enough. But to suggest that people who have the education, experience and skills, and who are in a situation in which there are already many unskilled, unemployed people, should be required to travel long distances and to work in totally unsuitable employment which is not commensurate with their education, experience and skills is to suggest something that, from what I can see in this particular clause, is not what the legislation intends. It must be the case that public servants, especially the more junior public servants in the Department, not abuse the powers that are given to them in relation to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I have raised a couple of what I think are crucial issues in relation to these contracts or agreements. The first is the question of whether people will be required to enter into such agreements where there are no programs available for them, and I think we need some reassurances on this point. The second is the question, as I said, of what sorts of work they will be required to look for, what sorts of areas they will be required to look at in terms of employment possibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me also refer to rumours which are going around in relation to these contracts or agreements. I do not believe the rumours to be true, but it is important that the Government again clarify the position in relation to them. The rumours refer to the claim that these officials will be given the power in negotiating the contract to require unreasonable conditions from people-for example, to require them to completely change their mode of dress or their hair style. I inform the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) that I have heard these rumours that are going around, and it is important that we put a stop to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, there are certain basic requirements. If people are trying to flout the system by deliberately dressing or deliberately behaving in such ways as to be rejected by prospective employers, that is one thing. But it is another thing if somebody comes along and says, `Look, I don't like your moustache' or `I don't like your beard' or `I don't like the fact you dress this particular way rather than that way'. Those sorts of statements can be seen as an infringement on people's rights, and I am sure that honourable members would agree that those sorts of abuses ought not be allowed to be perpetrated in relation to this matter. Clearly, if the departmental officers are going to have those powers, guidelines ought to be put forward to ensure that those powers are not abused. </PARA>
<PARA> We know from other departments, such as the department controlling immigration, what can happen when there are insufficient guidelines and when too much power has been given to people, especially bureaucrats and junior officials, in the exercise of their duties, so that they say to other persons, `I don't like the look of you. Go away and come back dressed differently, otherwise you won't get a social security payment, even though you cannot find a job'. That sort of thing must be avoided as much as possible. As I said, there are some reasonable requests that can be made, but we need guidelines in relation to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I have raised these questions because I am concerned about what is going to happen with the implementation of this program in the context of the present very high unemployment situation. I want to spend a few minutes addressing that situation and to say I believe that, ultimately, no matter which program of this kind we bring forward, the most important issue is for us to put into place policies and programs which will get us out of the recession as quickly as possible and which will create employment. In this context, it seems to me that we have to think about what sort of programs will create employment in the current economic climate. I am looking forward to the Budget because I hope that in it the Government will consider the issue of what has happened with unemployment and will put into place some programs for the creation of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not speaking here of another Commonwealth employment program of the kind we had in the past. I am speaking here about the fact that in this country, in the area of infrastructure-the roads, railway systems and all sorts of infrastructure developments where there is work to be done-we need to think of ways and means in which work can be done. It seems to me that the Government ought to think about the introduction of a major infrastructure program in this forthcoming Budget to soak up some of the unemployment and, therefore, to have secondary effects in terms of the creation of other jobs in the services areas. As we know, once basic jobs are created in the infrastructure area, other jobs are created in services, retail and associated areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that unless we put such programs into place we will be in difficulties with the employment situation. Notwithstanding the general performance of the macro-economy, there is a need at this particular time for such programs. I believe the Government ought seriously to consider what it can do within the context of the Budget in relation to such programs. As I said, I will be looking forward to seeing what can be done in the Budget context. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems that has occurred as a result of current unemployment, and one of the concerns that I have with this program, is that we have had a sharp increase in unemployment for people in the semi-skilled and unskilled areas where we have gone in for restructuring or where we have had tariff reductions. I am referring to industries such as the textile, footwear and clothing industries and the motor car industry where we have had significant job losses. Very often the job losses have been amongst people of migrant backgrounds who have been doing the same job for many years. Often they are in their late 40s or in their 50s, and we are saying to them, `You have got to go out and retrain'. That is fine, we can say that about retraining, but if we are going to be talking about retraining in these areas we have to make it perfectly clear that often retraining involves additional courses in the English language. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of the programs referred to in this Bill, we have to be prepared to put more resources into the provision of English language courses for the retraining of the work force, especially for the unskilled. We have already done that to some degree with the training levy. We have suggested to employers that part of the one per cent training levy could be used on English language courses, but that may not be enough. It certainly will not be much good for those who are already unemployed. These people are at a double disadvantage and they need to be helped. Not only do they have to retrain, but also as part of the training requirement they have to learn a better level of English. Therefore, we need to put resources into place to ensure that that succeeds. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst, as I say, I support the general thrust of the program, I am concerned that it has come at a time when there is rising unemployment. In my view, the program would be more successful if it were to come in at a time when unemployment was going down and employment was increasing. If we are to proceed with it we have to ensure that there are more activities and programs so that if people are to be required to sign an agreement, there will be labour market programs, training courses, et cetera, for them to go into. As I mentioned in respect of many of the migrant workers who are to be retrained, we also need to have significantly increased resources for English language training. </PARA>
<PARA> I have one concluding comment. The Bill says that a person may propose an activity such as voluntary work as part of this program. At this time of high unemployment I suggest that that aspect should be highlighted. If people are prepared to do voluntary activities in the community they should be told, `Okay, you are doing this particular beneficial and voluntary activity for the community; we accept that as part of the agreement'. That should be particularly focused on in the current context of high unemployment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate because I have concerns about the concepts in this Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill. I have no problems with advances which are being made in the social security system, and programs which are being put in place to make it more relevant to the real needs of the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1909 Australian governments have always had a concern, as has the Australian community, for those among us who are less well off than others. Whilst we like to believe that we are an egalitarian society, we are certainly not. There are those among us who are less well off; there are those who have jobs who are not well off. </PARA>
<PARA> Until 1990 that was a view which I would have suggested was shared equally and pursued in different ways but, nevertheless, pursued by both sides of politics in Australia. That is not the case today. The present Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has made it clear that he believes that the aim of the Federal Government is to transfer funds from those on the lowest incomes to those who are best off already. His proposal to automatically remove unemployment benefits from persons who have been unemployed for nine months is a money-saving exercise at the expense of those people who no longer can, or are unable to, support themselves and have no other source of income. It could save $1 billion a year, but not to the Government. That $1 billion will be transferred to speculators and others who will be repaid, under the policies announced, moneys already paid in capital gains tax and other get rich quick schemes which dominated this society in modern times. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to discuss the problems which are related directly to my electorate and the problems which are fairly general throughout provincial and smaller towns throughout Australia. Retraining schemes have value if, at the end of the retraining, there is an opportunity for people who have been retrained to find useful and gainful employment and to remove themselves from what is now a very serious social stigma-the welfare system-which is fast becoming a morass from which they cannot remove themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of events which took place nearly 20 years ago, where a public relations campaign was launched by a particular political party to damn the unemployed as being people who were deliberately unemployed-dole bludgers was the term used-people who are genuinely out of work today, unlike in the 1930s, say, are looked on as imposing themselves on others by choice. In most instances that is not true. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, and always will be, those in our society who would prefer not to work and probably they will not. A great deal has been done during the term of this Government to make that situation as difficult as possible. But between that, and the situation where you automatically remove income from people without concern or consideration, there is a gulf which is too wide to bridge.</PARA>
<PARA> Do you actually allow families to starve? That is a question which has not yet been answered. The only alternative to unemployment benefits or other welfare benefits which has so far been suggested is that people may go down to the Salvation Army, the Brotherhood of St Lawrence or the local soup kitchen and get a feed. I would have hoped that in 1991 that is not an option that Australians-and this Parliament-would seriously see as viable or acceptable from anyone in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill introduces significant changes in a whole range of welfare payments. Its success or failure depends very much on a group of people who will be responsible for choosing, administering and providing retraining schemes, or negotiating contracts with people on their futures and, more importantly, on whether or not all of that makes any difference. On today's figures in my electorate there are probably 11 per cent of those people seeking full time employment-I ignore those seeking part time work-who are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last 12 months and less somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 have lost their jobs in the car industry and its associated industries, which dominate the economy of Geelong. In addition, there is a like number of people who have lost their jobs in the textile, clothing and footwear industries, and although it is not spectacular and because the numbers have not attracted the same publicity it is of equal proportions and creates a double problem for many families. In numerous cases the people who have lost their jobs in the textile areas are from the same families as those who have lost their jobs in the automotive and other industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that I am a protectionist, not a free trader like the majority of the members of this Parliament, and I have already said that I am not converted to the new academic religion which has failed everywhere it has been tried, including Britain and the United States, but apparently it is going to be tried here as well. We are told that the medicine is nasty, but that it will provide a future which is brighter than that which exists at present. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told this by people who live in an enclave called Canberra, most of whom have never had dirt under their fingernails in their lives and would not know what a pay cheque of $400 a week or something of that nature is all about, the same people who are setting the guidelines and can change them in the future for the contracts people in my electorate are going to be asked to enter into. </PARA>
<PARA> We should remember that the policy makers in the Public Service now never leave Canberra; they do not have to go out to the State offices. Since Menzies started moving the Public Service into Canberra, and every Prime Minister since has followed his example-on both sides-we have reached a stage where we have an elite group of people who are born in Canberra, educated in Canberra, live in Canberra and probably go to Sydney University Economics School to get their proper right wing training and then come back to Canberra, and by the time they are in their forties they are in the executive service of the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who are out on the ground in the State offices, in the capital cities, in the provincial cities, do not get the promotions. They only see the problems, and they are told by people who have never seen the problems how they should solve them, and the guidelines are set at that level. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make this point, and make it very strongly: if we are going to retrain people, and there are no jobs in the area for the people we retrain, if we have some vague notion of lifting them all up and moving them all into the central business districts of Melbourne and Sydney, then we should forget it, or else we should acknowledge that it will cost and cost dearly. </PARA>
<PARA> To move home from Geelong to Melbourne, just the physical cost of selling a house and buying another one will be $40,000, and that is a lot of money if people are unemployed. It is not long ago that the Fraser Government was talking about forcing people to go to, say, the fruit picking areas. I have no objection to people being temporarily moved there, especially singles, as long as the costs are met. But that was not the case. Not only were they expected to move 400 miles from their homes and lose the support of the family that they had; they were not guaranteed accommodation; and, in the case of single girls, they were told they could sleep in the same huts as the men. Some might find that acceptable; most would not. However, that was a Government directive. Fortunately it did not come off. It was a Government policy, and where was it decided? In Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about retraining, for years in provincial cities the number of people who are trained for clerical and administrative jobs-which is fairly normal, especially amongst girls-and registered for employment with the CES often reaches a thousand in a month or more, and the number of jobs registered are five or six. Are we going to put people in retraining schemes to train them so that they can be added to that thousand?</PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that a good percentage of the people who lost their jobs in the textile, clothing and footwear industries in Geelong are-as the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) said-migrants and in their forties and early fifties. They are not going to be retrained for jobs that exist; if they are being retrained it is to occupy their time so that they will not appear and be a problem on the unemployment list. There is no form of contract that can be devised, even in Canberra, which will provide them any opportunity of work whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those who work for Ford and came to Australia to work for Ford in many cases, because that is why migrants were brought into the country in the 1950s and 1960s. They are still of working age and they are not going to be trained to take positions in other industries. There are a few jobs about, but precious few, and there are people already trained and skilled in those areas who can take those jobs when they become available. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to see what retraining is all about. I would like to see the guidelines, because I am very suspicious that those guidelines are going to be administered by people who have not been trained to administer them, have not got the training necessary to assess people, and they will be so overworked, because if they have to handle 3,000 or 4,000 people on the Social Security register in a small regional office which is already overworked, then they are not going to give the attention to detail that should be necessary and would be required if the scheme were to work properly. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to finish on this point: if we are going to introduce a scheme such as this, if we are going to depend on people to assess other people and fix conditions for other people, if we are going to offer people retraining, then there is some obligation to make sure that the people who are doing the work have the time to do it, the skills and training to do it, and that the retraining schemes have some prospects of actual employment at the conclusion. At the moment none of those conditions can be met in my electorate. There are no jobs and there are no prospects of any jobs, and we can retrain people week after week, scheme after scheme, and they are not going to get jobs. The only people who will get jobs are the people who train them. </PARA>
<PARA> I personally think that there should be built into this legislation provision whereby in certain areas the whole thing can be deferred until such time as some opportunity at least exists for it to work, because retraining schemes humiliate people. People are told that they must be retrained because they do not have skills for jobs that they did have skills for not very long ago. At the end of the retraining they are told, `Bad luck, mate. There were never any jobs there. We need a few people to fill another retraining scheme; let's start again.'</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in his statement on 12 March, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that $40m would be made available for assistance to those people who were displaced or who suffered from the consequences, in the short term, of the industry statement made on that date. It is now 9 May and no announcements of any forms of assistance have been finalised. It took just on a month before they were even looked at. I understand that some progress is being made, but I have to say that what I have seen to date is certainly a lot less than will be needed if people are to be given a decent way of life and a decent opportunity to live in the way that Australians are entitled to expect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First, I want to thank those who have contributed to this debate. The Government members who contributed today, namely, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh), the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), and the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), along with a number of others who spoke yesterday on the Bill, all made useful contributions. They indicated a concern that not only should we be implementing these initiatives, but that the resources are directed to those most in need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Corio and the honourable member for Calwell mentioned a number of matters which were of concern to them. I can appreciate that they would be concerned, particularly the honourable member for Corio, because of the rural situation and because of the fact that there are many thousands of people who are presently unemployed. But this Government does not want to repeat what happened after the recession of 1982-83. The very fact that there is high unemployment does not mean that we should sit back and allow what will be to be. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the active employment strategy of the Government is a positive strategy designed to assist back to employment those most disadvantaged in the labour market. These people must not be left to languish without help and then miss out as the labour market picks up. The purpose of these changes is to help people into jobs by providing an enhanced level of client contact through the interviews between Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) officers and unemployed people in formulating the activity agreements, an enhanced range of labour market programs based on individual assessment of clients needs, and better targeting of the disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure on the four main programs for the long term unemployed has been increased by $113m, or 40 per cent. The centrepiece of the new arrangements will be activity agreements negotiated between long term unemployed clients and the CES. Payment of benefits will be conditional upon a client fulfilling their agreement. The arrangements require careful implementation by the Commonwealth Employment Service. To this end, guidelines are being presently drawn up to define the nature of activity agreements and the circumstances under which benefit can be cancelled. These guidelines are being developed in consultation with the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS). Although they have yet to be approved by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), they will contain provisions on natural justice requirements for clients and they will contain important review rights for clients. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no direct relationship between the number of unemployed persons and the appropriate number of labour market program places. In particular, there is no sense in seeking to guarantee a labour market program place to every unemployed person, as the programs may not necessarily be able to assist every individual. There are other options for unemployed people outside the Commonwealth labour market programs; for example, technical and further education. Quality is important. Throughput of numbers is less important than ensuring that people's employment prospects genuinely improve. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not claim that these changes or expanded program provisions are a panacea for the problems of unemployment. The Government's policy responses to the unemployment problem are much broader than that, but these measures can and will play a useful supporting role. As I said, we cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the 1982-83 recession when nothing was done about getting people into the labour market when the labour market did improve. </PARA>
<PARA> It is natural, I think, for the honourable member for Corio and the honourable member for Calwell, and Opposition members who spoke here today and yesterday, to be concerned about the fact that there is a limited number of jobs and that the labour market is certainly not very good. But these new measures will at least go some way to try to make sure that we reskill and do everything we can to train those in our work force if it is obvious that they are not going to be able to find a job after 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Calwell and some other honourable members mentioned their worries about the abuse of powers in so far as the Newstart activity agreements are concerned. I can understand that concern, but I assure the House that the Government will be looking very closely to make sure that these sorts of things do not happen. There will be moved shortly by the Government in the committee stage an amendment which will give the right of appeal to those who believe that for some reason the contract that they may have been asked to sign contains unreasonable conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security Appeals Tribunal will have the power to set aside the whole of the agreement, or just conditions therein, but will not have the power to rewrite the contract. As is the case in any new program, obviously there may well be some hiccups; obviously there may well be some problems. This will always be the case, I guess, and it is something that I am sure the Department of Employment, Education and Training will be looking at very closely in so far as the Commonwealth Employment Service is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I now go to some of the comments made by some of the Opposition members during the debate. First, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) said that we had not taken into account the current high unemployment. I reiterate what I have said with respect to being ready when the upturn comes-as it will. He also spoke of the tighter measures, for instance, in New Zealand. I am glad that he mentioned that: I was not going to say anything about New Zealand, but now I am going to. It is true that New Zealand has implemented a number of tighter measures. I quote from an article which appeared in the Telegraph Mirror newspaper of 10 April, by Brian Rudman. It is headed, `Brian Rudman's New Zealand'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Ugly scenes over savage welfare cuts . . .</PARA>
<PARA> Last week more than 100,000 people took to the streets. In Auckland the mood turned ugly when 6,000 education workers marching down the city's main street in opposition to labour market . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Angry members of the unemployed march invaded several banks, hurled bottles at a McDonalds hamburger restaurant and burned effigies of Prime Minister Jim Bolger, Finance Minister Ruth Richardson and Social Welfare Minister Jenny Shipley. </PARA>
<PARA> In reply, a shopping arcade's electronic notice board flashed a message,``Stop your whingeing, get a job''. This sparked the smoke bombing and invasion of the arcade by 100 of the protesters. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In a bid to lop around $A1 billion from the annual welfare budget, the universal family benefit was abolished, virtually all benefits were cut, and stricter eligibility criteria were introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Worst hit was the single, unemployed under-25-year-old whose benefit was slashed 25 per cent back to $A82 a week. </PARA>
<PARA>I can assure honourable members that the Government has absolutely no intention to restrict unemployment benefits and to do the sorts of things that are being championed by the Opposition in so far as those unfortunate enough to be unemployed are concerned. Indeed, one only has to look at the manifesto-I think it is called the Economic Action Plan-of the Opposition, which under the heading of `Unemployment Relief Plan' says:</PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment benefits will only be available for a maximum nine months. Within this nine month period, the onus of proof as to why benefits should be continued will rest with the beneficiary. </PARA>
<PARA>Estimated savings: $1500 million</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where the Opposition gets that figure from. I understand that it will move an amendment later to suggest that people be taken off the Job Search allowance after nine months. It seems to me that the Opposition is simply saying that after a period of nine months-whether one can get a job or not, whether one has tried to get a job or not, whether one has done everything possible to get a job or not-people will be thrown out onto the scrap heap. </PARA>

<PARA> The honourable member for Dawson asks me to tell the truth. I will tell him what the Leader of the Opposition said. The transcript of a Matthew Abraham radio interview on 2CN dated 6 May 1991 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Abraham:</PARA>
<PARA>They're not the sorts of things that scare the voters, though, not necessarily. The focus is always on that side of it. As you know, the problem for an Opposition is the whole question of particularly welfare, and spending cuts, and they must be substantial, mustn't they. </PARA>
<PARA>Hewson:</PARA>
<PARA>We will have substantial cuts, there's no doubt about that. They won't necessarily be in welfare, though. There will be some, look at the last election I think we had about $3 billion worth of cuts and about $1 billion of those were in welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>Abraham:</PARA>
<PARA>Would that be a minimum, by the way. </PARA>
<PARA>Hewson:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, we are reviewing, we have an Expenditure Review Committee, and we are updating, if you like, the numbers from the last election campaign. We don't resile from that in any sense. A lot of those changes were structural changes. Some are more difficult to make in a recession, for example, in relation to unemployment benefits, but the principle of the change, the need to restore incentive for people to go back to work, the key motivation, if you like, of our decision last time still stays, even though it may be somewhat harder to implement it in a recession. We don't resile from the decision. And I don't pull back in any sense. </PARA>
<PARA>An article by economic writer Laura Tingle in the Australian of 19 February 1991 headed `Reith urges $3 billion spending cut-higher taxes' states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Opposition has called on the Government to introduce a goods and services tax immediately and cut government spending by $3 billion, half of which would come from restricting the dole. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Asked about the decision to cut the dole after nine months, Mr Reith said this was ``a structural thing'' as well as a savings measure. </PARA>
<PARA> ``You are saying to people there is a limit to the system, we are placing outer limits on that system, and Australia does have, relative to the rest of the world, very long averages for people on the unemployment benefit,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious that the Opposition has made it as clear as a bell that it will have its cuts in the area of welfare. Both the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders, have specifically said that they intend to make cuts to the dole. One says the figure will be $1.5 billion, while the other says it will be at least $1 billion. We do not really know what it will be. It is obvious, though, that it is going to save its money, if it ever has the chance, by cutting such things as unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of its computer matching programs and by way of stricter and more mobile review teams in the area of social security, this Government is doing everything that is possible to try to cut down the incidence of fraud in social security. It is doing so with a great deal of success. There have been substantial savings. Sure, there will always be a number of people who will try to get around the system. They will do everything that they possibly can to beat the system. The Government is doing everything that it can to make sure that those who are not genuine are penalised accordingly. But we will not have the situation that the Opposition would have-that is, that after nine months, by hook or by crook, people go off somewhere else and look after themselves. That is exactly what has been stated by the Opposition. The Opposition says that it will arrange to put people on a special benefit, or something like that. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) spent five minutes in his speech attacking the unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. That is fine; we expect that from the honourable member for McPherson. He also said that the Opposition would create a whole new attitude to work, but he did not say what it would be. The Opposition comes up with these things and says, `We're going to do this and we're going to do that. We're going to cut off $3 billion from government spending'. According to the Leader of the Opposition, at least $1 billion will be in the area of welfare cuts. According to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, $1.5 billion alone will be cut from the dole. But they do not tell us what they are going to do to replace these things. I do not know where they think these unemployed people-people who are genuinely unemployed and who have not been able to find a job-are going to go. Where do they go? Do they go to St Vincent de Paul? They have to live; they have to survive. Do they turn to crime?</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Opposition has not thought out its policies. We all know that. It blames this Government-or at least criticises this Government-because we are introducing reforms in labour market programs. We are trying to do everything that we possibly can to make sure that we get people retrained and to make sure that people who have problems in finding employment are able to get a job in due course and are at least responsible enough to enter into a Newstart activity agreement, a contract, where we tell them-after personal assessment-what we think they can and cannot do. The Opposition criticises us for that. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) said that the Opposition's policy is certainly not punitive and is not to leave without support people who have no other means of support. She did not actually say what the Opposition's policy is, except that it wants the clients knocked off after nine months on benefit. The honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) said:</PARA>
<PARA> The coalition wants proposed changes to the unemployment benefits system stiffened and toughened. We would like to see that after nine months people are given an opportunity to begin to make a change to the situation they find themselves in. Whether they choose to find themselves in that position or not, the Opposition would like to see an earlier change. All we are saying is, `We don't want you on unemployment benefits for 12 months'. We would like to say, `After nine months we are giving you the opportunity to move on in another direction'. </PARA>
<PARA>What does this mean? Where is the policy? What is the direction that the honourable member is talking about? In what direction are these people supposed to go? In the direction of hopelessness? Down the road of crime, as I said, simply to survive and perhaps feed their wives and children? The Opposition simply wants to wash its hands of the problem. This Government will not allow that to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Opposition has made it very clear that it intends to move a number of amendments. I will discuss them at a later stage. The major point is the question of the 12 months and the nine months. Over the last couple of days we have met and consulted with people from the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) and with people from welfare rights centres. We as a government have listened to their concerns. There will be one amendment, as previously stated, that will give the right of appeal to clients who believe that in some way they have signed an agreement which is not reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> There were a number of other matters that were raised by ACOSS and the welfare rights centres. The Government will look at those suggestions. We may not take them all up; we may take only some up. But the fact is that we realise that these welfare bodies are out there in the field. They are out there with the people who are suffering, if they are unemployed, and we will take as much notice as we can of what they are saying. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bradfield and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) also spoke in the debate. Amazingly, both members claimed that the Newstart reforms are being introduced as a response to the popularity of the Opposition's strategy. This must be a perverse measure of popularity. The Opposition has no strategy, unless dumping someone on special benefits without access to training programs is a strategy. The honourable member for O'Connor suggested that employers hold dole cheques to pay unemployed people to work, on the basis that this would give the otherwise unemployed valuable work experience, in his words. This surely is work for the dole-nothing short of slave labour, where employers have a free pocket of labour to exploit people at the Government's expense. As my colleague the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) said, this is nothing short of extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for O'Connor also said that he has become aware of phantoms; I take it he means people who are collecting the unemployment benefit and who really do not exist. If that is the case, the honourable member for O'Connor should let me know. If he can give me some names and addresses, I believe it is his duty as a member of Parliament to do so. If the honourable member for O'Connor lets me know, I will make sure-and I give him this undertaking in Parliament-that the matter is investigated. It is no good giving the chamber anecdotal evidence and quoting rumours that big problems will be caused because people are out there rooking us and all the rest of it. If the member for O'Connor has that evidence, he should tell the Department. Do not tell everyone in the Parliament; tell the Department who they are, and we will do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring to the rumour which the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) said he had heard to the effect that unreasonable conditions would be placed on some people by the Newstart activity agreement. I assure the honourable member for Calwell that will not be the case, and that the Government will monitor it very closely. </PARA>

<PARA> `(2) Where a person has received a notice under subsection (1) and has not, without good reason, within 14 days from the day on which the person was so notified, attended an office of the Department or the CES for counselling and advice, a person will cease to be qualified for a job search allowance until the person attends for counselling and advice.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments Nos 1 to 6 are clearly expressed. They were circulated and have been available to the chamber for the past 24 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> I want firstly to remove the misapprehension which is obviously in the minds of Government members in connection with the substitution of nine months for 12 months in relation to Job Search. Included in the first group of amendments is a requirement to attend for counselling. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) quite obviously was not speaking the facts and the truth when he indicated there would be within the Opposition's policy of 18 months ago a withdrawal causing a loss to the unemployed of over $1m. Without looking at other aspects, he said, in an attempt to deliberately create concern among the people who are the clients of this Government, that there would be nothing to replace it. He asked in effect, `Where do they go? Into the soup kitchens and down to the Salvation Army. They will get thrown out onto the street'. He then immediately said that the Opposition intended to replace it with a system of special benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Secretary cannot have it both ways. He selectively quoted and deliberately misled this Parliament and the people in the community for whom the Opposition has a genuine concern. These were not the words of the Opposition; I quote many members on the Government side, who said that all the skilling and training for a job is absolutely useless unless jobs are available. I think the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) made a pertinent comment in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the economic policies of the Government we see a move in the direction suggested by these Bills for only one reason: the economic policy of this Government has created growth only in unemployment and insolvencies, and has created a long trail of misery in this growth which is the lot of the people who are on social welfare, particularly for those on the unemployment benefit. The Parliamentary Secretary lectured the Opposition about what it is doing by way of the first lot of the amendments, so I will put his mind at rest. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that under this legislation no incentives or disciplines will be available for people on the unemployment benefit to try to take some corrective measures for the first 12-month period. They will be available only after 12 months when people go onto the second limb; that is, the Newstart legislation. That legislation at least will give them an opportunity to search for jobs, skills training, education programs, voluntary employment and part-paid employment, which have been denied to them because the first part of the Job Search program is just a continuation of the unemployment system at the moment, where none of these items are offered. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition initially believed that the unemployment benefit should be restricted to nine months. In connection with Job Search, the Opposition reiterates that it should be available only for nine months if intervention in order to train these people for some type of job occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should bear this in mind: these were comments made by its own members. I come back to the contribution of the honourable member for Cunningham, who said that all the skilling in the world will not take the place of creating jobs. Perhaps the Government ought to be as concerned about creating those jobs as it is about putting in this new system, which is the result of its bad economic administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Cunningham also referred to the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who said that the Government had only followed in the footsteps of the coalition when it issued these guidelines 18 months ago. I cannot help thinking that is more than the truth, at least in respect of what the Government reacted to. It reacted firstly to the terrible situation it has bequeathed to Australia-the recession that we `had to have'-and has done so in the way suggested originally by the coalition. Fair enough, the coalition did say, and still maintains, that people should come off the unemployment benefit-that is, what is now Job Search-after nine months and be more positively attached to a program whereby they learn skills. </PARA>
<PARA> It is wonderful how the Government clutches at the old sayings about slave labour, sweatshops and so on. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would find it interesting if he were to get back to the grassroots and talked to unemployed people. </PARA>

Last Friday night I was at a meeting of young people and they were the firmest of advocates from the word go of working for an unemployment benefit that was meaningful and might put them into a position where in later life they might be able to get a job. There was no suggestion by those kids who are faced with the problem that to get a job one needs experience, but to get that experience one needs a job. They are the people who are concerned, and that is what is coming from the grassroots of this country. I am fed up with the hackneyed sayings of the Government about slave labour, sweatshops and so on, because that is not the case at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have given the reasons why the Opposition has moved amendments Nos 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6. However, amendment No. 7 is the most interesting one. The Opposition believes there should be intervention through a counselling process after six months on the Job Search program. When one looks at this, it is interesting that for 12 months people can do exactly what they are doing at the moment; they can look for a job and record it and so on. I mentioned in my contribution to the second reading debate that I know of people being told by the Commonwealth Employment Office that they were not to take voluntary work and were to look for only two jobs every fortnight. I believe that restriction will still apply with Job Search. </PARA>
<PARA> In amendment No. 7, the Opposition is offering the requirement that:</PARA>
<PARA>Where a person is receiving a job search allowance, the Secretary must, on the expiration of 6 months from the day on which the person commenced receiving the allowance, notify the person in writing that he or she is required to attend an office of the Department or of the CES for the purpose of counselling and advice in respect of that person's attempts to obtain employment. </PARA>
<PARA>That is where the counselling comes in. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Where a person has received a notice under subsection (1) and has not, without good reason, within 14 days from the day on which the person was so notified, attended an office of the Department or the CES for counselling and advice, a person will cease to be qualified for a job search allowance until the person attends for counselling and advice. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very important that the kids out there who would have suffered 12 months of knock-backs under the Government's system as they go looking for jobs, without any hope whatsoever of getting into a skill training program, be given that encouragement at six months before they completely lose that morale and opportunity. Basically, they are the aspects of the Opposition's amendments. It is very important for the Government to recognise that intervention after 12 months is far too late, and our requirement to bring back Job Search to a nine-month period with intervention at six months is more positive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government talks about being active instead of passive. We believe that this is the aspect of activity that the Government is concerning itself with, particularly in connection with Newstart. We believe that it ought to start at Job Search level. As I said before, it is not what we are saying, it is what Government members have been saying for quite a while. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 3 concerns liquid assets. As we understand the Bill, if people dispose of liquid assets to their children within four weeks of making a claim, they can be denied the benefits of Job Search. Last year, in an earlier Bill, we mentioned that this does not go far enough in that it does not collect into the web the liquid assets disposed of by a person within three months to people even at arm's length. This amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `(1A) Where:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) a person disposed of liquid assets of the person within 3 months before lodging a claim for unemployment benefit or sickness benefit; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) the person received no consideration, or inadequate consideration, in money or money's worth; and</PARA>
<PARA>(c) apart from the disposition, this section would have applied to the person;</PARA>
<PARA>this section applies to the person as if the disposition had not been made.'.''</PARA>
<PARA>Again, we believe that this tightens up a loophole. We mentioned it in the earlier Bill last year and mention it again. Those are the seven items that comprise our amendments in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no greater duty upon the representatives of the people in a democratic society than the duty to ensure that they serve all members of that society equally. This duty requires government which is free of corruption and undue influence. It requires standards of integrity and honesty from its representatives, and it requires that the system itself does not engender a diminution of those standards. The integrity of the electoral process is central to the maintenance of these standards and the honouring of this duty. </PARA>
<PARA> In our own society the pursuit of government office at all levels is far more complicated today than it was when the first elections were held for this Federal Parliament. The development of modern election campaigning and communication techniques has impacted greatly upon the electoral process. This has been no more so evident than in the area of campaign financing. The vast sums required to fund modern political campaigns have added substantially to the pressures upon the electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA> With these changes in mind the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, as part of its inquiry into the 1987 Federal election, produced a report titled Who Pays the Piper Calls the Tune-Minimising the Risks of Funding Political Campaigns. This Parliament is indebted to the Committee for its report. The concerns raised in the Committee's report have been the subject of separate State corruption inquiries. Both Queensland Commissioner Fitzgerald and Assistant Commissioner Roden of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption dealt with the problems of political campaign finances in their reports. Related concerns are now the subject of inquiries in Western Australia and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The risk to which the title of the Joint Standing Committee's report refers is a real and dangerous one. As Commissioner Roden said in his report on his investigation into north coast development:</PARA>
<PARA>With the mounting cost of campaign advertising, parties must be increasingly vulnerable to attempts by substantial donors to exert influence. It appears that the parties are themselves aware of this, and various proposals for increased public funding, limits on allowable spending, free television time, and bans on television advertising, have all been mooted. </PARA>
<PARA>This risk applies throughout Australia. No political party or government is quarantined from that risk. Steps must be taken to protect the integrity of our systems of government. The Bill before the House today will take such steps. It will contain measures designed to repel the threat of corruption to public order in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not wait until the problem becomes unmanageable. Action must be taken now to sanitise the electoral system. Nor will the Government take action which only partially addresses the problem. The Joint Standing Committee identified the need to expose the system of electoral funding by enhanced disclosure provisions, but equally identified the need to control the burgeoning cost of political campaigning. As Commissioner Roden has stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . as increasingly vast sums of money become necessary for successful political campaigns, the problem will grow. It must be faced and dealt with firmly and openly . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The majority report of the Joint Standing Committee considered a number of options for addressing the risks of funding political campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee reviewed the present disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. These provisions and those of similar effect in the New South Wales Act are the only laws requiring disclosure of political donations throughout Australia. The lack of a national uniform legislative scheme which comprehensively covers all political donations in respect of all levels of government is lamentable. The Government will propose to the State and Territory governments that the lack of such a system be remedied as quickly as possible. In doing so, the Government will put forward the comprehensive disclosure laws proposed in this Bill as the basis for uniform legislation. The Government welcomes the commitment to such laws already made by the West Australian and Victorian governments and sees this as a positive start to this process. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for full disclosure laws is universally accepted. Disclosure will remove the taint of suspicion from legitimate campaign donations which are at present not required to be disclosed. As Commissioner Roden said in his report:</PARA>
<PARA>To allow large secret donations to political parties or candidates is but one step removed from allowing large secret deals with political parties or candidates. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee considered a number of options for dealing with the problem of potential corruption stemming from campaign costs. The Committee recommended that a system of free time for party political broadcasts be offered to registered parties and candidates by broadcasters who would provide air time free of charge. The proposal was strongly criticised at the time it was released. Many of the criticisms had more to do with the protection of self-interest than a fair assessment of the proposal. The Government has rejected the proposal because it believes that the allocation of time to parties would be inequitable and administratively impracticable. Free time would unfairly advantage the major political and incumbent parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also rejected the proposal for a limitation on advertising expenditure by political parties. Experience, both overseas, particularly in the United States with so-called political action committees, and domestically, through such notorious examples as the community polling organisation in New South Wales, has shown how easy it is for political parties to conduct campaigns through front organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's preferred course for dealing with the problems associated with campaign costs is to prohibit the broadcasting of political advertisements. The Government has not taken this step lightly. The competing claims of the various options were considered. The Government opted for a ban on political advertising because it is the fairest and most effective means of addressing the problem of burgeoning campaign costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed ban is aimed directly at the single greatest factor in campaign costs. The exorbitant cost of broadcast advertising precludes the majority of the community and all but the major political parties and large corporate interests from paid access to the airwaves. The Government carefully considered the implications of the proposals on the right to freedom of speech, both as it is generally accepted and specifically under international law. In respect of the latter, article 19 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a party, requires parties to guarantee the right of freedom of expression. This right is not absolute. </PARA>
<PARA> Article 19 (3) of the covenant provides that the right may be limited in the interests of public order. The prohibition of the broadcasting of political advertising is directed squarely at preventing potential corruption and undue influence of the political process. The Government is satisfied that the proposals are a necessary and proportionate response to this threat and do not constitute a breach of our international obligations. Of course the ban will not affect the expression of opinion or information through broadcasting of material other than advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I turn now to the text of the Bill. The Bill inserts a new part III into the Broadcasting Act 1942. The part contains a framework for the proposed ban on the broadcasting of political advertising. Part III is structured in a way which makes it clear that the several provisions of the amendments are to operate to the extent that the Constitution allows. The present Government of New South Wales has indicated that it will challenge the proposed ban to the extent of its application to State governments and elections. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has been drafted with the possibility of such a challenge in mind. It also reflects the different nature of election and non-election periods. During the former, when the heightened attention given to political issues creates more intense pressure on broadcasters to give access to politicians and parties, the Bill prohibits certain government advertising and does not provide for the same exemptions from the ban as those which operate in non-election periods. </PARA>
<PARA> The ban will prohibit broadcasters from carrying paid or unpaid advertising which includes political matter. It will extend to such advertisements, whether run by broadcasters on their own behalf or on behalf of others. The latter step is designed to ensure that broadcasters do not flout the ban. The ban extends to elections for all levels of Government, including by-elections and Commonwealth referendums to alter the Constitution. Were the ban to apply only to Federal elections, the problems created by the need of political parties to raise huge sums necessary to advertise during an election campaign would be only partially addressed. As the Joint Standing Committee report concluded, parties would merely transfer funds to exempt campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Bill, political advertising means advertising containing political matter. This definition of political matter is used throughout the Bill and is based upon that of electoral matter in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The provision has been modified slightly to fit the context of the Bill. Fundamentally, political matter is defined to include matter which is likely, or intended, to affect voting at an election or matter which includes an implied or explicit reference to an issue in an election. It would not include, for example, the ordinary fundraising activities of a charity. </PARA>
<PARA> Under section 95 of the Bill the ban is to operate at all times and includes the prohibition of advertisements containing matter likely to affect voters at, or matter before voters in, any election whensoever held. Sections 95b, 95c and 95d operate during specific Commonwealth, Territory, State and local government elections. Under these sections, the ban prohibits the broadcasting of advertisements containing political matter in respect of the relevant election period. The Government has been particularly vigilant to ensure that under the Bill incumbent governments do not enjoy an advantage over their opponents through the use of government advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, government advertising which falls within the general prohibition on political advertising will be banned. Secondly, during a Commonwealth election period, the broadcast of all Commonwealth government departmental or authority advertising other than that containing exempt matter will be prohibited. A similar ban upon Territory government advertising will be imposed during Territory elections. The extended ban is designed to ensure that Government advertisements which arguably may marginally fall outside the definition of political matter cannot be screened during election periods. Whilst it is currently Commonwealth government practice to administratively apply such a ban, the Bill will ensure that the ban has the force of law in the future. The ban is confined to political advertisements, as commonly understood. </PARA>
<PARA> The broadcast of bona fide news reports, current affairs programs and documentaries which contain or relate to political issues will not be affected by the legislation. Broadcasters and members of the public will continue to be free to use these forums and others, such as talkback radio, to express views on political issues. Editorial comment by broadcasters will not be impeded by the ban on advertising. The delivery of information to the public, including the print handicapped, by such means will be unimpeded. </PARA>
<PARA> The airwaves of Australia belong to all Australians. Currently, access to those airwaves by means of paid advertising through commercially licensed operators is restricted to those few in the community who can afford to pay the prohibitively high cost. In respect of the broadcast of political advertisements, the chief users of the airwaves are the major political parties who at the 1990 Federal election expended over $15m on broadcasting advertisements. During the same election period, all other non-political party expenditure on such advertisements amounted to $1.7m. Of that figure, over $1.1m was expended by the logging industry, while the Australian Conservation Foundation spent just over $25,000 on broadcasting activity. These figures illustrate the inherent inequity in the presentation of political debate through electronic advertising. The reality is that only the rich can get their message across by such means. </PARA>
<PARA> As one political commentator has described the current situation, `A system in which money decides who is and who isn't heard renders meaningless the right of free speech'. The ban will thus remove the privileged status of those few in the community who can afford to pay the high costs of broadcast advertising to express their political views, at the exclusion of the vast majority who cannot afford to do so. It will place all in the community on an equal footing so far as the use of the public airwaves is concerned. It must also be remembered that television advertising leads to packaging of important political debates and information into 30-second or even 15-second messages, widely criticised for their trivialising of content and concentration on image making. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the bulk of expenditure by political parties on advertising occurs during elections, the proposed ban will operate at all times. If the ban were restricted to election periods, parties and others who buy political advertising would run campaigns outside the ban period. The problems associated with a need to raise the huge sums necessary to fund campaigns would remain but apply to mid-term and pre-election period campaigns which could be expected to take on the importance presently attached to election campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for certain matter to be exempted from the effect of the ban. This is primarily non-contentious matter and includes announcements concerning civil or military disorder, information relating to the conduct of and promoting participation in an election or referendum, the promotion of services and programs of the ABC and SBS, certain non-contentious Government administrative announcements and advertisements for goods and services which do not contain any political matter and which are run on behalf of Government departments or authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> A further exemption which applies in all but election periods is made for advertisements which concern matters of public health. This would include AIDS prevention and anti-drug abuse advertisements, but not advertisements which refer to public health systems. The voluntary broadcast of party policy launches during election periods will not be prevented by the ban. Such launches will be restricted to no more than half an hour in length and may be broadcast on only one occasion. The provisions of the Act requiring equal treatment of political parties will continue to apply to the broadcast of launches. </PARA>
<PARA> The use by politicians of `free broadcast time' for party political broadcasts will be prevented by the ban. This will ensure that politicians do not enjoy access to the airwaves which is not available to other members of the community. This will include the provision of `free time' by the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill ensures that all broadcasters, whether public or private, are treated in the same way. Apart from applying the ban to the ABC, the Bill will not affect the ABC's power to determine to what extent and in what manner it shall broadcast political or controversial matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will be able to receive complaints regarding alleged breaches of the ban provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the urgent nature of complaints of alleged breaches of the ban, for example during election periods, the Tribunal will be required to deal with complaints or information about alleged breaches forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Tribunal and any individual with legal standing will be empowered to seek an order from the Federal Court to enforce or prevent a likely breach of the provisions of the new part. </PARA>
<PARA> The ban is expected in practice to operate chiefly as a deterrent. It will be an offence under the Broadcasting Act for a broadcaster to broadcast an advertisement contrary to the ban. Compliance with the ban will also be a condition of every licence granted under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the part will also be conditions of licences and permits issued under the Radio Communications Act 1983 thus extending the ban to video and audio entertainment and information services, such as Sky channel. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I have already referred to the inadequacies of the current disclosure requirements in the Electoral Act. These were perhaps best summarised metaphorically by the former Commonwealth Electoral Commissioner, Dr Colin Hughes, in his evidence before the Joint Standing Committee:</PARA>
<PARA>What happens under the present arrangements would be that the recipients of donations stand to one side of the table with three walnut shells, only one of which is transparent if it is labelled `a donation to the next Federal election'. There are two other walnut shells which are completely opaque and it is up to us to guess which walnut shell the pea is under. If it is not under the transparent one, they merely say, `wrong', and that is the end of the matter . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The majority report of the Joint Standing Committee accepted that the matter referred to by Dr Hughes should not end there and made sweeping recommendations to overcome the deficiencies in the present law. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government agrees with the Committee that these changes must be made and electoral financing in Australia should be open and transparent. </PARA>
<PARA> The reforms proposed in the amendments to the funding and disclosure provisions of the Electoral Act will bring that transparency to the electoral process. It will enable the Electoral Commission to investigate and expose any avoidance of the disclosure obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> The public is entitled to be assured that the parties and candidates which make up the government or opposition of the day are free of undue or improper outside influence. The present system of disclosure cannot and does not engender complete confidence. The Government will restore confidence to the system by exposing who pays the piper. </PARA>
<PARA> The Electoral Act will be amended to require political parties to fully disclose all income, expenditure and debts. Parties will be required to lodge annual returns with the Australian Electoral Commission within four weeks of the end of each financial year in addition to the existing requirement for the lodging of returns in respect of electoral expenditure following elections. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a party is required to disclose a gift as income in an annual return, details of the identity of the donor will not be required where the donation or total of all of the donations given to the party by the donor is less than $1,000. The sum total of such gifts will need to be disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government had earlier announced that the limits of gifts of $1,000 for political parties and $200 for gifts to candidates under which full details of the identity of the donor would be increased to $1,500 and $300, in finalising the legislation the Government has chosen to retain the present limits to ensure the disclosure requirements are not relaxed under the new proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> Tougher disclosure requirements will also be placed upon third parties who participate in the political process. </PARA>
<PARA> Third parties include persons or organisations other than registered political parties or candidates who incur electoral expenditure, including the making of a gift to a political party or candidate. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently third parties are required to disclose such expenditure but need not do so where the expenditure relates to an election which does not occur during the specific reporting period. This has enabled third parties to avoid the reporting requirements. The Joint Standing Committee identified this problem and recommended that the loophole be removed. The Bill removes this loophole by requiring disclosure of electoral expenditure in respect of any election. </PARA>
<PARA> Third parties will also be required to disclose any gift made to a political party or part thereof, regardless of whether the gift is for electoral or other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission will also be required to publish a list of all third parties in its reports on the operation of the funding and disclosure sections of the Act. This will ensure that the identity of those participating in the political process will be publicly available in keeping with the commitment to full disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is determined that the Electoral Commission should be armed with the powers necessary to enforce the disclosure requirements of the Act. The Commission has for some time had the power to conduct investigations where it has reasonable grounds to believe that an offence relating to the disclosure provisions of the Act has been committed. The provisions amount to the ability to conduct a spot audit of a political party or a candidate's financial affairs to ensure the Act has not been breached. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Commission retains confidence in the efficacy of such compliance audits as an enforcement tool, the current provisions require the Commission to have reasonable grounds to believe that a breach of the Act may have occurred in order to activate an audit. This has prevented the Commission from conducting random audits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's amendments will remove the deficiencies in the Act and provide the Electoral Commission with the power to subject political and third parties to random audits to ensure compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Act. The Commission will be able to do so at any time and will not be required to have a reasonable ground to suspect an offence under the Act has been committed. Political and third parties will be subject to a random audit at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Commission will be required to publish a record of all spot audits in the reports on the funding and disclosure provision of the Act which it is currently required to publish following each election. The Commission will also be empowered to issue such supplementary reports as it considers necessary to comply with its obligation to report all spot audits. </PARA>
<PARA> As some third parties are not established solely for political purposes and their financial affairs may only relate in a marginal way to their involvement in the political process, the Commission will be prevented from publishing any details obtained during a third party spot audit other than details of an offence under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has moved, through the Bill, to recognise and protect the rights of donors. The Bill will make it an offence under section 327 to interfere or hinder with the free exercise by a person of his or her right to make a gift to a political party. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Act to provide that registered political parties and candidates are entitled to the same level of public funding per Senate vote as is provided for a vote for the House of Representatives. Under the public funding provisions inserted in the Act in 1984 a Senate vote is currently valued at one half or two-thirds of a vote for the House of Representatives depending upon the type of Senate election held. These provisions discriminate against smaller parties who concentrate upon Senate campaigns and fail to sufficiently acknowledge the costs of such campaigns. The Bill will place all votes on the same footing. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments are also made to the Electoral Act and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act to ensure that the result of an election or referendum cannot be overturned by the Court of Disputed Returns by reason only of a breach of the Broadcasting Act or the Radiocommunications Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, the Bill represents a comprehensive response to the threat of corruption and undue influence which hangs over the political process. In the terms of the Joint Standing Committee report these proposals minimise the risks created by the need to fund political campaigns. The importance of sanitising our electoral process and of restoring public confidence in it has never been more paramount. The potential risk in not doing so will not diminish in the future. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendments moved by my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) during the committee stage of the debate. I also want to point out to the Government the enormity of the problem it has created as a result of its economic policies. Almost one million people are unemployed in this country. I have been trying for many months to obtain the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) figures for my own electorate. In fact, for eight months I have been attempting to get the Government to address the problem of the unemployed in my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After writing a number of letters to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and after having no response to numerous letters asking for those unemployment figures from the Commonwealth Employment Service, and after putting a question on the Notice Paper and receiving absolutely no response, I then proceeded to make the matter the subject of a freedom of information request of the Minister. Finally, after eight months, I was able to obtain the figures. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give you, Mr Deputy Chairman, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), an indication of the enormity of the problem which the Government faces and which it has created. In the Bendigo area there are 7,163 people registered as unemployed. This is 15 per cent of the work force. In fact, in the 18 to 44 years grouping, 5,719 people are unemployed; 79 per cent of the total unemployed are within that group. In Maryborough, in another part of my electorate, the unemployment figure is 1,294-running at 18 per cent. Again, in the 18 to 44 years grouping 913 people are unemployed. In fact, the unemployed in this age group comprise 71 per cent of that total unemployment figure. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that we have these programs-Job Search and Newstart-being introduced by the Government and the fact these social security Bills are being debated cognately gives me an opportunity to ask the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister responsible for employment in this country to address the enormity of this problem. I do not think the Minister realises its enormity. I understand that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) will be in the city of Maryborough on Saturday to launch a program known as the Maryborough rural enterprise scheme. I look forward to the Federal Minister and the State Minister, the Hon. Carolyn Hogg, being present at that launching so that they can address the question and talk to the people of Maryborough who are experiencing this massive increase in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> I was quite shocked when I tried to get hold of the figures from the Commonwealth Employment Service. Before one can really tackle the problems which these Bills seek to address, one has to understand just how large the problem is. When I sought to obtain the CES figures, I was, firstly, granted my request under freedom of information. However, I was told that the statistics for the numbers of people registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service awaiting placement-not seasonally adjusted figures, but people who have actually registered for employment-were not a true measure of unemployment. I accept the first two reasons that I was given. The first reason was:</PARA>
<PARA>coverage of jobseekers can vary over time as a result of changes in labour market conditions, variations in administrative procedures and the effects of Government policy, especially the impact of changes in labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA>I can understand that that could be the basis for variation. I make allowances for that. The second reason was:</PARA>
<PARA>some job seekers remain registered with the CES although they have either independently found employment or left the labour force but have not notified the CES. </PARA>
<PARA>The third reason I was given was:</PARA>
<PARA>not all persons seeking employment register with the CES for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, two of the reasons given could result in variation to the figures and perhaps could reduce the number of people registered as seeking placement by the CES. However, the third reason-that not all persons seeking employment register with the CES for assistance-would have meant that the figure would have been even higher than the 15 per cent in Bendigo and the 18 per cent in Maryborough. That enormous problem will be an ongoing one for the Government because I do not believe that we have reached the bottom of the current recession. I am sure that the Minister would concur with that view. </PARA>
<PARA> I then tried to obtain from the Department of Employment Education and Training figures on an ongoing basis for each quarter. However, I was told that these figures would not be available to me on an ongoing basis even though my colleague the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) was able to obtain those figures on an ongoing basis from the Department through a freedom of information request in Western Australia. We now find that the Government is discriminating between States and not allowing those figures to be made available to me in Victoria. I have gone back to the Department seeking those figures on an ongoing basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I paid my $30 to obtain the figures. I was told by the Department that I could not have that $30 reimbursed because the figures were not in the public interest. I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary at the table that those figures are very much in the public interest. In fact, I wrote to the Department on that freedom of information request and cited the areas in which there is interest. In fact, the figures I was able to obtain for the March quarter were published in the Bendigo Advertiser, which has an extensive circulation throughout the Bendigo Federal electorate. They were also broadcast on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio throughout western Victoria and on radio station 3BO Bendigo and were published in the Maryborough Advertiser. Those figures are very much in the public interest. I have requested that the Department make those figures available to me on an ongoing basis and that the $30 for the freedom of information request be reimbursed. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly wanted to address these matters following the moving of the amendments by the honourable member for Dawson and to support him during the committee stage of the debate. I put to the Parliamentary Secretary at the table that the Government has created this problem. The Government has to wear it and it has to address the question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I sometimes wonder at the somewhat ghoulish behaviour, I guess one could describe it as, of members of the Opposition, who seem to want to make political capital here, day in and day out, out of the unemployment figures. We know how important the problem is. Honourable members opposite do not need to come here and tell us the figures all the time; we know what the figures are. We are trying to do something about the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What does the Opposition expect us to do? Does it expect us not to worry about trying to implement labour reforms, trying to make sure that we bring in more training places and giving more resources so that we can find people jobs when the jobs do become available? There is no question but that we will get out of this recession. There are already signs that we are getting out of the recession, and there will be jobs available. I cannot see the rationale behind the Opposition coming here, expecting us simply to put our heads in the sand and pretend that the whole thing will go away. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that it will not go away. We know it is there. It will go away eventually, and it will be helped by the sorts of reforms that the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill and the Newstart program will implement. I know that the Government will not be doing what the Opposition does, and it does not wish to. As I say, after nine months the Opposition simply wants to get rid of the problem. After nine months, the unemployed will go on special benefit. I do not know who decides the criteria for this special benefit because, yet again, the Opposition has not spelt it out. </PARA>
<PARA> Why not be constructive? I say this to the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and to all of his colleagues who keep rubbishing us in this place every day. They do not need to remind us. I know that they are trying to get some political capital; I guess that is their job. But I ask them to be positive and constructive; I ask them not to tell us what we already know, but to tell us how they think we could fix it up. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not accept any of the Opposition's amendments. Amendment No. 1 alters the qualification conditions for Job Search allowance, so that JSA can only be paid to a person who is over 18 if the person has been registered by the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) as having been unemployed for less than nine months. The measures of the existing Newstart strategy for those unemployed for 12 months or more-that is, the long term unemployed-have proved effective and the new arrangements build on this experience. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Newstart program for the long term unemployed was introduced in February 1989, there were 160,000 long term unemployment beneficiaries, comprising 39 per cent of all unemployment benefit (UB) recipients. By May 1990, the number and proportion of long term UB recipients had fallen to 113,600 and 28 per cent respectively. Over this period, the number of long term unemployment beneficiaries decreased by 29 per cent compared to the decrease of 10 per cent in total beneficiary numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> Since February 1990, the number of UB recipients has increased by 196,600, or 49 per cent, while the number of long term recipients has increased by only 16,600, or 14 per cent. This rate of increase has been slower than occurred in the early part of the 1982-83 recession, when the number of long term unemployment beneficiaries increased by more than 50 per cent between February 1982 and February 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Twelve months unemployment is generally accepted internationally, as instanced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development definition of `long term unemployment', the point at which intensive assistance is required. There is a need to focus resources on those most in need-that is, the long term unemployed. A lower duration would spread resources more thinly and make them less effective. However, it should not be forgotten that these clients with special disadvantages will be given access to program places in the first six months. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 2 is a consequential amendment to the amendment proposed to the qualification conditions for JSA. My comments in relation to amendment No. 1 apply similarly to this amendment. Amendment No. 3 seeks to ensure that a person would not be able to avoid the effect of the liquid assets test by transferring assets to another person within three months prior to lodging a claim for unemployment benefit or sickness benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the creativity of the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) in resurrecting an amendment which was proposed by the Opposition, and which was debated and defeated, in the Budget sittings last year. The amendment does not take into account proposed new subsection 14a (3) as it does not omit that provision and refers to unemployment benefits which will not exist on the day the Bill commences. It also refers to sickness benefit, which has nothing to do with the content of the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment as drafted is at best a nonsense. Further, the proposed amendment is draconian in nature. Most people would not be able to forecast with sufficient certainty three months in advance the date on which they will become unemployed. For the sake of marginal savings to the Commonwealth, the proposed amendment would catch innocent people who, in good faith, have made relatively small gifts of money to, for example, parents, children or charities some months before becoming unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 6 are consequential amendments to amendment No. 1. My comments in relation to amendment No. 1 apply to these amendments. Amendment No. 7 inserts a new section 542 into the Social Security Act 1991. The new provision would compel a person in receipt of JSA to attend a counselling session after being on that payment for six months. If the person fails to attend the Department of Social Security (DSS) or the CES for counselling and advice, the person ceases to qualify for JSA until he or she does. </PARA>
<PARA> Under administrative guidelines which will be applied to JSA, both the CES and the Department will interview a person and review entitlement for various periods in the JSA phase. Each JSA recipient will be interviewed by the CES during the first three months of unemployment. DSS will then review a person's entitlement at the three-month stage. At six months the CES will interview each recipient to explain what labour market programs and other CES assistance is available to the client. An amendment along the lines proposed by the honourable member for Dawson is unnecessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just respond quickly to the comment of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) about ghoulish behaviour. I believe that it is not befitting for him to make that comment when Australia is faced with an unemployment level at which one in every 10 persons who seek work is out of a job because of a deliberately engineered recession `that we had to have'. I think it ill behoves the Parliamentary Secretary to say this, particularly as this very important debate has been interrupted tonight. Tonight the Government brought in a Bill about advertising, the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, which means that issue had precedence over the unemployed and their future.

<PARA> (8) Clause 7, pages 56-110, omit proposed Part 2.12. </PARA>
<PARA>Possibly I will only repeat precisely what was said in speaking to the first six proposed Opposition amendments, because we believe that after the period of the Job Search allowance has been completed-and we would have liked that to be nine months-what is required is an opportunity for reassessment as far as that period is concerned. Again I go back to say that our own economic statement of 1989 was quite precise in this: the unemployment benefit was to be dropped and replaced with a special benefit where each individual would come under a special scrutiny and would progress from that point onwards. We believe in a better sense and purpose in trying to get jobs for people who are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> We admit that after 18 months the position has deteriorated to the extent that there is high unemployment among our youth. I think that has already been mentioned by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), particularly in his statistics. I think that would be uniform right around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had released today the figure of 9.9 per cent unemployment. We take no pleasure whatsoever from that figure. The Parliament Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) did say earlier that the light is at the end of the tunnel, that we are coming out of the recession. It was put to me today that the only indicator that the Government can give for that is the inflation rate; it has put that as the criterion for our coming out of the recession. I say to the Government that the inflation rate is bound to fall during a recession, when the real inflation rate is still high, but it is subsidised in its own way by businesses going broke and accounts not being paid. Obviously the inflation rate will not be a real indicator that the recession is at an end. </PARA>
<PARA> The objective, particularly in terms of this legislation, is to do something positive for the unemployed. We believe that the omission of this section from the Act would require that incentive, that intervention, that counselling that is required to get Australia back on its feet. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not accept amendment (6) to omit proposed part 2.12, that is, the module which would provide for Newstart. Such a proposal of course is to be expected from the Opposition. All the evidence from the debate on the Bill was that its strategy would be to move people quickly from unemployment benefit to a special benefit. What would this achieve? As far as the Opposition is concerned, perhaps it would be a novel way of disguising unemployment numbers. They would be tucked away on special benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the client is concerned, it would do nothing. Putting a person on a special benefit would not help that person to enhance job skills, for example. As a Government we are promoting an active strategy. At best the Opposition is being fairly heartless and inactive.

At the end of the day, every time we get a good figure, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), in his whingeing style says, `That is not good enough', et cetera. Frankly, all I am saying is that I expect honourable members opposite, as the Opposition, to try to make as much political capital as they can out of bad figures; but sometimes they could be constructive, particularly when we are trying to be constructive with this sort of legislation.

<PARA>(10) Clause 7, page 57, lines 5 and 6, omit ``12 months'', substitute ``9 months''. </PARA>
<PARA>(11) Clause 7, page 59, after proposed subsection 598 (1) insert the following subsection:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `(1a) Where:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a person disposed of liquid assets of the person within 3 months before lodging a claim for unemployment benefit or sickness benefit; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the person received no consideration, or inadequate consideration, in money or money's worth; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) apart from the disposition, this section would have applied to the person;</PARA>
<PARA>this section applies to the person as if the disposition had not been made.'.''</PARA>
<PARA>(12) Clause 7, page 61, lines 12-26, omit proposed subsections 599 (2) and (3). </PARA>
<PARA>(13) Clause 7, page 65, line 11, at the end of proposed subsection 605 (1) add the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``within 8 weeks of the person having commenced to receive a newstart allowance''. </PARA>
<PARA>(14) Clause 7, page 66, line 25, omit ``the Secretary is satisfied, because of the person's failure to'', substitute ``because of the person's failure, without good reason to''. </PARA>
<PARA>To be consistent in connection with all the amendments that we have moved, Nos 9 and 10 reduce the period to the nine months that we were seeking before, and for the same reasons. The amendments were moved at this stage for the sake of consistency. As I said before, the Opposition in the Senate will be very vigorously pursuing these amendments to get a satisfactory outcome. I mention that for consistency. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 11 comes back to the same reason about liquid assets and the deprivation of these assets voluntarily by a person within three months. I listened to the comments of the Parliamentary Secretary (Mr Sciacca) in this connection that perhaps there would be some disposition made which could not have been forecast. I must agree there is some validity in that, in that in these times we do have people who are losing jobs with very little notice. I think we had the Toyota situation today of 400 jobs being lost. So that is acknowledged. I would have thought the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) would have taken this opportunity to close a loophole where there has been an obvious fraud intended in this regard. I would suggest that this is not being frivolous in any way whatsoever, as was suggested. We believe there is some merit in it. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to amendment No. 12, this one has its basis in section 599 (1). It is precisely to put into action the type of thing the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) was speaking of before. In other words, we would seek to delete subparagraphs 2 and 3 because they depend on Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) data, which has been shown to be notoriously faulty. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bendigo was too humble to have read into this debate the particular question he asked the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services on 15 April at Hansard page 2637:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) Will he provide localised figures for the actual (a) percentages and (b) numbers of (i) males and (ii) females actively seeking employment who are registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) at (A) Bendigo and (B) Maryborough, Vic. offices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I admire the honourable member's perseverance-and I also admire him for his luck in that he got an answer. The Minister responded in this regard, and I think it is very interesting. Remember, this is the data in which and these are the people through which it is expected that paragraph 599 would be consummated. These are the comments of the Minister:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Employment Service collects data on numbers of unemployed awaiting placement at local CES office level (local UAP) for internal management purposes only. The data is not released because it is neither an accurate measure of unemployment nor a reliable indicator of changes in unemployment. General release of UAP data would involve an undue use of Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) resources in preparation of material and responses to inquiries, yet it would provide no additional reliable information on the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a tremendous admission. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the CES and are still listed as possibly requiring assistance, but unavoidably it includes many who no longer require this assistance. It is certainly not a measure of the number of people `actively seeking employment'.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The inaccuracies and distortions in the data are especially significant at the local level. </PARA>
<PARA>We are suggesting that the registration by CES should be confined to subparagraph (1) of section 599, and that is why we seek the deletion of subparagraphs (2) and (3). </PARA>
<PARA> In clause 13, in changing the period to eight weeks, we are seeking to address the fact that the Newstart program does depend on an agreement. The Act itself indicates that an agreement is perhaps not absolutely necessary, and there has been some indication by the people involved-the Australian Council of Social Service and others-about the terms of that agreement. We are suggesting that if, within eight weeks of commencing to receive Newstart, people do not put in an application, it should be suggested that they come to the CES for further advice so that they can get that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that two months is a reasonable time for people to activate that agreement and show that they are prepared to enter into a scheme of intervention and get assistance within that program. I believe that what we are suggesting is reasonable-that the secretary must require the person to enter into such an agreement within eight weeks of the person commencing to receive Newstart. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 14 concerns section 607 (b). Instead of saying `the Secretary is satisfied, because of the person's failure to', we seek to substitute `because of the person's failure, without good reason'. I believe that the word `to' should go in at the end. It was an omission, as I mentioned last night, because of the haste in dealing with this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes the amendments. The effect of amendment No. 9 is to change the qualification conditions for Newstart allowance so that a person is qualified for Newstart if the person has been receiving the Job Search allowance for not less than nine months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have already addressed the nine months issue in my comments on amendment No. 1. I would also add that long term unemployment is not necessarily measured by time on an income support payment. In this regard there is a difference in the level of assistance required by a person who has been unemployed and receiving the Job Search allowance for 12 months, and a person who has been registered as unemployed by the CES for 12 months without necessarily having received income support for the entirety of that period. It is when a person has been unemployed for 12 months that extensive intervention of the kind available under the Newstart program is required to assist the person to compete effectively in the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as amendment No. 10 is concerned, it is consequential upon the changes proposed by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) to the qualification conditions for the Newstart allowance. My comments in relation to amendment No. 1 apply similarly to this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 11 applies to the liquid assets test provision as it applies to the Newstart allowance. It is the same as that proposed in amendment No. 3, and my comments in relation to this amendment are the same as for amendment No. 3. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed amendment No. 12 seeks to omit subsections 599 (2) and (3). Subsection 599 (2) qualifies the operation of subsection 599 (1) in that, where the secretary disregards a person's failure to register with the CES owing to circumstances beyond the person's control, the person is taken to have remained registered with the CES during that period for the purpose of qualification for a Newstart allowance. This provision ensures that a person is not disadvantaged by being denied the extensive assistance available under the Newstart allowance because of unforeseen circumstances beyond the client's control. It would be inequitable, for example, to penalise a person whose registration at the CES has lapsed for a short time because a flood prevented the person from attending a CES office. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsection 599 (3) enables a person's registration with the CES to lapse for up to 13 weeks without the person losing qualification for Newstart allowance. The effect of this provision is to encourage persons receiving Newstart allowance to take on short term work to broaden their skills base without adversely affecting their entitlement to the Newstart allowance at the completion of the work. Similarly, if a person attempts unsuccessfully to resume study and the attempt lasts less than 13 weeks, the person remains qualified for Newstart allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 13 would provide that a Newstart activity agreement must be drawn up within eight weeks of a person having commenced receipt of the Newstart allowance. This amendment would introduce an unnecessary element of inflexibility into the administration of Newstart activity agreements. The Bill already provides that written Newstart activity agreements are a mandatory condition of qualification for a Newstart allowance. It is anticipated that most clients will have an agreement before eight weeks in normal circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing to be gained from imposing time limits on the CES and the client in negotiating these agreements. The imposition of such time constraints, particularly in the months following the introduction of the Newstart activity agreement, would only lead to bulk processing of agreements and additional unnecessary stress on clients. In any event, flexibility in relation to time may be needed so that a client's needs and capacities can be adequately assessed by the CES, and the CES and the client have adequate time to negotiate a tailor made agreement. This consideration is particularly relevant when dealing with clients who live in remote areas, who do not have ready access to CES or Department of Social Security offices and who have limited job and course opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 14 suggests that section 607 of the Bill should provide that if a client has good reason for failing to negotiate an agreement, the client should not be taken to have failed to negotiate an agreement. As currently drafted, section 607 provides that if a client is unreasonably delaying entering into an agreement by failing to attend negotiation of an agreement, to respond to correspondence about the agreement or to agree to the terms of the agreement proposed by the CES or otherwise, then the person is taken to have failed to enter into an agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> In assessing whether a client has unreasonably delayed entering into an agreement, the reasons a person gives for the failure are a relevant consideration. If the CES acts unreasonably in cancelling a person's payment, because of a failure by the person to enter into a Newstart activity agreement, then appeal rights are available to the person. In considering the reasonableness of the decision, the relevant review bodies would certainly take into account any reasons the person may have for having failed to negotiate an agreement. It is ludicrous to suggest that the CES would not do the same, given the reasonableness requirement built into the provision and the right of review available to the person. </PARA>

<PARA>As mentioned before, paragraph 661a (ii) in clause 8 suggests that a person who has been registered for at least 12 months by the Commonwealth Employment Service is in an `allowance category'. We say again that the CES is an unreliable source of data, as has already been demonstrated. The amendment sought to say that the person had been receiving the Job Search allowance or a Newstart allowance benefits, that being something very positive that would be activated through the Department of Social Security, which apparently is in a better position to gauge these things than the CES. It is for consistency that we are moving that amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This clause has the effect of adding subsection 251(1B) of the Act to the list of provisions which are not reviewable by the SSAT. Subsection 251(1B) allows the Minister to give, vary or revoke directions to the Secretary relating to the waiver of recovery of debts. Such directions may not extend to the Secretary's related power to write off debts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When subsection 251(1B) was inserted into the Act in 1988, the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee suggested that the provision should be subject to disallowance. This suggestion was not taken up by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The position on the general question of review of subsection 251(1B) power remains unchanged and the amendment made by clause 19 is really just a logical progression of the 1988 decision to make subsection 251(1B) not subject to disallowance in Parliament. It is necessary that the directions issued by the Minister under this provision are of a binding nature to avoid difficulties in reconciling decisions made by review bodies with departmental policy on effective debt management and control. The directions only go to the criteria to be applied when waiving a debt rather than, for example, outlining cases where waiver is barred. </PARA>
<PARA> The system which was in place before subsection 251(1B) was enacted was based on administrative criteria flowing from those issued by the Minister for Finance to delegates making decisions on waiver under the Audit Act 1901. Those criteria, which were in line with those applying in most other Commonwealth departments and instrumentalities, were undermined over time by varying administrative review decisions. The Government believes that review bodies should not be free to operate in this area according to principles of their own devising and therefore the Minister's directions under subsection 251(1B) should not be subject to review. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in the Senate during Question Time Senator Collins, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, answered a dorothy dix question put forward by one of his back bench Senate colleagues. It was in relation to waterfront reform. Over the last year or so, since Senator Collins took up this task of being the Minister for Shipping and, particularly, the Minister responsible for reform of the waterfront, he has been able to answer the question without much accountability in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question that I refer to was about the number of redundancies on the waterfront under the Government's so-called waterfront reform program. Senator Collins claimed that 1,200 waterside workers had been made redundant under the Government's waterfront reform program. This happens to be a very interesting figure. It happens to be wrong, because 1,200 people have not been made redundant under the Government's waterfront reform program. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister chose to deal with the truth and if he chose to deal with facts which are provided by his own Department, he would find that the figure that he has put forward is totally misleading. It is not only misleading but is designed to be deceptive. For example, the figures which are provided by the Government indicate that, rather than 1,200, some 361 people in total have been made redundant on the waterfront under the Government's waterfront reform program as of 18 April this year. The figures also indicate that an extra 11 people are expected to be made redundant by about the end of April this year, just a week or so ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The figure of 1,200 that Senator Collins used in his answer to a dorothy dix question yesterday in the Senate is totally wrong. The true figure is 361. How we come to that figure is interesting. The first set of redundancies on the Australian waterfront under the Government's reform program took place in Cairns at the end of February this year. Some 13 people were made redundant there. </PARA>
<PARA> The second round of redundancies was due to take place following the establishment of an enterprise agreement between National Terminals (Australia) Ltd, one of Australia's largest stevedoring firms, and its employees. That was supposed to have delivered 451 redundancies by the end of March this year. Unfortunately for National Terminals and for the nation, those 451 redundancies were not achieved and there was a shortfall of a bit over 90 people as a consequence of some problems that occurred in the implementation of National Terminals enterprise agreement. As a consequence, the total number comes to 361. </PARA>
<PARA> How Senator Collins derives the figure of 1,200 is interesting. Senator Collins, in his explanation yesterday in Question Time, claimed credit for the redundancy of some 310 gangway watchmen. He claims that this is all part of the Government's waterfront reform program. If the truth be known, as indeed the Government's own departmental figures will provide, gangway watchmen agreed to be made redundant prior to the Government's waterfront reform program. The redundancy of those people was achieved by negotiation between the employers and the unions well and truly before the Government engaged in its waterfront reform program. </PARA>
<PARA> The next group of people that Senator Collins tried to claim credit for through redundancies was some 600 workers who retired from the industry due to normal circumstances. These 600 people retired due to reaching the maximum age for retirement, or through ill health or through death. For Senator Collins to take credit for those people who have died, who have been made sick and can no longer work, or who have reached the maximum retirement age is totally false. It spells very badly for Senator Collins's own ethics in dealing with the truth about waterfront reform. It spells very badly for the whole approach that this Government has taken to the manner in which it has reported the pace of waterfront reform in Australia today. I would hope that Senator Collins would desist from trying to deal out mistruths and misinformation in the Senate during Question Time and focus on the truth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to take up matters referred to briefly by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) the other evening when he took me to task for raising a matter in relation to the Tasmanian Royal Commission into an Attempt to Bribe a Member of the House of Assembly and Other Matters. Let me make it plain that my remarks were not addressed in any way to a call for Gray to resign but rather to draw attention to the hypocritical principle that was addressed to this House on a number of occasions by the Leader of the Federal Opposition (Dr Hewson), who in the case of Burke urged that the proper issue in relation to persons holding high public office is that, where their conduct or reputation is at issue before a commission of inquiry, they ought step aside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I made the obvious point that he was applying one set of standards for his opponents-those in Western Australia, the Labor team-and failing to apply the same stringent standards to those on his own side, having made no comment of any critical nature at all in relation to Gray's decision to remain in office. To that criticism, Hewson's office has said that Gray's involvement was tangential, in much the same way that he says the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) may be tangential to the Western Australian inquiry and that Gray did not hold office of profit under the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, let me briefly dismiss the second objection to the charge of hypocrisy. It is plain that the position of Leader of the Opposition is one of the great constitutional offices of our nation, and to make hairsplitting distinctions of that kind simply is not worthy. I turn to the more substantial objection, that Gray's involvement may have been tangential, and to assess the merit of that point one has to turn to the terms of reference. To repeat elements of those terms of reference, they are as follows: one, the events, facts and circumstances leading to and surrounding the attempt to bribe Cox; two, whether any person or persons other than Rouse or Aloi were involved directly or indirectly; and three, if so, who was involved and what that involvement was, and whether that involvement was improper or unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA> It is central to the task of the commission of inquiry to examine the role, if any, of the then Premier of the State. Gray was a premier whose side had been defeated at an election, holding office in a minority capacity, wounded but still clinging to power. His Government would have been the plain beneficiary of the success of Rouse's criminal scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Already in the inquiry there are two clear matters of conceded impropriety, although Gray is yet to give evidence himself. Firstly, evidence given by his present principal adviser, Tronson, is that Gray took $10,000 in cash from Rouse. It breached the Liberal Party's code of fund raising ethics, no receipt was issued for a roll of $100 bills, and the money was kept at Gray's home and was not passed on to his Party until months after the election. His former deputy, Ray Groom, who resigned from the Party, is said to have regarded this as one of the key reasons for his resignation, and said of it rather delicately to the Royal Commission, more in sorrow than in anger, `I think members should certainly be very cautious about accepting money directly from donors'. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, Gray used front organisations to trick Tasmanians into believing that there was a spontaneous campaign for a second election. The advertisement that was placed in the press was signed, `This advertisement and petition has been organised and paid for by Tasmanians concerned for the future of our State'. In fact it was inserted by an advertising agency at the behest of the Liberal adviser, Mr Tronson, acting on instructions from his boss, Robin Gray. Tronson said that if the Liberal Party had been identified as the instigator of the petition it would have had less impact. Carter, the royal commissioner, described it less delicately as either a deception or a lie. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst Gray has not yet given evidence, there obviously is a miasma of suspicion. I certainly hope that the Royal Commission clears Gray of any direct involvement because it would be a disgrace to our State were it not to do so and many on my side would not regard it as in Gray's character to have participated. Nonetheless, there are elements, I suppose anyone would say, of suspicion. Aloi told Cox that Gray would ring him. Rouse told Aloi that Gray was expecting a call. Gray put forward Cox's name to the Liberal Party as a possible Liberal nominee for the Speaker's position and told his then deputy--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Republic of Armenia within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) is in a virtual state of war, and Armenians are dying at the hands of forces of the Soviet Army and of the neighbouring Republic of Azerbaijan. Fighting has occurred in the mountainous Karabagh region around the town of Kedashen. On the border between the republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia, Armenian villages have been forcibly emptied of their populations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The present conflict has grown out of tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Negorno Karabagh territory within Azerbaijan, which has long supported a mainly Armenian population. It was preceded in 1989 by a pogrom against Armenian residents of the city of Sumgait in Azerbaijan, which led to intervention by Moscow and the declaration of martial law there. However, the origins of this conflict go back much further. They are to be found in religion: the Armenians have probably the world's oldest continuous Christian tradition, while the Azerbaijanis are Moslems. They are to be found in class; historically the Armenians were the merchants of the Caucasus and were prominent in the economy of the Byzantine Empire and later the Ottoman Empire, while the Azerbaijanis have a rural and latterly industrial tradition. </PARA>
<PARA> They are to be found in ideology. The Armenians recently elected a non-communist government under Premier Levan Ter-Petrosian. They are desperate for autonomy from the USSR, while the Azerbaijanis continue to live under orthodox communism and favour the continuation of the Soviet Union. They are to be found in politics: the enormous ethnic diversity and geographical spread of the USSR derives from the Czarist Empire. In the 1920s the Union of Republics was tacked together by Lenin's Commissar for Nationalities, Joseph Stalin, who manipulated the borders of the new republics, particularly Armenia, in order to ensure they remained weak and the central government remained powerful. It was Stalin who relegated the ethnic Armenians of Karabagh to Azerbaijan. </PARA>
<PARA> They are to be found in the Soviet crisis: the Armenian earthquake provided the first evidence of the crisis when the central authorities found themselves unable to deal with the disaster and for the first time opened Soviet territory to international aid agencies. The suffering of the Armenians and the lack of aid from the central government exposed the economic weakness of the Soviet Union, heightened demands for Armenian autonomy and contributed to the present hostility between Armenia and Moscow. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that relations between the Armenians and the Soviets have come to this, as in past times the Soviets were seen as friends and mentors of the Armenians. The ancient Armenian homeland is not in the present Republic of Armenia situated in the Caucasus; it was much further south in the Mount Ararat region of Eastern Anatolia, most of which is now within Turkey. Turkish nationalism deprived the Armenians of their homeland and subjected them to forced deportation and savage oppression, which came to a climax around 1915 during the period of the `Armenian genocide' when possibly as many as a million people died. In contrast to their treatment by the Turks, the early Soviets provided the Armenians with a new state within the USSR. </PARA>
<PARA> After their traumatic experience early this century, very few Armenians remained in Turkey. Many were drawn to the new Soviet Armenian Republic, but others emigrated elsewhere to form a world diaspora of Armenians numbering around four million people. There are many Armenian Australians and within my electorate of North Sydney there is a substantial community. </PARA>
<PARA> With such a history it is hardly surprising that Armenian Australians are so deeply offended by the Prime Minister awarding Australia's highest civil honour, the Companion of the Order of Australia, to Turgut Ozal, the leader of a country which has never made amends or even apologised for its oppression of the Armenian people. The Parliament of Armenia has sought a special session of the USSR's Supreme Soviet to resolve the present crisis. However, the future of the `Soviet Empire' is as much at stake here as the future of Armenia. The Armenians now represent a serious threat to the Union, which President Gorbachev and his centralists will not tolerate. </PARA>
<PARA> Only the world community can help Armenia. I therefore urge the Australian Government to bring the Armenian crisis urgently before the United Nations and to protest formally to the Soviet Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has placed workplace reform high on its agenda for this term in office as part of the micro-economic reform process. Earlier this evening, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) once again homed in on the waterfront, which is his wont, and highlighted that as an area that requires reform. There is no prize for identifying those workplaces in which reform is necessary. The real test comes in determining how that reform can best be implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is instructive to look at the sorts of things which the Opposition, and those on whose behalf it speaks within industry, are using to address this issue. Recently in the Brisbane Courier-Mail of 8 April, the Queensland Confederation of Industry (QCI)-and I am sure that the honourable member for Gilmore would be familiar with it-announced its concerns about the length of time that employees in Australia were working. The newspaper reported:</PARA>
<PARA>Queensland industries would benefit from a return to a 48-hour working week, a Queensland Confederation of Industry spokesman said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>The spokesman was none other than the QCI General Manager, Clive Bubb, who said that weekend penalty rates and paternity and maternity leave should also be eliminated. I read that article a couple of times because I thought that surely there had been a misprint. A 48-hour week is really turning the clock back even further than I anticipated the Opposition's agenda being set. But, in fact, it is a 48-hour week that is suggested. </PARA>
<PARA> I looked to see just how long ago it was that we had a 48-hour week in this country. As this debate comes so soon after May Day, it is appropriate that we should recognise the strides that have been taken by the industrial movement in achieving a reduction in working hours for Australian workers. In fact, the 48-hour week was the standard in 1904, when the Industrial Relations Commission was first established in this country. The very first time that this Parliament set about regulating wages and hours, we had a 48-hour week-not long after the Federation of our country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Confederation of Industry, a major employer body, on whose behalf the members of the Opposition are regularly spokespersons, is advocating a 48-hour week as the standard basis of determining workers' hours in the State of Queensland. No doubt, that would have some currency in some other States of Australia, at least amongst some of the employer groups. </PARA>
<PARA> From what I read in the article, I understand that the Confederation also believes that we should do away with weekend penalty rates and paternity and maternity leave. That is not a view that just the QCI has, because the Opposition has quite expressly endorsed at least that part of the QCI's policy. On 21 February this year, the Courier-Mail referred to comments made by the shadow spokesperson on industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). The paper reported that he said that a coalition government would take steps to remove penalty rates from awards. He is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>We should have a seven day a week 24 hour a day attitude to work. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the approach adopted, not just by the QCI, but also by the shadow spokesperson on industrial relations. We have in tandem an industry organisation advocating a 48-hour week and an Opposition which has formally adopted the proposition that we should also have a 24-hour a day, seven-day a week approach to the basis upon which Australian workers should be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a policy which will, no doubt, incur the wrath of Australian working people throughout the country and, I suspect, the great bulk of fair-minded and progressive employers throughout the country. It is one which will be brought into focus when some of the industrial legislation before the Parliament comes on for discussion. No doubt, as the next 18 to 24 months roll on, it is one which will come into focus in the public arena more than it has to date. I have no doubt that when the people put that policy under some scrutiny, they will reject out of hand the Opposition's approach to industrial relations as being archaic and as literally turning the clock back to the start of this century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak tonight partly because the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has raised an issue tonight with regard to the Tasmanian Royal Commission into an Attempt to Bribe a Member of the House of Assembly and Other Matters. I find it rather incredible that a member of the Australian Labor Party, after the Premier of Tasmania had asked people not to make any comment, would actually make a big splash about this time last week on the television and in the media trying to link Robin Gray, as if he were involved in the same way as Brian Burke is in WA Inc.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was interested to read the editorial in the Mercury on Monday this week commenting on this issue. The editorial is headed, `Gray right not to stand down'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Any parallel between Robin Gray and Brian Burke is tenuous, absolutely tenuous. </PARA>
<PARA>What we know now with regard to Brian Burke is the following: firstly, he made false statements to the police. He put billions of dollars of taxpayers' money at risk and he also neglected to pay tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to the comments of the honourable member for Denison, the position of Robin Gray compared with that of Brian Burke in WA Inc. is quite tangential. The central figure in Western Australia is Brian Burke. The central figure in Tasmania is Edmund Rouse, and that is quite different indeed. I wondered why a member of the Labor Party in Tasmania should go against the expressed wishes of his Premier. It seemed to be quite illogical. Then we realise that $20,000 from WA Inc. was given to the Tasmanian branch of the Australian Labor Party. And that was made public in Tasmania just last Thursday or Friday, at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Herald-Sun on Monday, I noticed the headline `Federal Labor fears stain of Western Australia Inc.'. With these thoughts put together, it became quite obvious that, even though it is a very tangential link that the honourable member was trying to make, he is concerned that the stain of WA Inc. will roll not just around the mainland but around Tasmania as well, and that at the next election he will be collected up in that rolling around. That is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Denison has decided that it is better to get publicity at any cost, because he knows that he is on the skids. He has tried to make a big issue out of this, and he went to the press and said, `I am going to raise it in the Parliament next week'. We have had to wait all week for it to be raised. And what a pathetic performance it was when he tried to defend his raising of this issue in public. </PARA>
<PARA> What we already know about the Tasmanian situation, which the honourable member for Denison did not tell us, is some of the behind-the-camera evidence which has been released concerning what Mr Rouse has said with respect to Mr Gray. He said, `If Mr Gray had known what I was doing, his hair would have stood on end'. </PARA>
<PARA> All the evidence so far indicates that there is no link between the Liberal Party and Mr Rouse. For the honourable member to try to beat this up shows that he is rattled and concerned, as many honourable members in Western Australia and on the mainland of Australia are concerned, about his, and their, future. As I said, there is only one explanation for this: any publicity is good publicity. So he has gone to the press, against the will of his Premier, and instead of putting John Hewson on the mat and to the test, he has put his own Premier to the test of whether he can get the Federal member for Denison to stop commenting on the Royal Commission's activities. So it is up to Michael Field to see whether the honourable member for Denison now actually keeps his peace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to delay the House more than I should, but I am moved to respond to the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) who, unfortunately, has left the chamber, because he came in with a quite remarkable argument about the Opposition's supposed views on industrial relations. It has become a pattern for the Government, and particularly the Ministers during Question Time when they have the advantage of Standing Orders, to deliver 10-minute tirades against the Opposition's supposed views without the Opposition having any chance to respond. But during the adjournment debate we would expect that newly elected members of the House would not indulge in this puerile behaviour. The honourable member for Brisbane came out with a view that, because some employer group had said that we should have a 48-hour week, that was somehow the Opposition's policy, that was what we were arguing and that is the way in which we were saying that the industrial relations system should work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the honourable member for Brisbane does not know how stupid his assertion is and how far from the truth it is, I have very real worries for him. I know that he spoke in the adjournment debate last night for five minutes about his interest in football matches. The honourable member for Brisbane has to know that, if he follows the pattern of the Ministers-such as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), who get up and totally distort an argument in a way which they must know is untrue-he is making an absolute ass of himself. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Brisbane said that, because some employer group somewhere had said that a 48-hour week is the correct way to run things, this is somehow the Opposition's policy. First of all, that is absolutely untrue, and he would have to know that. Secondly, if he believes that is so, he has no idea of how the rest of the world works in relation to industrial relations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (a-c) I am now informed that the figure thought to have been provided by the ABU in fact resulted from a misinterpretation of information provided to my Department at the time of the grant application. This is further explained at 2 below.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a-d) According to documentation provided to me recently by the honourable member, the registered membership of the ABU at 28 March 1989 was 473.</PARA>
<PARA>The membership was thus overstated in my answer. I am informed that there has been a misunderstanding at the time of the grant application between my Department and the ABU. The departmental assessment at the time of the joint application showed a figure of 4500 as the ABU membership. In fact, this was a misinterpretation and actually represents the number of migrant workers covered by the three unions.</PARA>
<PARA>In view of the above, and the fact that the application and the Departmental assessment focused on the proposed target group of 3,500 people, a number not in dispute, no action will be taken. For assessment purposes the membership numbers were not important.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) According to documentation provided by you the membership numbers were as stated in your question. I am now informed that in the Departmental assessment process at the time, membership numbers for the ASE and the FIA were confused with total numbers in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) Central Office considers the recommendations for grants made by State Offices on the basis of the perceived Australia-wide needs. Because there are limited grants available not every State Office recommendation can be supported. Central Office considered that there were other applications which, from a national perspective ranked more highly.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) I am not aware of the reasons for my predecessor's decision.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) My predecessor approved 4 applications which neither State nor Central Offices had recommended.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) (a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Yes. I maintain my decision to refuse to provide the information requested for the reason given in my answer to question No. 58.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The actual program of work to be undertaken was developed from the proposed program submitted in the application (in this case submitted in the joint application by ABU, FIA and ASE). Following the award of a grant to the applicant the final work program is negotiated with my Department.</PARA>
<PARA>(10) Responsibility for the MWPS was transferred to the Department of Industrial Relations with effect from 17 September 1990. My Department has thus not pursued allegations. I understand that the Department of Industrial Relations has written to the three unions concerned about arrangements to ensure the ongoing effective operation of the grant.</PARA>
<PARA>(11) Mr Darras' report dated 27 April 1990 was received by my Department's Adelaide Office on 14 May 1990. I do not know why there is a difference between the dates.</PARA>
<PARA>(12) The report did not disclose information relating to visits to South Australian country areas. This does not necessarily indicate that he did not visit those areas.</PARA>
<PARA>(13) According to my Department's record of the work program for this grant, such visits were not included.</PARA>
