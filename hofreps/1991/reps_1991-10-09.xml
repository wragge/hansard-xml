<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the amendment be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment will include two new clauses in the Aussat Repeal Bill 1991. With clause 5A, it is intended to put beyond doubt that Aussat Pty Ltd is not the Crown, does not represent the Crown and is not an instrumentality or an agent of the Crown. Clause 5B clarifies Aussat's status for income tax purposes by providing that Aussat is not and is taken never to have been a public authority for the purposes of paragraph 23D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. </PARA>
<PARA>  This amendment puts Aussat's status in relation to the Crown and under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 beyond doubt. While the Government and the Australian Taxation Office have always regarded Aussat as a taxpayer, there is some doubt in the minds of bidders which the Government thinks requires clarification in order to eliminate any adverse impact on the sale of Aussat. Amending the Aussat Repeal Bill in this way does this quickly and effectively without risking delay to the sales process. I commend the amendment to the House and present the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I indicate on behalf of the coalition that we will support and facilitate the passage of this amendment to the Aussat Repeal Bill but, in so doing, it is important to point out that this sale of Aussat marks the end of what has been a very sorry saga for the involvement of government in the delivery of communications by satellite in this country. The Bill which came to the House some weeks ago and which was passed limited the Government to absorbing in the vicinity of $800m of debt, $700m of which was already identified. There were also to be some tax losses recouped, with a net saving to the Government of some $50m. Certainly that is a huge amount of money and shows the folly of government intervention in this area, which has visited upon taxpayers a great cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Bill is primarily about facilitating the sale of Aussat as part of the development of the second carrier to compete with Telecom. Broadly speaking, we support it. The other interesting point to note from the brief remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) is that this is the quickest way to facilitate and advance the prospect for sale. I made mention the other day that I felt it was important for the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley)--and I know that he has lost his voice today--to come to the Parliament to indicate, where he can within the requirements of commerciality, exactly what stage the whole process of the issue of the second licence has got to. There are some key decisions that need to be made with regard to the Australian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation about headquarters and the arrangements for the new board and chief executive. They are all matters waiting for decision, and those decisions need to be made very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting that this Aussat Bill is being considered today, when Cabinet is about to make a decision on pay TV. My views and those of the coalition about pay TV have been on the record for some considerable time. I make a last minute plea for there to be a sensible, rational decision and that pay TV be supported on this occasion. If the Government is now going to turn its back on it yet again, I say to it that the luddites have won. The Government cannot turn its back on a technology that has been available for 10 years. We must have it available. It is up to the marketplace to determine whether or not it is going to be viable. It would be sheer folly for this Parliament to be involved in legislation which limits technology that ought to be available to this community, and in my view it is not the very best legislation that could be dealt with by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill does have the added impact of enhancing the price that the Government might receive for the sale of Aussat. Given that there is $800m in possible debts to be accrued by the Government and ultimately paid for by the taxpayer, if the Government can do something within the broader parameters of central policy development then it ought to proceed on that ground alone to support pay television. I particularly appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary at the table, who looks after telecommunications in the absence of the senior Minister, and also his colleague the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), because I am sure he has strong views about this matter. I hope he will be adding his voice to the concerns of those interested in technological growth and will reject the luddites in his own team who are arguing against what would be a very innovative and important development for this country. With those few remarks, all of them exceedingly relevant, I say that the coalition will support this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In this discussion of the estimates for the Department of Transport and Communications, I first want to address my remarks to subprogram 5.5, which includes funding to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority for the inspection of foreign ships. The seaworthiness of international vessels is an issue of growing global concern. Over recent years we have seen the disappearance of increasing numbers of ships at sea and the sinking of vessels crewed in the main by seafarers from Third World countries. It is a matter that demands much greater attention by the world's trading nations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Currently some 25 per cent of foreign ships visiting Australian ports should be inspected by officers of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. In the period under review, 259 foreign vessels were inspected to ensure that they complied with the relevant international maritime conventions and to ensure that their oil tanks did not present a hazard to Australian ports or to the Australian marine environment. Of the 259 vessels inspected, 147 were found to have defects affecting their seaworthiness and/or life saving equipment. We are advised that all of the deficiencies affecting the seaworthiness of the ships were made good before their departure. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to emphasise that Australia's objective is to inspect only 25 per cent of foreign vessels visiting Australian ports. Australia is one of a handful of nations that inspect foreign vessels frequenting their ports. When we introduced the inspection of foreign vessels several years ago there was a clamour from the free marketeers that this inspection would deter foreign vessels from frequenting and visiting Australian ports, that our international trade would be damaged, that we would not be able to get the freight rates that were available at that time and were likely to be available in the future and that, overall, Australian trade would suffer. That has not occurred. What has occurred is that hundreds of seamen, mainly from Third World countries, have lost their lives at sea in ships that have sunk or disappeared without trace. </PARA>
<PARA>  At this stage it is not clear, because of the lack of information, just how many of those vessels were lost due to the unseaworthiness of the vessels alone, as a result of inadequately trained crews and poor seamanship or as a result of a combination of both--vessels in foul seas need well qualified expert crews and attendants to handle them. We have a situation where on many of the flag of convenience vessels there may be only one or two certificated or qualified officers on board. The rest of the crew, being paid poverty wages, are effectively seagoing labourers. No tears are being shed by the trading nations of the world for those hundreds of Third World seamen who have disappeared without trace or who have lost their lives at sea. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is clear that in recent years we have seen a re-emergence of the coffin ships of past centuries when ships were sent to sea in an unseaworthy condition or in a condition that was likely to result in the loss of those vessels and their crews. The development of international maritime conventions and the development of proper standards for the construction and maintenance of vessels, crewing and training of crews developed out of those malpractices of centuries gone by. For years seafarers of the world have been pointing to the deplorable condition of many of the vessels that operate as flag of convenience ships. For their efforts they have generally been portrayed as people crying wolf, people who did not want to work, people who were drawing undue attention to the safety aspects of ship operation. We are now seeing the results of the continued neglect of this major safety issue by the shipping nations of the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  The irony is that attention has now been drawn to this practice of using coffin ships not because of concern about the loss of lives at sea, but because of concern about the marine and global environment. That environment is a matter of major concern; however, I should have thought that priority would have been given to the needless loss of lives of sailors at sea. We have a concern in this nation because of the risk posed to our coastal marine environment by oil spillages from poorly crewed vessels and from unseaworthy vessels in the event of their being wrecked. Recently, the near sinking of the Greek owned tanker Kirki off the west coast focused our attention on the risk to Australia's fishing grounds and to our coastal environment. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the past 18 months, 39 large overseas bulk-carrying vessels have suffered serious structural damage, were lost at sea or just went missing. We know that 21 of those ships sank. Six of them were loaded in north-western Australian ports. They were loaded in Australian ports by Australian persons, sailed, and were never to be seen again--ships that disappeared, ships that sank without trace.   I commend the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) for recognising the seriousness of this situation and for his determination to initiate an international campaign to address this problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have touched briefly on the sea safety issue, and I want to say more about it at a later stage. The important thing is that these ships are being loaded in Australian ports, they are frequenting Australian ports, they pose hazards and dangers to the lives of the seamen who crew them and they pose hazards to Australia's priceless coastal environment. This is an issue to which we will have to give a lot more attention in the time ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>  I now want to say something about what is happening on the waterfront because it is related to the expenditure within the Department of Transport and Communications. Most people would now agree that solid progress is being made in the improvement of waterfront operations, in reducing the delays that have been experienced--delays that we would all prefer not to have occurred. But the fact that there have been delays, the fact that there have been difficulties making the changes that are necessary, simply illustrates the complexities, the inertia, the long-established arrangements that have been built up over many decades, not on the part of waterfront employees alone but on the part of waterfront employees and employers, and to a large extent condoned by the users of waterfront services. </PARA>
<PARA>  This morning I received a copy of an article published in the Reader's Digest. It advocates the big brother, big stick approach and states:</PARA>
<PARA>Time to get tough on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA>I have always regarded the Reader's Digest as a magazine publishing articles that usually have a fair amount of status and a high degree of credibility attaching to them. However, this article is jaundiced, it is out of date, it does Australia a disservice. In respect of the Opposition, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>`If negotiations don't work,' says Liberal leader Dr John Hewson, `we will not hold back on the stick.' If unions retaliate by paralysing the wharves, Hewson threatens to use the defence forces to unload cargoes. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure all that is out of date. But the point I want to make is that that kind of approach does not solve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  The article refers to the New Zealand progress, to what has happened over there. The question to raise in New Zealand is: who is getting the benefits? If one checks the scene in New Zealand one will find that the major users of shipping services other than the shipping companies themselves, which are foreign owned, are getting the benefits; the major users of shipping services other than corporations such as the National Dairy Corporation, which charters ships itself, are the only ones getting the benefits. The benefits are not being passed down to the other users of shipping services. </PARA>
<PARA>  I deplore the article. It makes no reference to and does not recognise the impact of services to and from the waterfront, and it is unfortunate that the article was published at this time. It does not portray an accurate picture and it does not give any encouragement to those engaged in the difficult task that is under way. </PARA>
<PARA>  The growing awareness among waterfront users of how they need to lift their game is also evidence that we will get a much better performance from waterfront related services in the year that is ahead. I am strongly of the view that before the year is out the improvement required on the waterfront will be achieved and we will see a much greater effort by the users of waterfront services to improve their performance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am pleased to speak in the committee stage debate of Appropriations Bill (No. 1) on the estimates of the Department of Transport and Communications. I wish to refer to television reception throughout Australia, particularly within my own electorate of Lyne. I know it is the aim of the Government--and it is the wish, I am sure, of all members of this chamber--that we should improve television services to make them available to all people, no matter where they live in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  A matter that does concern me, and I wish to raise it here, is the fact that within my electorate the method of transmission has changed from VHF to UHF, and this has caused quite a number of people in outlying areas, particularly in the Gloucester and surrounding districts, to lose their television service--not only the ABC but also Prime, which comes from over Tamworth way. It was a shock to those people because earlier they were receiving transmission from Middle Brother Mountain, a facility in the Gloucester area. The changeover is equipping that part of the coast for aggregation, which will take place in the next year or so. It has meant a change in frequency and, as I say, a lot of people living in farming areas, particularly in the Gloucester district, are now missing out on any television reception at all. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have taken the matter up with the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley). He has responded, and his technicians have spoken to me about the situation. The transmission is to be boosted again prior to Christmas, but there is no certainty that these people will actually receive a service. It concerns me because people were receiving it before. That is the important fact. The reception might not have been top class, but they were receiving both ABC television and Prime television. </PARA>
<PARA>  I again want to draw this to the attention of the Government, and particularly ask the Minister to have the situation further examined. It is apparent that a mistake has been made. I do not know what the technical mistake is, but the fact that people were receiving transmissions before and are not receiving them now, when there has been an upgrading of the facility available, is an indication to me that there is something wrong generally in the area. I ask that we get the ABC on channel 6 and not on channel 1. There will be changes so far as Prime is concerned. We will get the aggregation within a certain time, and three commercial stations will be available. </PARA>
<PARA>  The answer, of course, is for the people who have the difficulty to put in dishes. To put in a dish will cost approximately $3,500. It is very hard to turn to people who were previously receiving a service and say to them, `If you put in a dish and pay out the money you will get very good television reception'. Six or seven people have actually installed dishes, but I am speaking about rural properties, which are suffering tremendously at the moment from the drought and because of the problems with markets for our stock throughout the world. I intend to raise the matter again directly with the Minister concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to say something about road funding generally throughout Australia. I know that at the Premiers Conference last July there was general agreement on the changing of regulations and charges between the Commonwealth and the States. These will take place over a period of time. I understand that there will be general changes in financing by the Commonwealth and the States for all categories of roads. If I am quite clear on this, it is my understanding that the money will go in bulk to the States for all arterial roads and rural and urban local roads and that it will be the responsibility of the Commonwealth to upkeep the national roads. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Pacific Highway is of grave concern to the honourable members who live in or represent the coastal areas of New South Wales. The traffic on this road is enormous and is increasing week by week. I travelled on a lot of the road the other day. From 6 p.m. to the early morning there were at least 80 to 90 semi-trailers per hour travelling south from, one could say, Taree to the metropolitan districts. So we have the heavy traffic but there is an enormous increase in vehicular traffic generally. </PARA>
<PARA>  What I would like to see happen--and I think it is in the interests of Australia and particularly that area--is for the Pacific Highway to be declared a national highway. I know that we have a national highway around Australia; the New England Highway is part of it. We want to take nothing from that road in the New England area; it is improving. But people want to travel along the coast because of the geographical situation and the growth in the population of that area. I want to say to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Brown) that he should look at this again. I personally would like to see it declared prior to these new financial arrangements in road funding generally that will be taking place over the next one, two or three years. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has been a downgrading--there has been a fall-off--in real money terms in the amount of funds made available by the Commonwealth to the States and local government for road funding. There has been an uplift this present year. I think the Budget has approximately $1,600m available, but there is an indication that that will be declining. There is a special grant that was actually within the Budget. If these new arrangements come into place, they will have an effect on the baby of the Minister, which is a good plan. I commend him for the fact that he was keen to upgrade the black spots that he recognised were dangerous throughout Australia and he has allocated certain moneys for that purpose alone; I think $110m over a two year period. But, of course, what worries us all, I am sure, is a duplication between the Commonwealth and the States in the administration of these funds. It is important that, if there is going to be a change, it is ironed out so that we will get the best value for the dollar placed back onto our various categories of roads. There is no doubt that they are part of our economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA>  I support the fact that the Minister and the Government are keen to do something with the main existing arterial roads that feed our ports that are so important and other important centres throughout the State and the Commonwealth. I actually support that. Not only do we have the national roads, but also we urgently need the upgrading of roads by local government for their rural and urban local roads and the arterial roads that are serving our farming communities and our towns throughout the country areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  From the observation that I made as we travelled the roads over a wide area, I saw that we can construct our roads in a better way. If one travels along a roadway, one will find a large amount of machinery--graders and tractors of various kinds--that is sitting on the road almost, I suppose, for 16 or 17 hours a day and not being worked. I was delighted the other day--and I do not know whether this work was being done by the Road Traffic Authority or by private contract--to see lights on the side of a road with men and machinery working at night-time. Other countries of the world are doing this and it is so important that we should look at this and do the same thing. I think that we have a lot to learn in the general building of our roads to get a better standard of roads and, certainly, to get much better value for the dollar. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have pleasure in joining in the debate to approve the allocation of funding for the Department of Transport and Communications to enable the carry through of the Government's program in this field. I welcome the contribution by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan). In fact, I find myself in agreement with a number of the observations made by my National Party colleague, which I am sure he will be pleased to hear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I also commend the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) for his contribution and his outline of the problems facing shipping and the waterfront. He referred particularly to the growing public recognition of the problems created by unseaworthy vessels, flags of convenience, and countries and shipping operators who are prepared to allow unseaworthy vessels to ply the world's waters. In Australia, particularly on the west coast, where some of the worst turbulences occur, such ships struggle to make the mark and in recent years have been the cause of a number of tragedies, many of which have gone unreported. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are two or three items in the Government's reform program for transport and communications that I particularly would like to highlight. The first is the funding that is allocated for improvements to aviation and the airlines, particularly to the development of airports. I do not particularly want to say anything about the Sydney Airport issue, except that the funds are there and that when the decision is taken to proceed with construction of the third runway at Sydney the project will be given a fast track. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am keen to have it publicly known that the Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne is in my electorate. I am concerned by reports from time to time in which that airport is described as being in some ways a Third World airport and reports which say that there is some kind of program or policy of trying to encourage more spending there or even the handing over of the airport to private ownership. I make a very clear public statement that Melbourne's Tullamarine Airport will remain as public property, a government owned enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the moment approximately $300m is being spent on developments at the airport, and a number of joint venture projects are being negotiated with the private sector to ensure that developments at the airport provide jobs and a focus for what will become a major freight, passenger and tourism centre in the south of Australia. I have great hopes for the role that Tullamarine Airport will play in that continuing program. I am delighted to see a couple of my constituents, Mrs Burgess and her son Nathan, in the gallery today. Mrs Burgess works for Australian Airlines, so she would be well aware of the developments taking place at the airport. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think I should also make some mention of the scope of reform of telecommunications which is provided for. This is not only about gingering up Telecom and allowing more competition in the marketplace so that Telecom does become more responsive to its clients and provides services which are more responsive to rapidly moving technological needs. Certainly that is one of the big benefits that we are already seeing. Our telecommunications industry is one of the areas in which Australia is at the world's leading edge and is one of the most successful countries. We have managed a very successful industry development policy and our Government believes that in the telecommunications industry in particular we have major opportunities to provide services to the 400 million new telephone subscribers who will come on stream in the Asia-Pacific basin during the next 15 to 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  These countries are saying to us, `Yes, we are prepared to allow you access to our markets provided you are prepared to allow us access to yours'. We are in the process of negotiating a broad new trading arrangement with the whole Asia-Pacific basin. We will be scrapping the White Australia policy, scrapping the old ties to Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, countries which have been our primary sources of trade, and we will be developing our potential in our region. There is much vision in that and much success to be had from it. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the next couple of months the Government expects to announce the name of the consortium which will gain the second carrier licence to provide that second phase of competition in the Australian telecommunications market. The most important process of reform by a long shot in the field of transport and communications is undoubtedly the change in the balance between road and rail in Australia. It is often unheralded. For instance, there is an enormous amount of publicity and hype about the problems on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry Commission has assessed that the improvements of the kind foreshadowed on the waterfront will lead to gains to the economy of about $1 billion per annum. That is not insignificant and no-one would scoff at that, but it ought to be kept in perspective. The same Industry Commission says that an improved balance in the road-rail infrastructure in Australia would lead to benefits of $8 billion--this would provide eight times the gains to the economy as would improvements on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Special Premiers Conference, which is taking place between the States and the Federal Government, is enabling consensus agreements to be reached about who will register motor vehicles, where the roads will be built, and what will be spent on rail and infrastructure to change that balance. These are the most significant things taking place in Australia today in the field of micro-economic reform. Let me give just one example. The recent agreement to form the National Rail Corporation is an acknowledgment by the six States and the Federal Government that it is no longer satisfactory to have six different rail systems, different railway gauges, and different organisations with which arrangements have to be made if one is trying to send freight or when people travel interstate. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are now forming a National Rail Corporation which will take over the administration and operation of a total rail system. It will spend about $500m in the next five years upgrading our rail infrastructure. The standard gauge, which we ought to have had for a hundred years, will be put into place. It will be constructed between Melbourne and Adelaide in the near future. The standard gauge between Melbourne and Sydney will be upgraded. Before too long we will have a complete standard gauge system from Brisbane to Perth and the ability to consign an item from one end of Australia to the other using one authority. That is a very major reform. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Premiers are to be commended for the way that they have negotiated those arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>  As time is short, I mention only briefly a matter raised in Question Time yesterday. I asked the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) whether had he anything to say about the speculated merger or joint venture of Australian Airlines and Australia Post in the parcel and freight and post area. As was explained by the Minister, that joint venture has now been formed. I saw press reports of it this morning. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is the start of the comeback of the public sector government business enterprise. It has always made sense that operations such as Qantas, Australian Airlines, Australia Post and Telecom work together in a common market presence to avoid duplication of facilities and to provide a cheaper, broader service to the people. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is what Australia Post and Australian Airlines have now set out to do together with their freight, parcel and post operation. I have no doubt that that will be the forerunner of a much broader expansion of reform and savings in this area of transport. I commend the estimates to the Committee. I believe that the reform program is one of great substance. Certainly, the estimates are worthy of approval. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to direct my remarks to the rail and road transport portfolios. In particular, I would like to say something about the National Freight Corporation which the Government intends to set up to improve interstate freight operations. This new arrangement is to begin in the second half of 1991-92. It is proposed that in three years it will control the whole interstate freight operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Those of us on this side of the chamber agree with this initiative. We live in the hope that the new Corporation will be a fully commercial operation. The briefings that I have received indicate that this can be done, that overseas best practice will be incorporated in terms of union and commercial control and in terms of the technical excellence that the Corporation may need to use in respect of rolling stock and some of the existing State rail authority equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Federal Government will make a capital investment of $295m over six years. The Federal Government, reluctantly I think, is going to put in $40m to start the Corporation. There has been some debate between the State rail authorities and the Federal Government. But I am pleased to say that a start is actually being made after some considerable delay. The States are going to contribute $118m over the six years. The estimated total contribution at this stage is $410m. This seems to be a fairly small investment to set up a freight operation through the rail network that might assist over the next 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  The key point to be made is that, if the movement of freight through the rail system can reduce the heavy haulage traffic on the main highways by 50 per cent, a major contribution would be made to the maintenance and development of the national highway system. If the trend to bigger and heavier transports such as semitrailers and B-doubles continues, highways such as the Hume Highway will be overwhelmed by heavy traffic. The situation will almost be impossible if nothing has been done by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA>  Everyone who has looked at the freight problems agrees that heavy goods should be carried by rail. The difficulty, of course, is that railways are inefficient in terms of their personnel and in terms of putting material on and taking it off again. The Australian wheat crop has always been a big contributor to the State railway systems. Minerals have also been a contributor. </PARA>
<PARA>  Fertiliser has been a contributor to the Victorian rail system. In recent days it has been drawn to my attention that 8 per cent of fertiliser distributed by the Pivot company is carried by rail. The rail system in Victoria used to carry about 40 or 50 per cent of this product. This gives an indication of the inefficiencies in and the lack of cost effectiveness of the Victorian railway system. Of course, the incidence of featherbedding is well known. There has also been a lack of action by State governments to smarten up their railway systems. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased to say that in New South Wales there has been some attempt to rearrange the way in which the railway in that State should operate. The profit motive has been put into the system and the rolling stock has been upgraded. Also, non-profit stations and non-profit lines have been done away with. </PARA>
<PARA>  In passing, I might say that the Australian National Railways, in which I have had some interest over the years, has done a good job. Australian National is seeking $59m as a supplement to revenue. We should bear in mind that Australian National took over the South Australian railway system and the Tasmania railway system. It has made every endeavour to run a sensible and efficient long haul freight operation between such places as Perth and Sydney. I think it is to be commended on the way in which it has approached its task. </PARA>
<PARA>  I draw a comparison between Australian National and the estimated $4 billion of losses that are incurred by the State rail systems. I hope that something will be done to those State rail systems, which are a great drain not only on State revenues, but on the Federal purse which has to contribute revenues to those States which continue to run these quite dramatic losses in their State rail systems. </PARA>
<PARA>  I note in passing my disappointment that the Very Fast Train project was disbanded in the last few months. I think it was a quite exciting project. Private sector money was being invested in an infrastructure project to improve the transport of people and goods around Australia. It was suggested in the feasibility studies that the train would move between the two major centres of population--this has been the case in France, America and around Europe--so, on my judgment, it was feasible. The Very Fast Train concept works well in Japan and Europe. Projects are now under construction in those centres of high population, whereas in Australia we disbanded it on the arguments of the Treasury. Whilst I am not familiar with the details of the argument, I think it is a great pity because for once the private sector was contributing, it was putting its money up front and was prepared to do something to make Australia more competitive and make it more effective in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn now to the road funding argument and draw the attention of the House to the ongoing saga of Federal road funding. Whilst the Budget figures indicate some changes, in simple terms there has been no increase by the Federal Government to the Commonwealth contribution to road funding around Australia since it came to government in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>  The actual figure in 1990-91 was $1.469 billion. The Government has done a little trick in the new Budget statement by suggesting that the new figure will be $1.1 billion; but $323m will be allocated to the States in untied grants. I agree that this is a step in the right direction. Money is being given back to States where they can best spend it on roads. However, honourable members should be aware that this Federal Government has dramatically reduced its contribution to funding in the Australian road system in real terms. All it has really done is change the name from the Australian bicentennial roads development program to the Australian land transport development program; it has not given any more money. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased to note that the Premiers Conference in July 1991 agreed--along with the Commonwealth--that the Commonwealth's responsibility would be to national highways. I think this is a step in the right direction, taking some of the politics out of who pays for what and whose responsibility it is for particular roads. Hopefully, that is a step that will help in the longer term. The other interesting initiative by the Premiers Conference, with which I agree, is the interstate road transport charge where road users are charged for heavy vehicles--that is, to cover the cost that those heavy vehicles cause to the highways around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have just returned from a parliamentary delegation to Europe. In reality, the 12 member nations of the European Community are doing their best to get a cooperative effort  among themselves in terms of highways so that the 340 million people of Europe can move around that one entity on highways that are linking to one another and are of good quality. Let us take a lead from the Europeans in Australia and get some rational thinking about whose responsibility it is for what roads and the funding and construction techniques that we adopt in making better roads for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  There needs to be some rationalisation in terms of national highways, what the main arterial road definition is, what local roads consist of and who is responsible for local road maintenance and construction. All honourable members would be aware of the ongoing arguments in their electorates about local government complaints that there is insufficient money from the Federal Govern- ment or from the State Government for local roads. It gets down to a definition of these particular roads and whose responsibility they might be. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We are dealing with transport and communications, which is a huge area. I wish to concentrate on one particular aspect of it--radio and television--and, in particular, the question of the extent to which the radio and television services of this country are capable of or are effective in serving Australia as a multicultural society. I am quite happy with certain aspects of our television industry and of our radio industry. I want to make that point at the outset. I think we are doing quite well in this area, especially in the production of television drama and also in many of our current affairs radio programs which are lively and help the participation of the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Having said that, the extent to which there is a genuine effort to reflect the multicultural nature of our society in our radio and television programs is really not good enough. I know that many people say the SBS is supposed to perform that particular service--I will come back to the SBS in a moment because I have a few comments to make about problems in relation to it--but it is not just the responsibility of the SBS. For example, for some considerable time the ABC has had in its charter a requirement to reflect the multicultural nature of Australian society. With the greatest respect to the ABC, if one watches many of its television programs, or its television dramas, one would think that we have a very minor multicultural society in Australia, rather than the diverse multicultural society that we are. </PARA>
<PARA>  I appeal once again to the ABC to do its national duty and reflect the actual composition and character of Australian society, which it is not doing enough of. Some time ago the ABC formed a multicultural unit, which was supposed to help promote these matters, but it appears that that unit has either exhausted itself, did nothing or disappeared because I cannot find out what is going on now in this multicultural promotion in the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA>  Given the huge amounts of public money which the ABC spends, I think that it is incumbent upon the ABC to regenerate its multicultural unit and to act to represent the multicultural and transcultural nature of Australian society. That is not to say that the ABC does not do a good job in a number of important areas, but I think that even its current affairs reporting quite often suffers in terms of foreign affairs coverage from the insufficiency of multicultural input of the ABC. We get a situation quite often where if there had been a broader, more multicultural spectrum within the ABC, some of the multicultural insensitivity which some of the ABC reports have shown from time to time may not have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>  It seems to me that proper consideration of this issue is long overdue. In the past we have had promises from the ABC, including from the previous chairman of the ABC and a current Director and it is now time for some action.</PARA>
<PARA>  The commercial television stations, as I say, in general are doing a reasonably good job under difficult circumstances. But again, on this question of the reflection of the multicultural nature of Australian society, they are certainly not doing a good job. This country is proud of its heritage and tradition, of the way in which it was brought together--people from many different backgrounds all working together to build what is becoming increasingly one of the great nations of the world. In this context, therefore, as I said, it is incumbent on our media to reflect that multicultural nature. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course some people have said, `Why can't the SBS do this? After all, we have the SBS whose duty it is to represent Australia as a multicultural society'. Indeed the SBS does a good job, especially given its limited budget--but that is the problem; the SBS's budget is limited. Recently we had a very good example of what has happened to the SBS as a result of that. I refer of course to the crisis that was created over the radio programs on SBS radio in Melbourne and Sydney where, because of the fact that we have had new communities coming into Australia in the last 15 years and they have wanted air time on SBS radio, the SBS management decided that it was necessary to reschedule the programs on SBS radio. Of course, the somewhat curious action of the SBS management to then drop 21 language groups from the radio programs created some considerable public furore. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was somewhat amazed that, when the SBS management was faced with this problem, it did not immediately do what was logical--which was to come to the Government straight away and say, `Look, SBS has this problem with all these new groups. It is absolutely imperative for us to have a second radio network'. That is what it should have done. Instead of taking that action, the second radio network option was canvassed and dropped and the SBS management then proceeded with this rescheduling exercise which created, to say the least, a lot of angst not to mention a number of different public meetings at which, unfortunately, the Government was condemned. But it was not the Government's fault at all; it was a result of the action of SBS management in relation to these programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am happy to say that, after a series of meetings involving the Caucus transport and communications committee, the Caucus immigration committee, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), we have managed to at least temporarily resolve this issue--and I say temporarily in the sense that we have reinstated the 21 language groups. But, of course, it has meant that the hours of some groups have been reduced while others have had their hours increased, and new groups have had to come in. The overall compromise, while it is acceptable as a short term measure, is obviously going to be inadequate to meet our requirements as a multicultural society. That means that it is absolutely necessary for the Government to move quickly in relation to the second SBS radio network in Melbourne and Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA>  The only way we can accommodate in a satisfactory way the sort of multicultural society that will be created through our immigration program, especially providing a reasonable service for the bigger groups in the community while giving those various groups some access so they can hear the news and current events--especially for the smaller groups, it is only perhaps a question of half an hour or an hour a week--is to have that second radio network. I believe that, given that more than 40 per cent of Australians have a background which involves a second language and given, in addition, the way in which we are trying to inspire even those Australians who are monolingual to learn a second language, we certainly ought to look at the radio programs on SBS. That means we do require that second network as soon as possible, and I would urge the Government to certainly look at this option. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have given a commitment that this option would be looked at in the next few weeks, and I am hopeful that it will be looked at by no later than the middle of November. I personally want to say that I strongly support the creation of that second radio network so we can service all of the communities and help to transmit programs in the various languages.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I want to start off my contribution to this consideration of Appropriation Bill (No.1) by talking about roads, because I believe that fundamentally the road system of Australia is the basis of all of our trade, all of our economy. In the current Budget road funding has fallen overall by 2 per cent in real terms. Funding for major roads has gone down by 4.4 per cent in real terms, and funding for arterial roads has fallen nearly 18 per cent in real terms. If we look at the record of this Labor Government since 1983-84, road funding has gone down totally by 20 per cent in real terms. Yet, at the same time, the revenue from fuel taxes is up 120 per cent. Revenue up 120 per cent; expenditure down 20 per cent in real terms. That is the sorry record of this Government on roads. Roads expenditure as a percentage of excise has gone from 63.2 per cent at the time this Government came in down to 23.3 per cent. That is all that has been spent out of fuel excise on actual roads. That is providing, of course, that local government is actually spending the Federal money with which it is provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  All roads are important. There is no doubt about that. It is very easy for individuals to say, `This road is more important than the other one', and I suppose in some circumstances that is true. But for those living in the McLeay Valley or Nambucca or other areas of Australia, the road which gives access to their nearest town, which gives their kids access to schools, is very important indeed. These roads are very important to tourism and also incredibly important to the marketing of agricultural produce. </PARA>
<PARA>  I did say that there can be special cases made for some roads and, Mr Deputy Chairman, you will be aware that since coming to this place following the election on 1 December 1984 I have shown a special interest in the future of the Pacific Highway. I have in fact led the fight to have it acknowledged that it should be a four-lane dual carriageway divided highway all the way from Hexham to the Queensland border. It is a special case. That is acknowledged by all political parties in this country. It is acknowledged by the current Federal Government and by the New South Wales State Government. It is acknowledged all over Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have presented petitions to this Parliament bearing over 50,000 signatures imploring the Government to maintain special priority funding for the Pacific Highway. Those signatures did not come just from people living on the north coast of New South Wales. They came from people living all over Australia, from people who were using that road who could see and understand its significance and who certainly agreed that it should be given special funding. Of course, I am very pleased indeed that that priority has been acknowledged so far, and in the current three years--and we are in the beginning of the second year of the three-year period--funding from the New South Wales Government and the Federal Government in total has been doubled. That is a good start. It has been doubled to $300m to be spent over the current three-year period, with $140m coming from the Federal Government and $160m from the State Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do believe, of course, that there is an overwhelming case, an unarguable case, for Federal funding to be increased. Yet, I have to be fair and acknowledge that the economy is in such tatters because of Labor's economic policies that it is probably unrealistic to seek a massive increase at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nonetheless, I believe it is absolutely essential that the current increased rate of funding be maintained beyond the present three-year period. Priority funding must continue. I am confident about the funding coming from the New South Wales Greiner-Murray Government, but I would like to be equally confident that the present Federal Government and the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) will at least continue the same high level of priority funding for the Pacific Highway. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe the Minister should make a statement and set the record clear on just what the Government's intentions are. We are all aware that, following the Premiers Conference, a working party has been established and is looking at perhaps changing the system to have only national highways, State roads and local roads. The Pacific Highway is a national arterial road. The Minister should set the record straight and make a statement about what his intentions are for the Pacific Highway--whether it will become a national highway and still continue to receive special Federal funding or whether it will become a State road only, and whether there will be continued priority funding, as an exception to the rule, because it is vital to the whole future of Australia that that road should be made a divided highway all the way from Hexham to the Queensland border. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would also like to touch on the third runway for Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. In the Sydney Morning Herald of today there is an article headed `ALP revolt on third runway plan'. I can understand some of those ALP members who have their seats around Botany Bay being concerned for their future. They should not stop the third runway because they are concerned about losing their seats, because they will lose their seats anyway, come the next election, when the people of Australia will revolt against Labor's mismanagement of the economy and against the almost one million unemployed. That is what we have got at the moment. It is getting very close to one million and it will go higher. I have no patience with the ALP revolt on the third runway plan--no patience at all. After all, the EIS found no major problems with the runway. The runway should go ahead, and it must go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>  But Labor is vacillating once again. It cannot make difficult decisions. All it is doing is governing for itself. It has been said many times that if a party cannot govern itself it cannot govern Australia. The Government has proved that it cannot govern Australia and that it cannot govern itself. What it has also proved is that its motivation is to govern for itself, to govern for the factions, to govern to keep itself in power. It is not governing for Australia or for the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The attitude to the third runway in Sydney is just like that of the Budget: no vision and no hope. The third runway must be built, and built as quickly as possible. There are many reasons why the lost eight years should be overcome. We should get some action immediately. We should get the fast tracking that Premier Greiner is speaking of. That third runway is absolutely vital to country New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>  Air transport is not a luxury. These days, air transport is a basic form of transport. I believe it is absolutely wrong that we should have an unfair, discriminatory tax against the smaller airlines. We have seen what it has done to Hazelton. Fourteen airports have been closed--14 services taken away from country New South Wales. It is a disgrace. East-West pulled out of Tamworth, where it was born--again the result of Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  What we have to realise is that, as well as being of great importance to rural New South Wales, the construction of a third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport is absolutely vital to Australia. It is vital to our tourist industry and to our export income because tourism provides an enormous amount of export income. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the present time tourism in Australia employs 448,000 people and we have got gross expenditure of $22 billion. Tourism is Australia's largest export earner. In 1989-90, $6.5 billion was earned in foreign exchange. That is a significant amount. The new runway will create 40,000 new jobs. But all this Government can do is look at the palliatives, the bandaids. It is not doing anything at this stage to create employment. That is what Australia needs. That is what the unemployed people of Australia want: they want jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  The new runway not only could create 40,000 new jobs in the very short term but also over the next 10 years would contribute to the creation of one million new jobs. Some of the members of the ALP are revolting over the third runway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This Budget has cut funding to the ABC over the coming year by $11.8m, a decrease of 2.3 per cent in dollar terms and about 7 per cent in real terms. As a result of some quite convoluted financial manoeuvring, the Government has attempted to convince us that the ABC will really suffer only a 1.4 per cent decrease in total available resources. To offset this bad news the Government attempted to placate the ABC by committing itself to what it calls `three years of guaranteed real funding'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If I were the ABC I would want to know a little more about what the Government means by `real funding', and about the relationship between that term and the percentages shown in the Budget Papers. Despite the cutbacks in the current year, the considerable publicity by the ABC, threats to reduce some services, and the partial implementation of that threat, Mr Hill might be interested to know that the steady flow of correspondence I receive in relation to the ABC is not concerned so much with funding as with programming standards. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have here a petition signed by 891 people expressing their concern about broadcasting standards and the ABC's apparent ability to consider itself aloof from properly addressing and responding to those community concerns. These petitioners are calling for the ABC to be made subject to the Commonwealth Ombudsman's jurisdiction. That is a call which I heartily endorse because, as you may recall, Mr Deputy Chairman, on 30 May last I introduced into Parliament a private member's Bill entitled Ombudsman Amendment Bill 1991. Its purpose was to allow the Commonwealth Ombudsman to investigate any action that relates to a programming decision of the ABC. What I sought to do was redress the present unsatisfactory situation where there is an identifiable public concern about aspects of the ABC's programming standards but no creditable independent review procedure available to investigate those complaints. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is true that in recent months the ABC has announced the establishment of an independent complaints review panel but, despite that title and a respected membership, it is nevertheless an in-house body which will leave the effective control of complaints actions in the hands of ABC's management. In any case, the panel is a belated and, I believe, inadequate response to pressure from the Government for action by the ABC to deal with what the Government considers to be growing disquiet about the ABC's programming decisions and its presentation standards. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those pressures came to a head in January last following the ABC's refusal to have Radio Australia transmit personal messages to troops stationed in the Persian Gulf and by the ABC's perceived bias in its coverage of the Gulf War. But the Gulf War was only the final straw for many Australians. The ABC's obsession with higher ratings is taking it towards the lowest common denominator factor. We are seeing comedies that confuse crudity and vulgarity with humour; an increasing reliance on emotional exploitation and trivia in current affairs programs; objectionable sexual emphases and bad language, particularly in prime viewing time; a lack of professionalism and downright bias during interviewing by leading commentators; and, above all, too much sheer bad taste and a disregard for common decency. </PARA>
<PARA>  Perhaps this was also in the Government's mind when it made its threat on 19 February that the ABC should either establish an independent body to investigate complaints or be subject to the control of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The pity is that the Government did not offer the ABC a third option, namely, for it to come within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The Ombudsman offers every advantage; it is a review mechanism which need not directly interfere with the ABC's right of independence; it is a truly independent adjudicator; it is highly respected by the public; and it is an established authority which could take on ABC complaints at a fraction of the cost of setting up the ABC's new review panel. Furthermore, successive ombudsmen have indicated a willingness to undertake this function and have expressed the opinion that their Act already gives them the power to investigate ABC programming decisions. The ABC, for its part, has consistently denied this on the grounds that the Ombudsman's jurisdiction relates to administrative matters and that programming is not such a matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  The practical effect of this piece of convenient evasiveness has been to deny the general public any effective independent review of their complaints about the ABC. The ABC has been unique within the media industry in this regard and there can be no justification for such a privileged position. Not surprisingly, the ABC has not supported my proposal. In fact, the position is quite the reverse. After presenting my private member's Bill in the Parliament, I received a letter from the ABC's management complaining that I had been neither accurate nor fair in my tabling speech in describing the ABC's newly established independent complaints review panel as an in-house body. The letter stated that panel members are `free to investigate complaints as they see fit and to adjudicate with absolute independence'. </PARA>
<PARA>  What the ABC's management had obviously overlooked was that only some weeks prior to my receiving its letter, it had sent to all members of parliament a 48-page document dated July 1991 and titled `Editorial and Program Policies'. Section 10 of that document deals with program complaints and subsection 10.3 with the role of the independent complaints review panel. What is clear from this document is that the ABC envisages most program complaints being handled by the relevant program area, as set out in section 10.1.1; that complaints of alleged error of fact and invasion of privacy are to be handled by a community affairs officer, as in section 10.2; and that the panel will `review only those written complaints which relate to allegations of serious bias, lack of balance or unfair treatment arising from an ABC broadcast or broadcasts', as stated in section 10.3.1. </PARA>
<PARA>  The phrase `serious bias' is of particular importance because section 10.1.1 requires that written complaints are to be handled by the ABC's corporate relations department in conjunction with the appropriate program department. This begs the question as to the nature of the internal ABC procedures that will determine whether a complaint is sufficiently serious as to warrant its being referred from the corporate affairs department to the independent complaints review panel. </PARA>
<PARA>  The document offers some comment on this. Section 10.3.3 tells us that either the managing director of the ABC or the convenor of the panel will make that decision. However, what are we to make of section 10.3.2, which specifically requires that a written complaint about serious bias, lack of balance or unfair treatment `may only be referred to the panel for review once the ABC's normal complaints handling procedures have been completed'? Clearly, rather than being `free to investigate complaints as they see fit', the complaints panel is heavily restricted by the ABC as to the type of complaint it can review and is heavily dependent on decisions by the ABC's senior management as to the actual complaints referred to it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Add to this the qualification contained in section 10.3.5, the requirement of section 10.3.6 that a complainant must waive the right to all legal claims before the review can proceed, the provision in section 10.3.10 that a panel's report be passed in the first instance to the managing director, and the prerogative of the managing director, as contained in section 10.3.11, to `decide what action, if any, will be taken as a result of the report', and I suggest that it was more than fair of me to describe the panel as an in-house body. </PARA>
<PARA>  The answer to all this is that the ABC sees accountability as being a decidedly uncomfortable process because it will require a more responsible and sensitive attitude to complaints. From personal experience, such a change in attitude is very much overdue. Let me give one example. On 18 June last the ABC radio station JJJ broadcast a program called Coming Round the Bend. It was a program about changing sexual practices and attitudes in Australia. However, its offensive language upset many people, and members of parliament have received heavy correspondence. Having not heard the broadcast and believing I should be objective and listen to it before responding to constituents, I wrote to the ABC seeking either a transcript or a tape copy. Mr Hill replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I trust you will understand that our limited resources do not allow us to meet frequent requests for copies of programs transmitted at a much earlier date. </PARA>
<PARA>Some weeks later a senior executive of the ABC phoned my office and offered to make that transcript available. It still has not arrived. But the point is that the nature of Mr Hill's reply and subsequent action by other officers to counter such an abrupt and dismissive attitude need to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Hill will be hearing more from me about the matter of transcripts, but what is of real importance is the dismissive attitude indicated by the ABC to what was a straightforward inquiry by a member of the Federal Parliament of Australia. One would have thought that such a request from any member of the Federal Parliament should have received a more accepting and rapid response than was provided by Mr Hill. Can Mr Hill wonder why there is rising public disquiet about the ABC's handling of complaints and inquiries, why there will be considerable public cynicism about the effectiveness of the ABC's newly created independent complaints review panel and why the only acceptable solution is for complaints to be investigated by the Commonwealth Ombudsman?

I cannot say that I agree with many of the propositions which have come from Opposition members, but I acknowledge the sincere interest that they have in the subjects they have addressed. I note that speakers have canvassed the gamut of responsibilities that come within the transport and communications portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  One particular area of interest which was raised during the debate is road transport reform. It is that issue which I want to cover, at least briefly, in the context of the way in which the road transport reform agenda is being addressed by the various governments around Australia and, more particularly, how it is being addressed in the Northern Territory and how it is perceived in the Northern Territory to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members will recall that this thrust for road transport reform came as a result of this Government's setting in place the Inter-State Commission to provide a report to it. That report was tabled in May 1990. It addressed the issue of road user charging as well as a range of other issues around the administration of reforms in terms of regulations, vehicle licensing, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is the issue of road user charges which has been at the heart of much of the opposition that has been expressed by some elements within the transport industry and certainly by the Northern Territory Government. I wish to briefly retail to the Committee the concern I have about the position which has been adopted by the Northern Territory Government in relation to this particular issue. The Northern Territory Government has been present at and participated actively in the Premiers Conferences which have endorsed the recommendations that there be support in principle for the issue of full cost recovery for roads. On two occasions the Northern Territory Chief Minister has been present at the Premiers Conference at which this issue was discussed, firstly, in October last year, when he endorsed it, and again in July this year. After the July meeting the National Road Transport Commission was set up. I will demonstrate in a moment the difficulty which this is causing people in remote areas in coming to understand what the implications of these proposed changes will be for them, their industries and their communities. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have to commend the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) for his effort in attempting to ensure that all people who may be interested and have a concern about the changes that are being proposed as a result of this reform package are aware of its impacts on them. He has gone to great lengths, in conjunction with the industry and his Department, to ensure that research has been put in place so that we can gather information about the impact of proposed increases in charges. </PARA>
<PARA>  The concern I have is that in the Northern Territory, despite the fact that the Northern Territory Chief Minister had in October 1990 endorsed the concept of full cost recovery, on 7 November 1990 the Northern Territory News carried an article, unsourced, indicating that the Northern Territory Minister for Transport and Works, Mr Finch, saw no harm to the Northern Territory from the fact that the Northern Territory Chief Minister had committed the Northern Territory to the adoption of a heavy vehicle charging scheme at the 30 October 1990 Special Premiers Conference. Mr Finch is quoted in this article as saying that the Northern Territory accepts the position of recovering the costs of damage done to roads. That is what is known as marginal cost recovery, not full cost recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>  All at once Mr Finch was at a divergence with the position which was endorsed by the Northern Territory Chief Minister at the Premiers Conference last October. There is a very fundamental and obviously serious difference between the Special Premiers Conference agreement and what Mr Finch was reported as having said in the Northern Territory News. That is a matter of concern because it demonstrates that in this instance the Northern Territory Chief Minister went to the Premiers Conference and put a point of view which supported the view which was being expressed by the Prime Minister, the Premiers and the Chief Minister of the ACT, but which was not supported by his own Transport Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>  Subsequently, there has been a great deal of debate on the figures which were put out by the Inter-State Commission in its report about the impact of road user charges. The interesting thing about that report is that as early as February this year it was made very clear that the proposals which had been posited by the Inter-State Commission were all but dead in the water and that the cost which it had been estimated would accrue to industry as a result of the Inter-State Commission charges would not arise. </PARA>
<PARA>  In March this year, as a result of a desire by Minister Brown, the senior Minister, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) and myself to ensure that people in remote areas were involved and understood the proposals which were being put--firstly, by the Inter-State Commission and then, lately, as amended, by the various meetings of the Australian Transport Advisory Council and the Premiers Conference in October the States had a meeting in Alice Springs. At that conference the Northern Territory Government, in a gross use of misinformation, said to the people who were present that every Northern Territory family would stand to lose in the vicinity of $1,750 per year. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not only did Mr Finch then know, as he now knows, that those figures were based on the Inter-State Commission's initial recommendations--which were not the recommendations that were being accepted by the Government at that time--but also, in July 1990, the Northern Territory Minister had indicated that Northern Territory consumers would stand to lose $100m a year as a result of the report by the Inter-State Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>  First, despite having a different view about what was meant by the October Premiers Conference decisions, he endorsed the position adopted by the Northern Territory Chief Minister. Then he went on further, in a meeting in Alice Springs, to indicate to the people of remote Australia generally, but particularly people of the Northern Territory, that the changes recommended by the Inter-State Commission and then amended by the Government as a result of discussions at the Premiers Conference and with meetings of Ministers would have an impact upon them of $1,750 per family. He knew that was wrong. Not only did he know it was wrong, but it was demonstrated to him by researchers from the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics that his advisers had miscalculated his figures by a factor of 10. </PARA>
<PARA>  There was no attempt by the Northern Territory Chief Minister or his Transport Minister to apologise to the Northern Territory community for this misinformation. What we have seen since that time is the same misinformation and lies perpetrated by continuing the myth that the initial ISC recommendations were the recommendations currently being considered by the Premiers Conference and subsequently by the transport Ministers which were going to be the basis for the recommendations that were going to be received by the National Road Transport Commission and the ministerial council of that Commission about road user charges early next year. </PARA>
<PARA>  He knows that is wrong. Yet, as recently as last week, the Northern Territory Minister said, erroneously yet again, that the impact on the Northern Territory community would be around $24m per year. Again we have the absurd position of a Minister basing these estimates on the original ISC recommendations of May 1990, which he knows--and I emphasise this--not to be the currency of existing deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA>  One has to ask: what is the purpose of this misinformation campaign? One can come to only one conclusion: that it is about trying to maximise a community concern that this proposal, which he asserts emanated from and was controlled by the Commonwealth Minister for Land Transport, Mr Robert Brown, will have a detrimental impact on the Northern Territory and that it is a political imperative that it be opposed by the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  One has to ask why the Northern Territory Government has said that it will not at present be part of the National Road Transport Commission formed in July this year. One has to ask this question because, remember, the National Road Transport Commission was again endorsed by the Premiers Conference. Here is a Minister who, at the outset, disagreed with the propositions agreed to by his own Chief Minister in October last year and who now, even though the Premiers Conference has endorsed the National Road Transport Commission, has said that the Northern Territory will not be part of the proposal at this stage because of the negative impact it will have on the Northern Territory economy. He does not know what the impact will be, because he has not done the research. If he has done the research, he has not exposed his research to the analysis that is required to demonstrate that he is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is of further concern is that a person who is masquerading as acting responsibly on behalf of the Northern Territory community is coming to the National Road Transport Commission and saying that he will act as an observer but will not participate in decisions about the level of charges which will be introduced by the Commission probably in March of next year. </PARA>
<PARA>  Here is a person who says he is representing the best interests of the Northern Territory community saying that he will not be part of the decision making process which will set the level of charges to apply in the road transport industry around Australia. What sort of responsibilities does this man have? Is that a responsible attitude in terms of the interests of the Northern Territory community? Is it a responsible attitude in terms of the interests of the road transport industry? Is it a responsible attitude in terms of the interests of the beef industry, the mining industry, the horticulture industry or the fishing industry--all industries in the Northern Territory which rely on road transport and are receiving on a daily basis doses of deliberate misinformation from the Northern Territory Government, from the Minister supposedly responsible, about the impact of road user charges, charges which have not been set and will not be set until the ministerial council meets on advice from the Commission next year?</PARA>
<PARA>  Here we have a person who asserts he is the responsible Minister continuing to say to the Northern Territory community that he is going to fix things up for the Northern Territory. How can he fix things up if in the first instance he has pulled himself out of the game? How could he make a valid contribution to asserting the Northern Territory's interests in front of the National Road Transport Commission, in terms of the ministerial council, if the Northern Territory is not part of the Commission and if, as a result of its not being part of the Commission, he cannot have a voice, have a vote and be one of eight in that ministerial council?</PARA>
<PARA>  We have had an argument put to us recently that the Northern Territory Government would be disadvantaged by being in this ministerial council because the big States, New South Wales and Victoria, would dominate. I do not know what class this bloke went to; I do not know where he learned his politics. I do know he is an engineer and I know he probably learned some mathematics; but it does not take a lot to work out that if someone is one of eight, if his Territory's population is 160,000 and the population of New South Wales is five million, he has a very large say in the way things are to move. I say to him that, if he thinks he will be outvoted by New South Wales and Victoria, he should talk to his friends from Queensland and Western Australia, who have a common interest in looking after the interests of people who live in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  The sort of poppycock we are getting from the Northern Territory Government, that it is serving the best interests of the Northern Territory community by not being part of this Commission, is exactly that--poppycock. Under no analysis can it be asserted that he is acting responsibly or that the Northern Territory Government is taking a responsible attitude by pulling out of this Commission and by not being part of this decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA>  It ought to be understood that what is being proposed at this stage in terms of road user charges is two zones:  zone A, which will be New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, and zone B, which will be Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia. There will now be a third zone, the Northern Territory, because by implication it will not be part of the decision making for zones A and B. That means that every time one of the road trains that are registered in the Northern Territory drives into South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia or Victoria, it will have to pay additional money. No-one can tell me that is either administratively appropriate or economically efficient in terms of the administration of the road transport industry either in the Northern Territory or in Australia generally. It will have a detrimental impact upon that industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  It may well be that there is a marginal increase in cost to the Northern Territory consumers in some industries, but the point is that, if one does not know the level of charges or if one has not done the research to establish what the range of charges would be, or what the implications would be for the community and industries, one should not make irresponsible statements like, `It will cost us $24m this year', or, as he was saying last year, $100m. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a measure of the concern of the Government and of the concern of the Minister for Land Transport and myself, and, of course, in the first instance the previous Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, and the current Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, together with the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, will be undertaking research into the possible impacts of a range of charges on industries, particularly the wheat and beef industries, and on communities in remote Australia. I would have thought that the responsible attitude for the Northern Territory Government to take would be to make a submission to the BTCE and ABARE on what it believes the implications will be for its industries and the community of the Northern Territory, instead of peddling this misinformation and creating the scaremongering which is going on about the implications of these charges for the Northern Territory population. It is irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA>  I invite, as I have done before, the Northern Territory Government to cooperatively meet with the BTCE and ABARE to discuss its concerns and to show them the research on which it bases these allegations of an impost of $24m. It is yet to happen, but it is something we are looking forward to. I am sorry if I have taken time, but it is very important that we lay these matters in front of the community. It is of concern to me that, whilst the six State Premiers and the Chief Minister of the ACT are all acting responsibly, safeguarding their communities' interests by being part of this process, the Northern Territory Government is doing nothing to assist this process and doing absolutely the wrong thing in terms of representing the best interests of the Northern Territory community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In the time available I would like to address some remarks to the biggest social and, I suggest, political problem which presents itself to Australia at the present time, and that is the very high level of unemployment. Probably one of the most authoritative research bodies on labour markets and employment trends in Australia is the Flinders Institute of Labour Studies in South Australia. Regularly it produces a document titled  Australian Bulletin of Labour, and it is authored by Professor Richard Blandy, who I know some members on the Government side would see as belonging to the deregulatory kidney of the industrial relations debate, but who nonetheless has enormous intellectual respectability and experience in this area. He had this to say about the current employment situation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . on the basis of these leading indicators--</PARA>
<PARA>and he had reviewed the material--</PARA>
<PARA>taken together, it is a fair supposition that unemployment is likely to reach its peak early in 1992, at something in excess of 900,000 persons. For this to happen, economic activity will stop falling and start increasing during the present half of 1991. Since we believe that the economic recovery will be subdued, we do not expect unemployment to fall rapidly from its peak over the course of 1992. As noted earlier, it will take many years, judging by the experience of the 1980s, to reduce unemployment to less than 8 per cent of the labour force. </PARA>
<PARA>The excerpt concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kerin has been honest and correct in stating this. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me say that I would regard that particular summary as being a fair assessment of what is likely to happen. I would express the hope that unemployment does not go over 900,000. I would hope that tomorrow's figures disclose no increase, and hopefully some decrease, because I have been at great pains in this shadow portfolio to make the point again and again that the Opposition draws no comfort at all--in fact, the reverse--from any additions to the ranks of unemployed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  But the Australian Bulletin of Labour has drawn attention to an unpalatable fact about the Australian labour market: that whenever we have periods of high unemployment it always takes years to get back to the level of unemployment that existed before it began to rise, and each successive recession leaves the situation progressively worse. In the 1970s we first experienced in the postwar life of Australia high unemployment. We did not have it in the 1950s and the 1960s, those `dreadful, stagnant days' when, as we are constantly told by some honourable members opposite, we groaned and grunted under the weight of the `inefficient, hopeless, job-destroying Menzies-McEwen governments' that, of course, gave us a period of unparalleled high employment. But in the 1970s that changed. Not all of it changed because of the policies of the Whitlam Government; a lot was because of the social changes, the oil shock, the disappearance of so many unskilled jobs and all the other attendant things. But in 1970 we first had high unemployment, and after it began to recede in the late 1970s it never went back to the pre-1974 level. That pattern repeated itself in the 1982 recession even worse. Unemployment went higher and it took years for it to return to anything approaching the 1981 level. It never did return to that. </PARA>
<PARA>  The sad fact is that we face the same likelihood on this occasion, no matter who is in power after 1992. Even if there is some kind of tepid economic recovery in the first half of 1992, we will see a very slow return to lower levels of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Against that background, we have to ask the inevitable question: what can be done? We are not in this place to engage in a council of despair and defeatism about the unemployment situation. I suppose the first thing that can be done is that we ought to tell the truth about unemployment; we ought not exaggerate it; and we ought not be doom and gloom merchants. But, by the same token, we should not indulge in some of the Pollyanna language which has lately come, particularly from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). On the truth stakes, when it comes to projections from the other side of the House about what is going to happen with unemployment, I would support the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) and I would reject Mr Hawke. The current Treasurer has been admirably candid about the very restrained prospects of reducing the level of unemployment. In contrast, his Prime Minister, as he was several years ago on interest rates, has been somewhat cavalier. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second thing that can be done is to get the economic debate back to what is relevant to reducing unemployment over the longer term. In that context, the current preoccupation of many people opposite and the media with interest rates as an issue directly relevant to the current level of unemployment is absolutely ridiculous. If interest rates fell by 3 per cent tomorrow, it would make not one jot of difference to the level of unemployment over the next six or nine months. </PARA>
<PARA>  Anybody who has any elementary understanding of the Australian economy will understand the enormous leads and lags that are involved so far as levels of monetary policy are concerned. The unemployment we are now suffering is the product of the high interest rates of late 1889--I mean, 1989. I might say that that slip almost has some relevance. There is a lead time of something like 15 to 18 months. In that context, I remark that the contribution of the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), to this debate is nothing other than cheap political grandstanding. He says he is interested in jobs, jobs, jobs; on the subject of interest rates, I think he is interested in the votes, votes, votes within his Caucus. </PARA>
<PARA>  To suggest that unemployment over the next few months is somehow or other going to be affected by whether the Reserve Bank drops the interest rates by half a per cent or one or 2 per cent or whether it leaves them where they are over the next couple of months is absolute economic nonsense. Mr Keating, better than anybody else on his side, ought to know that. He really ought not be linking current levels of employment with current levels of interest rates. It is an absolute absurdity in economic terms and he knows it. It demonstrates that it is nothing other than a political ploy for his own internal Party purposes. We must constantly remind the Australian public that the only sure prospect of delivering some sustainable gains on the employment front over the next few years is to accelerate the process of micro-economic reform. Accelerated progress in that area will deliver more dividends on the employment front than any short term manipulation or finetuning of interest rate levels or minuscule adjustments in fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The broad agenda of micro-economic reform; the change to a workplace bargaining system in industrial relations, which is the most important micro-economic reform of all; accelerated reforms of the waterfront and of the transport system; sensible investment by both the public sector and the private sector in infrastructure; and, of course, fundamental reform to Australia's taxation system--all of those things over the medium to longer term will deliver gains on the employment front because they will improve the general economic environment. It remains true today, as it was in the 1970s, that the only way that jobs are generated is by generating lasting and sustainable economic activity. Those in the Victorian Socialist Left or anywhere else who believe that in 1991 throwing a few hundred million dollars extra by way of economically dubious public works will achieve a lasting employment dividend are deluding themselves. I would say to the Government that, to the extent that it accelerates the process of micro-economic reform as being the true basis of reducing unemployment, it will have our lasting and sustainable support.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In the short time available in this debate, I begin by making a few observations about higher education funding and its effects. The first point I wish to make is that this Government, more than any previous government, has been responsible for the dramatic rise in the participation rate in higher education in Australia. The challenge of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to all Australians to become a clever country has been matched by the Government in unparalleled increases in expenditure on education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In response to the increasing demand for higher education across Australia, approximately $4 billion has been allocated this financial year, including extra funding to assist tertiary institutions with new buildings, research and additional enrolments. This represents a $200m increase in real terms. An additional $76m will be spent next year and $42m in 1993 to help tertiary institutions overcome pressures of overenrolments and overcrowding. This is in addition to a fresh allocation of $119m for academic salary increases this financial year. In the area of enrolment growth alone, the Hawke Government has allocated $70m over the next four years, including 13,000 new places in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>  Education remains one of the Hawke Government's fundamental priorities. Since it was first elected in 1983, the Hawke Government has continuously stressed its commitment to increase the level of skills in Australian society, particularly in the tertiary sector. It has matched its calls for excellence in education with ever-increasing budgetary allocations. In my own electorate of Herbert, the spectacular growth of James Cook University is in direct response to the enormous support that university has received from the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the time remaining for me in this debate, I refer to a number of developments at James Cook University which have important national significance. James Cook University was originally established in 1961 as a university college of the University of Queensland and became autonomous in 1970. The former Townsville College of Advanced Education merged with the University in 1982. James Cook University was Australia's first university in the tropics. Its student catchment area is approximately 750,000 square kilometres. It is the only higher education institute in a region three times the size of Victoria and the population of its catchment area exceeds that of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>  From 1970 until 1985, growth in student numbers at James Cook University was disappointing. The participation rate in higher education in north Queensland at that time was one-third the Australian average. I attribute much of the blame for denying thousands of north Queenslanders the opportunity of a tertiary education to the failures of past Liberal-National governments. Since 1985 student numbers have doubled. There are now nearly 7,000 students at James Cook University pursuing a wide variety of courses. About 10 per cent of its student load is at the higher degree level and there is a well-established research infrastructure in each of the university's major discipline areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  The university's rapid growth under the inspired leadership of its vice-chancellor, Professor Ray Golding, has increased demand for new facilities and buildings. Over the 1991-93 triennium, the Commonwealth Government has allocated $13.1m for capital projects at James Cook University. This includes $1.3m to complete a library extension. The total Federal funding for this project, which commenced in 1989, is $7.4m; $6.8m is allocated for a general purpose academic building, with funding commencing in 1991, and $4.5m for a biological sciences building, with funding to commence in 1992. In late 1988, a general purpose academic building at James Cook University was completed at a cost of nearly $4m funded by the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  Student residential accommodation at James Cook University is always in high demand. Accordingly, the Federal Government has contributed $500,000 towards the cost of construction of a project sponsored by Rotary to provide a student residential building to help meet live-in accommodation requirements for international students, as well as Australian students. </PARA>
<PARA>  James Cook University has also established and developed a number of research centres. This is in accord with the university's fundamental commitment to supporting research of the first rank that is relevant to Australia's needs and, in particular, to the development of north Queensland. The university maintains research and research training in many disciplines and has developed outstanding expertise in three broad areas. The first area is applied science and engineering, such as cyclone engineering, geosciences and geotechnology, with reference to mineral industries, information sciences and electronic engineering. The second area is life in the tropics, with activities in tropical veterinary science and animal production, and tropical ecosystems and their conservation and management. The third area is marine science and technology, including mariculture and fisheries, resources management of the Great Barrier Reef and coastal engineering. </PARA>
<PARA>  One such research centre is the Anton Breinl Centre for Tropical Health and Medicine. This centre had its genesis as part of a Labor Party policy for north Queensland which was developed prior to the 1980 Federal election. It was established by the university in 1986 after a long and exhaustive evaluation by the Federal Government on the need for such a facility in north Queensland. Honourable members would be interested to know that Australia's first medical research centre, the Australian Institute of Tropical Health, was established in Townsville in 1910 by the Commonwealth Government, and its first director was Dr Anton Breinl. In March this year a new director of the centre was appointed, Associate Professor Dr Rick Speare. The centre now has 15 postgraduate students. The work of the Anton Breinl Centre for Tropical Health and Medicine cannot be underestimated. </PARA>
<PARA>  Topics of research include the incidence of malaria and infectious disease such as the Ross River virus fever, diabetes among the people of Palm Island and hepatitis B. The work of the centre expanded last year with the establishment of a major research program on lymphatic filariasis in the western province of Papua New Guinea. The program has had enormous support from the local people. About 4,000 local people participated in the initial dosage program which was conducted in July this year. </PARA>
<PARA>  One new project involves research on the incidence of melioidosis. Over the past two years at least 237 people in Townsville have tested positive for antibodies to the tropical disease melioidosis. This disease was responsible for a number of deaths in northern Australia last wet season. The centre, in collaboration with the CSIRO in Townsville, is not only preparing a computerised soil map of Townsville suburbs to determine areas with the most likely host soils, but also developing a sensitive and reliable technique to isolate the bacterium from soils. The researchers at the Anton Breinl Centre hope that this exercise could set a pattern for the production of computerised locality maps on other tropical diseases such as Ross River fever, a serious, debilitating disease which is mentioned in a book I read recently on germ warfare. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Anton Breinl Centre is also hoping to obtain funding to develop a more rapid diagnostic test for melioidosis so that a more positive identification can be made within hours rather than one or two days, as is presently the case. Unquestionably, the Anton Breinl Centre is making a significant contribution to public health education and training in northern Australia. Already, the centre has shown an outstanding ability to respond to the needs of public health education and research in north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>  The initiatives announced in the Budget with respect to education, employment and training are without parallel in the history of this Government and certainly are unmatched by any initiatives taken by any previous Liberal-National Party government. I am confident that these initiatives will lead to a dramatic rise in the participation rate in tertiary education in this country. So the Australian people--relying on the Hawke Labor Government's commonsense, tenacity and vision for this country--will respond to the challenges announced by the Prime Minister to develop a clever country, enabling Australia in the twenty-first century to show the lead to the rest of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a few remarks on the appropriations to the employment, education and training area. A short time ago my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was alluding to the Opposition's great concern about the current level of unemployment in this country. The national seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in August was 9.8 per cent. We are now only too aware that over 800,000 Australians who wish to work cannot currently find a job. We know that that figure vastly understates the real truth, because we know that many people who are working are vastly underemployed; they are working only a very limited number of hours. Each of us in our role in our electorate is confronted almost daily with people who have given up any hope of gaining employment. They may have gone out of business and may be living off savings--they are making no real contribution to the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  My particular concern in respect of the unemployment figures is for Australian youth. In Queensland the unemployment rate for job seekers aged 15 to 19 is an horrific 29.5 per cent. In my seat of McPherson the figure is as high as 34.5 per cent--that is, over one-third of young people, people on whom to a large extent the future of Australia depends, cannot get jobs. These are the official figures. I believe that figure of over one-third in my electorate is also vastly understated. The prognosis for these young people is not good. They are devastated as they leave school and find that all that they have worked for and all that they have hoped for cannot be achieved and no jobs are available to them. As the honourable member for Bennelong pointed out, the social consequences of this unemployment rate will be enormous, immeasurable, and ongoing. For years to come we will not be able to overcome the problems that are created for us by these levels of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government desperately needs a solution to the unemployment problems it has created. Interestingly, its solution to some extent has been the development of training programs, and this appropriation deals with those. We have a plethora of them--for example, Jobtrain, Job Search and Jobstart. Members of parliament--I include myself--are confused about all these programs, some of them overlapping and some replacing others which have fallen by the wayside. We basically see the Government grasping at straws as it attempts to find some sort of solution and some way of getting these young people, in particular, into something that will be worth while. I am confronted daily with the even more pathetic situation of people in their forties and fifties who have for one reason or another become unemployed. The solution is retraining. They ask me--and I have no answer for them--`What am I going to retrain for? That temporarily puts me aside and takes me off the heap, but I am cast back onto it as soon as I have completed the retraining, because at the end there is no real job available to me'. </PARA>
<PARA>  I could go on at length about that aspect of this appropriation, but I now move on to one or two other areas that I want to touch on, one of which deals with the export of education services. I am fortunate to have the Bond University situated in my electorate. In this context, I refer very briefly to the Industry Commission's final report on the export of education services. There is no doubt that Australia has a comparative advantage in this area. We have the opportunity to earn export dollars for this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The number of international students coming to Australia has grown rapidly since 1986 when public institutions were first permitted to enrol them and charge fees. But major problems have emerged and the Industry Commission report is a damning indictment on the Government's handling of this particular aspect. </PARA>
<PARA>  Government regulation of this industry has been characterised by sudden shifts in policy direction. There is criticism that there was too little industry consultation prior to policy changes. The Industry Commission, in bringing down its report, points out to members of parliament and to the public that institution and government rules mean that we are losing international students, hence export income, as a result of government ineptitude in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>  This report says that the Commonwealth Government's 1986 decision to free up the export of education has led to major economic and social benefits for Australia and for students who come to study here. Gross 1991 exports of education were worth about $1 billion. But Australia's public universities, even where they have the capacity, do not accept all qualified international students. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commission points to the need for these rules to be changed. The report recognises that accepting all qualified international students would contrast with the treatment of domestic students. In 1991 up to 29,000 qualified Australian students were neither granted a university-funded place nor allowed to purchase a place in a public university. We know that this unmet demand problem will continue in 1992. The Commission concludes that funding arrangements for higher education domestic students are flawed. It recommends that the Commonwealth accept the need to alter current arrangements so that qualified domestic students not be precluded from a place in public universities. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commission also found that the recent history of frequent changes to visa processes and the ways these were made have resulted in confusion and a loss of market. There are many reasons why overseas students should want to come to study in Australia. It is a good place to study. We have an excellent education system, despite the problems that it has. We are able to attract students. In many respects it is a great pity that this particular program got off to such a bad start and that so many overseas students were disillusioned and had their fingers burned by their experiences with it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Bond University is making a great contribution in so many respects, particularly in receiving overseas students. Bond currently has 307 full fee paying overseas students, which represents roughly 25 per cent of the total student population. These students come from 23 different countries, the largest being Japan with 79 students, which represents 6.5 per cent of the student population. Every student at Bond is treated the same: each contributes directly to the costs of running the university. No overseas student takes up a place that an Australian would otherwise have, as vacancies exist in all schools. The fees there therefore contribute to the ongoing viability of the university. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am very pleased to tell the Parliament that Bond University spends half a million dollars each year actively recruiting in all major overseas markets, and it anticipates the flow of overseas students to continue. The university has just recently applied for the Queensland export award, based on the revenue earned by its overseas student population. It collected some $3.6m in tuition fees from overseas students in 1991. It is estimated that a further $3.8m in extra earnings was actually made indirectly as a result of those students studying at Bond. This amounts to a contribution of $7.6m to the local economy; it is a tremendous achievement. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise today to speak in relation to the education component in this year's Budget. This is the ninth Budget handed down by this Labor Government and it continues to build on the solid foundation already laid down in previous budgets. Under this Government, education funding has been constantly increased--a fact that the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), who has shown an admirable interest in education, would not deny--and this year it is expected to grow in real terms by 7.1 per cent. This represents the increasing emphasis on the importance of education for our nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Education is the single most important factor in determining an individual's future success, and collectively will determine this nation's success. Education is a long term investment and, as such, cannot satisfactorily be statistically measured as in inflation, unemployment, balance of payments and so on. Outcomes are long term. Therefore we need a coordinated long term strategy. We do not need some of the half-baked ideas of the Opposition on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  Because of this Government, we are now starting to see some very positive signs in education. Because this Government has placed greater emphasis on education policy, the community perception is also much higher and people are now much more aware than ever of the opportunities it creates for future employment. Indeed, one of the most disadvantaged schools in my electorate, the Parks High School, expects that next year year 11 and 12 together will make up two-thirds of its total enrolments. This, of course, includes a large number of adult students returning to further their education. </PARA>
<PARA>  Without this positive encouragement from the Government and the financial assistance from schemes such as Austudy and Abstudy, many people would not even get a first, let alone a second, chance to complete their secondary education. </PARA>
<PARA>  Austudy is a billion-dollar-plus program. In the Budget papers real outlays on Austudy are estimated to increase in 1991-91 by 18.3 per cent, reflecting the continuing effect of growth in the numbers of recipients. The major reasons for this are the large increases in school retention rates, additional funded tertiary places and over-enrolments in the higher education system. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last year 40 per cent of full time tertiary students received Austudy. This figure is expected to increase to 48 per cent in 1992. In secondary education the percentage of students receiving Austudy for the corresponding period is expected to increase from 33 per cent to 41 per cent. They are admirable improvements given the current economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA>  These increases reflect the Government's commitment to give working class kids the chance to reach their academic potential, something that has been denied to these kids for years and years under conservative governments. Unfortunately, Austudy has historically been awkward and cumbersome in its delivery. Recently, with other members of this House--including the honourable member for McPherson--I participated in the report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled Student Financial Assistance. I am pleased that several of the Committee's recommendations were implemented or partially implemented in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1992 all allowances, in addition to the parental-spouse income test, will be indexed in line with the consumer price index to maintain their real value. The minimum annual allowance of Austudy payable will be increased from $50 to $250. A flat reduction for each dependant will replace the sibling concession. This will financially benefit families on lower incomes with two or three dependant children. </PARA>
<PARA>  The sibling concession enabled some families in the past on relatively high salaries to receive some assistance under Austudy. For instance, a family of five children with a family income of $112,000 could receive Austudy assistance before the allowance ceased. Many of these students receiving small payments because of the sibling concession will find that from next year they will no longer be entitled to Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that this change will have no impact on their decision to continue studies in these situations but will ensure that the bulk of the assistance is targeted to those at the lower end of the scale. It also makes the increase in the number of recipients expected to receive Austudy even more impressive from a fairness aspect. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition to the changes regarding levels of income support, the Government has made some fundamental changes to the rules applying to educational requirements. From 1992 the existing minimum time rule for tertiary students will be modified to give students an extra half year or full year above the minimum length of their course. A full year will be added if the student is undertaking a course in which progress is calculated on the basis of a year's work or if at least one subject is a year long subject. </PARA>
<PARA>  A half semester will be added if the student's subjects are all semester subjects. These changes will give students more security in the knowledge that if for some reason they fail to complete successfully a part of their course they will continue to receive income maintenance while they do so. </PARA>
<PARA>  Adult secondary students will generally be treated in the same way as other secondary students. This will mean that the rule regarding adult secondary students repeating a year will be abolished. This will be very good news for those students who may have missed their educational chances in their adolescence. As you would know, Mr Deputy Chairman, studying as an adult can be rather difficult at times, considering the greater pressures which may occur such as financial commitments and family. An extra year may just take away some of those pressures. </PARA>
<PARA>  Education should be universal for all Australians regardless of age, family background or financial ability to pay. That is why the Opposition's proposal to replace existing funding arrangements to educational institutions with a voucher system will be perceived by the community as totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>  A voucher system which does not differentiate between the needs of individual students would discriminate quite severely against the less well-off families. It would create a large differential in the quality of education. It would benefit students attending the colleges of the Establishment to the detriment of public education. I suppose one comes to expect this sort of thing from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to know, for example, how the Opposition intends to sell this policy, or does it intend to sneak it through the back door to avoid public outcry? How do we tell a parent of a child with learning difficulties that there is no funding differential for these students? Do kids with physical and mental disabilities, who obviously have special needs, get the same amount of attention as is given in a normal classroom situation?</PARA>
<PARA>  Kids, regardless of their background and limitations, need to thrive in a school environment. They will thrive only if they are given the resources to create a situation of education excellence and, indeed, equality. Both State and Federal governments provide varying levels of programs aimed towards creating greater equality in education. </PARA>
<PARA>  Austudy, for example, continues to play a growing part in bringing up the overall education standards in Australia. Indeed, I believe that in Victoria retention rates for year 11 are now around 95 per cent. If a voucher system were introduced, it would not only mean creating a financial free kick to wealthy parents but it would also reduce the financial resources available to lower and middle income families. It would take education back decades where working class people were denied educational opportunities because the costs were prohibitive. In many cases, people accepted that their future would be in unskilled or semi-skilled employment and thought it normal because none of their friends continued in education past secondary level. Thankfully, that is no longer the situation today. </PARA>
<PARA>  What would happen under the coalition's education policy to our aspirations to be a `clever country'? They would go straight down the gurgler, along with the school retention rates. The 1986 Australian Bureau of Statistics figures are proof of what happened in those times and this is what the conservatives would like to reintroduce. It is interesting to note that 23 per cent and 18 per cent respectively of the populations of the wealthy electorates of Kooyong in Victoria and Boothby in South Australia have attained tertiary education compared with 4.7 per cent in my electorate of Port Adelaide. I am hoping that, after this year's census information is collated, that gap has been considerably reduced. </PARA>
<PARA>  In contrast to the Opposition, the Government does care about education. Between the Government's 1988 White Paper on higher education and 1993, nearly 75,000 new places will have been created for Australian students. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government also has a commitment to substantial real increases in per capita general recurrent grants to both government and non-government schools, in addition to providing financial assistance to eligible students in year 11 and onwards. Unfortunately, the funding set aside in this Budget for early intervention strategies in child literacy went fairly unnoticed by the education community and the media. </PARA>
<PARA>  This program, combined with the good schools strategy announced earlier this year by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), could be the foundation for the introduction of preventative approaches to education--something which has been sadly lacking in Australian education in the past. We have in the past spent too much money too late on education. In the long term, preventative approaches to education are much cheaper. I am pleased that with this initiative the Government has recognised the importance of early intervention. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In his recent Budget Speech, the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) stated that `the Government's retirement income policy aims to ensure that all Australians have a secure income in retirement'. I believe that very few Australians would disagree with that principle. Indeed, as far as I can establish from my readings, it is supported across a wide spectrum of our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  For example, the chief executive officer of the Business Council of Australia stated in the Council's September bulletin that `the development of a fundamentally sound retirement incomes policy has to be supported when one considers the future demographics of Australia'. Similarly, the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia warned in February last that a universal superannuation scheme for workers must be introduced to cope with the ageing population of the future. And the Opposition's 1989 retirement incomes policy stated that it will ensure that superannuation or similar saving arrangements are available to the entire work force, with the objective of achieving universal coverage on a voluntary basis. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are numerous other examples of business and community support for the principle of universal income security in retirement. What is at issue is not the principle but the nature and timing of the many and diverse steps taken by the Labor Government to achieve this objective. </PARA>
<PARA>  The history of superannuation in Australia over the past eight years has been the classic story of two paces forward and one pace back. If it had been just the two paces forward and one back, it might have been acceptable. But instead, this pattern of ill-considered and poorly timed and structured advances has gone on year after year, with constant adjustments and backtracking as weaknesses and errors have been identified. </PARA>
<PARA>  The 1991 Budget is a case in point. The Treasurer had to admit that the 1986 3 per cent superannuation package has not been fully complied with and that the Government has decided to respond with a superannuation guarantee levy, to commence in 1993. As part of that legislative package, the Government proposes to set prescribed levels of superannuation support which must be provided by employers to all employees--in other words, a compulsory non-contributory scheme. Employers not meeting the prescribed levels will be liable to a levy which will not be deductible for tax purposes. The overall objective is to increase the prescribed level of superannuation to 9 per cent of earnings by the year 2000. The Treasurer indicated that concessions would be available to small businesses and that employee contributions might be a future option. </PARA>
<PARA>  In looking at the history of superannuation over the eight years of Labor administrations, it is interesting to note that the Australian Labor Party came to office in 1983 with a platform which called for a national superannuation scheme. However, this was overtaken almost from the start by the lesser objective of occupational superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whether it be occupational or national superannuation is not the real issue for the business community, superannuation funds and individuals. For them, it is having to cope with the complexity and confusion of eight years of changes made by this Government since coming to office in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>  Consider the following summary of just some of the changes over those eight years. From July 1983, lump sum superannuation and retirement benefits became subject to new taxation arrangements. From July 1984 the 30/20 rule was abolished. From July 1985, employee contributions to employer sponsored funds lost their rebatable status and lump sum benefit taxation arrangements were adjusted. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 4 September 1985 the Government announced that it had reached agreement with the ACTU for the discounting of wage indexation and for ongoing wage restraint. One element included a delay and moderation in the national productivity case, where the 4 per cent productivity claim was reduced to 3 per cent and paid in the form of improved occupational superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 16 November 1985, the Government issued guidelines for the implementation of the proposed productivity decision. Subsequent modifications to those arrangements were made on 11 June 1986, 30 July 1986 and 22 December 1986. On 14 May 1987, extensive superannuation legislation was introduced into Parliament to give effect to the above decisions. In 1988, another round of major reforms occurred largely intended to correct inadequacies arising from earlier decisions. The August 1988 Budget saw another round of considerable modifications with the main change being intended to reduce the differential treatment of contributions from different sources. At the same time, the Government announced its retirement incomes policy, sections of which had and will have important implications for superannuation beneficiaries. Finally, we have the present Budget with its guarantee levy and compulsory non-contributory superannuation arrangements for all employees of up to 9 per cent of earnings by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA>  What can be said about all this? At the best of times, superannuation is a subject of considerable complexity and one that is little understood probably by most ordinary people. Surely of concern to the Government must be the frequency with which informed superannuation industry spokespersons are commenting on the increasing difficulty they are facing in having their own advisers understand the implications of these continually changing policies and the very important concern about their ability to give accurate and appropriate advice to their clients. Even more worrying is that, despite eight years of piecemeal change, it is widely acknowledged within the industry that superannuation is still in a state of flux and in need of further considerable and significant modification to meet much needed policy objectives and to overcome the existing inadequacies and uncertainties. </PARA>
<PARA>  What has been overlooked by this Government, in my view, is that superannuation is basically a long term arrangement that influences the behaviour of government and the community over many decades. Because of that, it is a subject which does not lend itself to piecemeal adjustment. Businesses and individuals alike want a stable, certain and predictable environment in which to plan for their employees' or their own retirement futures. This becomes the more so when it is apparent that there are vitally important changes taking place in the relationship between superannuation and the age pension and in the eventual outcomes. I believe it is no exaggeration to state that businesses and individuals find themselves, in 1991, in a position where the complexities and confusion are so great that long term planning is, at best, fraught with uncertainty and is, at worst, well nigh impossible. </PARA>
<PARA>  A number of matters require urgent attention, the most important being the effect of these many changes on saving and investment patterns; the eventual role of the union in industry superannuation funds; the cost of administering such a complex set of arrangements; the continuing weakness within these arrangements for lump sum payments to be taken and spent--and I am talking about the double-dipping problem; the timing of the latest round of changes and the need for some flexibility with the introduction date of July 1992, if the present recession should persist well into 1992; and, finally, whether future accord based national wage case decisions will be consistent with the superannuation program. Each one of those subjects warrants detailed and careful consideration and is obviously beyond the scope of the time available to me today. However, they have been well covered by a number of respected analysts and their implications should be well known to this Government. The real need now is for the Government to have the leadership and the resolve necessary to effectively address these remaining weaknesses. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, I would make the observation that there appears to be a well identified trend overseas to decrease the role of social security and the provision of retirement income and increase the role of occupational superannuation and private retirement savings. This Government has made a somewhat impetuous and disorganised start in the direction of occupational superannuation and has really done little more than scratch the surface of encouraging increased personal responsibility. The move towards greater personal responsibility in providing for retirement coupled with the inevitable freeing of the Australian labour market will put enormous pressure on government for increased flexibility in our superannuation arrangements. The Government must meet that challenge with more effective and visionary policy directions than we have witnessed to date. Businesses and individuals deserve a more certain climate than they have been presented with over the long term of this Government's mismanagement of the superannuation problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1991-92 and the Department of Employment, Education and Training estimates, I wish particularly to talk about program 4: labour market program assistance. In my speech on the second reading, I commented about this matter and, whilst there was some $600m allocated in this year's Budget, I queried whether that was sufficient. I just wish to make some remarks that will reinforce those comments I made earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In that speech I talked about the needs of those who had been working in manufacturing industry, who had found themselves retrenched and were then going into training courses to try to give them the capacity at some later stage, as the economy picks up, to be able to compete in what is going to be a very competitive labour market. At that time, there had also been some concern expressed in my electorate that, whilst we had identified the need for industry plans, especially with the textile, clothing and footwear labour adjustment package and the PMV--the passenger motor vehicle--labour adjustment package, given the way the work force was scattered especially throughout, in my case, the northern suburbs of Melbourne, the impact of job losses in those industries might be hidden. </PARA>
<PARA>  Several weeks ago, I had discussions with the local CES office and was pleased to find that, whilst it may be somewhat belated, there was an exercise being carried out especially to identify those on the registers who were from those industries. The problem was that many of the factories in those industries were not in the local area, whereas the employees and ex-employees were. So I was pleased to see that steps were being taken which would ensure that those people were identified. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was more than pleased, then, last Thursday to be involved in a graduation ceremony conducted by the Northcote library, which conducted a language and literacy program for textile, clothing and footwear retrenchees. Some 11 people graduated that night. They came from the northern suburbs of Melbourne, from Northcote right through to the suburbs of Lalor, Bundoora and Mill Park in my electorate. Many of those who were involved in this program had been previously employed in TCF industries, in some cases for over 20 years. They had the difficulty of not having had formal training for some 20 or 30 years. They were all from non-English speaking backgrounds, and in a number of cases they had very little English. </PARA>
<PARA>  Seeing those people at the end of their 17-week course, and the increase in confidence, their apparent improvement in self-esteem and their keenness to go on to further training, I think makes it worthwhile. In my speech on the second reading I emphasised that it is not just a matter of looking at the different literature that we put out with the Budget and seeing the dollar figure that is allocated; it is very much a matter of talking about outcomes--not only for the individual, but in the national sense. In this case, whilst it is anecdotal, seeing the outcome on the individual basis and the effect on the people who were involved in that program was very satisfying. </PARA>
<PARA>  But, as a result of this topic having been raised, the difficulties that confront many of the people about whom we are talking have been illustrated. I quote from some briefing notes that were provided to me by Julie McQueen, the coordinator of adult literacy and basic education with Northcote library. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>The students have shown amazing dedication and effort. Many have not been at school for 20 or 30 years, and moving into full-time education is a difficult step. Students were asked to try new things and take chances. In class, they no longer saw themselves as the experts that they were on the job, and they were not sure where "education" was leading them. As well, they had to come to terms with the frustration, anger and bruised self-image they have as retrenched workers. Now students see themselves as learners, they are recognising their strengths and their gains. </PARA>
<PARA>All of those whom I talked to after graduation indicated that they were going on to further training. They indicated that they were still of course seeking full time employment but understood that their job opportunities would be increased by entering into further training. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Northcote library has an extensive adult literacy and basic education program. It has both part time and full time courses that are funded from a number of sources, including the State Government and the Commonwealth Government. The course that it conducted under this TCF package money ran for 17 weeks. It was a 20 hours per week program which included literacy, numeracy, computer skills, work skills, community access, and communication skills. </PARA>
<PARA>  The students produced for their graduation a booklet entitled Stories of Hard Workers and Retrenchment, and it contains some very moving comments about their early times when they first migrated to Australia and their feelings toward their present predicament. There are some very sad stories about the circumstances in which they found themselves unemployed. One person arrived at work to find literally the factory had closed down. He had no access to any wages owed to him, he had difficulty in chasing up his group certificate and he had no employment separation certificate to show the CES and therefore found difficulty in qualifying for unemployment benefits. People who have gone through that sort of trauma need the large degree of support that is provided by such programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  As was emphasised to me, the Northcote library prides itself on giving a community base for the work it is doing. I would like to say to the two Marias, Fotini, Jeya, Frances, Sonia, Effie, Voula, Vesna, David and Kiriakos, who graduated last week, that I wish them all the best and every success in their future endeavours. It was interesting to me that, without any prompting, Kiriakos, who turned out to be one of my constituents, said not only that there was need for courses such as the one that he had been through in the city of Northcote but also that he hoped there would be courses provided in the city of Whittlesea, where he lives. That is what I wanted to reinforce about where we are going with these types of training programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is one sour note to the experience of these 11 people. The Government provides a formal training allowance to assist with the added costs that these people might incur in undertaking the training. Unfortunately, nine of the individuals experienced delays of up to 12 weeks; that is, they got their allowance in the twelfth week of the 17 week course. We have centralised the payment of these benefits through an office in Indooroopilly and it was hard for these people to understand, while going through a community based training program, that the benefit they were eligible for was being paid through an office some 3,000 kilometres away. I think that is something we should be looking at. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was not the first instance of problems of this nature being brought to my attention. Another constituent, from Watsonia, came to see me. She is a sole parent who was going through a pre-apprenticeship training program. She started the training on 31 July and filled out the forms prior to commencement of the course. She completed the course on 20 September but had not received any of the training allowance. I think her comments to me put this in context. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>May I say, it is costing me an extra $70 per week for child minding and travelling expenses. </PARA>
<PARA>She was applying for $30 retraining allowance. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The government seems keen to get people like me off the pension and into the workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>She saw that delay in the allowance as being very much a disincentive towards the achievement of that. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise this afternoon to contribute to the Appropriation Bill (No.1) debate with regard to employment, education and training. I would like in general to confine my remarks to the education and training sector of the portfolio. I commence by noting that, on my calculations, the overall increase in expenditure in employment, education and training in this year's Budget is some 7.7 per cent in nominal terms but we have increased the allocation for student financial expenditure by 18.5 per cent and general administration--that is, the bureaucracy--by 18.7 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I would question the logic--as I have previously--of increasing overheads and administrative expense to the detriment of teacher salaries, of capital infrastructure and of places in all of our tertiary institutions for students to meet the pent-up demand which has occurred throughout Australian society over the past decade. I note that recent estimates of unmet demand for the next student financial year are now being raised to the order of 30,000 places in universities. I believe the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has recently said that we will cut the intake next year and that will allow us to help meet the Budget. That means another 5 per cent of students who are qualified to go to university will not have places available. There are upwards of 120,000 full-time unmet places demanded in TAFE. I suggest that is a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA>  Surely, at the beginning of the 1990s when we in this place have helped to create expectations in the community of places in higher education, when we have encouraged people to continue their education, and when the recession we had to have has made it incumbent on many young people to continue their education as there are no jobs for them, we must have a responsibility to make places available. We pass no test for equity if we cannot provide access for those young people and those re-entering adults who now wish to participate in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my electorate we have very poor provision for tertiary studies. We have no tertiary facility of any nature, neither a TAFE nor a university. I note that the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) said that his electorate was particularly disadvantaged, having a participation rate of some 4.7 per cent, I believe he said, for 17- through 24-year-olds. In my electorate of La Trobe in one area the figure is approximately 8 per cent, in another area it is less than 6 per cent and in another area it is 4 per cent, so we have a massive disadvantage which we hope to address, with the Government's assistance, through the provision of university colleges or universities in two new areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not good enough that our youth continues at school without goals and without direction. We must decide in Australia for what reason we educate our population or we may well educate without effect. In some other countries, such as the United States, industry has decreed that it wishes the public education system to produce outputs--that is, individuals--who are well educated in general terms with high standards of literacy and numeracy and with an ability to learn. With such general grounding, industry will then supply the discrete training required to satisfy industry's need for competence in specific tasks. </PARA>
<PARA>  Other countries, such as Germany, have created a dual stream education system where some portion of the young student population is, at an early age, directed towards academic studies and ultimate tertiary qualification. However, the majority of the student population in Germany is directed into vocational studies with some academic training which will lead towards real jobs in the real world of work. The American system works well for Americans and the German system works well for Germans. But Australia must develop its own system of education and training which will serve the needs of our individuals and the needs of Australian industry, business and commerce. </PARA>
<PARA>  Prior to the 1980s there was little need for Australia to be supercompetitive with the rest of the world, but with our small population, our large land mass and abundant natural resources we were able to support one of the world's highest standards of living through a combination of largely self-sufficient food supply, together with export of raw or semi-processed materials, minerals and agricultural products. A high tariff wall protected local production of manufactured products and our export income paid for our import of manufactured goods which were either uneconomical to manufacture locally or beyond our capabilities technologically. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately for Australia, rapid advancement in technology in the 1970s and 1980s has led to a very real decrease in the value of raw materials, including agricultural products, and an increase in return for value adding industries which has left Australia behind and in the grip of an ever-decreasing standard of living. In the same historical sense, our manufacturing and process industries developed along the lines of traditional British colonial top heavy management and craft based trade union structure. That structure set up very rigid and fixed skills training paths that were appropriate to the craft delineation or demarcations which applied in industry. A young person who wished to be a bricklayer obtained an apprenticeship with a company devoted to bricklaying, studied bricklaying and learned bricklaying on the job, and was expected to lay bricks for the rest of his life. If by himself he managed somehow to obtain carpentry skills, and at home in his own time and on weekends he made furniture for the family, those skills were nonetheless unrecognised and he was not allowed to use those skills at work in his real employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The concept that at work only an electrician is allowed to change a light bulb and only a plumber is allowed to change a tap washer is still alive and well in Australia in the beginning of the 1990s. The craft skills concept and the demarcation concepts no longer have relevance in other countries whose economies have long since left Australia's behind. If we wish to survive in the twenty-first century and if we wish to return to a position of having one of the highest standards of living in the world, we must give away our training concept based on craft and demarcation and rapidly move to an advanced system of training which is flexible, adaptable to needs, relevant to modern technology, applicable to the desires and capabilities of individuals and capable of certification and practical and financial recognition. Our training must be equal to world best standards according to world best practice and achieve world best outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA>  Until tertiary education was disrupted by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) in his interventionist amalgamation philosophy, it had largely developed along British lines. Over time our universities and institutes of technology developed their own fields of individual expertise and their own standards of excellence in specific areas of curriculum concentration and research effort. In Australia we have not encouraged the private provision of tertiary education, with the result that almost all degree work must be undertaken in State funded and State run institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have achieved a high standard of excellence without external competition, but that is no doubt attributable more to student number restrictions than to competitive forces. The new unified national system, which is designed to force amalgamation between smaller universities, institutes of technology and colleges of advanced education, is premised on a concept that big is beautiful and that cost efficiency through reduction in expenditure on bureaucracy can be achieved through amalgamation and creation of larger units. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is clear that we have a major problem with access to our tertiary institutions. Youth are being turned away from our universities in increasing numbers because of the lack of capital funding for facilities and recurrent funding for teachers and staff. It is my view that we must find a better and more equitable funding mix to allow all of our youth who are qualified to attend a university of their choice. (Time expired)</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for his question and, of course, for being a member of the delegation which I led to five of the European Community capitals last week to protest the effects of the grain subsidies war on Australian farmers. I take the opportunity to thank all members of the delegation from both this House and the other House for participating in that delegation. I have no doubt that the delegation's efforts were worthwhile in getting the message across to the European leaders of the extent of the damage that is being done to Australian farmers by the export subsidy war between the United States and the European Community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It became clear to us that there would be no cease-fire in the subsidies war--no minimisation of that conflict--unless the Uruguay Round agricultural negotiations were successfully concluded. I have to say to the honourable member and other members that the signals the delegation received on that point were mixed. Clearly, the Germans and the Dutch recognised the urgency of the situation and the importance of a good result to the world as a whole. Both were optimistic that a breakthrough was imminent. The delegation did not receive the same message in Paris. The French were still very resistant to any change and rather insensitive to the urgency and the universal nature of the need.</PARA>
<PARA>  In meeting with the European commissioners in Brussels, the delegation reinforced the need for the European Community to show urgently the flexibility in order to negotiate a satisfactory outcome. The delegation pointed out quite clearly that, given the time framework, the next six weeks were critical. This was a message I repeated when I met the GATT Director-General, Arthur Dunkel, on Monday of this week in Geneva. I told Mr Dunkel that I shared his view that the next five or six weeks were a make or break time for the Round.</PARA>
<PARA>  I indicated that we in the Cairns Group would do everything possible to bridge the gaps that remain in the negotiations. I expressed the view of Australia, and of the Cairns Group, that if significant gaps did remain then the Director-General would need to bring down a courageous paper setting out a framework agreement for the Round on a take it or leave it basis. I made it clear that Australia will not take it if the paper offers less than a substantial result on agriculture. We will not be pushed into a cosmetic, low level outcome just because time is running out.</PARA>
<PARA>  We spelled out that for Australia and for the Cairns Group we must have a substantial outcome--one which ensures irreversible commitment to reform on internal support, on market access and on export subsidies over an acceptable period. We are ready to negotiate; we are ready to make compromises; we are ready to be flexible. But the prerequisite to any agreement is a structure which guarantees long term reform.</PARA>
<PARA>  We should be quite clear now what the alternatives are in the next few weeks. If the European Community indicates long awaited flexibility and Mr Dunkel is able to produce a paper which all participants take as a basis for agreement, then the prospects for the Round are good. But if he is unable to produce such a paper offering a basis for consensus and participants leave rather than take his proposals, this will almost certainly mean the end of the agricultural negotiations and the Uruguay Round as a whole within the current time framework.</PARA>
<PARA>  There is no doubt that that strategy involves high risks. But I believe now that it is the only hope of salvaging a round of critical importance not just to Australia but to the whole world.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That was a much better question, Mr Acting Speaker. One of the proudest claims of this Government is that we fixed up a tax system which when we came to office was in disrepair and disrepute. The honourable member for Blaxland was tireless in fixing up the legacy that we inherited. It was an institutional and administrative cesspit, and the payment of tax was an optional extra for the spivs and the vipers who were allowed to take decent Australians to the cleaners. That was the system we inherited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Honourable members opposite allowed that because the honourable member for Bennelong and his economic adviser, the current Leader of the Opposition, did not really think it was important, or rejected change because of sterile and narrow ideological grounds, or could not wield sufficient clout to push the change through the Cabinet. In short, when the Leader of the Opposition was advising on economic policy, these were the years of indolence, ideology and incompetence.</PARA>
<PARA>  We can contrast that shabby, tawdry legacy with the major reforms of this Government--capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, the abolition of entertainment allowances, dividend imputation, the resource rent tax, substantiation requirements, foreign income taxation reform, removal of the foreign tax havens and cash transactions. The list goes on and on. We fixed up the mess honourable members opposite left us.</PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, this Government has provided the Australian Taxation Office with the legislative and administrative resources necessary to run a modern taxation system. Simplification, self-assessment and electronic lodgment are the characteristics that will define the tax system in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>  The whole approach to tax by the Australian Taxation Office has been transformed to focusing on individuals as customers. While the Hawke Government has worked and is still working to make the tax system fairer and more efficient, the Opposition is heading in the opposite direction. What it is doing is proposing the introduction of a manifestly unfair consumption tax. It is proposing to burden every business in this country with the task of tax administration. Every farmer--I must tell this to the Leader of the National Party--every small business, every shop owner and every contractor will be required to collect tax on behalf of the government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I was informing the House about tax administration, which was the nub of the question. I was talking about New Zealand because there, in terms of administering a consumption tax, the number of taxpayers expanded tenfold. Each return takes about four hours. The compliance cost is assessed at $500 per taxpayer and the cost of collection is about 3.8 per cent of the total revenue collected. As well as that, about 35 per cent of the total tax collected is refunded. Therefore, the auditing procedures are also unduly complex. The New Zealand Inland Revenue Department had to employ an additional 1,000 staff to administer the consumption tax when it was introduced. As I have said, the auditing process has to take account of risk for fraud. As I said yesterday, when the 10 per cent GST was introduced, that increased the CPI by 6 to 7 per cent and through the period of absorbing that tax interest rates went up to 25 per cent and inflation went up to 19 per cent.

Can the Minister inform the House of the Government's position in relation to the disadvantages to the farm sector identified in that paper?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for his question. Yes, my attention has been drawn to the paper. In fact, it was sent to me by the National Farmers Federation last month. It is interesting to go to a section of that report, which is prepared by the Research Director of the National Farmers Federation, which lists the main groups that would be disadvantaged by the tax reforms that are being touted by the Opposition. Apart from other areas in which it indicates that groups would be disadvantaged, one significant group that would be disadvantaged is that of low income households and large families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The National Party really needs to look carefully at this document, not because of what it claims is the veiled support for the proposition that it is endorsing in the coalition, but because of the real concerns that the document raises. In the time that I have spent in this portfolio and as I have travelled into the rural community, many concerns have been expressed by that section of the community. The fact is that in the main this very group that is referred to as being disadvantaged represents farm families. They are low income families and they are large families--larger than the average.</PARA>
<PARA>  The question of income is important because the coalition is trying to grapple with the compensation package. It is important to note that this year 45 per cent of farm families are not expected to pay any tax. Against that background, how can an effective compensation package be developed? That is the question that the Opposition has to answer. That is the case this year. For those who want to take heart from the fact that it is only as a consequence of this year that this issue is raised, I draw attention to the fact that generally farm incomes have been lower than the average in the general community. In fact, over the past nine years the average income for farm families was $12,000, as against the average for the community generally of $20,000. A goods and services tax will disadvantage low income families, which includes farmers, because low income families spend proportionately more of their income than do high income families.</PARA>
<PARA>  If honourable members opposite couple with that this notion, which has not yet been denied by the Opposition, that it is planning to introduce a flat rate tax, there is double regression, firstly, because people on low incomes, and farmers in particular, will proportionately pay more tax as a consequence of the consumption patterns and, secondly, because the flat tax will advantage high income earners as distinct from low income earners.</PARA>
<PARA>  The second point that needs to be understood properly by the coalition, and in particular the National Party, is that farm families pay more than the rest of the community. It is interesting, because in the honourable member for Kennedy's own State of Queensland the Government Statistician recently produced a survey which showed that regional prices in Queensland were some 8 per cent higher than those in urban centres. That difference compounds the effect of a goods and services tax. If it is a 15 per cent tax, that compounding effect is 1.2 per cent on top, and if it is a 22 per cent tax--which has not been denied--it is almost 1.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>  But there is one specific area that should be of interest to members of the National Party, because when the Budget was brought down they came into this Parliament expressing concern for the children of farm families in isolated circumstances and about what they claimed the Budget had not done. The question of schooling costs is a particular concern for people in the farm community. If we look at the data from the review of assistance for the isolated children's scheme, we see that, of the 14,500 students receiving assistance under that scheme, 9,000 were attending boarding school and the majority of those students were children from farming families. On average, two kids per family were enrolled in school, with the nearest government year 12 school over 96 kilometres away.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the analysis that was done in that report, the average boarding school fees paid by children under AIC were close to $4,000. The transport costs were averaged out at between $580 and $648. There was no estimate of the average tuition fee, but a figure of $5,000 would not be an overestimate.</PARA>
<PARA>  That means that, if a goods and services tax is introduced at 15 per cent, those farm families with an average of two children will have to pay an additional $3,000 per year just to send their kids to school. If it is a 22 per cent tax, the figure goes to $4,230. I think members of the National Party ought to have proper regard for this. They cannot come into this House piously claiming that this Government has not done enough in terms of Austudy and the isolated children's allowance when their own policy will add significantly to the costs of schooling for children of farm families.</PARA>
<PARA>  The final point that I would make is this: I believe the National Party has blindly supported this goods and services tax in a desperate attempt to prop up coalition fortunes. The fact of the matter is that in blithely supporting it they have deserted their constituency. They have not treated this suggestion with the rigour it deserves, and for so long as we are on this side of the House and until such time as the Opposition releases the details, we will continue to draw attention to the anomalies. Why does the Opposition not get the details on the table so that its tax can be subjected to even more rigour? The Opposition has deserted these people; we will look after their interests.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I advise the honourable member for Moreton that Commonwealth payments for student assistance have nearly trebled in real terms over the past six years. They are up 178 per cent, due essentially to three factors. Firstly, there have been increases in the real rate of benefit, with the maximum benefit for age 18-plus students living away from home up 13 per cent in real terms since 1986. The maximum benefit for a secondary student living at home is up 30 per cent in real terms since 1986. The second factor is the increased numbers, with higher participation and higher education in senior secondary schools and extensions of eligibility in secondary schools. Recipient numbers have more than doubled in the last six years. On an earlier occasion I described the set of measures that we announced in this year's Budget to produce a more equitable, more flexible and more broadly accessible scheme. These changes have been welcomed by student organisations and the Government now has a consultant looking at broader issues to do with the structure of student income support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In the second part of the honourable member's question he asked about potential threats to the position of students. Quite frankly, there are some very serious threats on the horizon--particularly those coming from the Opposition. If the Opposition spokesperson on education matters, the honourable member for Goldstein--also known as Count Yorga, vampire, because of the way he wants to get his fangs into student finances--is able to carry out those threats, students are facing a grim situation indeed. We are talking about an Opposition that is looking for $3 billion in expenditure cuts. How will that be achieved without eating into student finances?</PARA>
<PARA>  Frankly, we have not seen anything of significance from the honourable member for Goldstein about what the Opposition proposes to do on student income support. The only statement of any substance that we have heard thus far has been from the honourable member for La Trobe, whose proposal was to abolish all classes of secondary Austudy and to convert tertiary Austudy into a loan scheme. It is pretty grim, but it would be even worse for the higher education sector as a whole if this proposal floating around in certain circles for a goods and services tax were to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA>  Were that to be done, of course, the higher education sector would be slugged in three ways. First, the Opposition has made it perfectly clear that it is on about a proliferation of the full fee paying arrangements. Of course, if a goods and services tax is applied to that and one is looking at something of the order of $12,000 average per annum in student fees--and if those charged to overseas students are anything to go by, one is looking at $12,000 on average--that works out at about $1,800. That is the first respect.</PARA>
<PARA>  The second respect would be the impact on higher education institutions themselves. They are, of course, currently exempted from sales tax under the sales tax legislation. Something of the order of $1.4 billion a year is spent by higher education institutions on goods and services which would be potentially subject to this goods and services tax. If it were levied at 15 per cent, one would be looking at an impost on higher education institutions per annum of $210m. If it were levied at a rate of 22 per cent, one would be looking at $310m. What does the honourable member for Goldstein have to say about this massive financial impost on institutions and on students?</PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, I turn to how the goods and services tax would impact on students in a direct sense. We do have some information on the pattern of student expenditure as result of surveys done by the National Union of Students and also by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. We know that an average student spends around $3,200 on accommodation and food--not taxed at the moment. Under a 15 per cent coalition consumption tax, there would be a tax of $480 per annum paid on that; and at 22 per cent, it would be $704. The average student spends around $850 on course related costs, particularly books, not currently subject to tax. Under a 15 per cent tax, one will be looking at $125; under a 22 per cent tax, one will be looking at $187.</PARA>
<PARA>  I have a typical university textbook named Foundations for Australian Political Analysis: Politics and Authority by one D. A. Kemp. The retail price is $32.50. Every student unfortunate enough to be in a course for which this book is a prescribed text will be liable to pay $4.88 on top of that $32.50.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for his question, which goes to part of a comprehensive package that the Government announced in relation to the Budget. I want to spend a moment on the comprehensiveness of that package, which certainly went far beyond the issue of co-payments. We have a problem in the growth of medical services in this country. That was documented in the Deeble report and in the second background paper which came out of the national health strategy. One can deal with that problem in a range of areas, which we sought to do in the Budget context. For example, there were a number of changes to radiology, pathology and diagnostic services, which I hope all members of parliament would support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>   There was also a recognition that general practice required attention, both in the growth in the number of services in the general practice area and in the deterioration in the quality of the service being provided by general practice. The Government was concerned with the growth in the number of services. The Government was also concerned to have improvements in the quality of service. I indicate no desire on the part of the Government to finally determine or to direct on the question of quality; that is something the profession can make its own judgment about. But the view is that the pressures that exist in relation to general practice are producing not only a growth in services but also a deterioration in the quality of service being provided. The Government, if it is to deal with that issue, needs to deal with its various aspects.</PARA>
<PARA>  Part of the approach that the Government announced in this year's Budget also went to the question of Supply. It is well known, as shown by the Government's study of these issues and also by the AMA and the medical profession, that we have an oversupply of doctors in general practice in this country. That has produced a situation in which doctors are pressured to overservice to make up their income in a situation of great competition. So questions of supply obviously need to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Government made some proposals in the Budget in the area of co-payments--this was referred to by the honourable member--linked to proposed changes to the rebate. The Government, through processes within the Party, has sought to address all those issues. As this is a far-reaching package, our concern is to get to the root of the matter, to develop good policy, to ensure that we get a handle on the costs so that we are able to restrain costs in the longer term, and to do something comparable to the reforms to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme last year, but to ensure that over time what has been the finest system of health insurance and health care in this country, in the form of Medicare, is enhanced and strengthened. We link that to a process of reform of health care.</PARA>
<PARA>  Unlike the Opposition, this Government has a history of directing itself to fundamental reform. It is a tradition that will continue. We have an Opposition that has had eight years in opposition and many opportunities to develop some line of coherent policy, but what do we get from the Opposition? We get very little contribution to this Parliament, almost no questions from the Opposition spokesmen, and no indications of what its policy might be. The Government is in the business of making policy, making it credible and ensuring it fits our very tight Budget strategy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for Hunter for his question. I was very proud last week to be able to go to Brisbane with the Chief of the General Staff to launch the national recruiting campaign for the ADF's new Ready Reserve scheme. This is a fine, new, innovative scheme. The defence chiefs are to be congratulated for the way in which they have come up with a proposal which is going to be effective and a cost efficient way of providing the defence forces with the highly skilled and highly motivated people that they need to discharge the important tasks which they carry out on behalf of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  May I say that I was very impressed by the enthusiasm of the young students in Brisbane who are in their final years of high school. They took a very keen interest and indicated that they would be very interested in participating in the scheme. The Opposition is against those contributions from the defence chiefs and the clear interest of the young people of this country. The Opposition, as usual, has done nothing but carp against this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is going to be very interesting at some time in the distant future finally to hear what the Opposition's policy is. You will recall, Mr Acting Speaker, that in January of this year the Leader of the Opposition promised us an urgent--his word--review of the Opposition's defence policy. It is now October. That gives some idea of the Opposition's sense of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA>  When the Leader of the Opposition was in Washington in July of this year he gave his hosts a very clear idea of what his defence review would be about. He spoke very big to impress his hosts. The language was large. He said that the Gulf war raised questions about our capacity to operate in other parts of the world. He said that the Opposition would `address the issue of our capability to participate in such operations in other parts of the world, and our capacity to do so'. After being in Washington and talking large to his hosts, he returned to Canberra. And back here in Canberra things started to look different. At least they do to his defence spokesman.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is Senator Durack. Last month he had something to say about it when he was talking to the RSL. This is what the defence spokesman, after the large talk of the Leader of the Opposition in Washington about what the Opposition would do about overseas contributions, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The direct defence of Australia must always be the first priority to be satisfied in buying defence equipment. Equipment which provides other capabilities, like the capacity to operate far from our shores, must take a lower priority.</PARA>
<PARA>It looks as though Senator Durack has dumped the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the Opposition has now had another think. He has probably discovered that the flash rhetoric that he used in Washington does not quite match up with the hard fiscal realities.</PARA>
<PARA>  We have the position that the grand strategic vision that he outlined to his host in Washington does not quite match the job he has to do when he sits down to try to make his tax policy work. The postures in Washington of this amateur strategist had to give way to the modelling with a computer which he sits down and fiddles around with as he tries to work out where he is going with his tax policy. The fact is that the defence of Australia is, and has been, our first priority.</PARA>
<PARA>  But, as distinct from the Opposition, this Government understands that, by providing for the defence of Australia in a careful and balanced way, we can at the same time equip ourselves to play a relevant and responsible part further afield, and the initiatives of Senator Robert Ray's force structure review will enhance that capability.</PARA>
<PARA>  I conclude on this point: I ask you, Mr Acting Speaker, and I ask members of this House to note that, this very day, HMAS Sydney is on duty in the Red Sea in support of United Nations sanctions against Iraq; Australians are playing a major role in monitoring Iraq's compliance with the disarmament provisions of the United Nations cease-fire resolution; a detachment of some 40 members of the ADF is deploying to the western Sahara as members of a United Nations team overseeing a settlement there; and we expect that, within a few weeks, ADF signallers will join the United Nations advance mission to Cambodia to help pave the way for a comprehensive settlement there--and we wish them well, as they are further living proof of the relevance, the effectiveness, of this Government's defence policy.</PARA>

I have also drawn some lessons from the period of the Liberal-National Party in government. The Liberal-National Party came to government in 1975 with the clearest mandate in the postwar period; it had provided to it an opportunity to undertake significant reform in this country. There has never been a government in the history of this country which has so flopped its mandate.

Mr Acting Speaker, this gentleman was the economic adviser to the successor of the Whitlam Government. That Government produced something that had never been produced before in the history of this country: with the advice of the current Leader of the Opposition, it produced simultaneous double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. That was the achievement of the Leader of the Opposition. No wonder he wants to turn his back on it.</PARA></TALK.START>

I gave him the right advice, but Malcolm Fraser did not have the courage'. What a performance!</PARA>
<PARA>  What do you say now?  We will listen to your argument and say that it was not really your fault. You were the economic adviser.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Notwithstanding the job losses that have occurred in recent times, we have still, in the period since 1983, created just under 1 1/2 million jobs. As well as that, we have taken account of the circumstances of those people who are unemployed and who are reliant on welfare. I want to refer to the figures which the Deputy Prime Minister referred to yesterday, but I want to put them rather differently. The support that we have provided to unemployed people has made a significant difference to the living standards of those people unfortunate enough to be out of work. For instance, if we compare the relative situations of an unemployed person with a dependent spouse and two dependent children, in 1983 they would have received 61 per cent of average weekly earnings; now they receive 74 per cent. If they are in receipt of rent assistance, they receive 83 per cent of what would be received by a comparable family on average weekly earnings. So we make absolutely no apologies for the fact that we have improved the circumstances of those who are least well off in the community, particularly those who are reliant on welfare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Leader of the Opposition, in the appalling speech that he made to ACOSS, also referred to the failure of the Government to deal with responsibilities of the unemployed to seek employment. Amongst the far-reaching reforms of this Government have been the arrangements for Newstart, which introduced a very important principle into the receipt of welfare; that is, that those recipients ought to be making as great an effort as they can to improve their prospects of getting a job.</PARA>
<PARA>  I want to put what the Leader of the Opposition has said on the question of welfare into the context of his economic prescriptions for this country. He says that as a result of following his policies there will be more jobs. Even if one is a sufficiently eternal optimist to believe that that will occur in the longer term, nothing is more certain than that in the short to medium term, as a result of the economic chaos that he would precipitate in this country, unemployment would in fact go up. If we look at his political mentors in Britain and in New Zealand, we find that where they have pursued that kind of cold shower approach to the economy the first consequence of that dislocation was increased unemployment. Yet this is a man who, knowing full well that the immediate consequences of his policies would be to increase unemployment, wants to reduce simultaneously welfare payments and support to the people who would be rendered unemployed as a result of his policies. Not only would he tear away the unemployment benefit at the end of nine months, he would also reduce assistance to people--</PARA>

I paraphrase the words of Mr Neil Kinnock when he was referring to Mrs Thatcher: having first crippled a goodly part of the work force, you then want to punish the people for being lame.

Because we are proud of our achievement in implementing the most stable, efficient and equitable health care financing system in Australia's history--it is a pride that we all share--it is natural enough that members of this Caucus will have some concern and will want to talk about anything that involves changes to and developments of that system. That is understandable enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The major concern has been to ensure that nothing that we do damages the rate of direct billing for general practice services. That is the major concern because direct billing, as you know, Mr Acting Speaker, restrains medical costs and ensures that in most urban areas patients can access medical services whenever they need them. We are currently working through these concerns.</PARA>
<PARA>  There are three matters, however, which should be clearly understood by the honourable gentleman who asked this question and by those on the other side of this place. Firstly, nothing this Government does will put at risk the access of pensioners and other cardholders to medical services; secondly, the Government's Budget strategy will remain intact; and, thirdly, the Government's announcement included important reforms to the Medicare safety net to ensure that no family need pay more than $246 a year in out-of-pocket medical expenses. It is important to understand that this safety net applies to all out of hospital medical services, for example, X-rays, pathology and other specialist services, not just GP visits. The Government will retain its commitment to protecting these families in most medical need.</PARA>
<PARA>  As I pointed out yesterday, the Opposition has not had a health policy for five years. We have produced a health policy which is working and which is endorsed and supported by over 70 per cent of the Australian people. This policy of this Labor Government is working to produce universality of coverage and equity in its operation. That is the achievement of this Government. In five years the Opposition has not been able to produce a policy.</PARA>
<PARA>  I conclude by saying that I note with interest in the Australian Financial Review today a report that the Opposition Leader is finalising the Opposition's policy packages    generally, presumably including a health policy, this week. What exquisite timing!  It looks as though he may be choosing next week to produce his policy when both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are out of the country. That will be a pretty typical act of courage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and relates to the Ready Reserve, which was launched last week. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to press reports which appeared in the Canberra Times and the Sydney Morning Herald and which suggest that he has some doubts about the viability of the Ready Reserve, which was launched by the Prime Minister last week in Brisbane, a launch I was able to attend? Are the reports accurate, and can the Minister comment on that?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for his question. It is well timed because it gives me an opportunity to add some further comments to those that the Prime Minister has already made on our defence policy in general. I have seen the reports. They convince me that we ought not give long, detailed, honest and qualified answers to questions that are asked in press conferences. Major-General Sanderson, in outlining the Ready Reserve scheme, acknowledged quite correctly that introducing any new initiative involves some risks but that the Ready Reserve scheme had been so designed that those risks were negligible. I was asked to elaborate on that statement and identify those risks. I responded by saying that I thought the scheme would work very well. But I and the Chief of the Defence Force went on to nominate some possible risks, discounting each one of them in turn. We went on to conclude that we had minimised all those risks and I believed that they were nullified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The suggestion in the articles to which the honourable member refers that I think the introduction of the Ready Reserves is a risky strategy is entirely false. It is a unique Australian initiative that will benefit Defence, individual Australian service personnel, employers and the nation's defence. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Young people know that this scheme is an excellent scheme and they are flocking to join it. Since the Prime Minister launched the scheme on Wednesday of last week, by the close of business on Friday we had 3,325 inquiries about the Ready Reserve. Young people are voting with their feet to join it. I have no doubt that the scheme will be an excellent success; nor should anyone else.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In the Australian of yesterday, there was a report under the heading, `Libs "backed Rothwells indemnity"'. This report has already been the subject of a personal explanation by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) but, since it also referred to me, I wish to make this personal explanation. There are three parts of the report to which I want to refer. In the first paragraph, it is said that I, along with the honourable member for Bennelong:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . strongly supported the West Australian government's decision to indemnify a $150 million line of credit to Rothwells Bank, the WA Inc royal commission heard yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>In the next paragraph, it is said:</PARA>
<PARA>  Former West Australian deputy premier Mr David Parker told the Perth inquiry he had been present when Liberal Party trustee Mr Tony Oates, also a Bond Corp financial director, had discussed the matter by telephone with Mr Howard and Mr Chaney. </PARA>
<PARA>Later, the article says:</PARA>
<PARA>He--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Parker--</PARA>
<PARA>said both federal MPs had strongly supported the State Labor government's decision to indemnify the $150 million line of credit from the National Australia Bank as part of the rescue and had undertaken to try to persuade their State colleagues to do likewise. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, on the Sunday of the weekend in question I travelled to Canberra from Perth. Upon my arrival in Canberra, I received a telephone message requesting me to ring Mr Oates. I rang the number that was given to me. I was told that it was the office of Rothwells and that Mr Oates was no longer there as he had gone to see Mr MacKinnon. I then rang Mr MacKinnon at his office and Mr MacKinnon told me he was with Mr Oates. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr MacKinnon then outlined the request which had been made of him by the Western Australian State Labor Government to provide bipartisan support for the proposal to indemnify that $150m guarantee or line of credit. He explained that and the request which was being made to him. I said that, if he had a loudspeaker phone, I would like what I had to say to be said to both Mr Oates and Mr MacKinnon. He put me on the loudspeaker. I had a brief exchange with Mr Oates by way of greeting. I then said to Mr MacKinnon that, in my view, what was requested was not a proper use of public money and that Mr MacKinnon should not touch it with a barge pole. There was some further discussion in the same vein. I had no other contact with Mr Oates on that weekend or on that subject at any time. I just wanted that to be quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA>  I acknowledge that the Australian did record in this article that I have `strenuously denied ever attempting to persuade members of the State Opposition to support the Government's plan'. My position on this throughout has been that it should not have been touched with a barge pole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-During Question Time today, in an irrelevant and rather longwinded answer to a dorothy dixer, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) said that except for the member for La Trobe, the Opposition had nothing to say about Austudy. That in itself is not true, but he further compounded the problem by saying that I had proposed that we abolish all classes of student financial assistance for secondary students and, further, that we convert any balance of student financial assistance funding to student loans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Mr Acting Speaker, that is not true. What in fact I have canvassed, in the context of providing more access to students in order to allow some equity back into the higher education system, is that we discontinue Austudy itself only for secondary students; that we more tightly target Austudy to those tertiary students who are mostly in need; that we encourage, increasingly, student scholarships; that we consider some tax relief for those parents who are willing and able to support their children at tertiary institutions; and that we then consider--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The most telling quote of the day appears on the front page of this morning's edition of the Australian newspaper, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Resistance to mass unemployment--horror at the impact of mass unemployment--has again been one of those core Labor beliefs that from generation to generation enabled the persistence of the Australian Labor Party in the Australian political system. </PARA>
<PARA>  If unemployment persists at 10 per cent throughout . . . the first half of the 90s under a Labor government then I believe it will end up rendering that federal Labor government an object of apology. </PARA>
<PARA>  It will be seen as ultimately unsuccessful as, say, the Wilson government in the United Kingdom and be regarded as repellent by Labor Party people. </PARA>
<PARA>That quote came from the New South Wales Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bob Carr. How true it is as we look around the landscape of Australia and see the devastation and the disaster that have been wreaked upon this particular nation through the inactivity and the lack of forward thought and policies of this present Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The scene around Australia at the moment is a very sorry one indeed. What do we see? The worst economic conditions in almost 60 years. Unemployment at one million. The official unemployment rate is 841,000, up some 350,000 since August 1989. But we are not told that the method of calculation of the unemployment figures in Australia has been changed so many times in recent years that the figure of 841,000 is not really the true figure. </PARA>
<PARA>  How many people throughout the nation have been put out of employment in recent months and have collected severance packages? How many of those people are allowed to receive unemployment benefit? How many people now are working 15 hours a week or less, barely making an income? Those figures are not included there either. More than one million Australians now face the prospect of very little income indeed to help bring up their families. Even the Government and its spokesmen refuse to rule out the prospect that 10 per cent unemployment in Australia is going to be the norm for some years to come. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is an absolute disaster when we think that for every job advertised there are 30 unemployed people in Australia to fill that particular vacancy. Let us look at what is happening in terms of the economic activity of Australia. Retail turnover increased by 2.8 per cent in 1990-91 compared with 8.4 per cent in 1989-90 and 6 per cent in 1988-89. If we look at another measure, the new capital expenditure, we see that it is down from 9.9 per cent in 1990-91 compared with the decline of 1.7 per cent in the previous year and an increase of 13.9 per cent in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at the bankruptcies. As we go around Australia and see the conditions in our shopping centres, in our small businesses and in our factory areas, these figures really come home because bankruptcies have increased over 50 per cent in the 1990-91 year--up from 8,600 to a massive 13,000. </PARA>
<PARA>  While this goes on, the terms of Australian trade get progressively worse and worse. Members on this side of the House have been battling in their electorates to try to get the message through to the Government of Australia that things are wrong and things have got to change. They will tell us what it is like in places such as Ballarat, Bendigo and Logan City in my own electorate where businesses are closing. </PARA>
<PARA>  In respect of that latter case of an area of Australia that I share with the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), I am sure that he is absolutely delighted to know that 27 per cent of the small businesses of Logan City--the 4,186 of them that used to exist 12 months ago--have now gone to the wall. In his electorate, one which contains so many small businesses, he has an unemployment rate of 30 per cent, and 43 per cent amongst the youth of his area. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia is getting to a stage where it is falling more and more behind its overseas competitors. If we look at the annual average growth in Australia in 1990, we see that it was a mere 1.5 per cent, and if we compare that with the situations in our major trading partners, we see a growth rate in Japan of 5.6 per cent, in Germany of 4.5 per cent, in France of 2.8 per cent, and even in Italy a growth of 2 per cent. One would think that when these figures keep coming home to the Government there would be some move to try to solve the problems, to bring some life back into the Australian economy, to revive business and to provide jobs for our young people and indeed for the work force as a whole. But what happens? Very little indeed. That is because this Government appears to be totally incapable of acknowledging that its policies are wrong and of then changing those policies to correct its mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think it is not unkind to say that, when we saw the demise of the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), there was a feeling that at last here was a chance that we might see some change of direction and policy. But what happened? Nothing at all. We got another Treasurer, who, quite frankly, is just a pale imitation of the honourable member for Blaxland. He has continued with the same failed policy prescriptions and the same inflexibility. The only thing we do not have now is the flamboyance and the media attention that the honourable member for Blaxland attracted. </PARA>
<PARA>  Business has summed up the situation that this Government has now got us into. In Business Background dated October 1991 this is what business had to say:</PARA>
<PARA>For some considerable time the Business Council and others have been pointing to the disastrous collapse in investment in fixed capital formation that has occurred over the past two years. The ratio of investment (business investment, housing and public capital) to GDP is at a forty year low, and is likely to fall even further in 1991-92. The Treasurer's expressed concerns of over-investment at this time seem misplaced, to say the least. Unless we get business investment moving again, the economic recovery will not be sustainable, and high rates of unemployment will be with us for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The new rhetoric will have credibility only if it is backed up by action to resurrect business investment. Senator Button's proposal that some major development projects would be put on a `fast track' by `massaging' the approval process is welcome. But it is symptomatic of the Government's approach of `doing deals', rather than getting the principles and the business environment right in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA>How much we have to agree with that. When we look at some of the real reforms that have to be made in terms of the resuscitation of Australian industry, we realise that what is really needed is a major overhaul of the very infrastructure of this nation and of the taxation system, which to a very great extent has been a prime cause of the demise of business and of the situation in which more than one million Australians are out of work. </PARA>
<PARA>  The annoying thing is simply this: when the Opposition takes real initiatives in this place and puts up real suggestions for debate, we get nothing but bucketing and denigration, and not even an indication that the Government is prepared to look at other propositions which in fact could help resuscitate the Australian economy. Government members are not interested; they do not have the policy directions; they are not prepared to think these things out; and we just go on from one disaster to another. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wonder how many people sitting at home today out of work realise just what the present structure that the Government has lumbered Australia with does to them. I wonder how many of those people who do have jobs and who are on the average incomes realise what a tremendous taxation burden has been placed on them by this Government. It is interesting to analyse the weakness of the current taxation system. In the last Budget under the coalition, the income tax as a proportion of total revenue in the 1982-83 year was 62.5 per cent. In the latest Budget figures, the estimate of that take for 1991-92 is 69.8 per cent. The plain fact is that the burden of that taxation is falling on the average income earners of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is all very well for Government spokesmen to talk about how much they have done on income tax reform, but the plain facts are these: we have had inflation in recent years; we have had wages growth; and those average income earners, those average Australian families battling to provide for their children, are in actual fact paying the bulk of taxation and are now paying some of the highest rates of taxation. This is because there has been absolutely no attempt to alleviate the strains that those high rates of personal income tax have caused to Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we are concerned about Australian families and their desire to have jobs, we must be concerned about the state of Australian industry and its capacity to provide jobs. The burden is falling increasingly on individuals and companies, and we must look at company tax as a proportion of total revenue to see just what is happening to Australian companies. If we go back to the figures for 1982-83, we see that the amount taken was 10.8 per cent. If we compare that with 13.9 per cent this year, we see an increase of 30 per cent for companies. That gives us an indication of just what is happening in terms of the constraints on industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are really quite crazy, because Australia is one of the few countries in the world that actually impose sales tax on their exports and export components. It will not be too long now before the coalition parties present to the people of Australia a package of major tax reform. There is a recognition that, if we are going to get jobs for Australians again and if we are going to get some wealth back into the community, we have to make sure that we fix business as well. If we are going to be competitive and if we are going to get back into those overseas markets, we must have in place a taxation system that allows Australia to be competitive again. The system that is being offered--including a goods and services tax, the abolition of sales tax, some real tax cuts for the average income people of Australia, and compensation for low income earners, all combined with a whole package of industry reforms--will at last give some hope to Australians once again. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is absolutely incredible that individuals in Australia in 1982-83 paid $22,900m in tax and this year they had to pay $49,900m--more than double. It is incredible that in 1982-83 Australian companies paid $4,800m in tax and this year they will pay $13,500m--a threefold increase. That gives an indication of just how critical the reform of the Australian taxation system will be for Australia and for Australian families generally. </PARA>
<PARA>  I mentioned a moment ago that if we are really going to get back into the export markets we have to make Australia competitive again. That is very true. The program of micro-economic reform proposed by the coalition will address that, with reforms of the waterfront, telecommunications and the aviation industry. It will certainly do it in terms of our industrial reform, but the Government has a real obligation, too, to keep its side of the bargain and to make sure that we get government expenditure down and right, and to make sure that we undertake this massive overhaul of the Australian taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA>  I mentioned that Australia is one of the few countries in the world that have the capacity to impose sales taxes on inputs for exports. It is interesting to go through the latest OECD review and see just how those rates are applied. It is incredible to think that the effective tax rate on our export of transport equipment is 6.3 per cent; that we apply an effective tax rate of 4.6 per cent on the export of forestry, fishing and hunting products; 4.4 per cent on wood products; 3.8 per cent on repairs; 2.8 per cent on paper and printing; and 2.6 per cent on mining. One thing that this next coalition government will do is make sure that that sales tax component is taken right out of all export products. We have to make sure that that is one of the first things that we do as part of that taxation reform to ensure that we can be competitive with overseas products. </PARA>
<PARA>  Never before has Australia been in such a disastrous situation. The Prime Minister comes in here day after day and is starting to talk about a 1993 election. I say to the Prime Minister that he has very little chance to reform the Australian economy and to try to provide some incentive back for Australian business in that short time. I suggest too that he looks at a report in the Australian newspaper today of a suggestion that John Halfpenny has made to the Prime Minister. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>  ``I would suggest, even insist, that does give the trade union movement in this country some special rights, some special entitlements. . . so far as the performance of Labor in government is concerned,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>  ``Within the family of the labour movement, those who gave birth to the party have a right to expect Labor to govern with a bias that is distinctly in favour of the working class. . . the disadvantaged and oppressed.'' (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am pleased to join in this debate and to follow the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull). Indeed, I must say, on behalf of the Government, that we are extraordinarily gratified that the honourable member for Fadden has seen fit to introduce into this matter of public importance this afternoon a debate dealing with the impact of the Australian taxation system on business costs, the competitiveness of exports and incentives for Australians to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is also rather fascinating that the honourable member for Fadden is the shadow Minister for tourism and aviation, which is part of the portfolio that I represent in this House, yet we heard very little during his contribution this afternoon about those aspects of his portfolio. Perhaps I will have an opportunity later in my contribution to suggest why he was relatively silent on those issues. </PARA>
<PARA>  I say at the outset that the Government has been extraordinarily conscious of the impact that the taxation system has on business. Any government would, of course, adopt that attitude. But, rather than just talking about the subject with blind rhetoric, we have made some very significant improvements. People on the other side of the House seem to forget that just a few years ago when we came to power in 1982-83, the last year of the Fraser Government, the company rate of taxation was 46 per cent; the current rate is 39 per cent. At the same time as the company tax has been lowered to that figure, we have also introduced a system of dividend imputation to remove the double taxation of share dividends and therefore encourage investment. Clearly, this was something that the business community in particular was calling out for for many years. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my Department in the area of tourism we are very conscious of the issue of taxation and we are currently conducting a review of the impact of taxation on business operations within the tourism industry. This is a very significant industry. It is Australia's principal export industry. It is an industry that currently generates some $7.3 billion worth of foreign exchange earnings. It employs 441,000 Australians in its work force. It is an industry with total expenditure in excess of $23 billion and it represents 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA>  So it is important in an industry as significant as the tourism industry that we pay particular attention to taxation matters. We recognise the necessity of making sure that we get the system correct so that there are no impediments to further development of this industry during the 1990s and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government in a general sense is also in the process of implementing measures to improve our international competitive situation, particularly through the taxation system. The honourable member for Fadden seems to have conveniently forgotten the rather significant statements that were made in this House just a few months ago in the March economic statement, in particular two taxation measures aimed at trying to improve the business competition situation. I refer to changes to the depreciation arrangements and the decision to widen substantially the exemptions from wholesale sales tax for business inputs used by manufacturers, those in our important primary industries and, of course, in the mining sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  Competitiveness is not enhanced only by the taxation system. Unlike the Opposition, we do not see any one taxation measure as some sort of panacea for all our economic ills, as a sort of `one solution fits all' policy prescription.  I refer to the issue of wages policy which this Government has successfully implemented through the various accord agreements with the ACTU--something that the Opposition has constantly scorned. The productivity and wage-tax trade-offs have allowed business and industry to reduce unit labour costs, to redress the balance between profits and labour, to significantly aid the level of profitability within the business community and, importantly, to enhance our international competitive situation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, our topic here today for this matter of public importance also deals with incentives for Australians to work. I have already mentioned the issue of the wage-tax trade-offs which were negotiated together with some other very significant changes to personal rates of taxation. Since it has been in power, this Government has significantly simplified the personal income tax arrangements of working Australians. Just a few years ago we inherited a top marginal rate of taxation of 60 per cent. The latest change has meant that the top marginal rate of taxation that currently operates is 47 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  I find it particularly interesting that the honourable member for Fadden is so keen to debate the issue of a goods and services tax on the tourism industry, in light of the fact that the tourism industry, which forms part of the honourable member for Fadden's shadow portfolio, would be one of the most significantly affected industries in Australia by the introduction of such a tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said at the outset, I find it rather strange, given some of his other comments in recent months, that during his contribution the honourable member for Fadden was relatively silent today about the impact on the Australian taxation system of those measures that are the subject of this MPI. Whilst there has been no confirmation of the treatment of tourism by the Opposition for the purposes of a goods and services tax, there is every reason to suspect that it would more closely resemble the New Zealand model than the Canadian model. The reason for this assumption is the very positive comments that have been made by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, about the New Zealand experience with a goods and services tax and the rather disparaging remarks that he has made about the Canadian model. The Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party was quoted on ABC radio here in Canberra on 15 July this year as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I think the Canadians, with respect to them, their experience shows how not to undertake major tax reforms. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The New Zealanders by contrast have probably the purest system in the Western world and have had a lot of acclaim for it because most people think it's much fairer if you treat everybody literally the same and certainly that's the reaction if you just talk to ordinary New Zealanders as I did. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, he must speak to rather different members of the New Zealand community from those who often contribute to debates on a goods and services tax. It is significant that in today's Bulletin magazine there is a rather interesting letter from a person talking about the New Zealand experience and saying what a great thing the goods and services tax has been for that community in that person's opinion. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>For six months, we have resided in New Zealand--a country which has had a consumption tax since 1986--and are just coming to grips with the goods and services tax . . . mooted for Australia. It is pertinent that Australians reflect on this most exacting of taxes, the sharpest of all taxing tools, and the failure of governments worldwide to honour promises of compensatory rebates in conjunction with its introduction. </PARA>
<PARA>Later the writer suggests:</PARA>
<PARA>Australians must realise that a consumption tax is levied on everything:  When you pay your car registration, electricity bill, local authority rates and phone bill, buy a loaf of bread or fuel at a garage, you will be up for this additional levy. Reflect also that GST is like moss: it grows. It will not remain at the opening rate. There is only one direction it heads--up!</PARA>
<PARA>The New Zealand experience is rather sobering when one talks about the benefits of a so-called goods and services tax. This has important implications for this most dynamic industry that I have the privilege to represent--the Australian tourism industry. In New Zealand tourism is not zero rated, unlike all other New Zealand export industries. </PARA>
<PARA>  What clearly is the intention of the Federal Opposition when it comes to the question of a goods and services tax with respect to tourism? The Opposition completely ignores the price impact of a goods and services tax, particularly on international tourism. We are very much a long haul destination and, as such, any long haul destination is clearly a price sensitive destination. It is strange that this fact should now elude the honourable member for Fadden because in the past he has shown a great appreciation of the impact of increased costs on the sale of tourism products. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have a significant press release from the honourable member for Fadden dated 8 July this year and headed `Bed tax threatens tourism--Jull.' It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Any decision by councils in far north Queensland to introduce a bed tax on tourists must be considered very carefully indeed. </PARA>
<PARA>He said it was critical that the Australian tourism product did not price itself out of international markets by the imposition of more and more taxes. I think he is absolutely right. Yet this is a man who belongs to the political party which is proposing a major change in the Australian taxation system by the introduction of a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  There also seem to be similar levels of confusion over the impact of a goods and services tax, a consumption tax, a bed tax or some other impost by any other name that the Opposition is trying to sell to the Australian community. It is interesting to note that at a recent convention on the weekend of 14 and 15 September the Queensland Liberal Party   passed a resolution. I ask all honourable members to take very clear notice of what the resolution says:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Liberal Party vigorously opposes the imposition of any form of tax levy or charges on tourists or tourism operators. </PARA>
<PARA>Members of the Liberal Party in this House should take notice of the grassroots of their Party and, in particular, the concerns being raised by people about the impact of a proposed goods and services tax with respect to the tourism industry. The industry has certainly voiced its concern. The honourable member for Fadden and members of the Opposition will continue to voice their concern about the impact of a goods and services tax, particularly on employment levels in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  More members of the Opposition should go to a place such as far north Queensland, which is at the very frontier of our latest tourism boom, and listen to what people in the tourism industry are saying about the proposal of a goods and services tax. I do not think the people in north Queensland will be swayed in any way, shape or form by the rather specious arguments that have been proffered in favour of the goods and services tax by such notables as Queensland Senator Ian Macdonald. In the Gold Coast Bulletin this week he suggested that the goods and services tax would be a very good thing for Australia and that New Zealanders had a GST and they liked it. To support his contention, he stated that the number of New Zealanders migrating to Australia had decreased. It is a rather simplistic argument. I think it is also drawing an extraordinarily long bow to suggest that there is any nexus between the levels of immigration from New Zealand to Australia and the impact of a goods and services tax within that country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The thing that the Opposition constantly runs away from in relation to the GST and the tourism industry is the fact that the tourism industry is primarily a service industry. As such, it attracts very low levels of sales tax. Again, we constantly hear the rhetoric that there is this hidden consumption tax operating in the system through a wholesale sales tax. The tax on things such as restaurant meals, theatre tickets, accommodation, entertainment--the very things that international and domestic tourists often become involved with--will clearly add to the cost of a domestic holiday and certainly will have a very vicious impact on the international arrivals into this country. This adversely impacts on the profitability of businesses and our international competitive position. </PARA>
<PARA>  Clearly, I find this matter of public importance presented by the honourable member for Fadden a complete joke. Right through his entire contribution this afternoon, as the shadow Minister responsible for tourism and aviation, he completely evaded any debate on the impact of any sort of proposal with respect to a goods and services tax on this industry. This is one industry which is very dynamic for this country. As such, to introduce a debate on a subject such as this clearly shows that he is way out of step, along with his Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --The contribution from the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) is typical of the scare campaign being waged by one and all on the Government side. He ignored some vital factors about the introduction of a goods and services tax which will benefit the tourist industry. First and foremost, the abolition of the wholesale sales tax will have a significant benefit to the tourist industry. With the introduction of a GST, the GST on all business imports is refundable. Secondly, the Minister took no account of the drastic reduction in personal income tax rates which will act as a stimulus for all working men and women and allow them a greater level of disposal income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Minister's knee-jerk reaction to the introduction of the GST is typical of the very organised campaign being mounted by the Government. The truth is that if members on the Government side doubt the need for drastic tax reform--sadly, there are far too many of them--then quite obviously a report in today's Sydney Morning Herald should dispel that callous and unthinking complacency. Mr Ian Steele-Park, a member of the New South Wales Rural Adjustment Authority, published a report predicting that up to 20,000 farmers, or 12 per cent of the farm community, will leave the land in the next two to three years. Furthermore, he points out that 1,000 farmers had left the land in the past financial year. They are dimensions of an historic crisis. The Government talks about structural adjustment. Well, here it is. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is very hard to quantify exactly those types of figures; they might be more or they might be less. The truth is that it is generally accepted that figures of that dimension are in the ballpark. They underlie the gravity of the situation our nation finds itself in. It is no better for small business. There are now two job advertisements for every 100 unemployed. Apart from New South Wales, that is the worst situation since the 1982 recession. </PARA>
<PARA>  We cannot duck for cover any more. We have an economic crisis of unprecedented dimensions which requires courageous and fundamental reform. Small business bankruptcies in the April-June quarter of 1991 totalled 4,225, a rise of 55 per cent over the same quarter last year. Bankruptcies were up 61.6 per cent in Victoria, 58 1/2 per cent in Queensland and 75 per cent in Western Australia. As our small business operators struggle under the weight of high interest rates and a recession and our farmers struggle under a drought, a downturn in commodity prices--particularly wool, wheat and, to a lesser extent, beef--and try to deal with interest rates, increases in government costs and charges and a very high exchange rate, the Government sits still, refusing to consider the fundamental reforms that are so necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>  The goods and services tax is part of an overall package of reform by the Opposition which will include industrial relations, waterfront reform, government expenditure, fiscal policy reform and micro-economic reform so as to bring down the costs of transport, particularly rail freight and handling. </PARA>
<PARA>  These things matter to the farming community especially, because in 1990 protection in the motor vehicle sector cost Australians $1.6 billion and added $2,000 to $3,000 per farmer to the farming community's costs. Waterfront efficiencies resulted in a $3,000 impost per export farm. Efficient grain bulk handling would return an extra $10 a tonne to Australian wheat growers. In relation to AQIS, there is a 100 per cent cost recovery but no input into the efficiency and operations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us not be in any doubt that if the Government walks away from GST it is walking away from the benefits to the rural community, small business and farmers. Anybody who says no to this proposal as a reaction to the scare campaign, and at times a sophisticated and coordinated effort by the Government, is turning his back on a chance to create a very pro-export taxation system. I am certain rural Australia is going to be at the forefront of this need to adjust in the economy; it is going to be at the edge of change. To be frank, the rural economy has the most to gain from taxation reform of this kind, and the most to lose if we stand stagnant. </PARA>

Will any Government member deny the need for fundamental reform, of which tax reform is an integral component?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The design of the goods and services tax includes with the coalition's proposals a compensation package, which of course nobody on the Government side takes into account in slamming it. When those on the Government side call for compensation measures to be outlined by the coalition, let us look at the present impact of the wholesale sales tax system as it exists. Where is the compensation there? When this Government came to power in March 1983, the wholesale sales tax take totalled $3.1 billion. Last financial year it was $9.4 billion. Where is the compensation for that trebling of the wholesale sales tax, that indirect tax which is hidden away? It is simply milking Australia's businesses and households of desperately needed income. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government always cringes at the prospect of reform, the challenge of change, and, quite frankly, it is thereby effectively continuing and approving the black market as it operates--the black economy--where billions of dollars annually are siphoned off from the community by way of tax evasion. So what are the Government proposals to deal with the black economy, which measures at least $20 billion in conservative terms? We hear figures as high as $40 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the Government wants to create a rational taxation system which gives consumers choices about how much tax they pay rather than have it stolen off them by high levels of PAYE, this is its chance to provide those income tax cuts, this is its chance to put in place offset packages for those on fixed incomes, superannuants and those receiving government benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important to stress that the GST is not being promoted as a single initiative. It is part of a package of reforms, only a piece of the action, if you like. The rest of the package is designed to strike out, to eliminate, those other obstacles to an efficient export oriented economy, so that we can stand in those very competitive and very corrupted world markets. By lowering protection against imported vehicles and equipment, as is the coalition's policy, we have an opportunity to smash a hole in those oncosts which are crippling and smothering farm profitability. Why should Australian farmers have to pay twice as much for their basic equipment as their counterparts? Why should the freight transport sector have to pay $12,000 more for a rig than it has to? Why should it be penalised by way of a wholesale sales tax on tyres and parts?</PARA>
<PARA>  The benefits to the farming community will be dramatic. For the farmers directly there will be the abolition of the wholesale sales tax on two-wheel vehicles or trucks and on a number of those hand-held tools on which they cannot get the exemption because of administrative incompetence by a great many retailers. In respect of fuel there will be a drastic change to their costs, particularly of off-road petrol and diesel fuel. Moreover, indirectly to farmers will be the benefit from zero rating our export industries of between $1 billion and $2 billion. There will be the abolition of wholesale sales tax on the freight industry, where $3.8 billion is paid every year. So farmers stand to gain enormously under GST in conjunction with our other radical reforms, as does small business, where for the first time the working man and woman will have control over a higher level of disposable income than before. </PARA>

He did not mention, for example, that the top personal marginal tax rate in 1983 was 60 per cent and that in 1991 it is 47 per cent. He has not bothered to mention that the bottom personal tax rate in 1983 was 30 per cent and that currently it is 21 per cent. He did not bother to mention that company tax has been reduced from 46 per cent to 39 per cent, and he did not bother to explain why the effective company tax rate in 1983 was 78.4 per cent. The honourable member has not bothered to look. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us examine the erroneous propositions that have been put forward in this matter of public importance today. Let us examine the status of taxation in this country compared with that in the OECD. The most recent OECD annual report on revenue statistics shows that in 1989 Australia had the equal second lowest ratio, with the United States of total tax revenue to GDP in the OECD. Since 1985 Australia's ranking has fallen from the sixth lowest. What does that tell those opposite about the tax take in this country? What does that tell them about what this Government is doing about taxation reform? Let us not have these sorts of simplistic assertions which bear no relationship to fact--the fictional diatribe, the rhetoric, that come from the lips of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us also examine briefly those reforms that this Government has introduced in the area of taxation. We have introduced the capital gains tax, which the Opposition would abolish. We have introduced fringe benefits tax, which no doubt those opposite would also like to abolish. We have abolished the entertainment expenses, and we have introduced dividend imputation, a resource rent tax, substantiation requirements and foreign income taxation reform. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has been no comment by the honourable member on those reforms and their impact on the Australian economy, because he does not understand them. No-one in the Opposition has been able to address those issues, save to say by implication, if not explicitly in some cases, that what those opposite are about is shovelling money back into the pockets of the rich, shovelling money into the pockets of the spivs and greasers whom they protected when they were in government in 1983 and in the periods before then. We know what those opposite are about and it is patently obvious to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) talked about the impact on the tourism industry. He said that he thought the Opposition had not clearly stated its view on the impact of the consumption tax on the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have to say that I got a bit of information --I got the nod--from the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). He told us all. The Leader of the National Party indicated very clearly on the ABC Country Hour program on 16 August 1990 that a consumption tax would apply to international tourism. He said the tax:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . would be broadly based. It even applies to the international tourist visiting restaurants up and down the coast of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Opposition wants to do to the tourist industry. Let me just state, as the Minister for Tourism has said, what the tourism industry is saying about this. Of course, the tourism industry does not want it. I might also say there is disarray within the ranks of the conservative parties. </PARA>

The domestic tourism industry is an import competing industry because, if one puts up the price of domestic inputs or domestic tourist travel, one is inviting Australia's domestic tourists to travel overseas, thereby taking the money with them. This is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  What is the Opposition's response to that? It says, `We are going to tax the tourism industry'. Who will that affect?

They will all be affected. It is not a concern to the Opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On behalf of the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Special Broadcasting Service,relocation of radio and television, Artarmon, New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>Since its formation, the Special Broadcasting Service, SBS, has operated from leased premises, none of which were ever constructed to accommodate the special requirements of a broadcasting organisation. This creates a significant restraint on the types of programs that can be produced, as well as the efficiency of the organisation, with television being the most affected. </PARA>
<PARA>  SBS radio, television and corporate activities in Sydney are currently accommodated in leased premises at Bondi Junction and Milsons Point. The two main leases are both due to expire in May 1993 and, while the SBS has options to extend at both locations, the availability of the Milsons Point premises cannot be guaranteed beyond May 1995. In addition to the uncertainties associated with future availability, the SBS wishes to relocate to more economical and appropriate premises in order to achieve financial and operational benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>  The selected building is a 25-year-old industrial complex originally constructed for a large printing organisation. The total floor area is in excess of SBS's requirements, with the surplus being available to generate future revenue for the SBS. The work generally comprises essential repairs and maintenance to the fabric of the buildings, the upgrading of existing fire protection and building services in accordance with the current regulations, and the fitting out of approximately half of the existing building area to provide accommodation for SBS radio, television and corporate activities. </PARA>
<PARA>  The total estimated cost of the project, including site acquisition, building adaptation and fit-out, technical equipment, consultants' fees and making good to existing leased premises, is $34.9m at June 1991 prices. The project is to be funded by SBS borrowings recently approved by the Loan Council, with repayments to be made from future rental and operational savings. It is planned that the construction will commence in January 1992 with occupation of the facilities in February 1993. I table selected drawings of the proposed relocation of the Special Broadcasting Service radio and television to Artarmon in New South Wales and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-While supporting the motion to move that the Public Works Committee looks at this reference, I would like to raise a number of matters in relation to the reasoning behind the proposal. I note that the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), drew attention to a number of anomalies that I see as needing to be responded to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  He makes an observation that SBS has operated in leased premises, points out that none was ever constructed to accommodate the special requirements of a special broadcasting organisation and goes on to say that this has created a significant restraint on the programs. It is interesting to note that, if that is a justification for moving, one has to ask: why is SBS moving to a 25-year-old industrial complex; in other words, why is it moving to something that was not built specifically for a broadcasting organisation, either? I think that is an interesting question that ought to be raised. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a number of other questions that ought to be raised. This proposal is going to cost nearly $35m, which is more than 50 per cent of the total SBS annual budget. Yet, we note that the leases on the current buildings of SBS are certainly assured of lasting for another four years, until May 1995. It may not be guaranteed that the lease on one of those buildings can be extended beyond May 1995; but there is nothing to say that it could not be. I would have thought that four years down the track does give SBS plenty of time to decide whether that one lease is not likely to be renewable beyond May 1995 and that, therefore, it would have plenty of time to make that decision. </PARA>
<PARA>  We then go on to see some rather interesting `justifications'. It is suggested that SBS will be able to fund this new accommodation from borrowings recently approved by the Loan Council. It almost looks as though, having suddenly got the opportunity to get hold of some more money, SBS has succumbed to the temptation to get a building and completely refurbish it at considerable expense because of this opportunity which has suddenly arisen. But the justification then goes on to say that the project will not only be funded by these borrowings, but also by repayments to be made from future rental. This is because the building will initially be too big for the operation anyway. So that seems to be a nice little thought, but it is really a poor justification for getting a building that is too big. Operational savings are then mentioned. I think those operational savings ought to be spelt out in considerably more detail. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I hope the Committee will do it, because I think this whole project does need considerably more scrutiny. I guess the thing that concerns me is that, while the Committee will be looking at the building per se, the way this motion has been framed it looks as though the Government assumes that the decision has already been taken, that it is only a matter of getting approval for the building itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I think there are a number of questions which should be looked at very carefully. I think the justification for SBS to move to a building which, as pointed out, is too big, raises further questions particularly as to what the Government's future plans for SBS are or, alternatively, what SBS's future plans are for SBS. Otherwise, we are left in the dark as to why SBS apparently needs to expand when the current premises, which will certainly be available for at least four years and may be available for a lot longer than that, have obviously proved adequate up until now. I hope that the Public Works Committee, in its deliberations, looks at all these points and closely scrutinises what is a fairly large amount of expenditure on behalf of the Commonwealth. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill implements the recommendations of the first report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act that, as a matter of priority, the Family Law Act 1975 be amended to fix a maximum age of 70 years for judges of the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the Family Law Act was enacted in 1975 there was no maximum age for judges appointed to the Family Court. Judges had life tenure in accordance with section 72 of the Constitution, as it then stood. </PARA>
<PARA>  The 1976 report on retiring ages for Commonwealth judges by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs recommended that a compulsory retiring age should be introduced for all federal judges. The Committee recommended that the appropriate maximum age for justices of the High Court should be 70, and that, after an appropriate amendment to the Constitution, Parliament should legislate to prescribe a maximum age of 65 for judges of other federal courts. The proposal to amend the Constitution to provide a compulsory retiring age for all federal judges was accepted in the 1977 referendum. </PARA>
<PARA>  Following the referendum in 1977, section 72 of the Constitution was amended to provide a maximum age for federal judges of 70 and to provide that Parliament may make a law fixing a maximum age for judges of a court created by Parliament at less than 70 years. The only law made pursuant to section 72 fixing a maximum age for judges at less than 70 years is in relation to the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA>  Section 23A of the Family Law Act 1975, which fixes the maximum age for judges of the Family Court at 65, was inserted in the Act in 1977 following the constitutional amendment. At that time the provision of a maximum retiring age of 65 was a reflection of community concerns that Family Court judges should be aware of and keep abreast of current social values and attitudes and took into account the demanding and arduous nature of some, if not all, family law disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Joint Select Committee believes that the reasons for fixing a retiring age of 65 for the Family Court are no longer valid. The Committee concurred with the views of the Family Law Council that it is important for Family Court judges to be aware of current social values and that there would not be a substantial difference, in this area, between judges who were 65 and those who were 70. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendment will not require judges to remain on the Court past the age of 65. Judges will still be able to retire at an earlier age, and if over age 60 will be entitled to receive the maximum judicial pension if they have served 10 years or more as a judge. </PARA>
<PARA>  For some time criticism has been made of the nature of the Family Court and its operations. For example, in 1985 Chief Justice Gibbs made some criticisms of the specialist nature of the Family Court in his address to the Twenty-third Australian Legal Convention on the State of the Australian Judicature. </PARA>
<PARA>  His Honour noted the limited scope of the jurisdiction of the Court and questioned whether the work of the Court required strengthening. He also suggested that the limited scope of the jurisdiction of the Family Court was unlikely to attract lawyers who might be expected to be appointed to Supreme Courts or the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe the experience of the Family Court over the past 15 years has demonstrated the wisdom which led to its establishment. The past 15 years have not been easy. Nevertheless the Court has maintained the highest standards in the administration of justice. Since its inception in 1976 the Court has attracted judges and other officers of a high standing in the legal profession. </PARA>
<PARA>  In recent years the Government has taken some initiatives to ensure that the Court continues to have the capacity to attract high calibre lawyers. For example, following the recommendations of the 1987 report of the Advisory Committee to the Constitutional Commission on the Australian Judiciary, the Government legislated to increase the jurisdiction of the Court. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Family Court of Australia (Additional Jurisdiction and Exercise of Powers) Act 1988 provided a mechanism whereby the Family Court could exercise jurisdiction under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, the Bankruptcy Act 1966, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Trade Practices Act 1974. Further, Commonwealth and State cross-vesting legislation allows the Court to exercise the jurisdiction of the Federal Court and various State Supreme Courts in appropriate matters. </PARA>
<PARA>  Following this increase in jurisdiction, the Government  legislated to bring the salaries of Family Court judges into line with Federal Court judges. The amendment to the Family Law Act to increase the maximum retiring age of judges from 65 to 70 years will ensure that the terms and conditions of judges of the Family and Federal courts are equivalent. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill amends the Family Law Act by repealing section 23A which fixed the maximum retiring age at 65. The provisions of section 72 of the Constitution, providing a maximum age of 70 for Federal judges, will apply to all future appointments to the Family Court. When the legislation is passed, the existing judges, whose commissions are limited until age 65, will be given new commissions in terms of the new age limit. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also amends section 41 of the Family Law Act to provide that judges appointed to State Family Courts are permitted to hold office until age 70. This is to ensure that judges of the Family Court of Western Australia, the only State Family Court established under section 41, may also hold office until age 70. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1991-92 for the Department of Employment, Education and Training, I wish to concentrate my remarks on the depletion of skills in Australia's scientific and technological effort. While overall participation rates in the sciences remain stable--that is, if the spurt in interest in life sciences and computer sciences in recent years is included in the calculations--involvement in the core disciplines is falling off. It is falling off in respect of the capacity of the educational system to attract suitable numbers of postgraduates and in the degree of interest being shown in the core sciences by the more talented end of the annual graduate intake. These issues will soon be the subject of even greater concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  For a number of reasons, international demand for trained scientific researchers is set to grow. It is reported that the United States alone will have a shortfall of some 675 PhDs by the late 1990s. Similar situations face the United Kingdom and Japan. So the pressure on the local supply of high quality researchers will grow in time. Because of rising international demand, immigration will be choked off as a means of overcoming such shortages. Moreover, those small numbers of graduates we do turn out will come to have a wider range of research and career options open to them in time. </PARA>
<PARA>  The issues are, therefore, significant and they require careful planning. Interruptions, for whatever reasons, to the supply of trained researchers can have an immediate and significant impact on the nation's scientific and technological research capacity. As a result, the human capital which underwrites Australia's scientific and technological effort must be managed with even greater care than other relevant concerns. The quality and number of graduates participating in core disciplines, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry and so forth, determine the nation's capabilities in a wide range of areas. For example, those involved in atmospheric and climatic research well appreciate the relationship of physics to our capabilities in that regard. The shortage in the supply of suitable postgraduates has placed a cap on the extent to which it is possible to make use of those added funds which have been directed to this area of research in recent times. Similarly, the constrictions on the supply of mathematics will come to have a similar effect on research areas such as the marine sciences. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am currently investigating avenues through which it is possible to extend the guidelines applying to the cooperative research centres program to embrace the development of scientific and technological skills. This is rightly an area in which governments should have a high level of responsibility. I can envisage opportunities for making use of CRC's program to build powerful national centres of training, teaching and research in the core sciences, including engineering. These national centres would not drag resources away from the universities and they would not be focused on a selective area of activity or specify a subfield of inquiry for investigation. Their focus, importantly, might conceivably be the preservation of the central disciplines as a whole. Importantly, initiatives in this regard should also have positive implications for the teaching of the sciences at the secondary school level. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the past, the problem Australia has faced in attracting the best and the brightest of the coming generation into the sciences has been almost a cultural one. Governments must arouse in the education system, and in the community as a whole, a sense of the national significance and dynamism of the sciences in our country. The initiatives governments take must reach down into the education system and affect student perception of the sciences, curriculum development matters and teacher training. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my view, single publicity campaigns on these counts amount to very little. What is needed is a sustained and integrated program which enables the secondary school system to focus on nationally significant centres of learning in the sciences and to work with them in practical ways. It is vital that the private sector develop a more strategic view as to how and to what extent it invests in scientific and technological activities across the tertiary and other public research agencies. I point out that the greatest single obstacle to expanding Australia's scientific and technological research base and, as a consequence, its future skills training capabilities is the relative under-investment in research and development on the part of local industries. There are many concerns bearing on the reasons behind this phenomenon, but it is sufficient to say that, unless the industry, trade and economic policies of future governments unambiguously push the private sector to seek out competitive advantages, industry investment and R&amp; are unlikely to progress beyond current levels. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is little chance in this country of building a technology ethic across the community, or an Australian identity for the sciences, until there is a higher degree of cooperation between the higher education and private sectors. When this relationship crystallises, the great revival of the sciences will begin. We might struggle as we do cultivate a sense of the sciences in the community, but the game will not really begin until there is a larger gathering of forces across the community working to rebuild and replenish the supply of scientific and technological skills. I think this is particularly important in breaking the growing disinterest of talented students in taking up the sciences. Genuine fears have been expressed about the supply of numbers of various qualified graduates, but my concerns are equally with the quality of the secondary school students entering the sciences at present. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am afraid I am unashamedly elitist when it comes to the sciences. I am not in the least interested in sacrificing the core disciplines to an egalitarian ethos. But I do not think this problem will dissipate in any fundamental way until the young are able to grasp in concrete ways the diversity of career paths afforded by their participation in the sciences. As well, there is a pressing need for the universities to present a much stronger scientific and technological profile in the core disciplines. </PARA>
<PARA>  As you will appreciate, Mr Deputy Chairman, the current generation of students are not intellectual puritans. They are the products of enormous economic changes and they have a healthy dose of realism about their future and where their interests best lie. They do not have to be bought but they do have to be won. They have to be convinced of the value of a commitment to the sciences. </PARA>
<PARA>  Increasingly, secondary students are coming to see university education as an asset in which they invest personal, intellectual and financial resources. They expect the best in a way in which I do not think previous generations have. We might well lament this trend as a new style of educational consumerism but it does have its merits. Regardless of this, in order to regain a pull on students' imagination, universities and research agencies and governments are going to have to work together to promote the sciences. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Defence budget that we are debating this afternoon has been formulated at a time when a number of Australians are running around this country saying that we should be yielding some type of a peace dividend. Of course we in this country welcome the decisions by the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom to reduce their levels of nuclear armaments. We warmly welcome the final demise of what has for decades been known as the Cold War.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  But it is very important in this country that we do not draw the conclusion--the completely false conclusion--from those very progressive and happy events that we ourselves can reap some type of peace dividend, that we can start to disband our defence forces and that we can wind back any commitment we have to defence because, somehow, the trouble for the world is now over. The fact is that the peace that has broken out --the end of the Cold War, to put it another way--has very few implications for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  We live in an extraordinarily volatile region of the world, as can be seen from events in neighbouring countries over the last few months. It is a region which is unpredictable and uncertain. In that context, any government which takes the view--and I must say that this Government has at times taken this view--that there could be no serious threat to Australia in a period of 10 or 15 years is extraordinarily unwise. </PARA>
<PARA>  I thought the words of Admiral Jeremiah on 27 September were very chilling. When he was in Australia, Admiral Jeremiah, who is one of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, made the point that there are 20 states on the threshold of possessing nuclear weapons and that more could develop chemical and biological weapons. As Admiral Jeremiah points out, we do live in very difficult and unpredictable times. That is a very important reason for us to build up a strong and effective defence force. </PARA>
<PARA>  Yet this Budget and the approach of government these days to the issue of defence implies that Australia is reaping a peace dividend. The Budget weakens Australia's defence capability and, to be specific, it cuts our combat capability. In addition to that, it kills off any prospects of essential equipment purchases such as the airborne early warning aircraft system or the coastal mine hunters. Both of these sets of purchases have been regarded by the ADF as an essential part of a strong and effective Australian defence capability. Yet, this Budget has effectively killed off any prospect of those purchases. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the few minutes that I have left to me this afternoon I want to talk about two initiatives basically in the Budget which have been part of the Government's general defence review over recent months. One is the prospect of greater commercialisation and the other is the concept of ready reserves, which was the topic of some heated controversy at Question Time today. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, we on this side of the chamber support commercialisation in so far as it is practical. Our view is that what the Government has proposed in the area of commercialisation does not go nearly far enough. Indeed, the Government has trumpeted results in the field of commercialisation. But it is worth reflecting on the fact that this commercialisation will not begin at all until the 1992-93 financial year and that in that year effectively only 158 positions will be commercialised. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government had originally identified something like 21,000 positions which could be commercialised. Yet, by 1994-95 fewer than 1,000 positions will have been commercialised. Indeed, it is worth reflecting that up until 1994-95 the Government's approach to commercialisation is one that will cost money rather than save money. </PARA>
<PARA>  The burden of the remarks that I want to make today relates to the concept of the Ready Reserve. I regard this as a very important change in defence policy in this country. My view is that it is a very deleterious change in defence policy. We have disbanded two battalions and effectively we have replaced them with this concept of the Ready Reserve. </PARA>
<PARA>  In answer to a dorothy dix question asked today, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) claimed that he had every confidence in the Ready Reserve concept and that somehow he had been misrepresented in a newspaper report. Interestingly enough, he did not explain how he had been misrepresented or what he had said. But I thought what he said was in a sense right and it is a shame that he is trying desperately to run away from that. When he was launching the ready reserves on 2 October 1991, the Minister said that he would rather put money on the scheme's success than on the Melbourne Cup. That is comforting! But he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>When it comes to the real thing, it's possible it may not work. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what was said by one of the Ministers who have overall responsibility for the Ready Reserve. </PARA>
<PARA>  As you well know, Mr Deputy Chairman, we have a range of objections to the Ready Reserve. You, Mr Deputy Chairman, have been very outspoken on this issue. In the three or four minutes that I have left, I would just like to run through some of those objections. </PARA>
<PARA>  First of all, the Ready Reserve will not be ready enough. The Government says that the ready reserves will be equally as trained and prepared for combat as the regular forces that they replace. That, of course, is a nonsense. The ready reservists will serve for only 50 days a year compared with the full time service of the regular battalions. </PARA>
<PARA>  Ready reservists will be spread throughout the country and will exercise together for just a few weeks a year. And we are expected to believe that they will be as efficient as the battalions that they replace. I find that extraordinarily hard to believe. All the time that I think about that question I recall the chilling words of the Minister that when it comes to the real thing it is possible that it might not work. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, the proposal has not been properly costed. The Government maintains that the Ready Reserve is a low cost option for defence. We know that the Government is interested in defence on the cheap. But the force structure review estimated that a ready reservist would cost the equivalent of 30 per cent of a regular soldier. Fair enough, that is the review's figure. But the Government was forced to admit in reply to a question on notice asked recently by Senator Durack that the Army believes that the cost of a ready reservist will be more like 50 to 60 per cent the cost of a regular soldier. So, in other words, the Government has no idea whether the cost of the Ready Reserve will be its estimate or something approaching double its estimate. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third point is that we on this side of the chamber believe that the four Regular Army battalions will simply not be enough. Because of a lack of time, I will just say that we are committed to the six battalions. Senator Durack has said on the record on a number of occasions that when in government we will return to that formation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Fourthly, the Ready Reserve, though, also means that there will be more defence bureaucracy. It will introduce yet another element of bureaucracy into the Defence Force so that we will have three tiers of military service--and of course we will need more bureaucrats to administer those three tiers. Fifthly, the existing Reserve will become the poor cousin of the Ready Reserve. The Government has promised to do something about the existing Reserve. The Auditor-General in August 1990 criticised the Government for doing too little in that area. The Government has not even responded to that report, let alone done anything to build up the existing Reserve. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a range of other problems that time does not permit me to go through; suffice it to say that I regard this Ready Reserve development as one of the most serious and deleterious developments that has occurred in the Australian Defence Force for many years. It is a very sad development and it is particularly sad that one of the Ministers responsible, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, has such little confidence in it that he thinks it might be worth only slightly more than a wager on the Melbourne Cup. He is not too sure it is going to turn out very happily in the end. So we have a Government trying to reap a peace dividend when Australia cannot afford the peace dividend. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) tried to claim today that the Government's first priority must be the defence of the land. However, this is not the Government's first priority. It is clearly one of its last priorities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The speech just made by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) deserves a response but, according to the exigencies of this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and particularly with regard to the Department of Defence, time does not permit it and I must confine my remarks to other areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I have often said in this House that the fundamental duty of any Federal Government is to provide for the security of Australian citizens, and this Budget discharges that obligation. The Australian defence forces are becoming more battle capable than ever before. The 1991-92 defence budget has been prepared against a decision by this Government to set defence planning guidance at zero percentage real growth over the 1992-95 Forward Estimates period. This financial year, the defence budget is $9,435m and it represents approximately 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product. This year's defence allocation represents an increase of $369m over 1990-91 or a 4.1 per cent increase but, after taking account of inflation, the defence allocation this year represents zero real growth over last year. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the context of expenditure constraints in almost every area of Federal Government activity, the maintenance of the current level of defence outlays is evidence of this Government's ongoing commitment to sustain and improve the combat capability and effectiveness of the Australian Defence Force. Funding for capital equipment projects this financial year is over $607m. There are a number of items of particular importance which have received priority in this Budget. For example, new major capital equipment projects include Raven combat radios, wheeled armoured fighting vehicles and RF/F-111C simulator upgrading and replacement. </PARA>
<PARA>  During exercise Kangaroo `89, one glaring deficiency identified was the poor state of field communications equipment in the Australian Army. It was found to be deficient to the extent that it would adversely affect the combat capability of fighting units. The Raven combat radio represents a huge increase in communications capabilities within the Australian Defence Force. The first 85 sets have been issued to 3rd Brigade, Australian Army, in Townsville. During the next 12 months, more than 3,000 radio sets will be issued on a regional and priority basis to units throughout the country. In addition, more than 3,500 VHF radio sets are expected to begin entering the service in mid-1993. They will be phased in over a two-year period. </PARA>
<PARA>  The new Raven radio compares favourably with any other combat radio system in service worldwide. Raven radio is capable of handling a wide range of traffic, including voice; teletypewriter; low speed data, up to 300 bits per second; high speed data, up to 16,000 bits per second; and morse code. I am advised that increased survivability against enemy jamming is also an add-on feature of the new radios, which can be fitted with hopping units programmed to change frequency many times per second during transmission. This makes enemy interception of messages more difficult. Apart from having a communications range for HF radio sets in the hundreds of kilometres, the Raven radio has exceptional survivability, being able to operate in virtually any environment, even after undergoing water immersion and damage by electric shock. I congratulate the Australian Defence Force on its acquisition of the Raven radio. It will ensure that the Australian Defence Force will remain at the forefront of communications technology well into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA>  Continuing capital equipment allocations include $657m for the Collins class submarines, $338m for the Anzac ships, $89m for the new FFG frigates Melbourne and Newcastle, $65m for the F111 avionics update, $52m for small arms and $28m for Harpoon missiles. Apart from the items I have just mentioned, many other important projects will receive funding under the continuing capital equipment program. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget also includes a substantial allocation for new capital facilities. For example, in my own electorate of Herbert over $1.3m is allocated to complete a clothing and dangerous goods store. This sum is a follow-on to more than $28m expended last year on capital defence works in Townsville. The number of permanent Defence Force personnel funded under this Budget is 67,664. This is in line with the force structure review policy announced by the Government earlier this year. The reserve forces have been funded to a target strength of 29,017, and the funded strength target for the first year of the new Ready Reserve is 1,298. </PARA>
<PARA>  The decision by the Government to maintain in real terms the level of expenditure for housing compared with last year's allocation is especially welcome. The provision of housing for defence personnel is one of the essential conditions of service for members of the Australian Defence Force. The Government is to be congratulated on its continuing commitment to improve the quantity and quality of defence housing and assistance. Honourable members will also be pleased to learn that about 87 per cent of total defence expenditure this financial year will be spent in Australia. This can only encourage local contractors and has the added benefit of increasing Australia's self-reliance. </PARA>
<PARA>  I congratulate the Hawke Government and the Australian Defence Force on their continued commitment to the Kangaroo series of defence exercises. From March to April next year, more than 12,000 defence personnel from all three Australian services and the United States will take part in Kangaroo 1992. The exercise will be held across the Top End of Australia and it is designed to test the overall capability of the Australian Defence Force to defeat small scale raids. Many honourable members attended Kangaroo 89 which was the largest peacetime defence exercise ever held in Australia. Exercise Kangaroo 92 is about half the size of exercise Kangaroo 89. Whereas Kangaroo 89 involved brigades of more than 3,000 troops in various exercises across the Northern Territory, Cape York Peninsula and north-western Australia, Kangaroo 92 will involve units at company level and, on rare occasions, at battalion level. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nevertheless, Kangaroo 92 is designed to provide realistic training for members of the Australian Defence Force in dealing with opponents operating in small units. Not only will next year's exercise test the tactical skill of units, but it will also challenge the formidable logistic demands of units operating in a vast area with little civilian infrastructure. I hope that honourable members of this House will avail themselves of the opportunity to visit units in the field during exercise Kangaroo 92. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this speech I have dealt with some of the highlights of the budgetary allocations for defence this year. Nevertheless, I take this opportunity to voice my concerns about the number of recent media reports concerning attempts by Australia to set up new regional security arrangements. I believe that Australia should be very cautious in exploring the opportunity to develop bilateral or multilateral security arrangements between Australia and the countries of South East Asia. Notwithstanding the reservations sometimes expressed about the effectiveness of the ANZUS Treaty, the indisputable fact is that the ANZUS Treaty guarantees the national sovereignty of Australia. For that commitment by the people of the United States, Australia has an important responsibility to fulfil its obligations under the treaty and, accordingly, Australia should not do anything to compromise in the slightest degree its ability to fulfil its ANZUS responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have grounds for suspecting that a number of South East Asian countries would prefer Australia to withdraw from the ANZUS Treaty. Their motives remain a mystery to me because the ANZUS Treaty is a defence treaty designed to resist aggression. Together with the ANZUS Treaty, Australia's membership of the five power defence arrangement has helped maintain regional security for 20 years. Whilst I support Australian officials having discussions with their counterparts in South East Asian countries on cooperative arrangements with respect to air and sea surveillance, intelligence exchanges and training exercises, to date there has not been one valid reason put forward why Australia should enter into any fresh bilateral or multilateral security pacts with the nations of South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA>  It seems that Australia has yet to develop its vision as a regional South Pacific power within the so-called new world order. I suggest that this vision must be articulated on the foundations of the ANZUS Treaty. We must never allow ourselves to be lulled into believing that the so-called attractions of regional security cooperation outweigh the inestimable benefits of the ANZUS Treaty. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Today I wish to make some general comments on the Defence appropriations. I believe that it will be of assistance to remind honourable members of some of the main objectives of our defence forces, as a number of other speakers have already. One of the prime objectives of our naval defence force is to provide a maritime force capable of conducting effective maritime operations in the pursuit of Australia's interests using regular and reserve forces, and expanding in a timely manner against warning of more substantial conflict. Likewise, our Army is to provide land forces capable of conducting effective land operations in the pursuit of Australia's security interests using both regular and reserve forces. Our air defence force is to provide an air force that is capable of effective strategic and tactical operations as an independent, joint and combined force, including support of maritime and land operations, again in the pursuit of Australia's defence and internal security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  With these objectives in mind, I was most interested to note a Government decision that appeared in Budget Paper No. 1, on page 3.28, which said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided to maximise combat capability by reducing the numbers of service personnel. </PARA>
<PARA>This comment was in relation to the force structure review recently outlined by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney). </PARA>
<PARA>  It never ceases to amaze me that the Government really believes that Australia's defence forces combat capability will be improved by reductions which include abolishing two Regular Army battalions, one regular tank squadron and one regular engineer construction squadron. Our peacetime Defence Force must be kept at a high level of readiness if we are to have a credible deterrent. Our forces who went off to the Gulf had a lot to learn, in many cases learning skills en route to the area of conflict. Equipment was fitted onto ships in a great rush and the technicians and operators of new equipment were fundamentally self-taught. </PARA>
<PARA>  We should reflect on lessons from our previous wartime experiences and remember that one of these lessons has got to be the importance of maintaining a well-equipped and well-trained Defence Force so that we may rapidly deter any aggressor and so allow our country to remain at peace. With this in mind, it is again disappointing to note that spending in the 1991-92 Budget is estimated to be slightly less than 2.4 per cent of GDP, well below the 2.6 per cent widely acknowledged as the minimum necessary to maintain an effective force and representing, sadly, a zero increase on the 1990-91 figures. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, as time goes on this Government continually fails to give our nation's security the priority it deserves, in spite of considerable amounts of rhetoric. An Australia Defence Association article on the appropriations now before the Committee concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite popular assumptions that defence outlays are driven by economic imperatives, defence commitments are actually driven by the Governments political priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Sadly, I believe the author's perception is not too far from the truth. On page 3.34 of Budget Paper No. 1, it is stated that in 1991-92 there will be a forecast reduction of 966 ADF permanent forces when it is estimated that only 698 will be recruited into the new Ready Reserve during this same period. This means that we will lose a significant number of highly trained and experienced personnel who will be replaced with a significantly smaller number of untrained, inexperienced ready reservists. According to Government calculations, we will be better off and maximising our combat capability. I notice that the Minister got quite upset today with a newspaper report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 8 October, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Bilney, confirmed after the launch that the Ready Reserve plan may not prove viable. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that, among other things along the same lines. The Minister came into the House today to repudiate, or minimise, those comments. Yet we saw, with all the expertise that the United States has with ready reservists and their long experience, that in some of the reports on the response of its ready reservists in the Middle East it was very concerned that the ready reservists were not as ready as it thought they would be for such a very important occasion. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another area of concern is the apparent contradiction in Government rhetoric and Government practice. I am referring to the decision to make large cuts to the funding of the defence science area. For quite some time now we have heard the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) exhorting the nation to become `the clever country' and to use our intelligence to rise above our present situation. In a practical contradiction of this principle, funding for defence science has been cut by a massive 5.5 per cent in real terms--from $227.2m to $221.1m. The coalition has a very clear policy in this area and it is worth quoting:</PARA>
<PARA>  The Defence Science and Technology Organisation has made and is making a great contribution to Australia's Defence effort. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Liberal and National Parties support the general thrust of the current re-organisation within DSTO, and in particular the increased emphasis on innovative research and the transfer of engineering work to Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Liberal and National Parties recognise the Australia-wide problem of the scarcity of science and engineering graduates which is faced by DSTO and other scientific bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>  Particular attention will be given to measures to attract and retain the high calibre of recruits needed in the fields of engineering and science. </PARA>
<PARA>The coalition clearly recognises the need for Australia to encourage our young graduates to stay in Australia and dedicate themselves to the development of future technology within this country in order that Australian industry and indeed Australia as a whole will reap the benefits. By slashing defence science funding, all we will do is supply our bright young graduates with still more reasons to look at overseas opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is one other area I would like to touch on before I conclude--the area of Australian Defence Industries Ltd. In December last year, ADI, Australia's largest defence manufacturer, announced a long term restructuring plan the purpose of which was to restructure and to consolidate manufacturing facilities to avert a projected future loss of $60m over the ensuing five year period. This restructuring includes the establishment of a state of the art ammunition plant of world standard later this decade but results in the closure of three existing plants, one of which is the St Mary's munitions plant, located at the far eastern boundary of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>  The thing that amazes me and indeed puzzles me about this decision is that ADI has just spent at least $8.4m in the construction of a new shell filling facility on that very site. According to a report by the Joint Committee on Public Works in April 1989, this new facility was built to replace facilities which had been operating since 1958 and had reached the end of their economic life due to high usage and general wear and corrosion. </PARA>
<PARA>  What I would like to know is why all this money was spent on these new facilities. I did not mention initially the additional $1.5m that was spent on consultancy fees for the same building. It is absolutely imperative that somebody come out and take responsibility for this decision. We are talking about $10m of taxpayers' funds, which would be very helpful in the defence budget. The Minister says that it was ADI's responsibility; ADI says that the decision to build it was made before it came into existence. So we still do not know who bears the responsibility for this huge $10m loss to the Australian taxpayer. My understanding at the moment is that in the not too distant future it will provide employment for people armed with bulldozers and other demolition gear to pull the building down. </PARA>
<PARA>  The only defence that ADI seems to have is: `It wasn't our fault', and my question, again, is: who is going to be big enough to stand up and take the blame? (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I regret to say that the speech of the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) is entirely inconsistent because his Leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), at the time of his response to the Budget suggested that the Budget should have been balanced. That would have meant that $4.7 billion--$4,700m--had to be taken out of expenditure. If honourable members opposite were going to take $4,700m out of total expenditure, where were they going to get additional funds for defence? They could have been taken only from other areas of economic and social expenditure--other very high priority areas which could not possibly have coped with further cuts. What he was just saying was really, I am afraid, cloud-cuckoo-land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  At this moment we have opportunities that have not been available to the world for nearly a century. The twentieth century has been dominated by war--the First and Second World Wars, innumerable regional wars, including the Vietnam and Gulf wars, and, for the last 40 years, the Cold War. The Cold War in particular has justified the maintenance of massive and previously unprecedented levels of military power. Now the Cold War is over, its end having been symbolised by the signing last November in Paris of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, negotiated by the 22 NATO and Warsaw Pact countries. The recent reciprocal unilateral announcements of reductions in nuclear weapons and demobilisation of nuclear bombers and other weapons systems by Presidents Bush and Gorbachev are the most vivid illustration of the end of the Cold War. </PARA>
<PARA>  These potent examples all demonstrate clearly that the world has a better chance of substantially and sustainably reducing wasteful military spending than at any other time during the twentieth century. Such a reduction in military spending would allow all countries to concentrate increased resources on top priority economic and social development. </PARA>
<PARA>  Major structural shifts in policy commonly occur in postwar periods. For example, between 1945 and 1946, US defence spending fell by almost 27 per cent of GNP--approximately a quarter. The end of the Cold War offers the same type of opportunity. The bipolar world of the Cold War has become a multipolar world in which the United States is now the sole superpower. The US therefore has the responsibility for leading the development of a demilitarised global security system. President Bush demonstrated acceptance of that responsibility with his recent announcements. Everyone concerned about the reduction of military tension must praise his initiative wholeheartedly. Likewise, we must welcome President Gorbachev's far reaching response. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the central reasons for welcoming these dramatic changes is that wasteful military expenditure can now be reduced. The central rationale for cutting military outlays is their opportunity cost--that is, the opportunities for alternative consumption and investment forgone. Military expenditure is wasteful consumption; every dollar spent on military activity is a dollar which cannot be spent elsewhere. In the context of a given Budget stance, military spending is most obviously in conflict with other forms of public consumption. This choice is between defence and such things as education and health, social security and aid to developing countries, national parks and the arts. </PARA>
<PARA>  The long term effects are even more serious when public investment is reduced to make way for defence. Cancellation of or delays to improvements in the public infrastructure reduce national productivity, so slowing economic growth as well as reducing convenience and safety. At a time when, in all industrialised and developing countries, schools and universities, health centres and hospitals are being deprived of urgently needed funds, when there is a housing shortage, when urgently needed improvements to road and rail systems are being delayed by funding restraints and when overseas aid has stagnated or been cut, a continuing high level of defence spending would be impossible to justify, particularly since the international strategic environment has become more benign than at any time for a century. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are also important secondary reasons why cuts in military spending should be maximised. For all but the major arms exporters, military spending involves a net loss of foreign exchange. As well, military expenditure tends to stimulate inflation, and the experience of the Korean and Vietnam wars illustrates that vividly. Military research and development diverts scientists and engineers from far more productive civilian activities. Further, military outlays stimulate growth of employment by less than equivalent outlays on such activities as education and health. In sum, military expenditure retards economic development. </PARA>
<PARA>  There will, of course, be many difficulties in achieving major defence cuts. The first is simply in enabling key decision makers and the wider public to recognise the extent of feasible reductions in defence outlays. Massive military expenditure in peacetime is no longer perceived as an aberration. Most people have forgotten the tiny size of standing armies before World War I. In the United States military spending was less than 1 1/2 per cent of GNP whereas it was over 6 per cent for most of the 1980s. An important task is therefore to work out both visionary and feasible targets. Is a general target of halving defence outlays during the next five years, on a reciprocal global scale, too ambitious?</PARA>
<PARA>  The beneficiaries of defence cuts far outnumber the losers. Those who benefit directly from defence cuts include everyone in the community who wants more jobs, the business people who want infrastructure improvements, the educationalists who want improved schools and universities, the health workers, the construction industry, the scientists, the social security beneficiaries, the poorly housed, and us, the politicians who represent this great majority of the population. Recognition of the fact that the beneficiaries of defence cuts far outnumber the losers makes disarmament much more likely. </PARA>
<PARA>  The environment for defence cuts would be enhanced by regional security agreements. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe offers an effective precedent to other regions such as our own on the Pacific Rim. Similarly, the United Nations has a vital role in increasing local security. That role was enhanced during the Gulf war. The implications of that enhanced role must now be worked out. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, there is an unprecedented window of opportunity now for achieving major reductions in military expenditure. Such reductions would liberate human and financial resources for desperately needed economic and social development both here and overseas. They would also contribute to reducing the threat to the natural environment from war, which was so tragically demonstrated during the Gulf war. The next year will be crucial in determining whether there is a structural shift towards lower military expenditure in all countries. The signs are encouraging. Everyone can contribute to promoting attitudes and information which make such a structural shift politically feasible. Major defence cuts will increase economic, environmental and strategic security. </PARA>

Any sort of complacency, that sort of pacifist garbage that we hear, is a recipe for absolute disaster. The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) believes that we would not have a balance of payments problem if we did it his way. But we would not have a country. He says that we would not have to worry about anything. That is absolute rubbish. His economic solution to our problems is to cut defence expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If nothing else--I emphasise `if nothing else'--the ADF provides an enormous amount of worthwhile employment and training for people. If anything, I would advocate a considerable expansion of expenditure on defence. Incidentally, national service was very good for me and it would be good for a lot of young people today. In my view, they would be better off in the Army than sitting around doing nothing. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will just calm down a little and make the remarks that I really wanted to make. The 1991-92 defence budget followed hot on the heels of the force structure review announced in Parliament on 30 May. The Budget confirmed what that review revealed--an appalling lack of commitment by this Government to the future defence of Australia. Spending in 1991-92 is estimated to be slightly less than 2.4 per cent of GDP--very low. Defence spending will amount to 9.3 per cent of Federal spending. This continues the steady decline in Government priority given to defence since the 1987 White Paper. The net effect of the Budget reveals that the Defence Force will lose the equivalent of 1,104 trained personnel for a gain of no more than 700 untrained ready reservists. Unfortunately, the Budget confirmed that Labor has lost its resolve on defence. The Budget showed that Labor is not genuinely interested in reforming defence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-No, it never had any resolve. It has not lost it; it never had it in the first place, and it is not interested in developing a genuinely self-reliant defence policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In my speech which followed the Minister's May statement, I referred to the motto of the RSL--`The price of liberty is eternal vigilance'. If the honourable member for Fraser were here now, I would remind him about that. Even the Boy Scouts' motto is `Be prepared'. In defence, vigilance is vital. Of course, being prepared has to be the crux of any worthwhile defence policy. Australia has never been properly or adequately prepared for war and in some respects perhaps one never can be. But now, with this risky, untried strategy of replacing trained personnel with a Ready Reserve, there is no guarantee that we will be prepared. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nobody disputes that there is a need for reorganisation of the ADF. Our response to the Gulf war, commendable though it was, underlined for us some of the inadequacies of the ADF. The ships that we sent there were equipped only by cannibalising and borrowing. There was never any real possibility of committing Army or Air Force personnel to the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA>  Also of genuine concern is that the ADF has one of the highest ratios of officers to other ranks of any defence force in the world. This present restructuring is, however, seriously flawed because of its reliance on the creation of the so-called Ready Reserve. This is certain to produce an ADF with fewer regular or reserve combat ready troops. </PARA>
<PARA>  The proposed reduction of 10,000 in the regular force and the addition of only 4,100 to the Ready Reserve does not add up. It means fewer personnel and, more importantly, fewer trained personnel. Even today in Question Time there were a couple of dorothy dixer questions to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) about the Ready Reserve and the Prime Minister stood up and trumpeted the Government's achievements in defence. But it was really hollow rhetoric. It was not borne out by the facts. The facts are that this Government has put the defence of Australia at risk and it continues to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's Budget driven approach to defence came very close to home for me the other day. The Army is currently conducting a fire risk analysis of its properties. Apparently, it intends to dismantle some of its firefighting units. At the land warfare centre at Canungra, which is in my electorate, this particular firefighting unit is manned by personnel of the Royal Australian Engineers, headed by Sergeant David Morse. That unit has played an important and valuable role in fighting recent devastating fires at both Mount Tamborine and in the upper and lower Beechmont areas. Some of these fires actually originated on the 6,000 hectare Army property and spread to the surrounding areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  So, in light of that terrific work done by these trained firefighting personnel, I appeal to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to recognise the vital role that these firefighting units have to play not only on the base but also in the adjoining community where many of the soldiers who work at the base reside. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, fighting fires requires considerable expertise. It is not just a matter of training soldiers in how to stamp out the odd grassfire. A lot more is involved. Sergeant Morse, in particular, has special expertise in preventative firefighting--in back-burning and those sorts of skills. I take this opportunity, while we are dealing with the appropriation of defence funds, to thank Sergeant Morse and his troops, on behalf of the surrounding communities, for their tremendous work. I know that my colleague the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), who is presently away on parliamentary business and in whose electorate Leahys Lookout at Mount Tamborine falls, would join me in paying this tribute. </PARA>
<PARA>  I appreciate the assurances that I have received from the Army, as recently as early this afternoon, that it will not act precipitately at Canungra and that a thorough examination of the circumstances in that area will be undertaken, including full consultation with the local community and the Beaudesert Shire Council, before any action is taken to close down those firefighting units. I assume that the same sorts of considerations will apply to firefighting units elsewhere in Australia. It certainly caused a considerable amount of alarm in the community adjoining Canungra when the word got out that part of the review--I guess as a result of the constraints on the availability of funds--was an intention to take action in respect of firefighting units. It just shows how easily things can go off the rails. But I am pleased to have those assurances from the Army that action will not be taken without a due process of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have a great interest in defence. As I have said, I had what I regard as the great privilege of having been a national serviceman in the late 1960s. I regard the defence of this country as absolutely fundamental. While I am a member of the House of Representatives, I will not stand by and let defence be downgraded in priority, as it has been consistently. When I come in here and hear the sort of garbage trotted out by the honourable member for Fraser, that sick, pale, pacifist approach that says that we really ought to be diverting funds away from defence into other areas, I get very angry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --I would like to endorse the remarks made by the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) and commend him for them. In the few minutes available to me I want to look at a number of aspects of defence. It is apparent that we are debating the estimates of the Department of Defence. It is quite impossible in 10 minutes to range over all the inadequacies of the estimates now presented. I use this occasion to say that on other occasions there have been more adequate procedures for examining estimates than there are in this chamber. I am disappointed that they do not exist now. This estimates debate is a bit of a farce, and that is a great tragedy in a matter such as this where the Defence Force structure review essentially should be able to be matched against the resources available within a proper estimates scrutiny. It is a great pity that that cannot be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The obvious concern that we in the Opposition have--I suspect it is a concern of many, not only in the defence community but in Australia at large--is that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has recently brought down a Defence Force restructure without having in any way revised the 1987 White Paper or produced new strategic bases from which we could make a judgment on it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Enormous changes have taken place around the world in the defence alignments. Only last week President Gorbachev responded to President Bush's initiative with respect to further movements in nuclear disarmament. Australia is certainly an interested observer in those disarmament processes. Perhaps of even greater importance to us is the consequence of the Mount Pinatubo eruption. It closed Clark Field. As well, we have the rejection by the Philippines Senate of moves by the United States Administration to retain the Subic Bay naval base. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have these reduced tensions resulting from both the disarmament talks and changes within the Soviet Union itself, including the undoubted economic difficulties that plague the Soviet Union. Anybody looking at our part of the world would be foolish if he thought they necessarily could be translated into reduced security or defence requirements here. Because of that Subic decision and the problems in a number of nations in our region, in my view there is probably an enhanced requirement for defence within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  In these estimates we have been given at best a maintenance of funds for this year's defence expenditure and a projection of reduced funds in the future. It is from that base that the Government has propounded its concept of a Ready Reserve. I thought that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) showed a bit of common sense in his reported comments last weekend. There is no doubt that the Ready Reserve will not work for the Navy and it will not work for the Air Force. When my colleague the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), in his role as acting shadow Minister for defence, commented the other day on the problems with the Ready Reserve, he quite properly referred to the fact that now is not the time to embark on a new defence initiative unless we provide the Department of Defence and the ADF with the resources to allow it to be implemented. That has not happened. We are not only going to reduce or eliminate two battalions of Regular Army personnel but we are going to introduce a new instrumentality at the cost of the regular forces by transferring resources from the regulars to the Ready Reserve. </PARA>
<PARA>  I frankly do not think now is the time to try a Ready Reserve. I am not against the concept, but I am very apprehensive about the impact on the availability of regular personnel. I certainly do not believe that we can take it from the existing Army Reserve or, for that matter, the reserves of the other two forces. Now strategically is not the time to embark on a new venture when there are demands which even this week the Government has announced which ensure that there will be a greater obligation on the regulars at a time when we are going to diminish them. We need to be conscious of those other demands and try to work out where we should go. I suggest to the Government--I will not have time to expand on it in the few minutes I have--that it is quite critical that it understand and investigate to a greater degree what sort of role it believes Australia should have in the United Nations and other multinational peacekeeping roles around the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have heard this week, initially from an announcement last week or perhaps three weeks ago by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), that we are going to send some signallers to Cambodia. We already have a number of units participating in various peacekeeping roles overseas. In the past we have always said that we are not going to develop our force structure according to our peacekeeping obligations. We are not going to be like Canada which always allows for those peacekeeping obligations.   For all that the Chief of the Defence Force, General Gration, has said that he thinks we could allow for some commitment in the Gulf and a commitment in Cambodia without it unduly affecting our defence capacity--according to the evidence tendered to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which in May 1991 produced a report on Australia and United Nations peacekeeping--I do not believe him. What is more, that comment was made before the announcement on the Ready Reserve. I think we are creating an impossible burden relating not just to maintaining our ordinary exercise commitments, but if there were to be any sort of defence threat to this country we have no capacity to have forces stationed all over the place on peacekeeping roles. Whether they are signal units or any one of those other units that we have overseas at the moment, they do impinge on our present defence capability. </PARA>
<PARA>  On top of having those peacekeeping forces away we are also going to have an additional commitment to divert resources to create the Ready Reserve. We are stretching what we have far too far. I do not believe that it is practical or desirable or within Australia's defence capability to undertake what the Government is doing without providing more resources. I am most concerned about the general presentation of these estimates and the fact that we are committing ourselves increasingly to a peacekeeping role. Honourable members should not get me wrong; I am all in favour of maintaining our peacekeeping role, but we can only do it with an adequate resource. There is not an adequate resource. There is not sufficient funding to undertake the commitments in the 1987 White Paper which the Minister still says is the basis of our present forward defence planning. </PARA>
<PARA>  We certainly do not have the new revised strategic bases on which the Defence Force task can be set, yet we have these fundamental changes in the strategic situation, fundamental realignments between the superpowers and the potential withdrawal of the Americans in one year's time, not only from the Clark airfield but from the Subic naval base. It will create an enormous problem for us at a time when the strategic situation is more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA>  I move from there to two other factors that concern me. There was recently a corporate plan produced on defence communications. Defence communications is critical. There is still a totally inadequate network of communications within the Australian defence forces. There has been significant development as far as Discon and Parakeet are concerned and project Raven is still under way, but at the moment we are still using World War II type telephone communications in many instances. I am worried that we do not seem to be providing enough resources to permit the modernisation of our defence network as we should. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will give honourable members an idea of how inadequate the Government's planning is. The Government says it is going to take over, and fund and operate, the North West Cape communications base. I am all in favour of maintaining international alliances. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is long on rhetoric. The absolute nonsense today about the priority he gives to defence just does not ring true. What he has got to understand is that we, under his Government, are more dependent on overseas support and coordination than we have ever been. He should not come to the business of designing and manufacturing defence equipment in Australia. This Government has maintained design capability abroad to a greater degree than we did and now it is going to take over North West Cape entirely. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not know the final terms of the funding arrangement. I would be very interested to hear them. I think this House should be told exactly where those negotiations are. We have been told there has been a bit of a wink and a nod and the Americans have come to the party. Frankly, from my point of view, the funds that are going into North West Cape to operate it entirely would have been far better spent upgrading our ordinary on-ground communications and defence communications network. We must maintain that North West Cape facility. We are absolutely dependent on it for our submarine communications. It is not something hidden or subtle, or something that is going to encourage nuclear war. It is providing an essential communications base for our maritime requirements around Australia and in peacekeeping roles. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister ought to realise that we still have ships in the Gulf. He referred to one of them today--HMAS Sydney. North West Cape provides a vital link in that area. If we are going to provide money for things, for goodness sake let us plan how we are going to do it, let us take notice of forward requirements and do not let us impinge on other requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am most concerned about the state of the defence forces today. These estimates are totally inadequate and I do not believe this Government is adequately meeting the defence need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It would be fair to say that most honourable members in this House in the last couple of months have received voluminous briefing documents from the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and other sources. We have been regaled with glossy brochures, briefings, and goodness knows what else, as well as the Budget and Estimates documents themselves. We have also been regaled by advice and views by so-called experts, and by interviews, on television, radio and in the print media, with former service chiefs and other self-appointed experts and specialists. But, in talking to servicemen around the traps in all the services, and at a variety of levels, I detect in this latest move by the Government, in the whole defence area, a mood almost of depression--certainly one of professional frustration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There is no doubt that technology has changed the very nature of war in the last few years. The Gulf war in particular taught us all many new lessons. Perhaps one could venture to say that for the first time in its 70-year history, air power actually delivered in the way that it had been promising for many a long day. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the same time, we have an environment where government spending is under the closest scrutiny. The annual defence budget of $9 billion has come under the microscope. The Government, we are told, now proposes the contracting out of a range of defence activities to private industry, the shifting of more responsibilities onto part time reservists and cuts of over 10,000 in regular personnel. It is proposing the closing or relocating of bases in the southern part of Australia which no longer fulfil a viable role in the nation's strategic planning. There are significant additions to the capital equipment program. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, the question mark that lingers--and it will only be proved one way or another as the programs are implemented over the coming decade--is whether, in the final outcome, the process will see a fundamental improvement in Australia's combat capability, at no increase in cost. That is the intention, of course, in all those glib phrases about `leaner and meaner', `more teeth, less tail', `more bang for the buck' and so on. But the mere fact that the results of these decisions can only be known and tested over a long time frame naturally creates uncertainties and vulnerabilities for the Government, and in fact for the whole nation. I suspect the Government has had to persuade the defence forces themselves that these are changes for the ultimate good. With what has been happening recently as a result of the Defence Force review and other proposals, I suspect that the Government has really had no choice but to grit its teeth and push ahead anyway. </PARA>
<PARA>  I accept the strategic orthodoxy that Australia must focus an increasing proportion of its defence resources in the north and to the west of the continent, as it is there that there is a far greater likelihood of any immediate threat to Australia's security. But the most important argument for the Minister to answer concerns whether this entire exercise has got more to do with simple cost cutting--cost cutting, I would suggest, to cover past mismanagement and over-reaching in the defence budget--rather than any fundamental reassessment of Australia's defence needs. </PARA>
<PARA>  When Senator Robert Ray took over from the former Minister for Defence, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), after the 1990 election, he found that the big spending had been done--on the FA18 fighter, the Anzac frigates, the Collins class submarines and so on. These were regarded as essential ingredients in our defence posture, in line with the 1987 Defence White Paper, which laid down the strategic framework for the policy of defence self-reliance. Each of these expensive elements would perform a key role in protecting the northern sea and air approaches to Australia, but the purchases had the effect of locking up the defence budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  After meeting the annual costs of those weapon systems, along with the normal operating costs such as salaries and superannuation, there was no flexibility for additional spending. The Defence White Paper assumed that defence spending would remain constant at or near 3 per cent of GDP. In fact, spending fell to 2.3 per cent last year and is claimed to be 2.4 per cent in this year's Budget. But, incredibly, in this Budget the Government has stated that it will maximise combat capability by reducing front line personnel. One of the earlier speakers made this point. It is an incredible claim. The Government argues that it is critical that the Australian Defence Force goes through this restructuring program to make room within existing resources for the additional requirements in the capital equipment program. We reject that proposition totally. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government, I suggest, is making ordinary servicemen pay the price for past laxity in the Defence Department's management of its own budget, and the Government is guilty of failing to meet its commitment on the level of defence spending. Moreover, the effect of these changes will be to weaken Australia's combat capability in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA>  The decision to cut the numbers of regular battalions from six to four is a dangerous mistake. The honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) commented on this. Whilst I acknowledge the successful use in some countries overseas of ready reserves, I have to say that the concept as it is being applied here is ill considered and fundamentally flawed because, regardless of training levels, due to the political, legal and logistical constraints on their ability to mobilise, part time soldiers in this country cannot be expected to serve as an immediate front line substitute for regular troops. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also ask the Minister what account the Government has taken of the dramatic changes of the past two years in the global security environment. The end of the Cold War has seen most of the standard assumptions about the world military balance totally revised. The role of the United States is changing by the week. It changed as recently as last week. The very recent historic events in Russia demand at the very least that we now review our strategic position. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the Asia-Pacific area there has been a significant build-up, incorporating many high tech weapons, by many of our neighbours. The vital issue is whether there is a need to depart from the force structure and equipment needs which were outlined in the 1987 White Paper. If there is a need, then a new strategic assessment should be released and should be publicly debated. </PARA>
<PARA>  As strategic circumstances continue to change dramatically, it is the Defence Force configuration that the Government is now implementing that will have to meet any threat to Australia's security, because the process cannot be reversed once it has been started. The process of `civilianisation' is only just beginning. It could be that the military's worst fears of what it will mean to place greater reliance on the broader community will prove unfounded, but both the Government and the defence chiefs have to make the case that, whatever the financial considerations, this program will not detract from Australia's ability to protect its sovereignty. That is the bottom line--protecting Australia's sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA>  I freely concede that there are, of course, aspects of the review with which the Opposition has no quarrel, such as civilianisation or contracting out in some areas, rationalising of the base arrangements, some aspects of changes to the defence industry and defence export policy, the reintroduction of Chinook helicopters, and mobilisation planning. But in essence this plan means the blunting of the Army's sharp end and the reduction of RAAF operations. Furthermore, it does not address the overstaffing, the inefficiencies and the inadequate management practices in the civilian defence bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the subject of redundancies of service personnel, let me counsel the Government as one who, during a 24-year service career, witnessed just such an exercise on more than one occasion elsewhere. One must beware of the damage one does to the fabric of one's most critical asset--one's people. Quite apart from all the equipment, quite apart from the technology or anything else, if the morale goes then one is lost. It is the morale that is being damaged at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will conclude by simply saying that the coalition believes that the review will do nothing to enhance this country's security and, if implemented, will dangerously weaken the combat capability of the defence forces. The review is clearly Budget driven and, because of the mismanagement of the Government, major cuts are being forced on the ADF without regard to our strategic defence needs. The defence of Australia has been put in jeopardy by this Government. It should review the direction of its proposals. I can only pray that if it does not, the nation does not come to rue this day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I want to begin my contribution to this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) by reiterating one comment that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) made in relation to the Ready Reserve. Irrespective of what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had to say in this place this afternoon in all the rhetoric that was generated by him, let there be no doubt that the Ready Reserve concept is a public relations con job. I cannot see how the operational capability of the Defence Force cannot be adversely affected as the result of that Ready Reserve concept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In the very short time available to me this evening I would like to concentrate on one other issue--a potential defence scandal. That scandal involves an aeroplane, and that aeroplane is the Australian Defence Force Nomad. I quote from a letter to the editor in the Northern Territory News a couple of days ago, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The NT News recently gave coverage on the Tenterfield air disaster involving an army Nomad and the loss of four lives. </PARA>
<PARA>Seventeen months before this, another pilot, Flying Officer Glenn Donovan, was killed when his RAAF Nomad crashed in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA>The RAAF report concluded this was the result of an aircraft malfunction. </PARA>
<PARA>I inform the House that that aircraft malfunction was simply that the tail fell off. The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In Tindal last week another Nomad malfunction caused a near-fatal incident for two RAAF pilots. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a modification developed for the Nomad aircraft to rectify one of the structural problems of the aircraft's tailplane. </PARA>
<PARA>A question I would like answered is why was this modification done to seven Nomads sold to the United States Coast Guard to make their planes safe but the same modification not done to Nomads in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA>We now have five people dead and Tindal's near-disastrous event made it a possible seven dead. </PARA>
<PARA>How many more dead pilots and passengers before something is done?</PARA>
<PARA>The letter is signed by David Silva, who happens to be the brother-in-law of the deceased RAAF pilot. Really, the Nomad aircraft has been a series of physical and financial disasters since it first flew in October 1974. For example, there was a crash in Sabah in 1976; the Australian test pilot of the lengthened version, the N24, was killed in a crash in Australia in 1976; and there was an Indonesian crash in 1979, the details and circumstances of which were never very clearly explained. </PARA>
<PARA>  I now bring the House closer to recent events. Last March, as I said earlier, an RAAF Nomad crashed near Adelaide killing the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Donovan, whose wife happens to be one of my constituents. As a result of that crash I took up the matter with the Ministers concerned. I have to say that the responses from the two Ministers were clearly very unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA>  I quote in brief from what the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), representing the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), said on 7 November of last year in reply to my question on notice of 20 September last year:</PARA>
<PARA>Recent advice from the Coroner indicates that the Coronial Inquiry into the death of Flight Lieutenant Donovan will be held in February 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>That coronial inquiry has never been held, and I am informed as late as this afternoon, only a couple of hours ago, that decisions have been taken in Adelaide so that in fact that coronial inquiry will not take place. I have to ask why the coroner in South Australia could decide 18 months after that crash, on the basis of the facts that he had before him at the time, that a coronial inquiry should not take place. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel went on to say in this reply to me:</PARA>
<PARA>The Board of Inquiry found that there were some deficiencies in the performance of personnel involved in the maintenance of the aircraft and in the engineering management of the introduction of the aircraft into service. However, the nature of the deficiencies, coupled with mitigating circumstances, led the Board--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the board of inquiry--</PARA>
<PARA>to conclude that those deficiencies did not amount to negligence. The convening authority and the Chief of the Air Staff have concurred with that judgement and have accepted the Board's recommendation that disciplinary action was not justified. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>There were some servicing deficiencies; however, these were not related to the causal factors involved in the failure of the tailplane structure. </PARA>
<PARA>In my view that is a lot of ministerial gobbledegook. In fact, it was reiterated in a reply of 22 January of this year to a further question upon notice that I placed. The Minister then said:</PARA>
<PARA>During the conduct of the Inquiry some servicing deficiencies were discovered and in the statement by the Board the observation was made that if an acceptance servicing or a S17 anti-corrosion servicing had been carried out the cracks would likely have been found, hence the accident avoided. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It should be understood that these servicings were only indirect opportunities. The tailplane could have failed just as easily during one of the last ASTA flights. </PARA>
<PARA>ASTA, of course, is Aerospace Technologies of Australia, which originally owned the aircraft. The Minister finished his reply to that question by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The circumstances surrounding the crash of Nomad A18-401 has been extensively examined both by the Board of Inquiry and the review process. There is no requirement for a re-examination of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to both Ministers, in the light of what happened in Tenterfield last month, that the results of that board of inquiry into the circumstances giving rise to that crash are still awaited, as are those relating to a very serious incident which occurred at RAAF Tindal only two or three weeks ago, which once again places very serious question marks over the longitudinal stability of that particular aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA>  These aircraft are now grounded, in my view rightly, and should remain grounded. However, I have to ask a couple of basic questions. I go back to the replies to the questions on notice the Minister gave me. It seems to me, from my reading of these two documents--the board of inquiry report and the supplementary engineering report--that there is culpability on the part of the Government Aircraft Factory cum ASTA, the Department of Defence and, in particular, some people within the Department of Defence. I have to ask the question: to what extent is there some sort of cover-up going on in relation to that particular aircraft?</PARA>
<PARA>  I finish my contribution to this debate by asking the Ministers a number of questions. Can the Ministers confirm that all Australian Defence Force Nomad aircraft are grounded after the two fatal crashes and one recent serious in-flight incident? Can the Ministers assure this House that those aircraft are safe and do not have a design fault which raises questions about their in-flight stability? Furthermore, do the two fatal crashes--one near Adelaide last year and one near Tenterfield last month--and the incident near RAAF Tindal last month have a common link? What investigations are in train in the Department of Defence and with Aerospace Technologies of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA>  Does the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, in particular, stick with his reply of 22 January this year, which was in response to my question on notice, that `there is no requirement for a re-examination of this matter'? What can be done, as far as the Ministers are concerned, to make sure that the coronial inquest is held? Finally, what budgetary provision exists in the 1991-92 budgetary coverage to ensure that some of these modifications, particularly to the tail, are carried out? Senator Ray spoke informally to me on the night of the Tenterfield crash. I understand that a substantial amount of money is in the Budget. It is about time we did something else before somebody else is killed. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-(6.12 p.m.)--Before I start my contribution today, I should say that I notice that the tenor of these Estimates debates in the House of Representatives has changed enormously over the years. It is good to see the advisers in the box. They came in about half way through the second contribution during the Estimates debate and no doubt they have been assiduous in noting the remarks made by contributors to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I am disappointed to see that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) is not present in the chamber. I think it is a very unfortunate development that this Government has brought about; that is, that Ministers seem to take absolutely no interest in what members of parliament have to say about matters under their responsibility. We could hardly have a more urgent responsibility than the defence of the country and, particularly, the changes that have taken place in recent times due to the decision by the Government to initiate the Ready Reserve concept. We have a situation here where the Minister in this House who is responsible for this area simply has not bothered to turn up. It is a very poor reflection on the Minister and a very poor reflection on the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  Earlier, we heard the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). I have a modicum of respect for the honourable member for Fraser in that he should come into this House in a defence debate and take the leftish line that he did. The logical conclusion of his argument was that we should have no expenditure on defence whatsoever and that, if we did not have any expenditure on defence, obviously we would have a lot more money that we could dole out in various other ways. I find that people like this are very strong in this point of view when they do not feel under any danger themselves. It is a bit like the police. Everybody is very critical of the police until they need a policeman; and a lot of people are very critical of the defence forces and the expenditure in the defence forces until we are faced with a defence crisis, when people in the defence forces go out and risk their lives to keep the rest of us safe. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was sorry that the honourable member for Fraser, in fact, took the line that he did. Whilst there is no doubt that the strategic situation in the world has changed very dramatically in the last few years, I am not aware of any indication that the strategic situation which Australia finds itself in is in any way more benign--to quote him--than has been the case in the past. In fact, I believe that it is less benign. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my view, the very welcome developments that have taken place in the ending of the Cold War have brought about a situation where the risk of low level conflicts, which are no less deadly, is in fact heightened rather than lessened. I wonder how many people in this Parliament would have thought just a few years ago that we would be seeing the situation that we see today in Yugoslavia. There we have a very deadly conflict taking place. If we have a look at the entire area of central Europe and what used to be the Soviet Union, one could not say with any confidence at all that we will not be seeing some major civil conflicts as that push towards regional identities continues in its strength and form. </PARA>
<PARA>  To suggest that, because of the very welcome changes in the relationships between the superpowers--the ending of the Cold War and the very welcome decisions in relation to strategic nuclear weaponry by both the United States and by the Soviet Union--we are somehow now living in a safer world and that Australia can pay less attention to the requirements of its own defence really flies in the face of the evidence that we see around us. We have to look only at the capacity of the defence forces of a number of countries in our region of the world to realise that that benign view is simply not in accordance with the facts. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wanted to speak a bit more about the recent decision by the Government in relation to the Ready Reserve. I have found it quite interesting that in the past year or so the Government has known that a very detailed investigation of the Reserve structure is being undertaken by the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, yet it has made a series of decisions in relation to the Australian defence forces quite irrespective of the findings of that very detailed Joint Standing Committee review. The Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee will be meeting very shortly to finalise its report on the Reserve. I have no doubt it will be saying something very pertinent, as it does in all defence reports. </PARA>
<PARA>  How nice it is to see Minister Bilney in the chamber. It is good of him to grace us with his presence at this late stage of the debate. Let me come back to the fact that the Government has made these decisions in advance of the findings of the Joint Standing Committee which, I might say, has a reputation for fairness and detailed investigation of all the submissions coming to it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us get back to this Ready Reserve. It is, of course, the result of three distinct suggestions dealing with a Ready Reserve or a reserve militia which have been put forward in recent years. In response to a submission from the defence chiefs, the Government has now--if one can use the phrase--bitten the bullet and established the Ready Reserve. If one talks to very senior officers within the defence forces--the ones who are at the political end of the spectrum--one will find that there is support for this. They have to support it because, of course, they are very close to the Government and are senior advisers to the Government. But if one talks to the people away from the political end, if one talks to, for instance, the personnel in the defence establishments in my electorate of Warringah, one will find a very healthy contempt--that is not too strong a word--for the Ready Reserve concept. It is a contempt not for the concept of itself, but for the way it is being implemented and the way it is having a detrimental effect on other aspects of the defence structure. </PARA>
<PARA>  Other speakers in this debate have paid attention to the fact, of course, that we are to have a reduction of two battalions of regulars and the effect that this will have on our capability. So far during the debate, not many people have talked about the effect that this decision will have on the already existing reserves. If one has the chance to speak to people who are already reservists, one will find there are an enormous number of criticisms about training days, ammunition and the equipment that is available to them. They are simply being neglected, and have been neglected consistently. </PARA>
<PARA>  This most recent change by the Government will do nothing to assist those people who have joined and served well in the reserves of this country. I believe that some of the issues they have raised with me are major ones. Firstly, they doubt the effectiveness of the Ready Reserve. The Minister at the table does not know about its effectiveness--he has admitted it. He has these rushes of blood to the head when he comes out with very straightforward statements. He is quoted as saying that when it comes to the real thing it is possible it may not work. Does the Minister realise that he said that? Does he admit that he said that when it comes to the real thing it is possible it may not work? That is hardly a ringing endorsement of it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The people in my electorate say that it will weaken combat capability and that it throws into doubt our ability to meet the peacekeeping commitments, let alone a limited conflict in our sphere of interest. The Army believes that it will cost a great deal more than the Government claims. I think this is the real crux of it. This is defence on the cheap. On the Government's figures, bringing in the Ready Reserve will cost about 30 per cent of what it would cost to keep the regulars going. The Army says it will be 50 to 60 per cent or higher. </PARA>
<PARA>  So we are looking at a Government which has made commitments in the equipment area which are going to cost a great deal of money. The Government cannot afford to spend the required amount of money on the personnel side of things. So what do we do? We go for the cheap option. I believe very strongly that this Government knows it will not work, but it hopes it will get away with it for two or three years before it needs spend more money in the personnel area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am glad to be here to close this debate. Perhaps I should begin by responding to the points which have been put by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), who seemed to think that the marvels of modern technology would not allow me to follow what was happening in this debate. In fact, I have been listening to it in my office while doing three other things of equally vital importance, but I certainly was following the points that were being made in the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In general, I have been disappointed with the contributions of Opposition members. They appear to believe that the debate has not moved on from the days in which they conducted our defence policy, when the seriousness of our commitment to the defence of Australia was measured entirely by the amount of money that was spent and the numbers of people in uniform, as if the only area of modern endeavour that should not be subject to efficiency gains, that should be immune to those gains--gains which are a result of better management, higher technology, or a combination of those things and others--is defence. That is rubbish. It is a proposition to which the Government has given the lie not only in this Bill but also in others. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition has proceeded to debate this Bill as if the quantum of money has been reduced. It has not. The quantum of money has been maintained in real terms in this Budget and, in fact, has been increased as a proportion of GNP. It is astonishing to me that members of this Parliament who followed the Gulf war should have assumed that that was financed out of existing allocations. It was not; it was supplemented, as every member of this House knows, by an additional allocation of funds of the order of $100m. The Opposition seems to say that all we are spending on our defence and our peacekeeping is what is in these estimates. That is rubbish and nonsense. It astonishes me that people could have so limited an understanding of defence that they would fall for that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a number of matters to which I would like to respond. It seems to me that most of the criticism in the debate has related to Opposition claims that the Ready Reserve concept is somehow flawed, is somehow doing our defence on the cheap, and is somehow not what I believe it to be--an exciting, innovative and successful response to the defence problems which Australia faces. Let me run through some criticisms which have been made by the Opposition--including in this debate--about the Ready Reserve. I was very sad to hear my colleague opposite say that it was looked at with contempt by members of the military. I do not believe that is the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-`Contempt' was the word that was used. It is not a word that I believe ought to be applied to this concept. Let us look at the claims that have been made by the Opposition about the Ready Reserve. The Opposition has said that the Ready Reserve has not been properly costed, that Labor has no idea about how much it is going to cost. In fact, we have costed the Ready Reserve as precisely as we can. Working with the most complete knowledge of the scheme, the force structure review estimated the annual direct personnel cost to be around 42 per cent of the cost of regulars. That can be looked at as we go along, but it is pretty clear that people who serve on a part time basis--highly trained soldiers as they are--will cost less than regulars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As for the claim that the conventional reserves will suffer, the Government has set aside $50m for equipping the Ready Reserve as well as $100m over the decade for operating costs and the upgrading of the conventional reserves. The Opposition has claimed that the key defence problem is the defence bureaucracy, and that it needs to be cut. In fact, we have cut not combat ready soldiers but the support elements. We are replacing two understrength, underequipped Regular battalions with three highly trained Ready Reserve battalions and, in the process, are getting rid of 3,800 service civilians, a reduction which adds to the 10,000-odd decrease in service civilians which has taken place in the time this Government has been in office. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has been claimed that the Ready Reserve, which will serve only 50 days a year, will be as capable a force as professional Army regulars. These are professional soldiers who will have had one year's full time training. They will be the cream of the crop. As I said at Question Time, it has been most encouraging to the Government that people have flocked to join the Ready Reserve. In three days we have had 3,500-odd inquiries. We are looking to recruit 1,100 people this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-They have inquired and a number of them have applied. I have expressed two doubts in relation to our surveys of employers and potential members about whether people who had inquired would turn up to join. I said that a survey is a survey. As Mrs Haines found out in the last election, it is sometimes different when it comes to the real thing. People in this place are accustomed to saying that there is only one poll that counts--that is the one on the day. On the day, people are turning up to join the Ready Reserve. I know that the honourable member for Warringah is a betting man, and I would love to have a bet with him that we will get the numbers we need in a short space of time.  The Opposition has claimed that four Regular Army battalions are not enough--as if to suggest that the four regular battalions will operate in isolation from the seven conventional reserve battalions or the three Ready Reserve battalions. We are talking about a total force concept, a better way of managing our defence, and it is ridiculous to suggest otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I think the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) claimed that the Air Force and Navy ready reserves concept would not work. Is he saying that airfield defence guards are not necessary?  They are necessary, and ready reservists will be used in this area. They will be employed in a useful capacity as will the similar number, the 450 people, who will be used to supplement our forces in the Royal Australian Navy. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is claimed that it is not clear whether the necessary numbers of ready reservists will be obtained. As I have said already, the lie has been given to that by the number of people who have so far applied. I believe that more will come in. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) referred at some length to the problems with the Nomad aircraft. Certainly the concern that he expressed is shared. The fact is that the Nomad has been in service with the ADF for around 16 years. There are 15 in service now and 10 will be acquired shortly. The additional 10 are being refurbished by ASTA under a $11m contract which was let on 25 March this year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The accident rate of the Nomad--and in saying this, I do not in any way mean to suggest that we are complacent about the accident rate--of four in the 48,500 hours which have been flown by this military aircraft is quite consistent with the Army aircraft accident rate of nine per 100,000 hours for all types of aircraft over the past 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some further tests are going to be carried out and a full review of Nomad airworthiness by the airworthiness board is planned for later this month. We will be awaiting that airworthiness report before taking any action. When that is available to us, we will consider what needs to be done. While echoing the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Groom as regards the loss of life, I do not agree that we are faced with what I think he described as a scandal. </PARA>
<PARA>  One aspect which has been raised in this debate and which is sometimes referred to outside this place is the view that the Government has not kept certain promises about the level of expenditure that it made in the 1987 defence of Australia White Paper. The fact is that since then the GDP of this country has expanded considerably and the amount that was then said to be necessary for our defence has been spent. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), in what I thought was a very thoughtful contribution--I am sorry if I betray the fact that I listened across the table to what he said--asked whether the force structure proposal was simply a matter of cost cutting rather than a fundamental restructuring of the ADF. The capital programs which we have in mind--and they are considerable--can be funded, as was shown by events in the Gulf, with zero per cent real growth. </PARA>

One could also add the best superannuation scheme in Australia that this Government has brought down. A better housing scheme has also contributed to the greater retention of people in the ADF. It is no wonder that people are flocking to join the ADF and are staying in it.</PARA></TALK.START>

He referred to the ability that we have, not just to defend Australia but to contribute to the wider security of the Western Alliance and those countries with which we are friendly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Committee is considering some very important appropriations. I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that included in these appropriations is $45.9m for the BMR, $14.3m for ABARE and $167m for AQIS. In a few minutes, my colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) when speaking on the appropriations will discuss various aspects of that in more detail, as will the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd). I merely signal that the AQIS figure is of great concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It was affirmed in February of this year that AQIS had no fewer than 60 meat inspectors in towns and cities across Australia where there were no longer operating abattoirs. That circumstance, in particular, is adding greatly to the cost burden of the red meat industry and is only slowly being addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the time available I want to say to the House, and through the broadcast tonight beyond the House, that it is my very real concern that the drought is gripping much of Australia. It is an almost lethal climatic cocktail gripping much of Australia. There is drought in Queensland and northern New South Wales, with very mixed seasons elsewhere. Ironically, in southern parts of Victoria it is the other end of the spectrum--extreme wet and severe flooding in places and damage caused by that flooding. I must admit that a much smaller part of Australia is affected by the wet than the areas affected by the dry period. There are no magical answers to that circumstance. I think it will be recorded in the history of Australia that this century Australia has faced four crises which it had to deal with: World War I, the Great Depression, World War II and the great recession and drought of the early 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are aspects which can be addressed by the Federal Government. To some extent, steps are being taken by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and by Cabinet when they are not distracted with the current Medicare crisis and the undermining of the Budget produced by the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), which is now before the House and which may be changed between now and midnight and again tomorrow morning. </PARA>
<PARA>  The drought has come at a time of extremely low commodity prices, thus adding further to the burden of the situation--international commodity prices; the subsidisation by Europe, in particular; common agriculture policy; the export enhancement program pursued by the United States and the fact that the EEP is, to some extent, almost part of the furniture. To most of my farmers it appears to be part of the furniture rather than the tactical weapon it was designed to be against the Europeans. </PARA>
<PARA>  These are clearly issues that we will want to canvass further with the US Administration, our friends in the US embassy here tomorrow night and elsewhere and also during the forthcoming visit by President Bush. So international, climatic and Canberra factors have added to the burden of the situation. The Canberra factors might properly include the fact that interest rates were rafted up so high in 1988, especially 1989. As a consequence, they were kept far too high for too long because the former Treasurer, Mr Keating, and the bureaucrats of the Treasury did not realise the extent of damage they were causing to many small business operators, farmers and industry generally.</PARA>
<PARA>  Farmers have reached the stage where they are facing a net farm cash income fall of some 24 per cent in 1991-92. That comes on top of the sharp decline of 36 per cent in 1990-91. For last financial year and this financial year net farm cash income has fallen by some 60 per cent. I concede there are several reasons for that, such as climatic factors and international factors but also Canberra factors. Indeed, it is the Canberra factors which the Government should address and make more effort to address. One of the problems related to the circumstances in which farmers find themselves is that of the 17 inner Cabinet members not one comes from a country electorate or rural based electorate. The nearest one is the Treasurer (Mr Kerin),  who is on the edge on Sydney at Campbelltown. As the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) points out, there is not one member of the inner Cabinet from Queensland. It is a shocking indictment of the Queensland Caucus element that that is so. </PARA>
<PARA>  What did the Government do? It came up with this great solution of appointing a Minister from Perth, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), to be the notional representative of Queensland in Cabinet. The shocking legacy of this circumstance is that not even the inner Cabinet realised the extent of the drought, because there was no-one in the inner Cabinet from Queensland, where the drought has hit hardest. There is no farmer or even country member in the inner Cabinet. That has added to the burden of the situation, and my comments will be backed up by those to be made by my deputy leader, the honourable member for Murray, (Mr Lloyd) and other members of both the Liberal and National parties during this debate. I say to the House in another sense that if there was some magic solution, we would afford the Government our support in a bipartisan way. Certainly, there has been a great deal of bipartisan work done on the rural adjustment scheme and we have been looking at parts A, B and C. We are now looking at a part D to that scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even as we speak tonight, notwithstanding the official reductions in interest rates in the last 12 months, interest rates are still in real terms twice the level of interest rates in the United States. In Australia in real terms interest rates are 6 to 7 per cent; in the United States in real terms they are 1 to 3 per cent. That means two things: there is still a distortion of the value of the Australian dollar, making it very difficult for export industries, and there is still the added burden of interest rates on those viable farmers who are still meeting their commitments. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government can and should take further action in respect of the drought. As the first step it should appoint a Federal Cabinet task force led by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the notional Queensland representative in Cabinet, the Minister for Transport and Communications, to lift the profile of this problem and to bring more direct action at the highest level in Cabinet to bear in addressing the drought and the policy ramifications arising from the drought. The second step should be to look as a matter of urgency at the continuing impact of sales tax on the farm sector. Every time the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy comes in he trips over the exemptions factor associated with the farm circumstance and keeps on producing other booklets in relation to it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I say, very sadly, that semitrailers, road trains and the like are being used to shift stock to agistment or to shift fodder to stock on the Darling Downs and elsewhere. That fodder is being hit by a 20 per cent sales tax. The fuel tax level is a crippling burden on the operators of those transports carrying out those rescue missions, and of course there is a sales tax on the tyres and spare parts, which adds to the whole burden of the sales tax saga. That tax on transport freight and transport equipment amounts to well over $3,000m this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is scope for this Government to take action in relation to the drought in a sensible and sensitive way. I realise that the Government cannot will the drought away, but I warn that this time around there is going to be a very slow recovery from the drought, no matter when the rains arrive. And let us hope they arrive soon. I welcome the fact that in the vicinity of Mount Warning, which I climbed with Senator Brownhill last week, there has now been some rain in the last few days. Of course, we need a lot more rain, and even huge rainfalls in the next week are not going to reverse the financial circumstances of so many farmers and small business operators. People in capital cities are also at the receiving end of the impact of this drought that we did not have to have, as with the recession that we certainly did not have to have. </PARA>
<PARA>  So I look to my colleagues to continue to raise significant issues relating to the drought and the rural recession--the fourth great crisis of this century which has the capacity to do so much permanent damage to the agricultural infrastructure of Australia. </PARA>

In my electorate, input costs have gone up dramatically as farmers with irrigation have striven to keep their crops alive. They have even had to strive to keep sugar cane ratoons alive, which is incredible at this time of the year, given that some of the crop was harvested only a few months ago and some of it is being harvested now and given, of course, the effect and impact this is having on the horticultural industry in Bundaberg, the biggest area in Australia for horticulture.</PARA></TALK.START>

The 1991 Federal Budget contained a wide range of social and economic measures to assist farmers suffering financial hardship, including increased funding under the rural adjustment scheme and the rural counselling program, which does an outstanding job under very tough circumstances. In addition, farmers will benefit from revised eligibility rates to the family allowance and family allowance supplement payments. Parts A, B and C of RAS are the Government's main instrument for providing broad-based structural adjustment and income assistance to farmers in financial difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The decision to phase down tariffs on general agricultural products was consistent with the Government's process of restructuring the economy to improve the productivity and efficiency of Australian industry. The prospects for a successful Uruguay Round outcome hinge on attaining agreement on agriculture. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), who is in the chamber, knows as well as I do that the EC is the key in this matter. The talks stalled at the Brussels ministerial meeting last December as the community was unwilling to enter serious negotiations. The Cairns Group has been effective in ensuring that agriculture remains at the top of the agenda. Without reform in agriculture, there will be no successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Murray and I have just returned from a bipartisan mission to Europe, and it was pleasing to see politicians from all parties putting Australia first. The problems we face with trade are above politics. I think that this mission did have an impact and sent home to the Europeans the message that we are participants in a trade war--not one that we have brought on but, nevertheless, one that is impacting on our nation and on our farmers. </PARA>
<PARA>  Indeed, I was amazed when I was in Paris to see 150,000 farmers protesting in the streets about the commodity prices they are getting. They are getting four times the price for sugar and many more times the price for beef and grains that our farmers are getting. I indicated to the Europeans that if our farmers were getting the same price they would also be in the streets, but drinking champagne and celebrating. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for Murray. We keep saying that because it is true. In fact, Australian farmers this year will average 9,600 French francs per farm. When we indicated this to the French, the interpreter asked three times whether we had the correct amount, because nobody could believe that such a low income was going to be returned to farmers. Of course, many farmers in Australia will not have a net income this year, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) indicated in answer to a question in the House today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is vital that Australia takes every opportunity to convey to the European Community the effect of the crippling burden being suffered by Australia's efficient farm producers as a direct result of European export subsidies. Industry downturn, such as that which we are now experiencing, must not be cushioned by general subsidies or support for all of those in the industries affected, because it will only add to and exacerbate the problem in the long term. However, we do need to ensure that we target those farmers most affected and, as I have said, we have been doing just this through the rural adjustment scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have also faced a difficulty in the sugar industry, an industry close to my heart. While I was overseas, I was very disappointed to discover in the course of trying to talk some sense into the European governments that the United States had decided to cut sugar imports by a third in 1991-92. This will mean that Queensland canegrowers, who produce all of Australia's sugar exports, stand to lose millions of dollars in export revenue at a time when they are facing a reduced harvest due to severe drought and a current depressed world price for sugar of around US9c a pound. I stress that this is at a time when European farmers and American farmers are getting about US33c a pound. </PARA>
<PARA>  The new global access level of 1.385 million tonnes represents a reduction of approximately 34 per cent over the 2.098 million tonne access level for 1990-91. This means that Australia's share of the market will decrease from 168,000 tonnes in 1990-91 to 109,671 tonnes in 1991-92. What disappoints me most of all is that there is no way that the United States Government can say that this is part of its retaliation to the EC program of the Europeans. Neither that nor the cuts in our beef have anything whatsoever to do with that. </PARA>
<PARA>  Reluctantly, I have today written a letter to the United States Ambassador setting out my disappointment. It is a very sad state of affairs when I, who have supported and will continue to support the United States, have to write to the United States Ambassador, as the representative of his government here in Australia, to point out my disappointment for what I believe to be shabby treatment of Australian farmers at a time when they can least afford it; at a time when Australia, as part of the Cairns Group, is trying to get some liberalisation into the trade in order to get a better world. With the distortions in trade, we will never have a level playing field or a steady climate for world environment. I am very disappointed with the United States Government for having done that. I hope that the United States President, when he does come to Australia, does not just offer platitudes, that he does not expect us to be first rate friends when it suits and third rate friends when it comes to trade. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our wheat farmers are suffering a dear price because of the export enhancement program. Although it is interesting that the Europeans blame the United States and the United States blames the Europeans, we are not to blame. I stress that we are not to blame. I am sick and tired of seeing our farmers being affected by two giants hiding behind agrarian socialism and at the same time preaching a level playing field in technology, manufacturing and everything else. These are the communities that led a renaissance in Europe a couple of hundred years ago. The United States has been a protector of freedom, yet both of them are hiding behind the walls of protection. The best way to cure the problem would probably be to send Dr Christiaan Barnard to Europe and the United States to visit some of the politicians, since they are lacking a little bit of heart and a little bit of political courage. I am disappointed that Australian farmers are suffering as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other point I make is that, given this challenge, the Queensland sugar industry needs to look to the alternatives and opportunities it has. I believe we need to look to further deregulate the sugar industry in Queensland. I do not mean to throw the baby out with the bath water. I do not mean total wholesale deregulation. But I do believe that there need to be more commercial opportunities for our large refiners, CSR and now Tate and Lyle, to take up the opportunity to refine white  sugar  here  in  Australia  for  export markets. </PARA>
<PARA>  Only earlier this year, we knocked back an opportunity to export white sugar to the Philippines because there was no capacity there to refine. I have written to the State Minister for Primary Industries for his urgent consideration of this measure, because at a time when farmers are suffering from drought and commodity prices we need to make every post a winner and to take every opportunity to capitalise on an existing demand for white sugar. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend Appropriation Bill (No. 1) in relation to agriculture. The challenges we face over the next few years are going to be the toughest challenges Australian agriculture has ever faced. We will come through them, but there are going to be casualties, regardless of how many prayers we say and regardless of what happens in Europe before Christmas. My heart goes out to those farmers who will not make it.(Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Both the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) have raised the problem of the devastation of the drought over much of Queensland and northern New South Wales. It comes on top of the export subsidy war between the United States and Europe. The additional export subsidies of Europe plus our high input prices and high interest rates mean that an even higher percentage of the world's most efficient farmers are not going to make it. Those points have been made and I will be making them again in other speeches in Parliament over the next few days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  What I want to concentrate on now is the estimates for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy itself. It is rather amazing that a Department that is so good at giving advice to the farmers of Australia on how they have to be more efficient is itself not efficient. For example, while farmers have been cutting back, the DPIE has been expanding. In 1988-89, the cost of the Department was $80.5m. In the next year, 1989-90, it was $91.6m, a 13.7 per cent increase. In 1990-91 it was $103.2m, a 17.9 per cent increase. In 1991-92 it is $109.5m, a 6.2 per cent increase. The increases are well above inflation for each of those years. That means an increase of about 35 per cent since 1988-89. In that time, of course, farmers' incomes dropped dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA>  I acknowledge that one of the additional costs has been the sustainable development process. I think that was about $9m for the Department. All one can say about that is that it was a very costly exercise which has resulted in many more trees having to be cut down to make paper for reams and reams of reports which seem to be of no real value to this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget prediction for next year is also not good. While the figure is set to drop by $1.5m to $108m, it has to be remembered that the major part of the Australian Fisheries Service, which is now costing more than $30m to administer, is transferring from the Department to a self-financed management authority which will be financed by fishermen themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are three particular areas of administration that I want to concentrate upon in the few minutes available to me. The first is the Australian Fisheries Service, which has been administered by the Department for many years. I acknowledge, fisheries are very difficult to manage because no-one really knows all the time what the resource is. But if one looks at the record, one sees that the total allowable catch for southern bluefin tuna was reduced from 1,800 tonnes last year to 800 tonnes this year. Orange roughy was restricted to 10,700 tonnes for the eastern zone, and 12,000 tonnes for the southern zone. It is intended to bring the amount down to 2,700 tonnes for each zone. The total allowable catch for eastern gemfish two years ago was 3,000 tonnes. Last year it was 1,800 tonnes and this year only 420 tonnes. The northern prawn fishery is working its way through a buy-back to halve the size of that fishery. Then there are other restrictions in areas such as blue eye and southern shark. That is not good management by a Department for a very important resource for this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  On top of that, some of the AFS staff have been working to rules. It means that the dismal record of administration is even more dismal at the present time. That will change when the management authority starts next year. But the question I ask, and sincerely ask, is this: what disciplinary action has been taken against those staff people in the Department who have refused to do their work properly?</PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, I refer to consultants. The Department spent $8.2m on consultants last financial year. An amount of $108,658 went to TASA International to assist the wool industry selection committee. Why bother to have a wool selection committee if a consultant is required to do that job to such a degree? About $1m was spent on various fishery reports. I have already indicated the value of the administration there. An amount of $179,000 was spent on various studies for the south-east forests of New South Wales. An amount of $238,000 was spent on various studies looking at plantations. I believe there is plenty of literature by State departments on that subject. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It would be interesting to see whether these have added to the greater knowledge of the situation, or perhaps created a jungle. An amount of $43,718 went to John Walker and Associates for professional services for gathering, writing and clearing copy for the AQIS bulletin. I acknowledge that that has been a worthwhile publication, but that cost, together with $19,000 to another company to prepare a public relations strategy for AQIS, raises this question: what work are AQIS and DPI public relations officers and press people actually doing?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I refer to AQIS itself. I want to give some figures and I want to ask what is the state of play in AQIS at the present time. As of a few months ago, there were 1,654 meat inspectors, of whom 1,249 are actually engaged in inspection services at a particular time. That means there are always 405 inspectors, or 25 per cent, not engaged in inspection. Of this number, 87 inspectors are deemed to be surplus to requirements. It is estimated that a further 155 will become surplus within the next two years. On top of that, there are 162 inspectors to provide relief for those on holidays, sick leave, et cetera. To cover the cost of these inspectors who do not earn a direct recovery from the industry, a figure of $14,200 is loaded to every working inspector. </PARA>
<PARA>   I would also like the latest state of play on a second piece of information--that there were 63 inspectors stationed in towns which no longer had abattoirs. It has taken a while to come out, but in the Senate Estimates we were told that 45 of those refused transfers to somewhere where there was work; there were 18 in New South Wales and 27 in Victoria. Why were they still put on the payroll when they refused to be transferred? Despite the Department earlier admitting that it had surplus inspectors and that some inspectors were accepting redundancy packages, while others were refusing transfers, AQIS has recruited an additional 14 inspectors in the last 12 months. That is on top of those who are already considered to be surplus. </PARA>
<PARA>  On checking out further information on the 63 inspectors, we were told that the travelling allowance for these inspectors amounted to $811,621 in 1989-90 because they had to travel further to any abattoir. For example, some Bendigo inspectors have told me personally that they have been to Geraldton in Western Australia. Yet, in the Senate, we were told that Bendigo inspectors only did jobs locally because there are a lot of local service abattoirs. Somebody is not telling all of the story. </PARA>
<PARA>  We want to know what is the situation with those inspectors now? On figures also provided by the Department, they were working about half time. When we have a 100 per cent cost recovery on farmers who have no say in how that money is spent, and at a time of reducing prices, it is obviously and simply not good enough. I sincerely ask to be advised of the actual number of AQIS inspectors at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, the fishing industry, where some progress has been made, I believe, was told it would get significant reductions because there would no longer be on-line inspectors and there would be flexibility. That has not occurred, because the number of people at the regional and head office level has not been reduced in any way. </PARA>
<PARA>  Is this particular problem of AQIS being overcome? It is one thing for me and others to knock the actual meat inspectors but, after all, they--or the majority of them--are working. They are being paid about $34,000, but they are being charged out at $68,000, and unless the dead weight in the regional office and head office is reduced, nothing is really being achieved. So I would certainly like to know what the position is with that, and also with the Australian Fisheries Service and whether, in spite of this increasing Budget, we are going to be burdened with more consultants this year. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6T4">Mr ELLIOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It does affect the Parramatta River, as the Parliamentary Secretary suggests. In particular, I am concerned to deal with the major problem we have in parts of western Sydney relating to urban flooding. Probably one of the notable things about Australia is that we have times when we are ravaged by terrible floods and other times when we suffer the great distress that drought causes through much of the country. Our climatic conditions inevitably create pressures for people in both urban and rural parts of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In the Budget this year, the Government has recognised the particular problems we have with urban flooding in large metropolitan areas such as western Sydney, making major allocations to deal with those problems. It is very pleasing to note that, in the total allocation for the Federal water resources assistance program this year, which nationally is worth $26 1/2m, something of the order of $5.69m is being allocated to flood plain management projects within New South Wales. A significant portion of that is going to deal with the substantial problems of urban flooding that exist in areas such as the Parramatta electorate that I represent. </PARA>
<PARA>  This assistance is notable for a number of reasons. It helps to accelerate the process of making flood free the homes of the people who live in areas such as Parramatta, Toongabbie and so forth. That has been a constant demand from people who live in those regions, in large part because of the very substantial concerns they have had with flooding in recent times. I will not go through each of the floods that have had devastating effects on families in western Sydney. Suffice to say that there have been at least two occasions in the last five years when over 400 homes have been flooded, and that is a problem which I think most people would see as a very major national concern. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a result of those concerns, the people from the region have been pressing State and Federal governments to provide more funding to help to overcome the flooding and urban drainage problems that we have. Many of those problems, of course, are due to poor planning decisions in the past. Nevertheless, they are practical problems that governments, including local government, have to face these days. </PARA>
<PARA>  With that in mind, earlier this year the flood mitigation authorities of New South Wales met with the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the present Treasurer (Mr Kerin), to press the case for more funding to deal with these urban flooding problems. It was with that in mind that the Minister made a detailed inspection of western Sydney flood problems late last year. So, in the process leading up to the Budget, I and my Labor colleagues from western Sydney very firmly put the case on behalf of the people of that area that more had to be done by the Federal Government. We knew that in doing so we had the very strong support of the community in western Sydney, and we also knew that the local government bodies throughout the region were very supportive of any additional initiatives that could be taken in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA>  We had thought that we were operating with the support of the New South Wales Government, which had made a lot of noises in the past about inadequate Federal funding to deal with local flood mitigation. So, back in June, the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) was able to announce a supplementary allocation for flood mitigation works in our region. We welcomed that. The problem was that at that time the State Government refused to match the supplementary funding that the Commonwealth had provided, so that opportunity was largely lost. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this year's Budget the Government decided, as well as providing the normal assistance under the appropriation for the water resources assistance scheme, to proceed with a new initiative, the western Sydney drainage initiative. The Cabinet took the decision, as part of this year's Budget process, to allocate an additional $1m to this program, designed specifically to deal with urban drainage needs in western Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA>  The program was instituted to find ways of more innovatively dealing with the problems of drainage to ensure that the local problems that the Minister and many of the people in western Sydney know exist could be adequately addressed by all levels of government. The scheme was adopted on the basis that there would be contributions in the ratio of $1 from the Commonwealth, $1 from the State and $1 from local government. So the decision was taken to include that extra $1m in this year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reaction to that scheme from the community at large has been very positive and very encouraging. They have welcomed it. The reaction was similar from local government. I have a couple of letters, which I will not have time to read out, from local councils in the affected areas that indicate their very strong support for this new initiative. They have welcomed the fact that at last there has been a positive recognition by the national Government of the need to overcome our particular flood mitigation needs in western Sydney. Obviously the people in the community are anxious to accelerate any works that overcome those particular concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reaction from the State Government so far in relation to this initiative has been one of what we might term deathly silence. We have been endeavouring--Commonwealth officials, the local councils and the communities in those regions--to get a positive answer from the State Government saying that it would match the funding that we have provided in this year's Budget. To date, all of those efforts and all of the attempts by people in the community to get such a commitment from the State Government have been met, as I have said, with total silence. There has been no commitment; no demonstration of any commitment. When the State Budget was presented in September, there was no recognition in it at all that the State Government would do anything like match the funding that was provided with this new Commonwealth initiative in this year's Federal Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is simply not good enough. The Commonwealth Minister and the Commonwealth Government have taken proper steps to respond to the representations from the community at large in western Sydney, and from the members of parliament that represent that region, and we expect the State Government to honour the previous undertakings that it had always given that it would always match any Federal funding that was available for flood mitigation works in our region. It had suggested that it would be only too willing to match that funding at any time that the Commonwealth came to the party. Well, the Commonwealth has come to the party, as these appropriations we are dealing with tonight will attest. Yet we still cannot get cooperation from the Greiner Government. As the people of the region have been saying in recent weeks, that is simply unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some very significant works could be done with this funding, which, if we aggregate the funding from the three levels of government, amounts to $3m a year. The Commonwealth has given a commitment to maintain that funding for at least three years. I am confident that the $9m that could be allocated could do very substantial things to alleviate the flood problems in the area. Just to give an example of the sorts of works that are proposed, one of the particularly chronic problems that we have in western Sydney--(Quorum formed) (Time expired). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Whilst I am heartened by the large measure of bipartisan support for the appropriations before us this evening in Appropriation Bill (No. 1), let there be no doubt that the rural sector is in deep and deepening recession. For example, some grain growers have gone four years without harvesting a crop and, of course, the latest drought in south-east Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales has been particularly devastating because it has hit an industry already on its knees through a general commodity price downturn and some of the worst recessionary conditions since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Some of the comments made in Toowoomba last Friday at the first of a number of Australia-wide ABARE rural outlook conferences were, therefore, in no way surprising. I quote initially from the opening paper by Dr Michael Kirby of ABARE, who said in his concluding comments:</PARA>
<PARA>The market environment in which the rural sector will be operating during the first half of the 1990s is likely to possess two major characteristics. First, most major farm commodity prices will be low in real terms, resulting in historically very low levels of real farm income. In this regard, 1991-92 is likely to represent the trough but the recovery in subsequent years seems likely to be patchy and weak with real farm income remaining well below the levels recorded in the latter part of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Second, farmers are likely to respond by economising on their use of inputs wherever possible. New capital expenditure by farmers is likely to remain weak, particularly if real interest rates in Australia remain at historically high levels. For example, it is possible that there could be a repeat of the experience of the mid-1980s where new capital expenditure by farmers was insufficient to offset depreciation of the existing capital stock for several years. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) at that same conference gave what I regard as a very good speech indeed and said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>I feel confident that Australian agriculture will continue to shine, not only because we are the most efficient agricultural producers in the world but because we have shown a remarkable ability to adapt and to get on with the tasks at hand, despite hugely fluctuating climatic and economic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>He also went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I am acutely aware that many people in rural Australia are hurting. According to some estimates from my Department, almost half of farm families had taxable incomes, including off-farm incomes, of less than $10,000 in 1990/91. This will get worse. </PARA>
<PARA>Around 40 per cent of broadacre farmers will have negative farm incomes this financial year. Some say the drought, coming on top of the rural recession, could be shaping into a disaster as bad as the 1890s. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to add my support to that. In the area that I represent it is fast approaching that sort of proportion. Today's Brisbane Courier-Mail also adds a couple of other dimensions to the extent of the rural catastrophe that is clearly with us. First of all, an article reporting a Country Women's Association meeting in Chinchilla on the Darling Downs states:</PARA>
<PARA>The number of rural children at boarding schools would drop sharply next year as the rural recession caused further upheaval to families. . .</PARA>
<PARA>  A CWA south-western division spokeswoman. . . said many children would not return to city schools after Christmas and enrolments at the Charleville School of the Air were expected to increase by up to 50 percent. </PARA>
<PARA>  She said educating children at home would place further demands on women already struggling to save their properties. </PARA>
<PARA>Another delegate said that women in regional areas had almost no access to social services. She cited the case of one woman with two small children who was feeding her family boiled rice for a week and did not know what they would eat next. In another case, a husband could afford to give his wife only a card for her birthday and the family did not expect anything for Christmas. They have nowhere to turn, unless they sell their properties and leave their farms. This delegate concluded by saying that country people are proud and they cannot ask for help. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another article in today's Courier-Mail headlined `Farmers talk of suicide as rural crisis deepens' states:</PARA>
<PARA>The deepening rural crisis is driving an increasing number of farmers to contemplate suicide, a senior Lifeline executive, Rev Noel Park, said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>The Reverend Noel Park happens to be the director of Lifeline in Toowoomba. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>  ``We are getting a disturbing number of calls from people in absolute desperation. . . farmers who have been on the land for two and three generations who are unable to feed their families," he said. </PARA>
<PARA>  ``The calls we are getting match the number of reports from country police on attempted suicides. </PARA>
<PARA>My question therefore to the House is: where are the short and the longer term solutions? As far as the Minister is concerned--I hope that he is watching this on television and will come back to the table later on at the conclusion of this debate to sum up--I have to give credit to him where credit is due. First of all, I specifically give him credit for his speech at the ABARE conference last week. It was a well-reasoned speech, some of which not all of us on this side of the House would agree with. But also in recent weeks he has shown an inclination to listen to the rural sector, in particular to a group of vegetable farmers in my electorate. In an exchange of letters that I have had with him in recent weeks, again he has given me heart that he at least understands the problem. He may not have the solutions, but he understands the problem. If I could be critical, he seems to be placing too much emphasis on bureaucratic measures--I will come back to that in a moment--and he seems to make a great meal of the rural adjustment scheme in terms of both the scheme generally and particular provisions that may or may not emerge in relation to drought relief. </PARA>
<PARA>  In relation to the generally bureaucratic conditions, in the letters to me he talks about the rural adjustment scheme, the rural counselling program, the family allowance, the family allowance supplement, the business advisers for rural areas scheme, the rural industries business extension service and the innovative agricultural marketing program--all in themselves perhaps commendable initiatives but seemingly full of bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA>  In terms of the rural adjustment scheme he refers to an increase in this financial year, I think, from $64m to $160m but he also said in his speech at the ABARE conference that parts A and B of that $160m will be taken up in relation to part C of the scheme, which indicates that those under part C are the ones who supposedly will be leaving the rural sector. To my mind that raises a question as to the intent behind the rural adjustment scheme. Is it to keep people within the rural sector or to push them out of it? On the basis of the statistics that the Minister has provided, perhaps that is very questionable. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, I say that rhetoric simply is not enough when it comes to the solutions to the problems in the rural sector. Although we support some of the measures that have been taken and announced in the context of this Budget in relation to family allowance--the family allowance supplement, Austudy, the assistance for isolated children, et cetera--they are initiatives, but they are initiatives only as far as they go. We need real reform. That real reform is in the area of industrial relations, in transport, in tax, in privatisation and in real public expenditure cuts. I can only hope that, when it goes to Cabinet later this week, the Minister is able to get the necessary approvals for part D of the rural adjustment scheme in relation to the drought. </PARA>

This issue concerns the crisis presently confronting the Australian sugar industry. I have had a long interest in the sugar industry. I am from a canefarming family in the Tully district. My electorate is a key cane producing area. At present the Australian sugarcane growing industry is fighting for its very survival. The canegrowing season this year is the worst for at least 30 years, caused in the main by a combination of drought and other poor weather conditions. Bad weather is not the only adversary of sugarcane farmers. They have coped with drought, floods and cyclones since the industry was established in Queensland more than 100 years ago. Many canefarmers claim that a lot of the problems of the Australian sugarcane growing industry stem from government interference, particularly in the area of deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Just over a decade ago deregulation was made to sound a good idea. Economists, political leaders and industry spokesmen told us that, if the dead hand of regulation was replaced with open, free market practices, we would all be better off--sugarcane producers, consumers, and, indeed, the whole nation. Various studies were produced irrefutably confirming that deregulation would be the best thing that could happen to the Australian sugarcane growing industry. The phrase `if the Government would get off the backs of sugarcane farmers, it would be the salvation of the industry' was often heard. </PARA>
<PARA>  Governments, including the Federal Government, embraced these new ideas. The sugar embargo was removed and a process of lowering tariffs was introduced. It was said that these steps would help achieve a level playing field for international agricultural trade and that the Australian sugarcane growing industry had nothing to fear. Canefarmers were told over and over again that deregulation would increase annual export revenue and that annual net income would rise. The story was touted that deregulation would even result in higher employment and increased land values. </PARA>
<PARA>  The truth is that deregulation of the raw sugar industry is potentially disastrous for canegrowers. The reduction in tariff levels and other deregulatory measures introduced over the last few years has ignored the reality of a corrupted world market for agricultural commodities which is dominated by the United States and Europe. Eighty per cent of Queensland's sugar production is sold on the world market at a corrupted price that bears no relevance to the cost of production by Australian sugar producers, who are among the world's most efficient producers. </PARA>
<PARA>  In response to recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission, now known as the Industry Commission, tariff protection on sugar was unilaterally cut by the Government from $95 a tonne to $76 a tonne before the Industry Commission inquiry was even put in place. This was despite the industry being assured that the existing tariff would remain until the inquiry reported to the sugar industry in March 1992. Despite Australia's valiant efforts to exert a strong and persuasive influence on world trade issues, the task of convincing the European Community and the United States to adopt fair trading practices has so far been elusive. Australian primary producers are being seriously hurt as a consequence of the international trade debate. The European Community and the United States are following their own agenda on trade policy and taking whatever steps are necessary to help protect their primary producers from economic ruin. </PARA>
<PARA>  The overwhelming evidence is that the so-called free trade efforts by Australia are not protecting the interests of Australian primary producers. No major sugar producing nation has been without some form of production regulation. Even countries such as Thailand, one of the so-called Asian economic tigers, is increasing its level of regulation. The latest United States decision to slash sugar imports from Australia from 168,000 tonnes to 109,671 tonnes during 1991-92 will cost the Australian sugar industry about $18m. I have been told that this amounts to $1,500 for every Australian canegrowing family. It is another burden to bear for individual canegrowers already struggling to survive on reduced farm incomes caused by drought and low world prices. </PARA>
<PARA>  The current world market price for sugar is $US230 a tonne, which barely covers the cost of production. Honourable members should bear in mind that 80 per cent of Queensland's sugar production is exported. Therefore, many canegrowers will not make a profit this season despite working long hours and being amongst the most efficient canegrowers in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remind honourable members that the Australian sugar industry is a major export earner for Australia. For example, in 1989 the sugar industry generated $1.3 billion in export income. This season, due to the poor crop and corrupted world prices, the sugar industry income will drop to less than $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>  Compared to Australian sugar growers, the United States sugar producer benefits from a subsidised price of $US550 a tonne that their Government and consumers pay for them to remain viable. The European situation is even more ridiculous with sugar producers there getting a subsidised price of about $US650 a tonne. In Australia, canefarmers are puzzled by the headlong rush to deregulate the sugar industry. The sugar industry has stood the test of time based on the principles of regulatory support in the form of acquisition by a central agency--the Queensland Sugar Corporation--and assignment, that is, assigning land for cane production. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sugar regulation has not inhibited expansion of the canegrowing industry. Despite the not inconsiderable costs of expansion, the industry will be 30 per cent larger in 1996 compared to 1989 based on regular increments of expansion contained in the new sugar legislation enacted in Queensland, remembering that Queensland produces 95 per cent of Australia's sugar. Northern New South Wales produces the other 5 per cent but this is entirely used for domestic consumption. </PARA>
<PARA>  A regulated Australian sugar industry over the past 100 years has allowed the raw sugar industry to fund its own development from its own resources. Infrastructure such as ports and sugar storage facilities have been paid for by the Australian sugar industry. The $56m bulk handling sugar facility at Lucinda near Ingham was paid for by the millers and growers of the Australian sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  Furthermore, the sugar industry has always been conscious of the need to protect and sustain the environment. The very principle of assignment, which critics wish to deregulate out of the industry, has ensured that only suitable land is used for cane production. Marginal land is not moved into production to make a short term gain at a long term cost to the nation in the form of land degradation, which is one of the major environmental problems facing Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I plead with honourable members of this House to adopt a sympathetic attitude towards the Australian sugar producers. They need the help of government. They do not want government fragmenting the Australian sugar industry. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is an absolute tragedy that the Budget as it relates to primary industry this year sees a debate centred essentially on welfare provisions. So serious has the plight of the rural sector become that the debate now centres on the provision of public moneys the Government is voting to keep farmers viable. The unfortunate reality is that there is likely to be a great deal more of that before this crisis is over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  So here we have a vital sector, a sector which is important not simply for those involved in it, but which is vital to the future of Australia as an export nation dependent on its trading performances for its economic well-being and the provision of living standards for its people in a situation where it effectively has to beg. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are having ourselves on as a nation if we kid ourselves that we can allow the agricultural sector and farmers of this nation to sink. Its record in terms of productivity improvements and in providing much needed export income for Australia is second to none; indeed, no other sector of the Australian economy can match it. Its record is such that all participants can be extraordinarily proud of it. It angers farmers--it angers me as a farmer and as a representative of people in the farming sector--that our debt problems should have locked us in to such an incredibly serious situation, despite the best efforts of all involved in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  The collapse in commodity prices that we have seen in the last couple of years, particularly in the grain and wool industries, would be enough. What is now emerging not just as a drought but as an extreme drought condition stalking its way increasingly rapidly across our land, and then accumulated with the effects of inappropriate policies throughout the 1980s, all develops a scenario of extraordinary seriousness. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are seeing a catastrophic folding up of the rural sector. At least we are seeing despair; at worst it seems to me we are seeing constituents who are losing hope. The other day a young man of my age who has been in farming for 15 years told me that in the last 12 months he has begun to wonder whether he will ever find his way out of it. I spoke with another farmer from my electorate over dinner tonight who said that he cannot wait to sell up and get out. I do not know how many generations of his family have been on the land. That is at best. At worst all the ingredients are out there for a full-scale rural depression, let alone recession. </PARA>
<PARA>  For many out there that is indeed the nature of the current environment. This is no ordinary downturn, no mere hiccup: this is a time when people are seeing their life's work collapse and fold up before their very eyes. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have heard a lot in this place over the last couple of days about compassion, or some people's understanding of `compassion'. It seems that Government members opposite are determined that we should understand `compassion' in narrow and inadequate terms of welfare dependency. I put it to honourable members that real compassion for the farm sector should have started with the creation, development and maintenance of a realistic economic environment for farmers to operate in during the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, since we must now look for the handout, the reality needs to be recorded that the Government has granted a couple of worthwhile concessions, just as it must be recorded that there are still some glaring holes and that, unless things turn around, a great deal more funding will be necessary. The pluses relate to the provision of rural counsellors. I pay tribute to the work that some of those men and women are doing out there in helping people hold their personal lives as well as their financial situation together. There has at last been some recognition by the Government of the reality of extreme drought. </PARA>
<PARA>  Contrary to the remarks of the previous speaker, for example, about the provision of funding for Austudy and alterations in assets testing, the reality is that, despite the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the NFF that he would fix this problem, it has not been fixed. I am told that some people are still walking off their places simply because they cannot educate their children. </PARA>
<PARA>  To get Austudy under the hardship provisions that have now been laid down, certain criteria have to be satisfied. Firstly, the family farm has to be on welfare--but it is almost impossible to get it--or, secondly, the family must be on part C of the rural adjustment scheme, which effectively means that they must be leaving the farm and in a position where they can only accumulate more debt anyway. The family allowance supplement is also subject to a hardship provision, but again it is extraordinarily difficult to obtain and may involve spending moneys obtained from a bank or other credit institution for the purposes of carrying on the farm business, which, I would have thought, displays an appalling lack of understanding of how any small business, let alone a farm small business, operates. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said earlier, much of this should not be necessary. Most of our farming families would be in a far stronger position today if they had been paying internationally competitive interest rates on those average debt loads in the farm sector. If they had been paying 8 per cent to 10 per cent instead of 20 per cent to 25 per cent, as they did for up to 18 months during the 1980s, they would be a heck of a lot better off. On a debt of, say, $150,000, which is not rare out there amongst family farmers, the difference over five or six years could be as much as $150,000. That would be a far more compassionate way of providing for a downturn--to leave farmers in a position where they had a bit of fat to carry them on--than the sort of welfare provisions that we are now having to beg for. </PARA>
<PARA>  All farmers would be in a far stronger position if farm inflation had not ripped the guts out of their competitiveness during the 1980s, when constantly high rates of inflation were the direct result of the policies of this Government and its allies in the trade union movement. Again, I use a couple of examples from my own place. A 1982 tractor that we bought cost us the equivalent of 700 tonnes of wheat. In 1990, it would have cost us 2,600 tonnes of wheat. I would not be brave enough to do the figures now, because the more wheat we grew the less able we would be to afford the tractor. </PARA>
<PARA>  Regrettably, it appears that the ACTU has learnt nothing. It now wants to plunge us back into that inflationary spiral, and plainly members of the Government opposite are of a mind to agree with it and its ill-founded policies. The 2.5 per cent wage increase that resulted from the April national wage case is just now flowing through--it was a little delayed because of the activities of the ACTU--yet now we find that the metals industry, backed by the ACTU and the Government, wants a further 2.5 per cent from 1 November this year and a further 2 per cent from 1 January 1992. This is lunacy. It adds up to around a 7 per cent wage increase over a period when the inflation rate has been about 3.5 per cent, which is a great result even if we did get to it the wrong way--that is, by comatosing the economy. Unquestionably this approach will simply reverse the decline in inflation. It will also reverse the decline in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) might explain, since he has a background with the ACTU, that such a policy will not only impact very cruelly on employment prospects for those who are still lucky enough to have a job; it will also cost dearly in terms of the prospects of those who might otherwise have the chance of finding a job from their current position on the dole queues. </PARA>
<PARA>  While he is at it, in his role as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, he might also point out to the ACTU that such a policy will finish off the rural sector. All the rural industry needs now to absolutely break it is a surge in inflation, an attendant increase in pressures on interest rates and a higher and unstable dollar level again. The only chance for many in the rural sector is to survive on cheaper money--the cheapest money we can possibly secure for them. </PARA>
<PARA>  I put it to the Minister that it is about time that we saw some runs on the board in this regard. The farm sector is vitally important. We are suffering as a result of the impost of the sort of policy approaches of this Government and the Minister's mates in the ACTU. If he is to represent his new-found constituency in the farm sector, he will have to clearly decide, and he needs to decide that what we need is an economy based on lower inflationary outcomes as a matter of great urgency if the farm sector is to survive, and if it is once again to return to its pre-eminence as a motor house of Australian export performance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We are debating the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1991-92 relating to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Sometimes I feel just a little sorry for the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean. Like me he is a new member who came to office at the last election--he is taking time to find his way around--but he immediately became a Minister. We watched him fumble his way through his first Bill and, after a fairly inglorious performance in his first portfolio, he has now been promoted to Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There are great expectations of our new Minister. There are some who see him as the mysterious third candidate who will come along after the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) have thumped themselves into oblivion. It is a difficult and complex portfolio, and he has found difficulty finding his feet as was quite apparent as he tried to explain wholesale sales tax as it applied to farmers, during Question Time; as he told the pineapple growers of Queensland that they should move their factory to Thailand; and as he told the Grains 2000 conference participants that they should all start growing navy beans and peanuts. Indeed, he has a lot to learn. </PARA>
<PARA>   Of course, the Minister knows nothing about the portfolio. I know very little about organising strikes and pickets, industrial blackmail, lockouts and black bans and the like, and I expect I would have a fair bit of difficulty doing that job if I were asked. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GT4">Mr TRUSS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I do not think I would care to swap, but I am sure I would make a better fist of Minister for Primary Industries than we are seeing at the present time. My sympathy for him rests also partly in the fact that the primary industry portfolio was delivered to him in a woeful state. Honourable members may have read some of the media reports that suggested his predecessor did a pretty good job. There are not many farmers who would agree with that kind of sentiment, if any. In fact, his performance was one of great dismay to everybody in the rural sector. The previous Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, presided over the greatest exodus of farmers in the history of our nation. He destroyed whole rural industries--farm infrastructure has been largely degraded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The previous Minister's reward for all the destruction that he wrought on primary industry has been a promotion to Treasurer so that he can do for Australia what he did for primary industry. It is interesting, of course, that he always used to blame the Treasury for what he could not achieve for the farmers of Australia. Now that he is Treasurer it will be interesting to see what he can achieve. Quite frankly, his first Budget was a pretty poor effort.</PARA>
<PARA>  The current Minister's predecessor left behind a wool industry, a wheat industry, a beef industry, a sugar industry, a horticulture industry, a fruits industry and a grains industry all desperate, all very much worse than when he arrived. If all that is not bad enough, the new Minister now has to deal with perhaps the worst drought in our country's history. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is disappointing that he is not in the chamber tonight to listen to this debate. I would have thought that this was the most important night of the year for the new Minister for Primary Industries as his first Budget proposals come under scrutiny. He could have learned something. He could have learned something from some of his own colleagues--for instance, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). Even `no rural crisis Courtice' has finally discovered that there is, in fact, a disaster in the rural sector. I hope that the Minister will read that in Hansard at some stage. </PARA>
<PARA>  Like the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), I was pleased that the Minister has attempted to visit some of the drought affected areas. I understand he had a fairly unpleasant visit to the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), as he flew over some of the drought stricken farms in the area. I hope the unpleasantness was not just associated with the trip and that he also felt unpleasant and uncomfortable about the vacant fields beneath him, the dying stock and the tragedy that was clearly brought to his attention. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sadly, we seem to be told far too often by this Government that it is all the fault of a corrupt world; it is all the result of the behaviour of the USA and the EC. Indeed, their behaviour is an international disgrace. The United States is behaving like a schoolyard bully, pretending to be whiter than snow and defending all that is good but, in the same process, damaging its friends and colleagues with seemingly callous disregard. The sale of wheat to Yemen, the beef quotas, and the cutbacks in sugar imports are all classic examples of the way in which the United States is treating those people whom it regards as its friends. What kind of a relationship do we have with the United States if we are the sort of people it calls friends? This total disregard for our needs and interests is deplorable and it is hardly the way in which good friends and good neighbours behave towards one another. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe the visit of President Bush to this country is critical. It provides an opportunity, which we must take strongly, to get the message across to him that what is happening and what the United States is doing is totally unacceptable to this nation. We must take that opportunity in every address. The Prime Minister must say so and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) must say so--everyone who speaks to the President must say so. But we must do more than that; this will be a rare opportunity for us to get the message into the living rooms of American households. A plane load of media will accompany the President and we need to take every opportunity to ensure that the American television cameras also get the message of the great disquiet that Australians feel in this regard and realise the enormous damage that is being done to our relationship because of the United States' trading policies. We must hammer this point home strongly. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australian farmers will also need to be present and make their views abundantly clear. To just sit diligently and quietly and rely on one or two meetings to get the message across will fail, as previous meetings have failed. It will be necessary for them also, no matter how difficult the circumstances may be--during harvest, drought and depression--to make sure that they are in the right places to get the message across in the most active and positive way possible. </PARA>
<PARA>  A catastrophe is confronting Australian farmers. But it is not just the fault of America or the EC. The Australian Government has left its farmers defenceless and, what is more, added to their burden with increasing costs and the world's worst rural taxation regime. Recently, the Minister--who is not unaware of the problem--in introducing a Bill to provide a subsidy for citric acid to the giant multinational, Bunge, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . do. . . we ignore the fact that other countries are providing support mechanisms to their companies in this same industry?  Is that the level playing field that they talk about--that we ignore it;  we do not try to even up?  . . . I do not think that anyone in this country believes that, if there is not a level playing field, we should be the dupes. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Minister talking. I hope he will put that into practice in the primary industry area. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have a couple of good examples where he could start. At the recent Grains 2000 conference, the Minister suggested that farmers should switch to chick peas, navy beans and peanuts as the boom crops of the future. Again, that is a trifle naive. The chairman of the Navy Bean Marketing Board for the last 25 years has been in the public gallery for much of today and I am sure he could have told the Minister quite a bit about the navy bean industry. In fact, I represent most of the navy bean growers of Australia. We produce something like 3,000 or 4,000 tonnes; the Australian requirement is about 6,000 tonnes. If 100 farmers were to swing to navy beans it would flood the market. </PARA>
<PARA>  Woolgrowers cannot switch to navy beans, neither can wheat growers; they are a very specialised crop and are not likely to be the saviour of the farming industries of Australia. If all that is not bad enough, every time we try to export onto a world market where the prices are significantly lower than they are in Australia, we face enormous obstacles. America has a freight advantage over Australia in exporting navy beans to New Zealand. America can get them there cheaper than we can. That is a direct result of this Government's inability to do anything in areas such as industry structural reform. </PARA>
<PARA>  What about Australia's problem with imports and those people who do not give us a level playing field? Hungarian baked beans which are sold in Australian supermarkets for 45c a can are sold in Hungary for $1.35. That is a clear case of dumping, yet Australia's dumping regime is so twisted and difficult that it would be impossible for a little industry such as the navy bean industry ever to get the case up. Even if it did, it would be unlikely to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The story is similar for the peanut industry, the other industry which was identified by the Minister. But here the Government has been even worse. It has actually moved to ease health restrictions to enable Chinese peanuts contaminated by chemicals to come into this country. A lot needs to be done for Australian industries to establish a level playing field. They do not want subsidies as Bunge did; they just want a fair go. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Until about a year ago, for the preceding seven or eight years, Australia was rather lucky because our seasons were reasonably good and our markets throughout the world were reasonably good for most of our agricultural commodities. It was then that the Government, with the support of the industries, attempted to deregulate most of the primary industries of Australia wherever it could and, at the same time, to take away much of the taxpayers' financial support for inspections of beef, for example. I can remember the industry saying, `Righto, we want to stand upon our own feet, because we are big enough and efficient enough to stand upon our own feet'. It was quite wrong. Being a bit older and being a practical farmer, and because I have been tied up with politics for a fairly long time, I know that history changes, seasons change and markets change, too. So we cannot give away everything at the one time. Yet that is exactly what this Government has done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Tonight I listened to two Government members talk about the sugar industry and say, `Why did we deregulate it?'. These are the same people who, in this Parliament this year, supported a reduction in the tariffs on refined sugar. These people should go back to their sugar growers and tell them of their responsibilities and the things that they have done to them. I give the Government credit for the fact that through the Cairns Group, with the support of the Opposition, we have gone overseas and done our best to turn the minds of the EC and the Americans. But we are not going to do that very quickly; we have to realise that. </PARA>
<PARA>  Every speaker in tonight's debate has spoken about the drought, the economy and the awful markets that our primary industries are facing throughout the world. We have seen our national debt grow over those seven or eight good years that I was speaking about. We have reduced support and we have deregulated. But what are the farmers saying today? I was interested to read today about Mr Ian Steele-Park, a member of the New South Wales Farmers Association, a very prominent and respected man. He admitted that we have made a mistake. We have done certain things over the years, because of those good seasons and the relatively good markets, and now we have to recognise that the primary producers of this country have to get some support. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am not standing here tonight and saying that the taxpayer should just hand out money irresponsibly to the farmers. But for God's sake let us save our national herd--that is our responsibility--and let us keep up the quality of our soil. If a warehouse or building owned by a person who is running a business is falling down and there is a recession, at least that person tries to keep that warehouse or building in order for the better times. That is the case with almost all the farmers that my colleagues here tonight are talking about. Their buildings are falling down. They cannot afford to fertilise. </PARA>
<PARA>  I had a phone call tonight from a farmer within my electorate who told me that the RSPCA came out with a veterinary inspector and the police and told him to shoot three head of stock because he was not feeding them. That man is a good farmer, but he is in the midst of an awful drought at the moment. He has no feed and cannot afford to buy any to feed the cattle. But he will not turn around and shoot the cattle; he is trying to keep them alive. Why should a man be troubled with this sort of action in the middle of the present climax?</PARA>
<PARA>  What happens with the Greens and the pressure that we have today in the forestry industries? The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) spoke tonight about water resources. Where are we building dams and encouraging our farmers to put in water storage to irrigate and grow their crops? Those things are being forgotten because of the pressures of certain people who do not want this country to survive. </PARA>
<PARA>  We can do a number of things. Firstly, this Government, with our support, has to have a kind heart for those who are suffering and cannot meet their debts. I am not blaming the banks. They have been very kind to many farmers throughout Australia. They might have encouraged them to buy in better times. But we want the Government to have a kind heart and assist these people with the rural adjustment program, the assets testing problems, household support, the IEDs that the Government virtually wiped out, Austudy and family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government has to say, `We will extend these things to let these people have a decent standard of living and to give them heart to carry on so that they will keep their farms and be able to keep their herds of stock, be they sheep or whatever, and maintain the quality of their soil'. These are the challenges we have today in Australia and they are right at our doorstep at this very moment. The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) has been talking about this for many weeks in various parts of Australia. These are the problems that Australia is facing at this time. I call upon the Government to recognise what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our farmers today have a large investment in real estate, stock and plant. They are not like a paid person who works at a desk or who goes into work in a shop or an industry. They are people who have had to invest heavily in their property to be able to make a living and to survive. Those people want to survive because they are decent Australians. They are the ones who will bring this country out of the economic mess that we are in; nobody else will. Only production can do this. Productivity off the farm and out of industry in this country is the only way that we will wipe our national debt, get the economy back and employ the million people who are out of work at present. That is what has to happen. That has to be the aim of the Government in any of its programs to overcome our present problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recently, I went to South America and had the opportunity to look at the local primary industries, to go to cattle sales, to go out onto farms to see the situation and to look at some industries, such as the fishing industry. It is the countries in South America with lower costs than ours that are challenging us on the markets today. Not only the EC and the USA but also these countries which, through the Cairns Group of countries, have joined us. These are countries which we are in bed with but which are also our competitors. These countries will be our competitors in the years ahead, not only in the field of primary production but also on the manufacturing side. Our manufacturers in the car industry are moving offshore. I read a statement by the Manager of Toyota the other day--I think all honourable members have heard it--that there is a movement offshore because they can produce more cheaply. </PARA>
<PARA>  This country has to meet a tremendous challenge if we are going to survive and if we are going to get our people back to work again. I appeal to the Government to recognise this fact, to come along and to be sympathetic and to have a kind heart. I also appeal to the Opposition because we have to support the Government. We have to make suggestions, and I am sure that the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), can come up with an excellent program of immediate assistance to those primary industry people who are in trouble at the present time. The challenge now is not only to talk about this but to recognise it as well, and for the Government to be able to bring into being immediately policies that will be able to assist these people out on the land. </PARA>
<PARA>  Only this morning, I received a telephone call from a fellow who has 673 acres. He previously worked in a mill. The country is rough. He was sacked because the mill did not have the timber to go with it. He was drawing a social security benefit of $400-odd a fortnight for the wife and himself. But because he had a property that was valued at $177,000 or a little bit more, his social security benefit was cut off. He now has to go cap in hand to the Department of Social Security and prove hardship. Such people are worried by these things, but if the policies were in place and they knew they could go into the Department in a reasonable way, in a fair way, and be able to get the support they need, they would be different people indeed. That is why I appeal to the Government to recognise these facts and to get away from the way it is carrying on at the moment. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --There is no greater indictment of this Government's primary industry record than in this year's Budget when we turn not to the primary industry appropriation but to the Department of Social Security to see whether, among the inequities and welfare gaps that exist, people involved in primary industry and in self-employed areas have received any support. We know that our earnings from agricultural and mining exports will fall for the first time in 10 years and that incomes for our hard pressed farmers will decline. Tragically, Australia is in the midst of a total crisis in the country. Farmers are facing a fall of 24 per cent in net farm income on top of the decline of 35 per cent in 1990-91. This is a collapse of nearly 60 per cent in average net farm income over a two-year period. It is fair to ask the Australian community whether any PAYE worker would accept such a cut of 60 per cent in his or her wages over two years. We know the answer is no.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There is a feeling in rural Australia that this Federal Labor Government simply does not understand or simply does not care about the difficulties that exist. Where are the priorities of this Government when we have one million people unemployed, massive business bankruptcies, farms being sold off, and now horrendous drought extending through much of eastern Australia?  The priorities, of course, have developed in a feud between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). The former Treasurer--the wrecker and the architect of all the problems over the past few years--is now trying to justify his existence. We know that real interest rates are still at destructive levels. The Australian put it well when it stated:</PARA>
<PARA>There are many people out there in the electorate now wondering at Mr Keating's concern with the recession which they see about as credible as a fox with a mouthful of feathers inquiring about the state of the hen. </PARA>
<PARA>There is very little in the latest Budget that will do anything to assist primary industry out of this high domestic cost structure under Labor and allow it once again to become a very significant contributor to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  I now mention something positive that is going to be celebrated in the agricultural sector very shortly. I am sure that honourable members would not be aware that 1991 marks the hundredth anniversary of wheat breeding in Victoria. My electorate, which is based very much on broadacre cereal farming, is the prime region for Victorian research and breeding programs. It is interesting to note that wheat variety improvements and testing were established by the Victorian Department of Agriculture in 1891. This work was initiated by a committee formed by the Australian Association for the Advancement of Science originally to investigate the problem of rust in wheat. The research was, coincidentally, conducted by a vegetable pathologist in the first instance who grew numerous varieties from different countries, Farrer crossbreds and local varieties, in a nursery at Port Fairy in the western district. </PARA>
<PARA>  From these very simple beginnings wheat breeding grew in importance over the following 100 years. I particularly refer to the work of Hugh Pye at Dookie Agricultural College, who developed up to 100 wheat varieties, a number of which were extremely successful. It was early this century that wheat breeding was expanded to the Wimmera region at Longerenong Agricultural College, where many varieties such as Ranee, Rajah and Nizam were bred. Breeding programs were also carried out at Rutherglen and Werribee. From the work at Werribee a large number of varieties were released, particularly Ghurkha, Pinnacle, Quadrant, Insignia, Olympic and Sherpa. These are evidence of that very successful breeding program at Werribee. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1968 the Wheat Research Institute was established at Horsham and became the new base for the State's wheat breeding effort. Varieties released during the 1970s and the 1980s included the very successful varieties of Millewa, Meering, Cocamba, Lowan and Moray. In 1983 the Wheat Research Institute was expanded to the Crop Research Institute and all crop breeding programs were transferred to Horsham. The Institute was recently renamed the Victorian Institute for Dry Land Agriculture, which reflects the cooperation and coordination of the extension services with breeding agronomy and pathology to support rural agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the celebration of 100 years of wheat breeding a milestone has been reached in Australia's agricultural history and one that is worthy of the celebrations that will take place in Horsham on 6 November. I congratulate the director, Jim Kollmorgen, and his staff and wish them a successful celebration while continuing the research that is vital to our region's future. It is an indictment of this Budget that the only real assistance that has been provided to the agricultural sector is being provided to those leaving the land rather than those remaining. It is a further indictment that, even in the provision of welfare, many of the inequities and the welfare gaps that exist for rural families and those in self-employed enterprises have not been corrected. </PARA>
<PARA>  The downturn in rural fortunes is having a major social impact on the farming community and the small towns and cities that depend on agriculture for their well-being. The high interest rate regime and the high domestic cost structure that agriculture has had to deal with over the past few years has brought such a lack of confidence that our young people with the skills that we need for the future are being forced to desert our regions. We will lose the next generation of young people from our communities, which will put more pressure on those who remain. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nothing better illustrates this tragic situation than the recent information provided in the report from the Wimmera Fightback Committee. Their rural counsellor advises that in the last financial year farmers seeking help from that one rural counsellor--and I have five in my electorate--had an overall debt of $31m.  The Committee's annual report shows that the average debt of the Committee's 116 clients was $267,370, which is above the average Australian farm debt of $225,000. Another worrying trend is that the average age of clients seeking assistance was 47.7 years and there were eight farmers in the 65- to 75-year-old bracket.  These figures indicate the extent to which the depression is affecting all facets of the economy. It is commendable that the community today is united in tackling the problem. The focus of our attention cannot waver from families that are so devastatingly affected by the situation, not only in money terms but also in social cost and human terms. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recently the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) visited my electorate and I welcomed that visit, even though I was not advised of it or invited to it. I draw to his attention that many of the initiatives that have been taken in this Budget, particularly the increase in inspection costs for industries that are desperately trying to increase their export potential, are all going to disadvantage this sector rather than improve it. The Minister speaks in very glowing terms of the need to value add and, while I do not disagree with this, it will be seen as a smokescreen if the Government does not provide some real initiatives in so many vital areas of industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  In almost every community in my electorate during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, we had value added industries. We had flour mills in almost every town with very high levels of employment, and almost every community had a functioning abattoir. We must ask ourselves why these value added industries, which had been in existence for so long, are now non-existent. The reason is not related to the fact that Australia's farmers are not efficient. They are efficient. They are producing under high domestic cost structures and selling products at Third World prices. Of course, the reason relates to factors such as the disastrous state of industrial relations in Australia's secondary and manufacturing industries and the fact that our domestic costs are so out of line with those of competing nations. </PARA>
<PARA>  What then can be done about it? First, I think we have to take immediate measures to cushion the impact of the economic and rural crisis in our country communities. Why did the Government, for instance, not accept the coalition's recommendations that the wool levy be no more than 10 per cent? Why has the Government not reintroduced an acceptable underwriting scheme for our wheat industry and paid compensation to the wheat and other industries for the loss of market share as a direct result of trade sanctions against Iraq?</PARA>
<PARA>  The Government should immediately reinstate Commonwealth financial assistance in funding for drought aid, ensure that export inspection charges are limited to no more than the actual cost of service, and drastically improve the efficiency of our inspection services. In light of the reduction in tariff support for many of our industries, it is essential that anti-dumping laws be appropriate and that national labelling laws are extended so that consumers can clearly differentiate between imported and locally produced products. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is cruel that at the time that rural incomes are declining, tax average mechanisms ensure that farms are still paying high levels of tax even though in many cases incomes are negative. We must also reinstate the tax incentive element of the income equalisation deposit scheme. There is an opportunity for the Hawke Government to move now to ensure the future strength and growth of country Australia and its industries. If it fails, this Labor Government will go down in history as the government that destroyed Australia's great rural industries and infrastructure, and the people who go with it.

In this committee debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) relating to budgetary appropriations to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), I join my colleagues in the sentiment that I very much regret the fact that the Minister is not here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In anticipation of the interjection from the Minister, I do not pretend that the Minister is without adequate excuse; I simply regret the fact that he is not here, because it is necessary for the House to have injected into this debate, as the Opposition has endeavoured to do, some sense of the reality of the real urgency and desperation facing Australian farming families. In spite of the popular image that has been cultivated about farmers, the facts are that they are not complainers but are people with an enormous investment in this country. They are people who have chosen a lifestyle that is not necessarily comfortable; in fact, it is rarely comfortable. It is a lifestyle that frequently disadvantages the education opportunities that would otherwise be available to their children. Because of the demands of the property, many of them choose to live in houses that would not meet the standards regarded as normal in suburban Australia. They certainly would not be the sorts of houses that people in urban Australia would live in if they had invested in their manufacturing base the sort of money that my farmers have invested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I want to read into Hansard an article from the Land magazine of last week written by Louise Nichols. The heading is, `Never worse in the Hunter and Manning'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>The word ``moonscape'' has been used to describe the impact of the drought on the lower Hunter Valley and neighbouring Manning Valley, and the term is apt. </PARA>
<PARA>  Old-timers in these areas, which are among the worst-hit on the coast, say the 1991 drought is the worst in living memory. </PARA>
<PARA>  With paddocks devoid of any stockfeed and on-farm water storages reaching critical levels the situation for many farmers is desperate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Without rain this month any beef producers will be forced to destock or start full hand-feeding programs while dairyfarmers will have to find the money to increase their already heavy reliance on supplementary feeds. </PARA>
<PARA>And so the article goes on. This is not an article written from the jaundiced point of view that some honourable members opposite would think the Liberal and National parties have. This is an article written by a rural reporter to inform rural constituents of what is happening in a sector of New South Wales which is represented by the gentleman on my right. </PARA>
<PARA>  We do not pretend that we the Opposition or the farming community we represent can make it rain. But I do not find my farmers unrealistic in the way in which they deal with the reality of drought, which is a part of farming in the Australian environment. I put it to the House that the Opposition in any of its representations on behalf of farmers over the eight years that I have been in this place has not been unreasonable in the demands it has placed on the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  We can never be accused of having chosen to be critical of the Government simply to push some popular viewpoint. We have never just chased down the course of simple answers. In fact, we have been prepared to support the Government when what it has proposed has been initially unpopular in farming communities. I point for example to the deregulation of the domestic market for Australian wheat and to the Government's decision to remove the floor price for wool. Both decisions were modified by the Opposition but not opposed by the Opposition because to do so would have been popular in rural Australia in the short term. Instead, we chose the responsible course. We knew that farmers would be the first to see through any pragmatic shots we may have wanted to fire. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are not here tonight making unreasonable demands, merely making popular demands. We are here, as the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan), the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) have adequately said, representing the awful reality currently facing Australia's farming community. </PARA>
<PARA>  The real dilemma that farmers face as this drought begins to bite, particularly in eastern Australia, is that they simply have no way in which they could be ready for it; no way, because their trading base had already been eroded by what had happened in world markets; no way, because their capacity to prepare for a drought had already been eroded by the absurd high interest rate policy that the Government had initiated; and no way, because the classic technique available to farmers to prepare for tough years--once known as income equalisation deposits--had been destroyed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  I put it to the House that, contrary to all that the Government and the Treasurers, both past and present, have said about falling interest rates, a businessman or a farmer in Australia in 1991 still finds that interest rates are relatively high. Those high interest rates are still sucking in funds from overseas. The influence of that money coming from overseas is to prop up artificially the Australian dollar and to make it even more difficult for Australian farmers to trade in the world market. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am not proposing that the Government should once again regulate the dollar, but I point out that the Government's interest rate policy has artificially inflated the dollar and made it increasingly difficult for my farmers, who are already facing an impossible situation in world trade and an even more devastating situation in terms of drought, to survive. It has been calculated that, if the Australian dollar was to fall by the equivalent of US5c, it would boost the average Australian farm earnings by $200m each year. As I said, this is not a plea for re-regulation but a plea for a review of what the Government's high interest rate policy is doing to our trading conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Deputy Chairman, as you would be aware from the debates you have listened to in this chamber, the Opposition has never chosen to call for the reinstatement of protectionist barriers against what is happening to farmers in world trade. We have supported the Government in its effort to lower protection levels; we have recognised that we cannot go on building protection and expect to have an efficient and healthy export sector; but the reality that my farmers face is that, while we wait for the Cairns Group and for the EEC and the USA to amend their policies, farmers are going broke through no fault of their own. </PARA>
<PARA>  The question we must ask is: how can we help them survive until the sorts of reforms that Minister Blewett is seeking in world trade begin to occur? The Opposition has some answers. We believe that we can help our farmers survive by, for example, being industrious in the way we go about reforming the waterfront, and not simply pussyfooting. We believe that we can help our farmers survive by being determined in the way we go about reforming our industrial relations sector, and not simply pussyfooting with that either. We believe that we can help our farmers survive by recognising that they are asset rich and cash poor, and that some of the welfare entitlement that the rest of the community takes for granted is denied to them even though they need it. </PARA>
<PARA>  We recognise that the Government has not been bereft of any action in the farming sector. It has, for example, in my electorate, appointed an additional rural counsellor. But this is mere peripheral action. The plea from the Opposition benches to the Government in this debate on the Appropriation Bill is for action, and action now, on those things that would help keep Australian farmers competitive--the level of the dollar, interest rates, the waterfront and industrial relations. Something can be done, and virtually nothing has happened and nothing is flagged in the 1991-92 Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Mr Deputy Chairman, I would like to be able to say that it is a pleasure to speak in this debate on the appropriation for primary industry, but I can assure you it is not, because we have reached a situation in this country where compassion is a dirty word. It is a dirty word because the people sitting on the Government benches have corrupted it, perverted it and distorted it. They make a great play of their caring and compassion but, I tell you, Mr Deputy Chairman, there is very little evidence of that to be seen in rural Australia. The reality about the people sitting on the Government benches is that they do not care. One needs only to look at the 1991-92 Budget and assess what it has in it in reality. There was no planning, no vision and no hope--and that was particularly so for the rural community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The farmers of this country have long been correctly regarded as the most efficient in the world--and the most independent and hardest working in the world, too. But, for them, as well as suffering the high interest rates which have been crippling, the depressed commodity prices and the inflated value of the dollar brought about by the deliberate policies of this Government; as well as being the sandwich filling in the trade war between Europe and the United States--and it is a trade war; as well as trying to combat and be competitive with the vast quantities of imported foodstuffs which may or may not be dumped, but with the existing legislation and the way it is looked at that is very hard to find out; and as well as the difficulties that are thrust upon the primary producer because of the waterfront and the coastal shipping situation, there is the heartbreaking situation of one of the worst droughts we have seen in decades. Even in my electorate on the mid-north coast of New South Wales from Port Macquarie to Coffs Harbour, there are parts where there has been no rain for three months. That is a very long time, particularly for that coastal strip. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even without the drought, those other factors have created an absolute disaster for the farming community of this country. Quite frankly, farmers have been bashed down to their knees. Other speakers tonight have told of the worries of individuals and the possibilities--no, not the possibilities, the facts--of suicide, because people are driven and pushed to absolute despair. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is absolutely heartbreaking because the impact on those families--those men, women and children--will continue to be felt for many years to come. It is not something that is just going to run away. Being broke, having no money, not knowing where the next feed is going to come from in many cases, and having to take the children out of school, which has happened right around Australia, have a psychological impact. This is not a fairy story; it is a fact. These are our fellow Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  This so-called caring and compassionate Government bleats about what it is doing, but it is not doing very much. I hear every now and then the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), talking about the 45 per cent of farmers who are not paying any tax. He tries to score a fairly cheap political point because he is looking at our forthcoming economic reform package which will totally abolish the wholesale sales tax, significantly reduce income tax and tackle the whole economy of this country. I believe that our package will be the salvation of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister says, `Forty-five per cent of farmers do not have any income and are not paying any tax, so the GST or tax deductions are going to be of no benefit to them'. Quite frankly, I reject what the Minister says. I am not prepared, and neither are the National Party and the Liberal Party, to accept a situation where 45 per cent--nearly half--of the farmers of this country can be abandoned, and the Minister says that tax cuts are not going to do them any good because they have not got the income. We need to have a complete reversal of our thinking. If people are in that situation, some financial support must be given to them. Quite frankly, the Government has not gone far enough. There needs to be additional support for farmers. </PARA>
<PARA>  The assets test, in particular, is something that has to be looked at because if a farmer has no income and cannot sell his property what does he do if he does not qualify for some form of welfare assistance?  That assistance has to be only temporary. It is not good enough to simply turn our primary producers into welfare recipients. Equally, of course, it is not good enough to have a million Australian workers unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  We do not want the farmers of Australia to swell the ranks of the unemployed. The farmers of Australia want to work. They want to produce. They want to have some income and, believe it or not, they even want to pay taxes. Quite frankly, I think most of them would say, `The more taxes we can pay the better'. But what can the farmers expect?  Absolutely nothing from Labor, which talks about the level playing field. Well, the playing field for Australia's farmers is pretty much uphill; it is not level at all. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to look at what is happening in the EC. I had the opportunity of visiting Italy, France, Germany and England in June and July. I was actually on a farm near Munich in Bavaria and speaking to a farmer. I had always thought that, when people talked around cattle saleyards and other places about European farmers surviving and raising a family with five or six cows, it was a bit of a joke. But it is not; it is true. The reality is that what the EC is doing is providing social welfare in the form of farm subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not believe we should do that--no way at all--because what that does is oversupply and distort world commodity markets. I do not think we should necessarily get to the point where, for example in Germany, farmers are paid between 600 and 1,000 deutschmarks a year per hectare for a maximum of five years not to produce. That is roughly between $600 and $1,000 a year per hectare not to produce. But if they are producing, they can be paid 300 deutschmarks--approximately $300--a year not to fertilise which, of course, is to reduce the production. They also have some concerns about the quality of their ground water. </PARA>
<PARA>  What we need is a complete turnaround of this economy. We have to have some faith, some vision, some hope and some creative activity; not a Budget like the one we had just last August which was like a sponge filled with dirty dishwater with nothing in it--no creativity. What we have to do is to turn around the whole system. </PARA>
<PARA>  Micro-economic reform is a buzz word. Probably the average Australian, unless he or she takes a particular interest in economics, does not even know what that means. We have to get back to the basis where Australian farmers, Australian manufacturers and small businesses will not suffer under high interest rates and will not have to be ground down by depressed commodity prices and by an inflated value of the dollar. We need to be able to get out and freely produce and sell without that straitjacket of high interest rates and those other restrictions imposed by this Government. We have to deregulate our economy. We have to free it up and allow the Australian primary producer to get some value and some benefit from his production. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --As the rural sector and the community outside our major urban centres slide deeper and deeper into depression, one of the recurrent cries is that of the frustration of not getting the individual or collective voices of the rural people heard in this place. Consequently, in my contribution tonight on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) dealing with the appropriations for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, I wish to read into the official Hansard record two letters from two constituents who have asked that I take this step. However, before doing so, I wish to place on the record some of the facts that highlight the enormity of the importance of the rural sector to the national economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Australian agriculture produces enough food and fibre to feed 50 million people annually. In the 1989-90 financial year, farm exports amounted to $15.3 billion in overseas revenue, accounting for 32 per cent of merchandise exports. The source for those statistics is the ABARE quarterly publication of December 1990. Farm inputs during the financial year 1989-90 totalled $19.9 billion. Four hundred thousand workers are directly employed by agriculture. The March 1990 report to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) by the Australian Science and Technology Council entitled Science, Technology and Australia's Future stated that agriculture and associated industries, not including transport and finance, employed 1.4 million Australians, or 20 per cent of the work force. The annual rise in productivity rate for agriculture has been twice that for manufacturing over the last 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nobody, but nobody, inside or outside of this Parliament should underestimate the critical importance of agriculture to our standard of living. Consequently, any debate about primary industries must be closely followed by the Government. I have to say that for the last hour and a half we have had one solitary Government member in this chamber and that is the Minister for Local Government (Ms Fatin), who is on duty and required to be here. The disinterest in this debate shown by Government members is a hallmark of their treatment of the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  The first letter that I wish to read is on behalf of one of my constituents, Mr Jack Vanderland of 15 Farmer Street, Mirboo North. He received a letter from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) which is self-explanatory. I will read it to the House and then read some of Mr Vanderland's comments in reply. The letter to Mr Vanderland is dated 24 September 1991, and states:</PARA>
<PARA>  Dear Mr Vanderland</PARA>
<PARA>  I refer to your recent letter concerning the rural crisis and its impact on farmers. While noting the contents of your letter, I would like to respond in particular to your suggestion that food imports into Australia should be banned. </PARA>
<PARA>  Increased competition from imported food products has been a topic widely reported in the press in recent months. While the Government is well aware of the serious challenges this has imposed on some industries, it is important that these imports, or the threat of these imports, be put into perspective. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are many reasons why food products are imported into Australia. Many products are imported out of season or during periods of domestic shortage due to production failures, an inability to produce the commodity and/or production shortfalls relative to demand. Food imports form only a small proportion of total food consumption and do not represent a reliance on overseas producers for Australian survival. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australian exports of food products greatly exceed our imports. In fact Australia exports a higher percentage and a broader range of agricultural commodities than any other country. We export over 70 per cent of all our agricultural produce and are very dependent on this trade as a source of income for our country. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a major agricultural exporting nation, Australia has much to gain from the liberalisation of world trade and supports the need for a freer, less protected international trading environment. Australia cannot seriously seek the removal of trade distorting subsidies and high tariffs in other countries, however, without a similar system operating here. Clearly, a ban on imports would be a step in the wrong direction and would do Australia more harm than good as we strive to achieve freer world trade. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is keen to ensure, however, that Australian industries are not subject to unfair market competition from imports. Following the announcement in the March 1991 industry policy statement, anti-dumping procedures have been strengthened. These changes will speed up processing of complaints by industry so that in most cases where there is injury to local producers, provisional measures will be available 40 days sooner than at present. Better access to the system for agricultural and horticultural producers will also be available in response to unfair trading practices in relation to the processed products of their industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA>SIMON CREAN</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Vanderland's reply is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Crean</PARA>
<PARA>  Of course we need food imports, like tomatoes after we plowed tonnes back in the ground. Just like potatoes when every farmer has dumped them at the tip in Mirboo North. Of course we're short of them. And we are short of 7000 tonnes of cheese which is stuck in a storeroom at Allowrie Foods (frozen solid). We need fruit juice because the fruit fell off the trees before we can pick them.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members can see the irony, even sarcasm, of Mr Vanderland's reply to the Minister's contention that we need to import products because we cannot produce them ourselves. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Before I forget we need also frozen vegies because we don't grow them any more in East Gippsland because we've got sheds full of them. What a load of rot Mr Crean. You really think farmers are fools don't you?</PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully</PARA>
<PARA>JACK VANDERLAND</PARA>
<PARA>The second letter is from a small business constituent of mine, Mr Erich Zdrazil of Loch Sport. His letter is to the Prime Minister. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Hawke</PARA>
<PARA>  As an immigrant who fought to seek refuge, and a new life in Australia, and escape the Dictatorial Communist Government of my Homeland, SLOVENIJA, Australia was the land of sunshine, hope and promise, where hard work was rewarded, freedom of speech and association, a way of life. The picture East Europeans painted of Australia, was that of a GOD-fearing Moral People who believed in a good days' work for fair pay, and mighty unions to protect the Workers' rights against Opportunists, and Bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA>  While I'd never forgotten that SLOVENIJA had been conquered, first by the Third Reich, and again by the Soviets, I noticed that the Country I had escaped to was rapidly becoming more Communist than Soviet Europe, it dawned on me that Australia was conquered from the ENEMY WITHIN, by a Communist Regime of `Peace Activists', and a `Green Army in the guise of Concerned Conservationists', with a library of Falsehoods and Nonsense. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --Most of the debate on the estimates for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has been about the drought that is gripping much of Australia. This drought has come on top of a rural recession which is probably the worst in living memory and is affecting many people in rural Australia--not only the people on the land but also business people who are associated with the people on the land and with families generally throughout rural Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The electorate that I represent produces most agricultural products that are available in Australia today, apart from those grown in tropical climates. It is a very important food producing area of Australia. However, much of the area I represent is semi-arid. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wish to speak tonight about a visit I made last week to the small township of Tilpa and the surrounding area. Tilpa is a little township on the River Darling about 170 kilometres north north-east of Wilcannia. I visited that area about three months ago when it was in the grip of a drought. It had not had decent summer rains for at least eight years. The deterioration that had occurred in that time had to be seen to be believed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I went by aircraft to Tilpa because time did not permit me to drive. I landed on the Tilpa airstrip and went to the Tilpa hall immediately. I spoke to a number of people there, including Leon Zanker, Col Middleton, Jan and Peter McClure, Michael McInerney and Ross and Rosemary Bartlett. They raised several matters with me in relation to the drought in this area. The Tilpa area is typical of some of the black soil country and the red sand hills that exist along the Darling River, each of which have their own problems, particularly in time of drought. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some of the matters these people raised with me were the added cost burdens that had affected them before the drought came along--interest rates, transport costs, land rates and taxes, the problems they faced with industrial relations systems on the waterfront in trying to get their commodities overseas and the lack of educational opportunities for their children simply because of the fact that they are so isolated. Although there is correspondence and radio education these days, the problem of sending their children away to school is very great. Some people have left the area because they could no longer afford to educate their children. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the interesting statistics that emerged was that when assistance for isolated children was introduced in 1973 parents of about 32,000 students in rural Australia received assistance. Today there are fewer than 10,000 students receiving that assistance. This reflects the depopulation of rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I recently visited Terrigal for the first time. I found it to be a wonderful place on the coast with plenty of sunshine and sea water, but the thing that worried me when I started to think about it was that here we have, between Melbourne and Brisbane, most of the population of Australia on the coast, living a lifestyle which to some would seem idyllic--admittedly, many of them are working very hard--really supported by those people in the rural areas, in the farming and mining sectors, who are producing most of the wealth of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  We find that rural Australia is becoming more and more depopulated. For every person who leaves a small community like Tilpa, or any of the other rural areas, it means a drop in the standard of living or the quality of life for everyone else who lives there. I believe we really have to look seriously at that. As someone said to me in that area, `Do we really want a rural Australia? Do we want a rural producing sector in Australia or don't we?'. If we do, we have to make some fairly immediate changes to try to protect those people in Australia who are producing the wealth of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  For example, in Tilpa--it may only be a small thing, but it is indicative of what is happening in those rural areas--over the past 15 years there has been a very good cricket club, would you believe; it has played in nine grand finals and won four of them; but from this year there are not enough people in the area to form a cricket team. A cricket team might seem small peanuts to some people, but that cricket team is very important to that area and to the quality of life of the people who live there. </PARA>
<PARA>  As we know, and as has been stated tonight already, 30 per cent of farmers in Australia will have zero or negative incomes this year. That was before the drought. Now that the drought has come the position is almost impossible for some people. The interesting thing at the meeting at the Tilpa hall was that the people were not asking for handouts. We know that in Australia farming, really, is the management of drought. We have a volatile weather pattern and people learn, particularly in the semi-arid areas, how to exist under normal drought conditions because they allow for that, but when they get into a serious situation--such as the one I am mentioning, where they do not have summer rains for eight years--then it is very difficult for them to survive. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the things they raised with me where governments could be helping them was the provision of rural electricity. In capital cities and larger provincial centres we take the supply of electrical power for granted. There is an electrical power scheme going on under the name of DECA, south of that area, where each land-holder is expected to pay $53,000 for the connection of rural power. The State Government in New South Wales is doing its part towards funding that scheme and, under very generous terms, is providing electricity to those areas. The Federal Government could help by writing off the amount being paid in the year of expenditure, but no, it will not do that. It has a 10-year provision and is not budging on that, despite the fact that we have asked it many times. </PARA>
<PARA>  After we had been to the hall we flew out to a property just west of Tilpa and landed there. The small breezes blowing were lifting the dust. There was hardly any grass at all. As the feral goats feed above their heads, many of the shrubs were going and any green pick that may have been around was being eaten by native animals or feral animals, particularly the goats. One of the graziers told us that he had a problem shearing his sheep; they were too weak. One of the problems, of course, is that graziers are trying to keep their breeding stock together. As we know, it takes years to get breeding stock, but the way things were going they did not think they would be able to keep the breeding stock. In fact, they found that many of the sheep were too weak to shear and even if they could shear, they could not afford the cost of doing so. </PARA>
<PARA>  Something has to be done about the animal population, whether feral or native. Despite the fact that we are told that kangaroos are an endangered species, about three or four months ago I was speaking to people who should know and they told me that kangaroos in New South Wales at that time were probably at the highest numbers they have ever been--about 8 1/2 million kangaroos. That is a lot of kangaroos when someone is trying to run a grazing industry in that area. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also need to look at the tax deductibility of water conservation projects. Despite the fact that they also were tax deductible in the year of expenditure, in 1985 the present Government extended that to a three-year period. I do not see any difference between water conservation and soil conservation. They are both very much connected and both should be written off in the year of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>  The main questions asked were: do we in government think that the rural sector has a future; is there a future in the wool industry?  Of course, I said that I thought there was a very bright future. The thing we have to get over to the Government is the need to do something about keeping these people on the land, particularly young people. If we do not get two or three inches of rain over the next few weeks, not only will the local rural communities have problems but also this nation will have problems, as it has had before. </PARA>
<PARA>  I heard some honourable members from Queensland speak. They said that it is the worst drought they have ever known of. If that is the case, Australia has a real problem. Even if we had rain in the next few weeks, many people would not overcome their difficulties, because of the problems that have been caused by governments through high interest rates, transport costs and all those sorts of things. We have to ask ourselves whether we want a productive rural sector. If we do, we have to move very fast and do something about looking after it. </PARA>

Unless the pricing arrangement is changed and the drought desists, there will be such a crisis--and the depth of it is yet to be seen.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes, a Labor person said that, and it has been fulfilled by this Labor Government. Over the recent recess I had the benefit, one might say, of visiting quite a few parts of Queensland. One of them was Mount Isa. I visited areas throughout my electorate, particularly the township of Bowen. I also went to Charleville, just last week, as the banking inquiry was being held there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  To look around places throughout Queensland is rather revealing. There is a common theme, which is based on the grave natural disasters of droughts, floods and droughts again. That might seem to be an odd sequence, but that is the case with natural disasters on the coast of Queensland, particularly within my own electorate. We have had droughts right up until Christmas day and in the next four weeks had some 130 inches of rain. We have been in a drought condition now for the last four months. The State Minister says that we are not in drought conditions. He is not sure when a dry period extends into a drought. Coming back through part of my electorate last weekend, I noticed that the gum trees within the ridges were actually dying, and yet the Minister says that there is no drought condition. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the problems was the agreement between the States and the Commonwealth to de-list droughts as a natural disaster. There is no doubt in my mind that what Queensland and, I believe, some parts of Western Australia are facing now is a natural disaster. We also find that, as a result of that de-listing, the guidelines for the rural adjustment funds right across the States are inconsistent. The interpretation in Queensland through the QIDC may differ from that given elsewhere as far as household fund support is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note that the latest package of funds given in Queensland towards drought relief was less than the amount that the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) took off in tariff reduction for sugar this season. I talked about Bowen a little while ago. If one looks at a place like that where horticulture is predominant, it is interesting to see that what is hitting a place such as that is the recession down south, the imports of other goods and regulations forcing producers to label some of their products. However, at the end of the line, despite the extra cost, that does not mean very much at all. So there is a lack of consistency there. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have a press release here which shows the concern of both the State Labor Government and the Federal Labor Government. The Queensland Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Casey, visited Bowen recently. He arrived about four hours late. It was described as a whistle stop. The comment made was, `Growers find scant solace in Mr Casey's whistle stop visit'. </PARA>

He has not turned up, despite invitations, although he can find the time to fly over the top to Mareeba. I am not sure what the problems are at Mareeba, but he did not turn up at Bowen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  However, the coalition shadow Minister has shown a lot of interest in this situation. He turned up at 4 o'clock one evening and stayed until 10 o'clock. I thank the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), for his visit. He has shown that there is compassion within the National and Liberal parties. That certainly does not exist within the other parties. Other problems people have at Bowen are the training levy, the one per cent, the superannuation levy and the situation of their further inputs. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to look at the difficulties, quite apart from the drought and flood situations, of primary industries. Many of the products we have right across Australia--wheat, wool, beef, sugar, horticulture and rice--are being afflicted by Government imposed restrictions. Interest rates were kept too high for too long too early in the recession that we had to have. This has had a major effect on the costs of primary producers and has also decreased equity in their properties. We can talk about many of the businesses that have been bankrupted, which primary industry, as we found at Charleville last week, is facing. Interest rates are still too high in real terms. Our exporters feel desperately the effect of those interest rates in the exchange rate, which is pushing up the dollar. The value of our products on the export market has been diminished, and to a large extent it encourages imports. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1990, $34m worth of tomato products came into Australia--that is a market that Australians could quite well fill--and $27m came in during the year ended June 1991. Australia is importing many other products that Australia itself could produce if given the opportunities and a fair go by this Government. In 1990, meat and meat products were imported to a value of $22m; in 1991, it was $36m. Dairy products and birds' eggs were imported to a value of $105m in 1990 and $124m in 1991; fish and associated products, $425m in 1990 and $447m in 1991; and cereals and preparations, $94m and $105m. It is interesting to note that $17m worth of rice, which is one of the products I nominated, was imported to Australia in 1990, the figure being $16m in 1991. Vegetables and fruit were imported to a value of $415m in 1990 and $383m in 1991. Sugars and sugar preparations of honey were imported to a value of $51m in 1990 and $61m in 1991. This totalled, in 1991, $1,156m. </PARA>
<PARA>  A tremendous amount is being lost to our own producers as a result of the many difficulties they are facing in trying to trade in this country. The coalition intends to apply itself to many of those problems: the cost of the centralised wage fixing system, the lack of productivity in wages and also the means of getting interest rates to more realistic levels. </PARA>
<PARA>  One also needs to look at the common problem of the reduction of tariffs, with no effective anti-dumping mechanisms being put in their place. I have already mentioned that the tariffs on sugar were reduced unilaterally, even though there was no movement from the European Community or the US to reduce its corrupted subsidies when putting those products onto the world market. The other problem we find concerns the diminishing property values on farms these days. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I think I was addressing the argument of the diminishing property values of farms. At Charleville it was interesting to find that the lenders were now in a situation where they had security which was worth less than the value of the loan. This situation of course demands attention, and I imagine the Government should be looking at it initially. It needs to look at the situation in Australia at the moment, where there are $29 billion worth of non-performing loans, that is, loans where the interest is not being met. This compares with $27 billion, which is held in shareholders funds at the banks. Obviously, there is a need for realism as far as the lenders are concerned, and also a need to reduce the rates of interest. In this day and age when one can get interest on deposits of only about 9 or 10 per cent, we found that some people were being charged 18 per cent, with a penalty rate of 22 per cent. There is a desperate need to restructure those loans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Another aspect concerns the fact that America's quotas for both beef and sugar have been reduced. Those industries, facing low prices on the world market, will have further problems. I am basically discussing this crisis and the fact that the farmers of Australia are the new rural poor. I believe the Government should be doing something in this connection. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-During the last couple of weeks of the parliamentary break I travelled extensively throughout my electorate. In the southern part of my electorate, stretching from the Central Tablelands through the centre and to the north, I visited numerous towns including Forbes, Parkes, Wellington, Dubbo, Gilgandra, Coonamble, Nyngan, Girilambone, Coolabah and Byrock. I embarked on an extensive tour late last week with the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) through Brewarrina and Bourke and I travelled through my proposed new territory of Cobar and Tottenham. The weekend before last I attended a function at the little town of Tilpa on the Darling River, where only 32 people voted at the last election but 200 people turned up on the night I was there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I mention this because I gained a great first-hand insight into people's problems and what has happened recently. The main problem occupying people's minds is drought, which is extremely serious at the moment, particularly in the northern part of my electorate. Many farms have had little or no worthwhile rain since the floods of last year and many people are claiming it is worse than the 1982 and the 1965 droughts. Stock is being turned in on many of the crops. In some areas, silos do not even bother opening. Of course, stock are in a desperate state despite the fact that it is spring--the time we usually associate with a maximum amount of feed. A number of farmers have breeding stock away on agistment, and at the moment they have no prospect of those stock returning because there is no feed to come back to. This is happening as we are moving into the heat of summer. </PARA>
<PARA>  The continuing cost of having that stock away on agistment is probably more than the animals are worth. Some people have sent stock to Queensland, but the feed has run out up there and they are wondering what to do with the stock. In one  exceptional  case,  a farmer I know has lost most of his cows even though they are away on agistment. The sheep, particularly those in the western division, are in a very weakened state. Many farmers cannot get them to the sheds to shear them and they are left in the paddock to die. Many sheep that have come to the shed die after shearing due to stress. Others are already dead in the paddock. One man I spoke to--Peter McClure at Tilpa--is losing about 50 to 100 sheep per day. When all of this is happening it makes one wonder where the greenies are. It would be a good chance for them to get out and show a bit of compassion by cutting a bit of scrub for these people. But, no, we never sight them unless they want to shut something down. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even if the farmers could buy feed for this stock--and they cannot because no fodder is available in any quantity--they could not afford it anyway because it is being sold at such incredible prices. Aggravating all this is a chronic build-up of woody weed infestation in the western division of New South Wales, which means that there is less feed around than there normally would be. Woody weed invasion is probably the biggest long term problem facing the western division. I hope that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) will have a look at this at some stage. </PARA>
<PARA>  On top of this we have a feral animal problem. There are millions of red, grey and black kangaroos at the moment. Rabbits are a big problem; one farmer told me that he had eradicated 38,000 in one paddock alone. There are high numbers of pigs. Only yesterday the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) cited a case where he had counted up to 500 emus on one crop. One feral animal that does not get much mention and that I would like to alert the Government to tonight is feral goats. They are out there in their tens of thousands eating not only what little grass is left but also the trees and shrubs. They are eating it up so high that the sheep cannot reach any green pick in the trees. That is aggravating the problem immensely. The goats are going so high that they are leaping off the ground and in some cases are getting their horns tangled in the branches and dying by hanging. We are seeing goats down on black country now, which is a rare thing; usually they stick to the red country. </PARA>
<PARA>  On top of this gruesome scene we have a collapse in commodity prices. On the weekend I spoke to one superfine wool grower in the central tablelands who three years ago got a cheque for $121,000. The year after that it was down to $83,000. Last year it was down to $50,000. He has just got his cheque for this year and he is down to $21,000, even though he has wool down to 15.4 microns. He would have been getting 5,000c for that only a year or two ago and now he is only getting 300c or 400c. It is bringing less than his 19-micron wool because it is out of fashion. </PARA>
<PARA>  Out in the western division, around Bourke, wool growers are selling bales of wool which, after taking out selling costs, freight, commission and shearing charges, are worth about $250 a bale. The average healthy sized farm in that area would have about 200 bales, which means that the farmer is getting about a $50,000 gross income to live on. If he had a loan of $300,000, the interest charges alone would take all that income. It means that he has nothing left to educate his children, because the Government has squeezed the Austudy charges and the isolated children's grants. Farmers cannot get the dole because of the unusual position they are in vis-a-vis people who live in cities and towns. They may have agistment charges which they cannot meet; they cannot afford wages for their farm workers; and they cannot afford to buy vehicles, let alone service the ones they already have. There is no money left over for fencing and machinery or to service their equipment--windmills, pumps and bores--let alone to put food on the table for their wives and children. </PARA>
<PARA>  So it is not unusual to find a feeling of despair in the bush. There is enormous strain on finances and on the families. Frustration and anger are starting to build up and the farmers are starting to lash out at city-based politicians who, they think, do not know and do not care about what is going on out there. They are still being hit with high interest rates; 17 or 18 per cent is quite common. The Government is letting these high interest rates roll on so they can suck in overseas money invested to take advantage of high real interest rates. This is forcing up the value of the dollar. It is still hovering at around US79c or US80c. That means we are getting less for our commodities when we sell them overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is causing some anger when the farmers see the Government still funding a bunch of weirdo groups. It is sending hundreds of millions of dollars overseas to groups such as front-line states in southern Africa and throwing millions of dollars at the communist dominated ANC and groups such as this when the farmers cannot afford to send their kids to school and they cannot afford a satellite dish so they can pick up a couple of TV channels to get some quality of lifestyle. The land values around them are collapsing and that is destroying their equity. </PARA>
<PARA>  One property called Tankarooka, south of Tilpa, went up for sale last week and was passed in at $7.50 an acre. That is an example of what is happening in the bush at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Rural adjustment scheme funding has been increased. That is very welcome, but it is still totally inadequate. Farmers really do not want welfare; they want government to get off their backs. Admittedly, several hundred farmers are applying for funding under this scheme but very few are qualifying for benefits. It seems that they are either too rich or too poor and cannot qualify anyway. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a great need in the bush for the Government to look at new measures. Perhaps members of the Australian Labor Party will look at reinstating the opt-in opt-out for the tax averaging scheme that they abolished when they came to power and at reinstating a proper IED scheme, which they emasculated when they came into power. They might also look at making proper provision for fodder conservation and soil conservation programs and granting tax deductibility in the year of installation for putting electricity on. It may surprise some honourable members to hear that there are farmers in Australia who still do not have electricity, even though they are generating perhaps $100,000 or $200,000 of export income for Australia and are living on a negative income themselves. These people still do not have electricity. In this day and age it is absolutely amazing. </PARA>
<PARA>  The farmers would like to see the Government remove the tariffs on imports for things such as spare parts and the proper funding of roads. The Government has cut such funding by 30 per cent in real terms since it came to power. People in rural areas would like see the waterfront tidied up. It frustrates them when they read of wharfies working 27 hours a week for an average of $45,000 or $50,000 a year, getting dim sim allowances and shifting 13 containers an hour when our overseas competitors are shifting 30 to 40 containers an hour. </PARA>
<PARA>  These are the things that members of the rural sector are up against. Their town pharmacies are closing down. The pharmacy in Brewarrina could close down shortly and the locals will have to get their prescriptions sent down to Nyngan, which is 200 kilometres away. Yet greenies are running around the country shutting down forest industries and putting pressure on farmers who are clearing scrub, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA>  No-one in the Federal Government in Canberra seems to care about it. If farmers thought the Government was having a go and was fair dinkum, they might be able to put up with their situation; but they have had a gutful. I would like to record some of these points tonight so that honourable members can gain an insight into what is happening and therefore act on these matters. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Second to Mallee, as the honourable member for Mallee rightly says. Maranoa represents a large slice of Queensland. In fact, a flight from the eastern boundary to the western boundary of my electorate would be longer than a flight from Brisbane to Melbourne; it would end in Bass Strait. Flying the width of my electorate is like flying from Brisbane to Sydney. Within that large area lies the electorate of Maranoa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The area of my electorate is being ravaged not only by the policies of this Government but also by the worst drought in recorded history--since records commenced back in 1862. This drought has extended right into the city of Brisbane. Now the people of the cities are getting an understanding of what we have said for years and years: there are such things as droughts, and governments must show to those people affected by them some compassion and some understanding of what happens during a drought. </PARA>
<PARA>  But the policies of this Government are largely responsible for exacerbating the situation for many people in rural Australia. In the life of this Government we have seen record interest rates; they have been up for the longest period ever, which has led to our Australian dollar being overvalued. This Government has taxation policies which tax business inputs. What a ridiculous situation; what a ridiculous policy!  All these factors have combined to result in the lowest farm incomes ever. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was interested to hear the comment made last week by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) when he was in Europe on a bipartisan mission taking the Australian case to the GATT round. According to the Canberra Times of 3 October, he said:</PARA>

<PARA>People in Europe believed that the Minister must have left a nought off that figure of $A2,100. They thought he was joking. They would have expected $21,000, but not $2,100, with 45 per cent with negative incomes. These are the words of the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA>  I have listened recently to the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls). He came into the House during Question Time on 5 September and asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) a question. He was concerned about one of his constituents, a mango farmer whose name was Ray. Honourable members may remember the question. The honourable member for Kennedy said:</PARA>
<PARA>Farm incomes are down and his--</PARA>
<PARA>Ray's--</PARA>
<PARA>projected taxable income for this year is about $13,000. I ask: what would be the effect of a broad-based consumption tax for Ray?</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Kennedy should be telling Ray what the policies of this Government are doing to the mango farmer. This Government has a huge range of sneaky, hidden taxes. We on the Opposition benches know that the Government is not telling the public about them. Day after day, the Government is misleading the people of this House and the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us take the capital gains tax. The honourable member for Kennedy should be telling Ray, the mango farmer, that when he passes on and leaves his assets to his next of kin, the mango farm will come under the scrutiny of the capital gains tax. Capital gains tax is really a de facto death duty. The honourable member for Kennedy should also be telling Ray about the fringe benefits taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>  Consider also the fuel tax. We have a ridiculous situation with fuel tax which Ray, the mango farmer, could well be affected by. He could well have petrol driven machines working his mango farm which attract a fuel excise. He cannot get that tax off his business input at all. </PARA>

Just because a machine is driven by a differently powered engine, there is a different standard for rebates. Look at the ridiculous avgas excise. Last year an amount of $6.5m was paid in avgas excise by people in rural Australia with helicopters and aeroplanes which they use for mustering. They received no service for that tax they paid. If we want to apply the user pays principle, people who use a service should pay for it. But with these aeroplanes and helicopters, these producers pay that avgas cost and receive no service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Consider the sales tax on lubricants. The Minister did say in the March statement that such taxes would be removed. We have farmers facing the worst drought in living memory, facing the lowest net incomes ever, and we still have a sales tax on lubricants. The Government says it will remove these taxes, but still has not taken any action. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has also failed to remove tariffs on imported machinery parts. There are still machinery parts that Ray the mango farmer, to keep his machinery running efficiently, is paying a tariff on. What a ridiculous situation. That is what the honourable member for Kennedy should have said to Ray the mango farmer. He should be taking this message to his constituents, and I hope he sends them a copy of Hansard, because that is what he should be telling them. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government has attacked the productive sector of Australia with these sneaky, hidden taxes. Ray the mango farmer, just like every other Australian, has suffered nine years of hard labour. This Government has reduced the morale of all Australians. Imagine the morale of the one million people who are out of work today. The morale of the farmers and the people who live in the towns of my electorate is at an all time low. The people feel they have no hope. Whilst there is some assistance, it really is not going far enough to avert a potential disaster. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) has also come in here attacking our tax reform package. Our package will assist Australian farmers and Australian businesses. He was a part of the bipartisan mission to Europe to talk to the GATT negotiators only two weeks ago. He should be telling his constituents that this Government does not have effective countervailing duties. It is all very well to go to other countries and tell them what they should be doing, but we have to get our own house in order first. We need to make very sure that our own house is in order. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia is fast becoming the dumping ground for unwanted products from other countries. In the last 12 months $2 billion worth of foreign food imports were placed on our shores. None of these products were subjected to effective quarantine laws which would ensure that the quality was the same as our Australian quality; and they were certainly not subjected to effective anti-dumping and countervailing duties. A good example of that is the pork industry. Currently, Australia allows in pork from Canada. Effectively, to get pigs from Canada into the United States of America a countervailing duty is applied, not so in Australia. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I sympathise with my colleague the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) about the shortness of our remarks tonight. I suppose they are short in relation to the depth of the problems that exist in the rural areas of Australia that people such as the honourable member for Maranoa and I represent. Listening to this debate, which commenced earlier this afternoon, it has been fascinating to hear each of the speakers who have represented rural electorates talk about the state of the economy and the state of the society that exists in their electorates at the present time. My electorate is no different to many others. We are probably more fortunate in the sense that we have had more reasonable rains and, therefore, we are not suffering the drought conditions that some of the constituents of the honourable member for Maranoa would be experiencing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  My electorate is typical of most rural electorates in Australia today in that it is experiencing probably the worst economic and social times that anybody can recall in modern times. My memory goes back to the rural recession that took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s when sheep were commonly referred to as ground lice. At that time, farmers were going out the door very quickly. Of course, the difference between then and now is that in those days, when farmers and rural communities were doing it so tough, interest rates were only 7 or 8 per cent and, therefore, there was a greater capacity for farmers to withstand the onslaught of low commodity prices and poor seasons. In addition, there was a great deal of confidence amongst farmers back in the late 1960s and early 1970s that, whilst things were tough then, they would ultimately come good as they had done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, what is different between then and today is the fact that I have discovered that the confidence and morale levels of farmers are as low as they could possibly go. Many farmers that I speak to can see no end in sight to the depressed rural times. Many of them are convinced that this is the beginning of the end of rural industries as we have known them in the past. Many of them, because of advancing age--the average age of farmers being well in excess of 55 these days--are going to give up the fight and will not bother to face up to continuing bad times; they will throw the towel in and give the game away. Many farmers also look at the plight of younger entrants to the rural industries. They look at the future that confronts them with a great deal of dismay because they can see no great light shining for those people in the future to give them any sort of hope. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, whilst some of the problems of farmers are the direct consequence of low international commodity prices, and some are due to the current drought that prevails across a large section of Australia, a great deal of them have been imposed by policy decisions of this Government which have affected the rural industries particularly savagely. The recession we had to have, brought on by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), has hit the rural communities very savagely. High interest rates, which are a deliberate policy of this Government, have hit our farmers particularly badly. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have heard many examples of the high levels of debt that confront farmers today. I think the average debt for farmers would be somewhere in the order of $250,000. Farmers are still paying interest rates of around 16 to 18 per cent. They are not enjoying the 90-day bank bill rates that we see currently prevailing for people fortunate enough to be able to borrow at rates of about 9 per cent; farmers are still paying 16 to 18 per cent. It is that deliberate, high interest rate policy which has savagely attacked farmers. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition to that, this Government, having given us the recession we had to have, having given us extremely high interest rates, then gave us a Minister for Primary Industries and Energy who had no experience with rural industries and who had come from a sector of our society that could be described as the traditional enemy of farmers--the trade union movement. The current Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) is somebody who would have very little sympathy for or understanding of the plight of farmers. Indeed, many farmers saw the appointment of the current Minister as an attack on their own industries, something that would ultimately reduce their standing in the Cabinet and reduce their position overall. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a sad thing to realise that amongst the Cabinet members of this Government none has had any country experience whatsoever. None represents a country electorate. It is a very sad day indeed when the farmers and rural constituents of Australia understand that they have nobody sitting in that Cabinet room tonight who lives amongst them and who truly understands the problems that they confront today. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we look at the policies of this Government and realise the effects they have had on our Australia farmers, we can start to understand why farmers have so much dislike for the current Government. It is not just farmers, of course; it is people living in rural communities. My electorate, for example, has seen a dramatic increase in unemployment levels. In my home town of Young, there has been about a 50 per cent increase in unemployment numbers over the last 12 months. In Goulburn, there has been a 37 per cent increase in unemployment levels over the last 12 months. In the coastal area of my electorate there are now 5,700 people unemployed in Nowra and the surrounding district. That is nearly a doubling in the numbers of unemployed people over the last 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA>  All these communities depend on farmers for their income and all these communities have suffered tremendously as a result of this Government's policies. We also see the Government imposing difficulties upon our farming communities through such things as the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. This is a service which is being provided at great cost to our rural industries and is something that has nearly brought down one of the major employers in my electorate, the Cowra abattoir which employs several hundred people. Indeed, it is the biggest employer in Cowra. It came within a hair's breadth of closing down earlier this year because of the tremendous increase in costs that has been imposed on it by this Government through the provision of meat inspection services. That is just one example of the policies of this Government bringing a great deal of economic hardship to a community such as Cowra. </PARA>
<PARA>  In such a community we also see the Government's anti-dumping policies having a big impact on the horticultural industries--the vegetable and, in particular, the canned vegetable industries--which are being hit with subsidised imports without adequate anti-dumping provisions being available to those industries. This Government has also increased fuel excise over the past 8 1/2 years of its reign and this has brought great economic hardship to rural Australians. Today fuel excise is in excess of 30c a litre. When the Hawke Labor Government came to power, fuel excise was 6c a litre. </PARA>

It is that form of taxation which is biting very deeply into the pockets of farmers and people who live in rural areas today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government's failure to provide income equalisation deposits has also put farmers at a big disadvantage. The Government will regret its current reaction to the drought and its current drought aid, which is a reaction that is coming very slowly and is very inadequate. The fact that the Government is not addressing some of the major social welfare issues for rural communities in a way that ensures that farmers and other people living in rural communities have equal access to things such as Austudy, the family allowance, the family allowance supplement and the unemployment benefit is something of grave concern to all my constituents.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This evening I want to talk about the Estimates for the Department of Social Security and place that expenditure in a broader picture. I have been arguing in recent times that there is a need in Australia to reshape the general settlement which characterises the relationship between individuals and the State, between the people and their government. We need to redefine the role of government and we need to understand clearly what is expected of individuals, and individuals need to understand what they can expect from their governments. The tax and social security system that the present Government has developed while it has been in office is confusing, unfair and misdirected. It penalises those who aim to achieve self-reliance and it encourages others to interdependency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I think we need a tax and social security system that does not penalise those who take responsibility for their own expenditure; that recognises that all taxpayers should, according to their means, contribute to the cost of providing for the social expenditures required by the needy; that relieves the self-reliant of any tax burden which would otherwise be paid to fund those who could afford to be self-reliant but choose, for whatever reason, not to be so; that levies taxes on individuals on the basis of their capacity to pay, taking into account the extent to which they meet their own social expenditure responsibilities; and that builds capacity to pay taxes into the tax benchmark, rather than seeing them as a revenue forgone expense of government.</PARA>
<PARA>  Having made those general introductory remarks, I want to talk particularly about the interface between the developments that are occurring in superannuation and the social security pension. In superannuation we have a mishmash of arrangements. They can be identified by the fact that recent evidence has come to light that the Superannuation and Insurance Commissioner, charged with the implementation of retirement benefit limits, or RBLs, anticipated that he might get 200,000 people making inquiries. How many inquired? There have been over 400,000 inquiries. So there is a huge constituency of people involved in superannuation who sought information about their position, and it is not clear either that they understand the information that they are being given or even that the information is necessarily correct. </PARA>
<PARA>  This comes about because we have tax arrangements for employees who have employer support beyond award superannuation different from those that apply to employees with employer support limited only to their award superannuation; we have another tax regime affecting the self-employed and employees with no employer support; and we have a tax arrangement that applies to employers who make contributions to superannuation funds. Then we have another situation whereby the income of superannuation funds is subject to tax under a great variety of confusing arrangements, and then, when benefits are paid, often lump sum tax is paid also, under a whole range of confusing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that that whole mishmash should be abolished and the system totally reformed. I think it is very strange that we have in this country a situation where we provide a flat rate pension to those who reach retirement and satisfy an assets test and an income test--two tests that have become more and more confusing the longer the Hawke Government has remained in office; more and more punitive and more and more discouraging to those who would provide for their own retirement. But, if they qualify, they get a flat rate pension. We say, `Oh, we have an ageing population', and there is a huge expenditure there through the Department of Social Security because of the increasing numbers reliant on that full social security pension--and we keep it flat rate. In superannuation we have this confusing tax regime that I have just referred to, and we give tax benefits, rebates, concessions--tax sheltering--on an earnings related basis. </PARA>
<PARA>  The tax system in that regard favours the affluent and penalises the poor. That tax system is a regressive tax system, and there are a huge number of loopholes being increasingly taken advantage of by those who want to minimise the tax that they would pay. The whole system could be and should be simplified. A person who reaches 65 who is entitled to the full age pension because he or she satisfies the income or assets test is, in effect, given a government present that is worth between $75,000 and $100,000. It comes out of funds that he or she has probably contributed to during his or her working life by paying taxes over the years, and, although it is not funded, that contribution can properly be regarded as having been made under a pay as you go system. </PARA>
<PARA>  The indexed pension that is payable to a married man or woman at the age of 65 could be purchased from a life insurance superannuation company or society for approximately three times average weekly earnings. That is the reward that is given for having paid taxes. Why do we not acknowledge that that is what is needed to fund a modest level of income on which people can retire and live in some reasonable and dignified comfort? Having acknowledged that, why do we not say that everyone will be entitled to it?</PARA>
<PARA>  In this computer age those people who want to provide for themselves and get tax benefits should be entitled to three times average weekly earnings--or whatever the value of that pension is--in the form of tax deductions or tax rebates over their working lives. One would have to work out the discounted cash flow value of taking those rebates early rather than taking them late. People who provide for themselves should get no more and no less in benefit and value through the taxed social security system than those who draw directly on the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA>  That would make a huge difference. It would need a phase-in process, but I believe that it could be phased-in as we have done with a lot of other sensible reforms. We would say to people, `Yes, we hope that you will provide for your own retirement. We will encourage you to do that by recognising that if you didn't save you would get the age pension but, if you do save, you can draw those tax rebates into your superannuation fund'. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have said before in this House that it is becoming a matter of increasing concern to retirees and to those saving for their retirement that their funds are being conscripted into superannuation funds which are selected for them by their employers and by their unions. Australians want to be able to invest their own superannuation savings. They should be entitled to do so. The only obligation that they should be called upon by the Government to give is to guarantee that when they reach retirement they will have those resources available to provide them with a stream of income or the assets that will purchase that stream of income. That could be done by enabling average Australians to take out their own money, invest it where they want to and purchase from an insurance company what I would describe as a performance bond.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --Mr Deputy Chairman, you would know that this Budget allows for a significant increase in outlays in the social security portfolio. You would probably also know that there can be no satisfaction in an increasing social welfare Budget. It is a clear indication of failure and a clear indication that more people are being driven into poverty and forced into the welfare net.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Actual expenditure on social security in the last Budget was some $24.67 billion as against $23.7 billion in 1990-91. The 1991-92 forecast is for total outlays to rise to $28.9 billion--a rise of 14.4 per cent over the coming year. Spending on administration is up to 13 per cent higher to $866m and average staffing levels within the Department have increased by 1,745 to 19,070. </PARA>
<PARA>  Social security now represents some 27.7 per cent of total Commonwealth outlays--almost three times the size of defence--and is the largest spending portfolio, including the Treasury portfolio, which includes payments of billions of dollars to the States. The Budget forecasts an average unemployment rate for 1991-92 of 10.5 per cent. We know that this represents about 880,000 unemployed Australians through the coming year. We know at present that the figure is estimated to be one million and possibly higher through the hidden unemployed. Of course, precisely how this translates to average numbers on the unemployment benefit lists throughout 1991-92 is unclear, although expenditure on unemployment payments is forecast to be $6.8 billion, up from $4.56 billion last year. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also remind the House that the previous Budget contained a proposal to impose an assets test on the family allowance of $300,000. As a result of protests throughout the Australian electorate, this figure was subsequently raised by the Government to $500,000, but to no avail as this initiative was defeated by the Opposition in the Senate. But the ideologues have finally got their way. This Budget tells us that from 1 January 1992 there will be a net assets test of $600,000, beyond which point the family allowance entitlement cuts out altogether. Excluded from the definition of assets are the family home, curtilage and any debts. </PARA>
<PARA>  Hardship provisions have also been introduced for two years for families excluded as a result of the assets test. I acknowledge that this again is a significant change from the last Budget. However, two conditions are attached to the entitlement for family allowance under the hardship provisions: firstly, the current year's estimated taxable income must be below the annual married pension rate of $13,078, plus $624 per annum for each dependent child; and, secondly, the family has less than $6,000 for a single person or $10,000 for a couple in available funds. The family allowance hardship provisions, which will also apply for two years, will be introduced to the existing family allowance supplement assets test which currently stands at $347,500 in net assets. Further, families with net assets below $600,000, but above the family allowance supplement threshold, will become eligible for a family allowance supplement if they meet the above hardship conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>  The hardship provisions for both allowances will mean that many of those who are income poor but asset rich, particularly when those assets are not presently realisable at their current valuation, will not be deprived of the family allowance or the family allowance supplement. However, an assets test would still require current valuations which in the case of farm assets are almost impossible to determine accurately, given present market conditions. It is therefore not clear that this latest assets test proposal will be workable until asset prices, particularly rural assets, can be adequately valued. </PARA>
<PARA>  The family income supplement threshold is to be raised from $18,000 to $19,300, at a cost of $90.2m in its first year. I also acknowledge that this measure will allow many low income working families to receive extra income support to reduce the likelihood that they would be better off relying solely on government income support rather than being in paid employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this very short debate tonight on social security, I wish to mention the special benefits that are being made available to 16- to 20-year-olds from low income families who are experiencing hardship during the education leavers deferment period. Claimants for either Job Search or sickness allowance who are single, have no dependants and are under 21 years of age must currently wait 13 weeks before becoming eligible for either of those two payments. From 1 October 1991, 16- to 20-year-olds experiencing hardship and who are from low income families have become eligible to apply for special benefits during the 13-week period. </PARA>
<PARA>  While I have acknowledged and, where appropriate, supported some of the Budget changes, I wish to make a number of brief comments about how the system affects many of my constituents in Mallee. Any application of the asset test at this time of economic depression is a farce. Farms and many businesses cannot be sold, there are no cash flows, and many families are even having difficulty putting food on the table. The continuing inequalities and welfare gaps make a mockery of social justice policies and the social justice claims of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  Earlier this evening in my previous contribution to this primary industry debate, I spoke of the huge debts of many farming families who are being assisted at present by rural counsellors. The average debt of those who have made inquiries to and are being assisted by these counsellors is $267,370. These hardship provisions must at this time be allowed to override any asset test guidelines. The only realistic test that can be made at this point surely is an income test. The welfare gap must be addressed to ensure that asset test and work test applications do not exclude self-employed people in serious financial and social conditions the opportunity to participate either in the unemployment benefits system or Job Search program. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Deputy Chairman, I know that you will allow me to breach procedures somewhat here to briefly mention one change in Austudy that concerns me and that is linked very much to the asset test as it is applied through the social security system. I refer to Austudy changes that were announced in the Budget which I believe will have a devastating effect on some country families, particularly those with more than one child in full time study. I have made some calculations which indicate that there are some students over 18 years of age living away from home attending tertiary institutions who will lose, as a result of these Budget changes to Austudy, some $40 per week and for many others, depending on family income, up to $16 to $17 per week. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is obvious that these radical changes have been made because the Federal Government is strapped for cash and has directed its priorities away from so-called middle income families to the increasing number of low income people. This change may be justified because of the increasing unemployment and the drop in living standards. However, it should be recognised that in rural communities young people have no local access to tertiary education and must live away from home at a huge cost. There are still many major anomalies in both the social security and education policies and they should be addressed in the interests of fairness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to make a further contribution to this debate. A few minutes ago I was saying that there is an increasing demand by people approaching retirement who are making provision for their retirement years through superannuation to have more control over where those funds are invested. I think that the choices should be expanded so that people can have individual superannuation accounts, that the investment can be of their choosing--subject to satisfactory prudential standards and subject to a performance bond from some registered financial institution whose bond is acceptable to the Government that gives an assurance that when that person reaches retirement age the funds will be there to meet the pension requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We are already doing that sort of thing with roll-over funds. It should come down to the contributions that are being made by 25- to 35-year olds so that they can have some say in where those funds are being invested. The funds may well be suitably invested on their family homes. There is evidence that says that the greatest protection for the majority of Australian citizens as they approach retirement age is the ownership of their own homes. As more and more of their effective income is being siphoned off into superannuation funds that do not necessarily invest in housing, it is becoming more and more difficult for people to make that purchase of that particular asset which will give them some safety and security when they do reach retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to have a total rethink in this area. I was interested to read of new ideas that are being introduced in this regard. The banking industry is particularly concerned, to some degree out of self-interest. In this quarter's publication by the National Australia Bank there is an article entitled `Superannuation: trends in savings and investment'. It opened up by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>  Tax incentives and the inclusion of superannuation benefits in industrial awards are resulting in strong growth in superannuation savings. Indeed, even before award based superannuation became widespread, superannuation assets were the fastest growing component of financial asset holdings of households. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>  Contributions to and interest on life and superannuation assets have fully accounted for household savings in recent years, with other household savings--</PARA>
<PARA>which include bank deposits--</PARA>
<PARA>being negative. </PARA>
<PARA>It says, as we all know, that in the coming decade the growth in superannuation assets will continue at at least the rate at which it has been proceeding in recent times. There is an expectation by many experts that by the year 2000 the superannuation funds will be responsible for the investment, and management of the investment, of some $600 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is having a serious effect on the banking industry, so what has the banking industry done? It has looked at the United States and it has looked at the United Kingdom. It has found that the United States has an individual retirement account system--an IRA system--where individuals can have bank accounts in certain qualified banks, into which they pay their retirement savings and have a degree of control over those savings. The banks have to satisfy certain requirements to ensure that the savings will be available for retirement and, of course, the deposits go into the banking industry. The banks are suggesting that we should do that here. I think it is a good idea--it is a step in the right direction--but it does not broaden the freedom of choice as to investment nearly as far as I believe we should go. </PARA>
<PARA>  If one then turns to the United Kingdom one finds that the banking industry there has TESSA accounts--tax exempt special savings accounts--which were introduced on 1 January 1991 to encourage long term savings through tax relief on interest earned. That is a similar idea, motivated by a banking industry which wants to recapture some of the community savings that have been moving into the long term savings superannuation area. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is all right for the banking industry, but I do not believe that those savings should be the captive either of the superannuation funds and their managers or of the banks and their managers. They should be able to offer those funds, but individual Australians should be able to have individual accounts and determine whether they invest their retirement savings in their own houses, a holiday cottage, shares, fixed interest securities or unit trusts of one kind or another. That is provided that a financial institution is prepared to give a guarantee or performance bond and--to the extent of the tax sheltering that we offer today, and would offer if my more radical and far more rational proposal were to be adopted--that tax sheltering was protected and, therefore, the provision of a stream of income in retirement. Then the Government could deal with those institutions that could give those guarantees, in much the same way as we now rely on the superannuation funds and their managers in the expectation that those funds will be able to deliver assets that can support a stream of income for the superannuants when they do retire. </PARA>
<PARA>  That, of course, raises another question as to the extent to which people's expectations will be realised as a result of a significant proportion of their income--their real remuneration package--being put into superannuation funds. In that regard one needs to be asking proper questions about the appropriate level of prudential supervision with regard to the community's long term savings. </PARA>
<PARA>  The two points I want to emphasise tonight are, firstly, that all people should be entitled either to tax rebates over their working lives that encourage them to put savings aside into long term savings vehicles so that those savings are available for their retirement, or to a pension, the capital value of which, as I mentioned, is about three times average weekly earnings. The tax rebates should be equal in value to the pension. People should get one or the other but not both. If they get part of one and part of the other, the entitlement should be equal. There should be no bias one way or the other. </PARA>
<PARA>  In that way, we could do away with the complex network of tax that applies to superannuation funds, to contributions, to the income derived from them and to the benefits paid out. We could do away with the assets and incomes test and all the ancillary tests that relate to different types of investment and savings, as they are reflected through the assets test. We could do away with the complex arrangements within the income tax system that tax pensioners at different rates and have very high marginal tax rates for those who then cease to be entitled to age pensioner taxation relief. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second point I want to emphasise is that Australians are intelligent. They want to be able to run their own lives. They want to be able to deal with their own long term savings and to be responsible for them. The Government should say, `We expect you to provide for your retirement in a way that assures you of a stream of income in retirement. Provided you satisfy those requirements, you should be able to make your own choices as to where you invest your own savings--whether in your own house, your holiday house or an investment portfolio of your own choosing'. </PARA>
<PARA>  We must move to a situation where people are encouraged and rewarded for being self-reliant rather than one where we penalise those who make those endeavours and reward those who do not attempt to do that and who rely on others to cross-subsidise them in their retirement even, when they could have afforded to have made provision for their own retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In speaking to these estimates, because of the time constraints and as I will be addressing some matters on disability services tomorrow in a notice of motion, I thought I would centre my remarks around the age care section, residential and HACC programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  When talking in terms of aged care, of course, one is talking basically of residential and home care. I will address some comments to various aspects of it. The functions within the Budget made changes in respect of hostels, particularly in the restructuring of hostel subsidies, whereby under the new restructured personal care subsidy arrangements that will be implemented as from April next year, three levels of personal care funding are provided for. Those arrangements will provide for increased funding for very frail residents and those suffering from dementia. By that time we will be having a GAT assessment not only for nursing homes but also for hostels. </PARA>
<PARA>  The three levels that attract subsidies are the top level of basically 10 per cent of residents, which will be at $28.85 per day; the intermediate level, which will attract a subsidy of $26.20; and the lower level, which will attract a subsidy of $23.55. I express concern for those hostels around Australia that have been receiving dementia grants and have tailored their arrangements to the care of dementia patients. This program means that the subsidy they were enjoying previously under that grant of $30 will be diminished to the top level of $28.85, so there will be a diminution of care. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) is in the chamber, and he probably knows what I am talking about when I refer to some of those special dementia units which have been operating over the last few years. They have been operating at a loss even in spite of that subsidy, and they have been drawing on their State governments for subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA>  The one I am referring to basically is the Lefroy special hostel for ambulant dementia sufferers. I was at the residence about six weeks ago and I was shown figures that that hostel had been keeping for the last three years, indicating that if some of these dementia patients had gone into a nursing care situation or into any other care, they would have incurred Commonwealth expenditure to a far greater extent than under the hostel's own program. As I said, even at $30 a day the hostel was getting a grant from the Western Australian Government. I think it was a three-year grant. As I understand it, that grant finishes this year and in view of the pull back or the drawback of the subsidy, establishments such as Lefroy do have a funding problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  I know the Minister is aware of the hostel; I know he is aware of the program. I would just ask him what the situation will be in the event of these figures showing a massive loss. I think it is about a 40-bed hostel, and such a loss would mean it would be financially embarrassed. The establishment itself is part of a wider Anglican care of the aged in Western Australia. I know that it will be looked at very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has been a reduction in the percentage of the population over age 70 who will not be accommodated in hostels. It has been reduced from the figure of 60 in every 1,000 to 50. Funds are intended to be put into the home and community care program. We will be looking, with a certain amount of interest, to see whether that happens. The HACC programs are at the moment basically underfunded, from what I hear from the States. I am not sure that is the correct way to assess such a situation, but that is the situation there. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Reduced to 55; sorry. So we will be looking very carefully at that. I will now deal with the nursing home aspect and the CAM funding system. It has been reviewed to the extent that there is to be a discount on the CAM standard hourly rate of one per cent. That will put pressure on nursing staff already stressed under the current arrangements. The withdrawal of that one per cent could have some effect on the funding arrangements and also, unfortunately, on the quality of care along the way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I will now deal with the resident classification instrument, which has been reviewed and, as I understand it, is undergoing further trials before it is phased in from April 1992. A lot of concern has been expressed to me about the amount of nursing time which goes into this assessment. I can understand that, for accountability reasons, it is necessary for a person to be assessed properly, but I get the feeling, from speaking to directors of nursing right around Australia, that the amount of time involved in the resident classification instrument means that precious hours are being taken up which could be better utilised to enhance the quality of care. As I have said, I can understand the need for accountability but, in some ways, the nursing staff do regard this as a further harassment from the point of view that some of these requirements are just a little over-exaggerated as far as staff needs are concerned. I do hope that when that review comes out some concern will be shown for those people. </PARA>
<PARA>  There have also been changes to infrastructure funding. When indexing SAM for 1992-93 and thereafter, it will be varied for changes in the average Australia-wide occupancy over the last 12-monthly period for which figures are available and also for changes in average dependency. For many years, charitable and benevolent organisations have received capital grants to assist them to build new nursing homes or rebuild existing homes. Proprietors who did not receive capital grants will now receive supplementary recurrent funding for 10 years for new homes. </PARA>
<PARA>  Remote homes, whose infrastructure costs are substantially higher because of their location, will receive additional funding of approximately $3 per resident per day as from 1 May 1992. The Opposition wholeheartedly endorses that extra funding for those people in remote areas because they suffer additional costs which are not really understood by those people living in capital city areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  The problem we have with the alterations to the SAM is that, although there is a review still going on, some changes have been made. As far as the people in the nursing home industry are concerned, the SAM component is woefully short of what is required of it. Again, I believe it is up to the industry people who feel that the SAM funding is short of what it should be--bearing in mind all of the considerations--to keep the pressure on the Government to ensure that the SAM review is completed properly. There are also revised CAM acquittals. As I understand it, this means that these will be made every quarter instead of every 12 months in order to ensure that those excess funds are repaid on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to mention another aspect of the HACC program and also the need to have proper distribution of those funds. In Queensland, we recently regionalised 13 areas through the Health Department. These are autonomous areas which are not only distributing funds for hospitals, but also distributing some funds which are provided by the Commonwealth--namely, GAT and the HACC. I have been looking very carefully at these health regions because, depending on the manner in which the regional administrators go about their duties, I would like to make sure that the funds can be applied properly, because it is an avenue under devolution. I would like to make sure that some of those funds which the Commonwealth distributes also go to those regions. I hasten to add, in connection with the HACC program, that I hope that these funds will be applied as they have been in the past. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to direct my comments this evening towards the housing component of the Health, Housing and Community Services portfolio. Housing accounts for nearly $1.3 billion of the 1991-92 budget for this portfolio. Of this, just over $1 billion is earmarked to meet Commonwealth-State housing agreement commitments. The remainder will be directed towards such programs as the national housing strategy, the building better cities program, the housing cost reduction program and the housing industry development strategy. A proportion will also fund staffing and administration of the Housing Services Division. By far the largest amount of the housing budget, apart from the Commonwealth-State housing agreement funds, will be spent on the building better cities program--$56m in this financial year. It is interesting to note that this $56m is only the first instalment of an $815m allocation which has been promised by the Government over the next five years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As I understand it, the better cities program is aimed at reshaping Australian cities and, in particular, containing urban sprawl. The program is intended to bring together Commonwealth, State and local governments to develop ways to improve the quality of life of the citizens in our cities. There is no doubt that there are problems within our cities. Urban sprawl, resulting from continual development and expansion of the suburban fringes, has created both social and economic problems. For many Australian families, the outer city suburbs are the only place where they can afford to buy a home. Unfortunately, however, this affordability often comes at the cost of isolation from their family and social support networks. Their feeling of isolation is compounded by the limited health and medical facilities, education services, child-care and other community facilities located in these regions. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are difficulties for the breadwinner, too. The growing city boundaries mean that they are frequently required to travel long distances to the major employment centres, often on poorly developed and inefficient transport links. In economic terms, the growing urban sprawl and provision of associated infrastructure is expensive. For example, it currently costs around $60,000 per block to develop land in the southern and western suburbs of Sydney, including the provision of infrastructure and community facilities. In Melbourne the cost is around $52,000; in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, land development costs are around $47,000. If we take development costs on their own, which include water, sewerage, drainage, roads and electricity, for an average suburban block in Sydney the cost is nearly $40,000. </PARA>
<PARA>  But, having recognised that problems do exist, the better cities program is not the most appropriate way of addressing them. For a start, the program is vague and it lacks direction. There is no clear set of program objectives or perceived outcomes. Rather, as the Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA>The focus will be on areas where a package of related urban development projects in infrastructure, service provision and improved Government processes can be identified and agreed upon. </PARA>
<PARA>Government will also ensure that programs are implemented so as to protect, and where appropriate, enhance the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>The actual programs will vary according to each geographical area, but might involve urban consolidation and improved public transport. </PARA>
<PARA>But what does all this mean? More roads and schools, better sewerage and electricity services or, given that a program objective is to enhance the environment, more parks and gardens? Alternatively, are we talking about new initiatives which will slash the cost of housing, thereby increasing its affordability to ordinary Australians?</PARA>
<PARA>  The better cities program is also somewhat patronising. Just like the Whitlam Government before it, the Hawke Government has developed its own idea of model urban life and is seeking to inflict that model on the community by approving only those projects which meet its own objectives. Effectively, the Government is removing the choice from housing and dictating not only the location, style, cost and surroundings of our houses, but also the social mix of people who will live there. The market and market preferences of the community have been completely overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA>  But the most fundamental failure of the better cities program is that it does not address the underlying problem of our cities and, in turn, the major reasons for the growing urban sprawl. In fact, it illustrates succinctly this Government's tendency to tinker about the edges of a problem rather than to get to the heart of it. The better cities program will fail to get people back into our cities to utilise the existing infrastructure, including transport networks, health and education services, power, water and sewerage. Instead, it will plough money into duplicating existing services, relocating them a few kilometres down the road in a way that conforms to the Government's designer city plan. </PARA>
<PARA>  Essentially, the program has failed to tackle the major regulatory impediments to urban redevelopment, such as zoning, planning density requirements and planning approval delays. Furthermore, the Government has overlooked the need to encourage local councils to offer more flexibility in developments by increasing planning densities and providing for more flexible design, boundary setbacks and more rapid approval times. It is this lack of negotiation at the local council level and the consequent failure to tackle these issues that has led to the continual expansion of our cities' boundaries. If there was more talking between the two levels of government, it is quite possible that the accelerated reductions in building and planning regulations and better density planning and mixes would have already been put in place, resulting in better housing affordability, a slowdown in the rate of urban expansion and a better utilisation of our inner city areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, one can ask whether, in ignoring the fundamental problems of planning densities and approval times, the Government is concentrating its efforts on a few carefully selected areas for its own political expediency. An education and awareness program about different housing alternatives is also omitted from the Government's housing initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note that a recent survey found that 70 per cent of respondents thought that the only alternative to a house was a high-rise flat. There was little awareness of other housing options, including courtyard homes, townhouses, cottages and villas. Likewise, many in the community regard high density housing as being high-rise flats. Again, they are not aware of the very stylish yet affordable townhouse and villa unit developments available. This indicates a pressing need for a sound and practical education program about the different types of housing and the implications of those developments on existing property values. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australians must also acknowledge that housing types exist well beyond the three-bedroom brick veneer home on a quarter acre block. New and innovative housing developments are making better and more efficient use of land. Developers are getting more dwellings to the hectare while at the same time giving consumers greater product choice. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important to note that these new developments do not necessarily mean smaller houses or noticeably smaller blocks. Placing stormwater drains down one side of the road or down the middle of the road, shared trenches for telephone, power, sewerage and water and reduced road widths and reduced road reserves all result in more efficient use of land and lower council maintenance costs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Likewise, the way in which dwellings are placed on the block can be an effective means of better utilising land. These developments, demonstrated most effectively by the Green Street joint venture, will result in significantly lower housing costs and, to a large extent, will also curtail the urban sprawl without compromising the appearance and style of the house or the suburb. Indeed, the Green Street joint venture has demonstrated that, by adopting new practices, developers can save up to $7,000 per block, or 20 per cent of the development cost per block. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, the key to achieving the maximum benefit from all these approaches lies with educating local councils about the social and economic benefits which can be derived from planning schemes and the density coding that will allow greater product choice; educating the community about housing options and choices available; and educating developers regarding ways to best utilise land. The irony is that, if this Government had looked at some of the alternatives I have just outlined, such as tackling the planning and design constraints, reducing regulation and conducting an enhanced education and awareness campaign, programs such as the better cities program would not be needed, thus saving the taxpayers $815m. </PARA>

<PARA>  (1) Approximately 1 800 tonnes are used in service and repair of mobile air conditioners and 2,500 tonnes used in service and repair of stationary refrigerators and air conditioners across all sectors. It is not documented what proportion of this use is accounted for by leakage.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Yes. The Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) Strategy for Ozone Protection was sent to Commonwealth Ministers in 1989. The Strategy is a public planning document aimed at achieving a rapid phaseout of ozone depleting substances. It highlights the need for improved design and operating procedures of commercial and industrial air conditioning and refrigeration systems. The use of leak detection systems for the reduction of CFC emissions is detailed in the document.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Strategy recommended the adoption of a Government approved, industry Code of Practice covering system design to reduce loss of refrigerant during operation and servicing. In March 1990 ANZECC endorsed the Code of Good Practice for the Reduction of Emissions of CFC 11 and CFC 12 in Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Applications. The Code recommends the installation of suitable sensing and alarm systems where CFCs are used.</PARA>
