<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The purpose of the Albury-Wodonga Development Amendment Bill 1991 is to place a chief executive officer on the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation and give effect to an agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria. The Bill gives effect to aspects of a range of reforms to the Albury-Wodonga project. I have mentioned some of them. Most of the Bill is devoted to amending the Corporation's membership and introducing arrangements to separate the responsibilities of the board and the staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill replaces the full time chairperson and two deputy chairperson positions with part time equivalents and transfers responsibility for day-to-day management to the Corporation's most senior staff member. Local government representation on the Corporation is changed from the mayors of Albury and Wodonga to a representative of each of those councils. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will enable the Commonwealth and State Albury-Wodonga corporations to produce one annual report instead of three, or one for each government. This aspect will involve some saving of time and expense. Provision is being made for Corporation staff to have reciprocal mobility rights with the Australian Public Service and other statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> On 23 October 1973 the then Prime Minister and Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria signed the Albury-Wodonga development agreement. The objects of the agreement are contained in the preamble to the agreement, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the intentions of the three Governments are-that a development Corporation will bring about in the Area (Albury-Wodonga), by the development of a growth complex, the creation of a city with a high quality of environment, appropriately planned and developed having full regard to human requirements and the involvement of the public; and that the development corporation will involve, as far as possible, the established Australian, State and local government authorities in the development of the growth complex. </PARA>
<PARA>The development of Albury-Wodonga was an element of the Whitlam Government's decentralisation policy. On 21 January 1974 the Albury-Wodonga Area Development Act 1973, which gave effect in Commonwealth law to the agreement, was proclaimed. Complementary State legislation established separate New South Wales and Victorian development corporations. The three corporations act as one integrated entity. The Corporation is responsible to the Ministerial Council on the Development of Albury-Wodonga, which comprises the Commonwealth Minister for Local Government, the New South Wales Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs and the Victorian Minister for Industry and Economic Planning. The main function of the Ministerial Council is to supervise the development of Albury-Wodonga. In addition, the Ministerial Council has the power to give direction to the Corporation on how it performs its functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The functions of the Corporation include carrying out and supervising certain developmental works, negotiating within the Commonwealth, State and local government authorities for the purpose of arranging or providing services and facilities to Albury-Wodonga, and creating job opportunities by encouraging the setting up of industries and other investments in Albury-Wodonga. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 the Ministerial Council established a review committee to examine and report on the role and structure of the Corporation. The report of the review committee, which was presented to the Ministerial Council in 1989 and approved by it on 8 June 1989, is the origin of the amendments proposed in this Bill. In the next 12 months the Corporation is to undergo a period of change on the basis of a revised mission statement to facilitate the continued growth of Albury-Wodonga in cooperation with Commonwealth, State, local government and community agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation's new goals will be to contribute to the physical, economic and social planning of Albury-Wodonga, in partnership with local government and the community; to promote Albury-Wodonga in cooperation with appropriate agencies; and to develop and market Corporation landholdings. An Albury-Wodonga Regional Planning Committee will be established to overview and coordinate the preparation of a regional plan covering physical and social planning in AlburyWodonga. The Committee will review the physical plan of Albury-Wodonga and, once agreement has been reached on the revisions to the plan, amendments to legislation and planning are to be arranged and the Corporation will relinquish its local planning powers. </PARA>
<PARA> The social service program delivery becomes the responsibility of local government and the community. The financial operations of the Corporation are to be improved through the adoption of more commercial practices. The membership of the Corporation will be restructured to comprise a part time chairperson nominated by the Commonwealth, two part time State-nominated deputy chairpersons, and two regional members, one from each State, agreed by the Commonwealth and States. </PARA>
<PARA> It is our intention to move an in-principle amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. I therefore move:</PARA>
<PARA>That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the functions of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation should be phased out as soon as practicable, but notes that the Bill does not provide for this''. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make a few general comments in connection with Albury-Wodonga and the development centre concept, which as I understand it was the brainchild of Tom Uren in his time in the Whitlam Ministry. At that time other development centres were planned, and I believe it was a great concept. However, the present situation with Albury-Wodonga seems to be a stalemate and the great precepts and thoughts of Tom Uren have not been fulfilled. I make these general comments in relation to regional Australia, which is losing services and population to the more densely populated capital cities and provincial towns. I am not blaming the government of the day for this, but the methods by which commerce is now transacted by these statutory authorities mean in so many cases that it is okay to be small, it is okay to be big, but if a town is in between it is going to suffer. I am talking about population and regional numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate of Dawson in Queensland over a period of many years I have seen the statutory authorities and government instrumentalities gradually reduce services and direct them to larger centres or back to capital cities. One example that comes to mind is the current plan of the Federal Airports Corporation to bring centralised pilot supervision and radar control under the auspices of either Brisbane or Melbourne. We cannot say that that is decentralisation in any great way, particularly when we consider that Sydney, with its third airport, would demand some sort of attention. However, it means that much of the growing airport tourist traffic throughout Australia, where it is being sought, will not have the necessary services. </PARA>
<PARA> I can also talk in terms of Telecom: once there were local operators and local personnel who could give advice. Now someone in Mackay probably gets wake-up calls from some centre in Brisbane, the people who give directory advice are from Townsville, and the whole thing has been depersonalised to a great extent. Telecom itself is now saying that it is going to reduce its regional area work force and these services will go down to Brisbane or somewhere like that, where, at the expense of a telephone call, we can check with somebody about our account or something like that. It is most impersonal in its own way. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia Post is a great example of services being diminished. Post offices have actually been closed out in the country. This is where the population and the productivity of Australia is dependent; yet we are moving these services away. There has often been talk about the decentralisation of the Australian Taxation Office. Every time we get a talk about decentralisation, the next rumour is that the local branch of one's own office is to be closed. Anyway, the Office always says that it cannot give us the advice we want and that we might as well go elsewhere in any case. In the case of Mackay, it was only last week or the week before that I had to take some constituents to Townsville to talk to the Tax Office about a very personal matter. That could have been handled in the city.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Could I talk about my old favourite, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)? On a local basis, it is a great representative of the people, but its services are being diminished. Every time the ABC wants to make a cut, we can be guaranteed that it is in regional Australia. Once we used to be able to get a local television news program. Now we might get a mix of news in the State news, but that is as much contact as the ABC has. The latest talk is that the rural officers in country Australia could be at risk of being withdrawn to capital cities in order to maintain the service out of one centre instead of out the region, in which they should be properly operating. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members would be aware that a few years ago the Australian Electoral Commission was going to centralise all its computers out of two or three places in Queensland. I suppose that this would have gone for the rest of Australia. The returning officers were not going to be resident within their own electorates. Fortunately, that theory seems to have gone out, but the risk was always there. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention television aggregation. It was undertaken with great gusto by this Government and at the moment some places have three commercial channels. One of them is not giving any local content at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Steadily going broke. Most of them are operating through receivers at this stage, but that is the risk they took before. Outside of provincial cities, that aggregation does not yet work. We have had the famous classic of one commercial television station operating the pick programs up to 31 December. When I say the `pick programs', I mean the ones that take the rugby league, the cricket and things like that. Now we are bound to find out that the one that is not giving the particular service to country Australia is the one that takes the popular programs. Aggregation at this stage is a failure because many of the channels are not operating in some areas and they are not broadcasting local news.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also point out the situation that exists, as I understand it, in the United States. The United States has deliberately taken its high-tech industries and other industries to the place where people are. It takes them out of the capitals. It takes them into the country. It takes them where the quality of life is better. The industries perform their manufacturing tasks out in the country. Country areas that once used to produce the primary industries are now out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, it seems, rural and primary industries are being deliberately closed down and, on the other hand, the drift to the provincial cities and capital cities is being allowed to proceed on the basis that that is the only way to get the attention and the services that are required. So I think there is a need for the Albury-Wodongas. There is a need for a commitment by this Government and this Parliament to saying that there is something worth while out in the country and the provincial areas, and to trying to maintain the population in the place where the quality of life is far superior to what it is in the cities, but where the services applied by both State and Federal governments are not available. </PARA>
<PARA> I just want to give one other example at a local level of the centralisation of health services. At the moment Queensland is in a situation where the Department of Health is saying that the State should regionalise its ambulance services. There is one thing that is predominant in any community in Queensland, and that is the respect for the QATB, the Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade. It has the highest respect because it belongs to the community, and in this era when the Government is giving fewer funds to such services, it is absolutely essential that the QATB maintain that local contact in order that it can bring in the funds required to provide its services. There was the example the other day of an accident which would have been within the Mackay region being directed first I think to Brisbane, then to Rockhampton, and then to Mackay so that the location could be pinpointed. </PARA>
<PARA> If decentralisation does not exist and if we continue to centralise out of the major interest areas, what we will see is a greater drift to the cities and to the slums of the capitals. I suggest that there are many ways in which a government, through its instrumentalities, can provide those services in country areas. I ask that the responsible Minister look afresh at some of the benefits to be derived from decentralisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation, the Albury-Wodonga Development Amendment Bill 1991, contains what I consider to be some very realistic and appropriate proposals which rightly place some of the functions essentially of local government back in the hands of local government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As was pointed out by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) in his contribution, the genesis of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation, and the entire concept of regional development in Australia, came as a result of initiatives displayed by a former Labor government. Generally the credit for that must go to a former Minister of this place, Tom Uren, and the former Department of Urban and Regional Development, which was established under his stewardship during the term of the Whitlam Government. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time the concept of having regional centres of considerable population developed around Australia was appropriate for the times, and I believe that it is still an appropriate policy that governments should be pursuing. I would like to spend some time looking at the genesis of that, and to bring it back particularly to the legislation as we have it today, because there have been substantive and substantial changes in State government planning legislation, in local government legislative changes, and in the approach by local government in getting into a range of development opportunities which are appropriate for this legislation to address, and which have in fact been so addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the proposals that were put forward back in the 1970s by the Whitlam Government, and particularly, as I have indicated, by Tom Uren, three major centres were designated for development under this concept of regional decentralisation. The reason for that was that the phenomenon of urban drift to the cities was certainly very recognisable in the early 1970s. That phenomenon occurs basically when rural people, for a variety of reasons-often because of a lack of job opportunities or because younger people receiving better education decide that country life is not for them-want to move to the attractions of the big smoke and so on. There was a constant stream of people out of regional areas around Australia into the capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to stem to some degree, or to provide the opportunity to stem to some degree, that flow of people into the cities, the concept of a series of major regional centres was developed. Those three regional centres were, firstly, Campbelltown-Macarthur; secondly, Bathurst-Orange; and, thirdly, Albury-Wodonga. The concept involved in developing this corporation style arrangement, whereby Commonwealth Government funding was placed in a pool along with assistance from State governments, was that the responsibility for planning initiatives, for social initiatives and for a range of development activities was given to the development corporation in each of those centres. At the time it probably was appropriate and a good stimulus to development there for the simple reason, of course, that there were guarantees of Commonwealth funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Progressively over time what has happened though is, while the concept of the development of those three centres has remained, the ability and the desire of various Commonwealth governments to put funding into those particular areas on a tied grants basis has diminished quite considerably. In fact, what we find now is that moneys being directed in Albury-Wodonga, Bathurst-Orange or, indeed, in the Macarthur region have generally come from the Commonwealth but as part of global funding arrangements through the local government portfolio of the Minister for Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Mrs Fatin), who has been seated at the table during the course of this debate, through the housing portfolio or through a variety of community service portfolio responsibilities and so on in a general sense, without specifically going to certain parts of the region. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Albury-Wodonga, we saw a unique concept as well inasmuch as it involved two States: it involved the development of Albury in New South Wales and Wodonga in Victoria. So we had a unique arrangement there where two States had to cooperate with the Federal Government to ensure that development opportunities were equally distributed on both sides of the border-that border of course being the Murray River. As was always the case with these regional centres, the concept of providing additional stimuli to the development of those areas often fell, in fact, to the State governments. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall quite vividly in the case of the Orange-Bathurst growth area that to stimulate development and to show the bona fides and commitment of the State Government, which was a Labor Government at the time, to the continued need for regional centres to be developed the Central Mapping Authority was moved out of Sydney to Bathurst, and this provided an opportunity for a great number of public servants to be transferred into that area and, again, this was a way of giving a regional stimulus. It showed the bona fides of the State government in saying, `We will have development in that area, and here are our bona fides by putting in some jobs and white collar opportunities for people living in that decentralised part of the State of New South Wales'. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Campbelltown-Camden-an area which I know particularly well having formerly worked, before coming into this place, as the regional manager for the Department of Environment and Planning based in Campbelltown and being responsible for the development of the State Government's interests in the Macarthur region generally-we found there was very much a mentality for regional stimulus. What we found of course was that massive planning and massive social responsibility were shared equally between the State and local governments in that area but, again, under a master plan that was developed back in the 1970s as part of this regionalisation process started by Tom Uren; and the tri-cities concept, the tri-cities plan for the Macarthur region is still alive and well today. </PARA>
<PARA> We still have the fact that the Campbelltown part of it has almost virtually been completed; the Camden part of it is well and truly under way with massive urban development taking place there; and the planning for the third phase, renamed now Macarthur South, originally to be called Appin, is under way as well in a preliminary sense. It may not lead to the great amount of development and number of people to be sustained in that area in the short term as some people may have envisaged. Nevertheless, the basis of the planning, the physical planning, the land use planning, the provision of government services and the provision of job opportunities in that area has its genesis back in this decentralisation concept that emerged under Tom Uren and the former Whitlam Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What we saw in the case of Campbelltown has been reflected in Albury-Wodonga through the legislation we are considering this morning. In the Campbelltown area, for example, the Macarthur Development Corporation was established. How well I remember, when I was sent to Campbelltown as manager with the Department of Environment and Planning, having a great many friendly, and sometimes not too friendly, discussions with people from the Corporation. Their power resided in the former decentralisation department at the State government level; as we were responsible for planning and environment and they were responsible for decentralisation, they believed that our objectives were not always headed in the same direction. We sometimes had to have our differences amicably resolved around a table, often with Ministers present. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty for those in the Corporation was that they were charged with responsibility for developing the area in the sense of being land use developers themselves. The land was physically owned by the State Government; it was physically owned by the Macarthur Development Corporation. If someone wanted to develop a factory or build a housing estate or put in parks and recreation and so on, it had to be done in line with the master plan, the regional land use plan, that had been developed by the Department of Environment and Planning. But in buying the land, going through the approval processes and so on people had to go through two phases. </PARA>
<PARA> Then a third phase was added: local governments-Campbelltown City Council, Camden Municipal Council or whoever it might be-wanted the opportunity to comment from a local government perspective, given that they were providing many of the local services such as roads, rates and rubbish. They wanted the opportunity to have an input into the decision making, although they had no statutory basis for it and decisions were always taken by the State government. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of the original funding for the purchase of that land in the Campbelltown-Macarthur area came from the Commonwealth Government, just as it did in the case of Albury-Wodonga and, although not to the same extent, in the case of Orange-Bathurst. To indicate the sorts of difficulties that existed in Albury-Wodonga, in order to stimulate some development in that area the opportunity was provided for the Trade Union Training Authority to develop its major training base at Albury-Wodonga, again in an effort to bring people to that area for specific purposes. Again, that is something that will continue, irrespective of the implications in the legislation today. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated, one of things that has happened over the past several years that has meant that this legislation is so appropriate for Albury-Wodonga has been the development at the State government level, both in New South Wales and Victoria, of planning legislation that provides the opportunity for the development not only of local plans-that is, the land use plans that we are all familiar with-but also of regional environmental plans. The Environmental Planning and Assessment Act was developed in New South Wales at the commencement of the 1980s. State plans, regional environmental plans and local environmental plans were defined and had their basis in that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are talking about in the Bill before the Parliament this morning is giving back to the local government authorities in both Albury and Wodonga the planning responsibilities that exist under the planning legislation in New South Wales. In the late 1980s the same type of legislation was enacted in Victoria. It very closely followed the lead of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act in New South Wales. In fact, officers of the Department of Environment and Planning who held senior portfolio positions in New South Wales and who implemented the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act in that State found themselves employed in Victoria to bring in similar legislation there. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had changes in planning legislation of a land use and social planning nature-that is, physical and social infrastructure, which obviously includes things such as roads, sewerage, open space and community centres. These days such things are encapsulated in planning legislation, and provision has to be made by developers planning major developments to provide some of this infrastructure. The need for a development corporation of the nature that exists at the moment no longer is there in Albury-Wodonga. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is appropriate that in the case of this regional centre, as was the case in Macarthur and Orange-Bathurst, notwithstanding the fact that, again, the Commonwealth rightly is providing the power of people's destinies to reside with local government in these areas, we still keep an interested and a weather eye on many regional developments that are occurring around Australia. As the honourable member for Dawson rightly pointed out, unfortunately there is a trend towards greater centralisation of services in the cause of cost cutting which often suggests that efficiency will be improved. Unfortunately, the converse of that is that we find a loss of service being provided at the local level. </PARA>
<PARA> I disagreed with the comments made by the honourable member for Dawson about aggregation in the television industry. I think that generally from a consumer's perspective-I am sure the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) would agree with me-three commercial television stations now beam into the major centres, based in Orange, Canberra and Wollongong, covering all of south-east New South Wales. It is a much better proposition for consumers, along with receiving the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and in many cases also the Special Broadcasting Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The choice is therefore much wider and the opportunity for people to expand in terms of advertising and improving their own markets has been provided through this Government's policy. I think that in time improvements will be made in Queensland. Most television networks are now aligned with some of the regional television stations, which will provide the opportunity for those areas to get great benefits from it. In response to the question of servicing decentralisation, the provision of government offices and so on in different parts of Australia, in the case of the Australian Taxation Office, I say to the honourable member for Dawson that the policy of decentralisation is still alive and well. </PARA>
<PARA> Two weeks ago the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was in Wollongong. I was pleased that he made an announcement which indicated that a regional office of the Australian Taxation Office will be created in our city and that some 275 jobs will be created there as a result. Obviously the opportunity for better services to be provided to the taxpayers of Illawarra will increase because of that policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to see that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) has come into the chamber. Why is there a tendency within the bureaucracy to suggest that most functions can best be performed in capital cities around Australia? Why is it that regional centres such as Illawarra, Albury-Wodonga and so on should not have the opportunity to have even State offices of immigration, local government, or whatever, located around important regional centres in Australia to provide the stimulus for development?</PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that that does happen. We have seen governments decentralising these sorts of things and improving the opportunity for dialogue between constituencies and the officers themselves from the Commonwealth bureaucracy. I think there is ample proof that that has been an important and a very good relationship for the Commonwealth Government departments but, more importantly, for the consumers of those particular departments. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks today by again stating that the Government's decision to introduce this legislation and the effect that it will have-in my view, it rightly passes the responsibility for local land use planning, social planning and so on to local government, again removing the necessity for the Commonwealth through the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation to play such a vital role in determining those sorts of issues-is an appropriate way for Australia and for this area in the 1990s. I am concerned that by providing the opportunity for further development to take place based on local government and State government initiatives the Commonwealth does not abrogate its responsibilities in ensuring that the services that we, by necessity, have to provide in some way are not eliminated from these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is timely. It is appropriate and it is consistent with this Government's approach to urban and regional development, as exemplified by what Tom Uren did back in the days of the Department of Urban and Regional Development. It is consistent with what has happened in the Campbelltown region, which I am most familiar with. It is consistent with what has happened in Bathurst-Orange and it is consistent with Government policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very interested in the comments made by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin). I am disappointed to see him leaving the chamber. The Albury-Wodonga Development Amendment Bill is quite historic. It marks the back-down by the Labor Government on what was one of the grand Whitlam-Tom Uren dreams. Those opposite are now coming back to reality, after 18 years. That reality was quite clearly spelt out by members of my Party when this proposal for the setting up of the Albury-Wodonga strategy was first mooted back in 1973. We had quite different ideas from those of the then Labor Government. The principal function of planning was one area in which we differed very markedly from the Labor Government. I note with great interest that this Bill now brings the planning role of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation back to the local level. I believe that this is where we had fundamental differences with the Australian Labor Party right from the outset in the setting up of the Albury-Wodonga Corporation and the development of that plan in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macarthur has spelt out that, in his view, decentralisation is alive and well by citing one single example of the Wollongong branch of the Australian Taxation Office. Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure you that decentralisation is a foreign word to those in the Labor Party. They do not understand what it is about. Their objective in country areas of Australia is to withdraw government services and to leave country areas dry of those services. It is occurring right across the board. It is happening in so many areas. It is happening in Australia Post. It is happening in Telecom. It is happening in the Department of Employment, Education and Training. It is happening in employment areas. There is no concentration by this Government on the regionalisation or decentralisation aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is appropriate at this time that I give a little of the history of the setting up of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. In October 1973 the then Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, and the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria signed the Albury-Wodonga area development agreement. At that time, I know, the Victorian State Government had grave reservations about many aspects of the way in which that was being set up. The objectives of the agreements which were finally reached stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the intentions of the three Governments are-that a development Corporation will bring about in the Area (Albury-Wodonga), by the development of a growth complex, the creation of a city with a high quality of environment, appropriately planned and developed having full regard to human requirements and-</PARA>
<PARA>these are the key words-</PARA>
<PARA>the involvement of the public . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was one area where I believe that the public were not given full consultation in the setting up of the planning procedures in that area. The objectives went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>and that the development corporation will involve, as far as possible, the established Australian, State and local government authorities in the development of the growth complex. </PARA>
<PARA>The plans of the Whitlam-Uren Government at that time were very magnificent but they lacked a lot of detail in the methods by which local people could be involved, particularly in the planning area, and the way in which those planning matters would be judged by the local population, as well as having an overview from Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of Albury-Wodonga was an element of the Whitlam Government regionalisation policy, but it fell down because of lack of local input into the planning processes. The 1990 annual report of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation quite clearly spells this out under the heading `Ministerial Review'. I understand that this led to some of the changes mooted in this legislation. It points out that there were concerns about planning in this ministerial review. The Ministerial Council on the Development of Albury-Wodonga advocated important changes to the role, structure and objectives of the Corporation. Under the heading `Recommendations Adopted: Planning' it suggested that:</PARA>
<PARA>* The Corporation support an expanded town rather than a new town policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Development should concentrate on the major existing urban centres of Albury and Wodonga. </PARA>
<PARA>* the Corporation should cease being the consent (NSW) responsible (VIC) authority in the designated areas. </PARA>
<PARA>* the Corporation should cease to be the local planning authority in the designated areas. </PARA>
<PARA>This very important matter received a great deal of canvassing in 1973 during the lead-up to this legislation. We wholeheartedly supported the concept that the local government and local planning side of it should have been addressed at the local level rather than overseen by Canberra with a centralist government controlling the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation from Canberra. After 18 years the Government is now beating the retreat on that issue. It has now decided that it will hand back local planning to the local authorities. This is most appropriate. That planning will be done at a local level; there will be input from the local level. The annual report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>* the planning role of the Corporation should focus on regional planning only, in co-operation with Local Government and State Government Planning bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>It would obviously be advantageous to have the cooperation of the Victorian and New South Wales State governments in planning controls. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened at Albury-Wodonga over the years has been impressive. I do not want to detract from the progress achieved there-there have been many magnificent achievements in Albury-Wodonga-but these achievements could have had a much greater impact had they been aided by the local planning authorities having far greater input from the outset in the development of that area. The local people understand what is required. They are able to provide valuable input, which centralised authorities are unable to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government must have a look at its regionalisation policies because these policies are not working in country Australia, which is suffering a very severe loss not only in employment opportunities but also in population growth. Those opportunities are not being provided. Part of this is due to the Government's policies on withdrawal of government services. I quote an example. I recently received some information indicating that the Department of Employment, Education and Training country area office located in Bendigo is likely to be relocated to Melbourne. I can assure the Minister for Local Government (Ms Fatin), who is at the table, that the unemployment situation in Bendigo is very grim indeed; the area has very high unemployment. To take a service such as that out of the Bendigo area and relocate it to Melbourne would be counterproductive. An office in Melbourne could not offer the service that someone at the grass roots level at Bendigo would be able to provide. Whilst the Government claims that it has a social justice policy, by doing this it is saying that its social justice policy will work in the capital cities but that it does not extend outside the city boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Access to the services of the Department of Employment, Education and Training in a country area is vital. In these days of modern communications-with fax machines, computers, modem links, et cetera-there is no difference between operating a department office in a provincial city such as Bendigo and operating one in Melbourne. I was interested to listen to the comment of the honourable member for Macarthur about the Taxation Office being moved to Wollongong and service being provided to the people there. I make representations to the Minister for Local Government, who is at the table, to take this matter up with the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) to ensure that those offices of the Department of Employment, Education and Training are not relocated to the city area. In fact, the movement should be the opposite way. </PARA>
<PARA> This type of activity is taking place not only in government departments but also in industry because most country centres in Australia have some infrastructure already in place to provide development. Industries that go to those areas are able to utilise that infrastructure which is already in place. Land costs are cheaper, rental costs are cheaper and, with modern communications, there is very little difference between conducting an enterprise in a country centre and conducting one in a capital city. It is probably cheaper in the country centre due to environmental aspects and other factors such as transport related issues in the metropolitan area. I make that plea to the Minister to take that matter up because what we are talking about in the principles of this Bill is the Government's regionalisation or decentralisation policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been tried in Victoria. In  1983-84 the Cain-Kirner Government abolished all of its decentralisation incentives. It has taken that Government eight to nine years to realise that those policies need to be reinstated. It is now returning to those decentralisation-regionalisation policies after having seen the damage that has occurred to country industry by the removal of incentives. Many of those industries have suffered a severe downturn due to the economic climate at the moment and many of them are either closing up or going back to the metropolitan area. Many of the policies that the Victorian Government introduced, and then withdrew during 1983-84, were similar to what the Federal Government was attempting to do with the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. But the Government failed to take into account the local input in all of these matters, and the fact that it was necessary to encourage the spread of population throughout Australia rather than focusing it on capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office must be one of the few government departments that has decentralised its activities throughout Australia. The honourable member for Macarthur mentioned that. That office has also decentralised its functions to Albury. It conducts a lot of business from the Albury-Wodonga area. Most major provincial centres have a very viable Taxation Office. Certainly, the one in the city of Bendigo is very active and very helpful to taxpayers. It provides a very good service to that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to comment broadly on the remarks made by my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) regarding the loss of population and the loss of job opportunities in country areas and the retraction of government services. This is particularly evident in the electorate of Bendigo, which at the moment is suffering a reduction in government services. We are feeling the economic impact of the Government's policies, probably to a higher degree than many other centres in Victoria because of the rural dependence upon wool and wheat production in that area and the reliance that the city places on industries which are associated with those products. The development of other manufacturing industries has received no encouragement from either the State Government or the Federal Government in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Dawson which indicated that in our opinion the functions of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation should be phased out as soon as practicable, and which noted that the Bill does not provide for this. In making those remarks I ask the Minister who is at the table to take up the matter which I raised regarding the withdrawal of services by the Department of Employment, Education and Training from Bendigo and their return to a capital city. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the earliest actions of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam upon winning power in 1972 was to seek a conference with the New South Wales and Victorian governments with a view to establishing principles for the development of Albury-Wodonga as a growth centre. This meeting occurred on 25 January 1973 in Albury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Albury-Wodonga appeared to have quite a number of features which made it such an attractive candidate for growth. As enunciated in a June 1973 report by the Cities Commission, these included the fact that it was located on the major communication network between Sydney and Melbourne and was especially well served by road and rail links. It was one of the most versatile primary producing areas in Australia and Albury and Wodonga formed a major service and distribution centre. Secondary industry was well established in both communities, and both towns had attracted a significant number and wide range of industrial activities. Employment in manufacturing in 1973 already comprised 20 per cent of the work force. An important army base was being developed in the vicinity. The area had significant tourist potential. The combined populations of the two towns had already been growing at a significant rate and between them they formed one of the five largest inland populations in Australia. The climate and other physical factors in the area provided desirable living conditions, and essential services, such as water supply, drainage, sewerage, solid waste disposal and power supplies, were capable of being improved to accommodate an accelerated population growth without pollution or adverse effects on other centres of population. </PARA>
<PARA> The then Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, met with the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria in Albury on 25 January 1973. At that meeting, 18 principles were agreed which would apply to the development of the new regional growth centre. In the next few months, the principles were refined and were eventually embodied in the Albury-Wodonga area development agreement which was signed by the then Prime Minister and two State Premiers in Wodonga on 23 October 1973. It was this latter agreement that was ratified by the Albury-Wodonga Development Act 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> The Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation could have faced constitutional difficulties. As a result, a rather convoluted structure was derived whereby, in addition to the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation, two other corporations, the Albury-Wodonga (New South Wales) Corporation and the Albury-Wodonga (Victoria) Corporation, would be established by legislation in the respective States to acquire, hold, manage and provide land and to provide municipal type services and levy charges in new urban areas of those States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act gave the Corporation the power to borrow money for development purposes from the States of New South Wales or Victoria, an approved bank or other approved lender. It could also receive moneys appropriated by any of the three governments. The Commonwealth Treasurer could guarantee borrowings by the Corporation and the Corporation was also exempted from Commonwealth or State taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement stipulated that the Development Corporation was to prepare each year a comprehensive forward five-year plan for development of the growth complex, to be submitted to and approved by the Ministerial Council. The plan was to include statements of the expenditures necessary for its implementation in each of the five years. Under the agreement the three governments agreed to share equally the cost of administration of the Corporation. The Commonwealth share of these costs continued to be provided under annual appropriations. The Commonwealth was to provide the lion's share of the funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The initial goal of the Albury-Wodonga growth centre program was to build a complex consisting of the old and new cities which would have a population of 300,000 by the year 2000. In addition to the old cities of Albury and Wodonga, two new cities, Thurgoona to the north-east of Albury and Baranduda to the south-east of Wodonga, would be constructed. The Development Corporation was to be responsible for the development of new areas, while local governments were to remain generally responsible for their existing urban areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation began to acquire land and develop it, mainly around the edges of the existing cities rather than developing the greenfield cities. It should be noted that although the Commonwealth had a distinct preference for residential land to be provided on a leasehold basis, this was opposed by New South Wales. As a result, from the beginning the Corporation sold developed residential land on a freehold basis. It does, however, hold a stock of rental accommodation which it can rent to key personnel in the development process. Initially, all developed industrial sites were provided on a leasehold basis, but companies now have a choice, with the majority preferring freehold tenure.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the original principles it had been agreed that land price speculation should not be allowed to prejudice the success of the growth centre program. Measures would be taken to ensure that land acquisition prices did not reflect local speculative pressures on land prices. To this end, the two State governments would introduce land price stabilisation legislation as soon as possible. This legislation would set the price of land to be acquired for the growth centre project on the basis of market prices ruling at 3 October 1972, indexed by an appropriate land price index to be subsequently defined and computed. The acquisition of land over later years, particularly at 1972 values, caused a great deal of resentment and bitterness amongst landholders. </PARA>
<PARA> The Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation was continually assessed, but in November 1988 the Ministerial Council agreed to a further review of the Corporation, noting that no review had been undertaken since 1982. The recommendations of the review committee were considered at a meeting of the Ministerial Council on 8 June 1989. In a communique issued after the meeting, the Ministers announced that they had decided that important changes to the role, structure and objectives of the Corporation were necessary to ensure the continued success of the growth centre into the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> Amongst the recommendations of the review committee that were endorsed by the Ministerial Council was that a new Albury-Wodonga Region Planning Committee be set up to oversee physical and social planning in the area. This Committee was to develop a regional plan as a prelude to the Corporation relinquishing its local planning and approval powers. There was to be an internal reorganisation of the Corporation to enable it to meet its new and enhanced role in regional development. It was recommended that the new mission statement for the Corporation should be to facilitate the continuing growth of the Albury-Wodonga area in cooperation with Australian, State and local government and community agencies, and that the goals of the Corporation should be to contribute to the physical, economic and social planning and development in the area, in partnership with local government and the community; to promote the area in cooperation with appropriate agencies; and to develop and market Corporation landholdings. To achieve these objectives, the Corporation must form a new cooperative relationship with local government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Albury-Wodonga Region Planning Committee was to be established to overview and coordinate the preparation of a regional plan covering physical and social planning in the area. The Committee should comprise representatives of the Albury and Wodonga councils, a representative of the Corporation and a representative of each of the State planning departments. New strategies would be prepared to encourage income generation and population growth in the area, provide people and businesses with access to the services and facilities they need, and establish the future shape of the cities and towns in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, the Corporation would still have a continuing role in the process of regional planning. It would continue to be a landowner and developer. However, contradictions inherent in the Corporation's being both a landowner and developer as well as being involved in the planning process and the provision of services would be reduced. Social service delivery would become the responsibility of local government and the community. The financial performance of the Corporation would be improved through the adoption of more commercial practices for the management of its major public sector asset holdings. </PARA>
<PARA> There would be closer monitoring of the Corporation's cost effectiveness by the Ministerial Council, having special regard to land stock requirements, infrastructure, land development activities and the provision of housing. A chief executive officer would be appointed to enable improved internal administration. Membership of the Corporation would also be restructured to comprise a part time chairman, nominated by the Commonwealth; two part time deputy chairmen, nominated by the States; two regional members, one from each State; and a chief executive officer without voting rights. It was not seen as necessary for the mayors of Albury and Wodonga to be ex officio members of the Corporation; instead, their representatives could be appointed as ex officio members. </PARA>
<PARA> The Albury-Wodonga Development Amendment Bill 1991 legislates to implement those recommendations which need legislation. The question is often asked: has the Albury-Wodonga growth centre been a success? A very large sum of taxpayers' money has been injected into the growth centre by the Commonwealth Government and by the governments of New South Wales and Victoria. The Minister for Local Government (Mrs Fatin) in her second reading speech referred to a $120m Commonwealth investment. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the project has created a pleasant and well planned urban and industrial environment. It has facilitated the growth of population in the Albury-Wodonga statistical district from 55,780 in 1971 to 86,830 in 1989. This represents one of the highest regional city growth rates in Australia. Certainly the area does not appear likely to approach anything near the target population range of 150,000 by the year 2000. Even on the most optimistic projection, population for the statistical area is likely to be only 106,700 by that time. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the Corporation has also managed to attract a number and range of significant industries to the area. Capital investment in the growth area between 1973-74 and 1989-90 is estimated to be in the order of $1.8 billion. However, the Opposition believes that the Corporation must put a great deal of emphasis on the disposal of its land holdings, certainly not in a manner which would adversely affect land sales in general but with the aim of phasing out the Corporation as soon as practicable. It is with this in mind that I support the amendment moved by the member for Dawson, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the functions of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation should be phased out as soon as practicable, but notes that the Bill does not provide for this''. </PARA>

Most of those matters fall outside my portfolio area, but I will certainly draw them to the attention of the relevant Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) gave a lucid and succinct account of the rationale behind the development of the growth centres by the Whitlam Government, and I thank him for that. He also referred to the changes that have occurred since then and the appropriateness of the current legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) suggested that this legisla- tion indicates a backdown on Albury-Wodonga by the Government. That is not the case. The amendments merely put into effect arrangements that are more appropriate in the current circumstances. No-one would reasonably suggest that arrangements put in place almost 20 years ago should be immutable. The honourable member also raised the matter of the transfer from the Bendigo region of staff of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. I will certainly draw his concerns to the attention of my colleague. I also thank the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron) for his contribution this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not accept the Opposition's amendment. The Government will not have the Corporation continuing in existence any longer than necessary. However, at this stage there is no good reason to nominate a time when the Corporation should cease to function. In fact, to do so would be counterproductive; there is still an important role for the Corporation in Albury-Wodonga. Its continuation is critical to ensuring that the Commonwealth receives a good return on its considerable investment in the area, and the member for Indi mentioned this. It is also important for the continued success, I believe, of the Albury-Wodonga area. </PARA>

<PARA>The Government has moved minor amendments affecting three aspects of the Bill. These are, firstly, to change wording in the Commonwealth-States agreement attached to the Bill that could have been interpreted at law as bestowing State planning powers on the Albury-Wodonga Ministerial Council. The major thrust of the reform package is to return State planning powers held by the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation to those agencies normally exercising such powers. This amendment simply clarifies that point. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the amendments change the commencement provisions of the Bill and the agreement to ensure that they are aligned. Both now provide for the agreement to be operative after the passage of this Bill and complementary State legislation. The agreement as previously drafted assumed that the agreement would have been executed by all parties before passage of the legislation, which is now unlikely. Finally, the amendments provide some tidying up of wording by correcting headings and omitting the term `growth centre' and replacing it with `growth complex'. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the amendments to the Committee and present the explanatory memorandum for the amendments to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Their heads are in the clouds and the rest of them is not far behind. The tax was a creature of the election campaign strategists for the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in 1990, designed to appeal to the rank motive of envy among some of the Labor Party's constituency. Prior to last year's election, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) described any tax on expensive car imports as `mere embroidery on the fabric of policy'. In the ALP's desperate quest for votes, a tax on highly priced vehicles became a significant plank in the Government's election platform. Things might not have been so bad if that had been where the policy stayed; but instead it was the very first sales tax measure to be introduced into the new Parliament. The Bill increased the sales tax on so-called luxury vehicles from 30 to 50 per cent for cars with a retail value over $42,910 or the wholesale price equivalent of $28,793.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That Bill was accompanied by the brave prediction that it would net revenue of $105m for the Commonwealth in a full year. That figure was wildly optimistic since it was based on 1988-89 sales figures which ignored the marked downturn in the market for more expensive cars from September 1989 onwards. BMW had warned at the time of the introduction of the Bill that, on the basis of the sales figures available to it, the tax was more likely to result in a net revenue loss of $200m. That prediction was to be confirmed within a matter of months. It was a prediction that was being borne out even before the new tax became effective. </PARA>
<PARA> Sales of more expensive cars in March 1990 ran at 2,290 units, whereas the March figure for the previous year had been only 820 units. It was obvious when the Bill was being introduced that most prospective car buyers had escaped the tax, reaping a windfall gain to the dealers but devastating the market and orderly marketing of affected vehicles for the foreseeable future. We should not forget that the official rationale for this tax was to take off some of the pressure on the current account that was being generated by so-called luxury car imports. This was never likely to be achieved, given that those car imports amount to less than one-half of one per cent of total imports. It was a goal that was also contradicted by the Treasury's revenue estimates, which assumed that there would be no dramatic decline in sales, and thus imports, as a result of the tax. At best, the new tax was to be nothing more than a politically motivated revenue grab; at worst, it was a shameless fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> Some have argued that the tax served to switch demand from imported to domestically produced vehicles, the gains from which would offset any effect on the imported vehicle industry. What this argument conveniently ignored was that most existing imported expensive cars were in the possession of owners of similar vehicles only one to four years old. Thus, the decline in the demand for this type of new vehicle was most likely to be translated into the retention by owners of their existing cars in the hope of a policy change under a coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the tax was a classic example of legislation by press release, fraught with uncertainties and illegalities. The introduction of the tax was originally to be backdated to the date of proclamation, 1 April 1990; April Fools Day-very appropriate. This was subsequently changed in the Bill to a starting date of 1 May 1990. For much of this period, relevant car dealerships were put in the position of having to collect this tax without the benefit of having even seen the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> More seriously still, where the tax had been collected after 1 May and before the Bill was passed, those same car dealers were required to break the law in order to collect the tax at the new, higher rate. The Government thought it quite acceptable to force people into breaking the law for the sake of the revenue. To this end, the Treasurer issued a press release on 24 April 1990 which was designed to confer some sort of immunity from prosecution for those who levied the tax at the new rate. The press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Taxation Office will not seek to penalise dealers who make provisions for, or remit, additional sales tax in anticipation of legislation being passed. </PARA>
<PARA>The law of the land was thus swept aside by a mere piece of paper coming out of the Treasurer's office. Such is the Treasurer's contempt for the Parliament and, indeed, for the rule of law. This attitude was neatly summed at the time by David Solomon, writing in the Australian, who noted:</PARA>
<PARA>It's all right to break that particular law if the Government is going to get the money. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition, originally with the support of the Australian Democrats, sought to amend the original Bill so that the tax would commence 28 days after royal assent. However, the Democrats in the Senate did the usual thing and struck a deal with the Government so that the Bill was further amended to have a commencement date of 9 May 1990. The Bill, as finally enacted, was to operate retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the enactment of the tax, affected car sales quickly plummeted from an average of 1,200 per month to 435 per month. The car industry led the country into the recession engineered by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). By November 1990, BMW was estimating a negative revenue impact of $228m as a result of lost sales, rising to $330m in 1991 were the tax not scrapped. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax introduced a serious disparity in the treatment of different vehicles on the thresholds to apply, which the Government then sought to address in the 1990-91 Budget. The Budget introduced a split rate tax structure which served only to greatly complicate the administration of the tax under the new rates. The new measures completely failed to arrest the decline in sales and the resulting inevitable decline in the high cost sector of the car industry. By late December last year the first reports began to emerge that the Government was planning to scrap the tax in the light of the overwhelming evidence that it had been a disaster for all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to finally scrap the tax was announced in the 12 March industry policy statement. At page 3.7 the statement noted that the tax had resulted in:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a dramatic contraction in sales in the sector. Monthly sales are now running at less than a third of the level over the years before the tax changed. </PARA>
<PARA>This has had serious consequences on the overall business of these vehicle importers. Vehicle importing is only part of the Australian operations of the luxury car companies such as Mercedes-Benz and JRA. These companies also have major bus and truck operations in Australia and are large employers of highly skilled labour, including many apprentices. The downturn in their car sales has put at risk these operations and their capacity to grow in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>They have also been exporters of automotive components from Australia and have been integrating Australia into their world-wide sourcing of automobile components and materials. </PARA>
<PARA>To ensure that these companies can continue to contribute to the Australian economy, the Government has decided to review the higher rate luxury sales tax and to revert to the May 1990 arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Surprise, surprise! It is a pity the Government did not think of all these effects before it introduced the tax in the first place. The Government is damned out of the Prime Minister's own mouth over the effects of the tax, but nowhere do we hear any contrition from him or the Government over the bankrupted businesses and the lost jobs that have resulted from this politically motivated tax. The Government simply shirks all responsibility for one of the most irresponsible abuses of taxation power ever perpetrated by an Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA> One might be tempted to let the Government off the hook if it had made an honest mistake. But there have been far too many gross errors of judgment of this kind for us to be particularly indulgent. There was no honest mistake involved here. The Government was told by industry and the Opposition what the effects of the tax would be. I recall, and it is recorded in Hansard, that I told the Government when it introduced the first piece of legislation exactly what it could expect, and that was a net loss of revenue with effects on employment throughout our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not just a matter of taking our word for what would happen; the evidence was there in volumes to support what we were saying. But the Government persisted regardless because it was more interested in the political capital to be realised through the tax than in giving any thought to its likely economic consequences. It was another one of those outrageous political deals on the part of this Government for which we have had to pay the price. </PARA>
<PARA> The disaster of the tax on more expensive cars does, however, serve to highlight for everyone one of the many important advantages of a broadly based goods and services tax over the existing wholesale sales tax system. Not only is such a tax administratively far less complex, and hence less costly, to collect and administer; it is also less open to the kind of outrageous political abuses that have characterised this Government's administration of the existing sales tax system. A broadly based goods and services tax has the potential to spare us the economic consequences of irresponsible attempts to turn the taxation system into a vehicle for delivering votes, or even for delivering vast sums into the coffers of the Labor Party itself to fund extravagant election campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the second Bill, the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), which is in complete contrast with the one I have just discussed in that it provides a rare example from this Government of a responsible taxation measure which will actually be of some benefit to economic activity in this country. The Bill introduces a new system of quarterly payments for small businesses of their sales tax liabilities. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Bill introduces a new system of quarterly payments for small businesses of their sales tax liabilities. Under the current payments system, sales tax payers who have any taxable transactions in a month must lodge their returns and remit payment to the Australian Taxation Office within 20 days of the end of that month. Under this legislation taxpayers will instead be able to lodge a return for the quarter, or a return for each month in the quarter. Payment can be made at any time during the quarter, provided the full sales tax liability is paid by the twenty-first day following the end of the quarter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The new payment system will apply to all taxable dealings on or after 1 August this year. It will apply to those taxpayers whose annual sales tax liability for the 1990-91 financial year was less than $50,000, thereby putting them in the small business category. The Bill will result in a small one-off revenue loss to the Commonwealth from delayed sales tax collections and the loss of interest on those collections. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the measure will provide significant relief to many small business taxpayers who found the existing payment system so debilitating to everyday operations. The principal benefit to small business of the new system will be to ease pressure on small business cash flows. Under the current payment system many small businesses are required to remit sales tax payments to the Australian Taxation Office before payment for the goods sold is received from the particular customers. This occurs as a result of the proprietor having extended credit for the payment of accounts for standard business practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Beddall report into small business in Australia noted that the average time taken by non-cash paying customers to settle their accounts is almost certainly greater than the maximum period currently allowed by the Taxation Office for the remittance of sales tax-that is, the sales tax component in the relevant accounts. The disparity between the remittance of tax and payment by customers is thought to average between 10 and 40 days, creating serious cash flow difficulties for many small businesses. This serves to compound the existing, well-known cash flow and working capital problems that confront small businesses on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Most small businesses have little choice but to extend credit to their customers in order to maintain market share in a competitive environment. Consequently, it is not uncommon for small businesses to be forced to resort to highly expensive bridging finance in order to make up for any shortfall in their ability to meet sales tax liabilities. This Bill is thus very welcome; it is a very welcome measure for small businesses. It is interesting to see that the only time the Government gets excited is when I am about to compliment it and have already done so in relation to a particular measure. It shows a lack of judgment on the part of those responsible for that sort of intercession, Mr Deputy Speaker, but that is not all that surprising, as I am sure you know.

You would be the first, Mr Deputy Speaker, to draw me into line on the grounds of irrelevance if I started discussing company tax. This Bill is a very welcome measure, but it almost goes without saying that this measure only tackles the symptoms rather than the cause of the problem, which is our massively complicated and ramshackle wholesale sales tax system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Beddall report devoted a considerable amount of space to discussing a number of other measures that would seek to relieve small business of some of the burdens imposed by the existing wholesale sales tax regime. For example, the report recommended a public review of the sales tax system and its effect on small business. It also proposed a number of specific measures, such as placing time-limits on the Australian Taxation Office's provision of sales tax rulings and the fast tracking of appeals mechanisms in sales tax disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> The piecemeal approach to the reform of the wholesale sales tax adopted in this report was characteristic of the Government's efforts to patch up the increasingly burdensome sales tax system. It seems that every economic statement in every Budget coming from the Government contains numerous changes to the sales tax system, which adds massively to the complexity of sales tax laws. Virtually every new sales tax laws amendment Act further adds to the compliance and collection costs of an already hideously expensive sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has rejected this system outright, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and it proposes to introduce a broadly based goods and services tax in this place, some of the advantages of which I have already mentioned. The very narrow base of the existing wholesale sales tax system means that sales taxes are necessarily levied at a very high rate. For example, nearly 30 per cent of sales tax revenue comes from the sale of transport and transport equipment, 16 per cent of which comes from the sale of passenger and commercial motor vehicles. Another 24 per cent comes from household goods, office equipment and furniture. Thus just over 50 per cent of sales tax revenue comes from just these two commodity groupings alone. There are three different ad valorem rates to the wholesale sales tax of 10, 20 and 30 per cent. These differing rates levied on a narrow range of goods severely distort production and consumption decisions, particularly in view of the fact that the commodity listings in the rates and exemption schedules have failed to keep pace with changing consumer preferences. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated in a study at the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University entitled A Broad Based Consumption Tax for Australia that nearly half of all wholesale sales tax is levied on intermediate business inputs. Another 14 per cent is levied on sales of investment goods, while only 30 per cent is actually paid by the ultimate consumer in the ultimate transaction. That study also found out that some 10 per cent of the final incidence of wholesale sales tax falls on exports, which translates into an average export tax of more than 2 per cent. This is at a time when we are trying to lift our export performance, and we should compare that with the fact that a goods and services tax will reduce the wholesale sales tax impost on business inputs into exporting industries. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the wholesale sales tax gives relatively favourable treatment to imports, and so discriminates against domestic production of import substitutes. It was the conclusion of the Centre of Political Studies that:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a general consensus that the-</PARA>
<PARA>wholesale sales tax-</PARA>
<PARA>system has lost any economic merit it may once have had, and it remains only as a politically expedient but economically inefficient revenue raiser. </PARA>
<PARA>It is time we did away with political expediency and scrapped this ridiculous system in favour of a broadly based goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding my remarks, it is worth noting that this Bill marks the introduction by the Treasury of a new format in the explanatory memoranda of tax Bills coming before the Parliament. The various provisions of tax Bills that deal with related matters are now grouped together rather than being listed seriatim and thus scattered throughout a memorandum. This will make the job of both legislators and tax practitioners and, dare I say it, members of this House somewhat easier when it comes to grappling with the meaning of the many tax proposals that are put before us by the Government. But it is only a small contribution to the massive task of tax law simplification that we confront and on which the Government has been inexcusably slow to act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The two pieces of legislation that are before us relate of course to taxation measures that have been introduced, and I would differ from the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) first in saying that, in fact, there is no contrast between these two pieces of legislation; the direction of these two pieces is the same. I think it addresses that about which honourable members on both sides of this House would agree-that there is an urgent need and there has been an urgent need for decades in this country for us to have a more competitive and international outlook in respect of the way in which our economy is structured.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is absolutely critical for Australia to maintain that which we have, but to improve on it at the same time and, when we take decisions in respect of our economy, to take decisions that will go to improving our competitiveness. In regard to the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) I would say that what we do see is recognition by the Government of unintended consequences of a change in tax policy and, therefore, a change in the structure; a reduction in the luxury tax from 50 per cent to 30 per cent. But still implicit within this Bill is a difference between the rate at which normal, ordinary vehicles are taxed and the rate at which luxury cars are taxed-and I did not hear from the honourable member opposite some suggestion that in fact there should be an equivalence in those two rates. So what he is doing, I presume, in his summary of this legislation is agreeing with the principle that there should be a higher rate of tax on a luxury vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are then debating is the fact that perhaps, in judgment, the level that was set more than 12 months ago was high but the principle is something that the Opposition would support as, indeed, it would, as a result of some unintended consequences of that move, a change in the tax structure accordingly. He suggested also that throughout the economy there were unemployment and employment effects as a result of this. While he suggested that, he also suggested that this represented a very, very small part of revenue and in fact it was just tinkering with the edges. I would say that those two statements by the honourable member for Curtin are again inconsistent and reflect, I think, the inconsistent nature of thinking on tax policy by members of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The second measure relates to an easing of the sales tax burdens on small businesses. In a sense, it allows them to pay their sales tax returns quarterly rather than monthly, and as such it gives some improvement to the way in which small businesses will be able to order their affairs and the efficiency with which they will be able to structure the way those things operate. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, I understand that as a result of these moves, from 21 November, when the first payment will be due, businesses which have a sales tax requirement of less than $50,000 in a year will be able to forward their returns on a quarterly basis rather than a monthly basis, as presently required. This will provide an improvement in their efficiency and will allow them to overcome those lumpy changes which occur necessarily in sales tax payments because businesses do not run in a steady or even way. There are times when demands are higher and times when demands are less, and as a result of that it is necessary for businesses to smooth over their payment procedures. This measure will allow for that. Of course, as a sensible measure, it is supported by members of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The discussion, as I believed it would, ranged far and wide and moved into the area of general taxation policy and, indeed, the Opposition's proposal for a general goods and services tax. In 1985, when these proposals were put forward at the National Taxation Summit, I was a supporter of option C, but one needs to look at the background of taxation and the way in which it has changed significantly since that time. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time I supported the consumption tax proposal. It was one of the things that would have allowed us to bring about significant reductions in marginal tax rates in a position which allowed us to be revenue neutral. Of course, the propositions that were put forward at that time were compensated propositions that allowed for the regressive nature of a general goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> What needs to be understood by members of the public, and indeed the community in general, is that, while a general goods and services tax at the margin-where it is levied at, say, a rate of 10 or 15 per cent-may be lower than some of the wholesale sales taxes that are presently levied, items such as milk, bread and clothing, which have previously been exempted, general items that are required as a bare minimum for us to maintain a reasonable living standard and for people on lower incomes to maintain a living standard, will be taxed for the first time. The impact of such taxation, particularly if there is no compensatory mechanism, is substantial. If there is a compensatory mechanism in such a system-and the Opposition has not bothered to clarify this issue-there will be no revenue gain. </PARA>
<PARA> There are probably two justifications for a general goods and services tax. The first concerns the cash economy, which presently is difficult to estimate and is an area of the economy which is variously judged to be very significant or not so significant. A goods and services tax will allow people who are earning in the cash economy, in the black economy, those people who are avoiding taxation by other measures, at least to have some tax impost when they consume. I think it is unarguable that a general goods and services tax would bring about an increase in revenue from these people who are presently avoiding or evading the taxation system. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) nods his head in assent. </PARA>
<PARA> The other justification that I think carries some weight is that a general goods and services tax-which would exclude, of course, components for export-would have an effect in making Australia more competitive and reducing the input costs of our exports. In introducing the measures the Government has introduced in its March statement, effectively that aspect of benefit from a general goods and service tax has been removed. In exempting the business inputs under the wholesale sales tax system, we have removed that present stricture which applies to exporters. Indeed, what we are providing there is a means whereby we can increase our competitiveness in the international arena. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other arguments in respect of the goods and services tax. One of them is that it will bring about significant improvements in savings. But it is clear, if one looks at the evidence, that following the introduction of such a tax in New Zealand that has not in fact been the case. Indeed, the effect has been the reverse. There are arguments about efficiency, and one could complain about aspects of the wholesale sales tax, which has been broadly smoothed and improved over the past couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to consider the down side of a goods and services tax. At a time when probably there is agreement from both sides of this place that we can no longer allow inflation to beat down our competitive edge, then the impost of such a tax would be inflationary and the impact dangerous. As I have mentioned, it is also the case that without compensation it is very doubtful whether there would be a revenue gain from such a tax. It is clear that without compensation such a tax is indeed regressive. </PARA>

<PARA> When one considers taxation policy, one has to look at economic management in general. Indeed, many of the myths that were present at the beginning of the last decade have effectively been blown out of the water. When this Government came to office it was generally believed that if we could rein in domestic deficits and domestic spending we would be able to control the extent of our foreign debt and our borrowings overseas. It is clear that, while both of those things have been done-domestic spending and domestic deficits have been reined in-there is a need for a much greater adjustment in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason the Australian economy is in a parlous state is that it is structurally poorly built up. We have an economy which has principally been devoted to commodity exporting and not to manufacturing. Indeed, many of the measures this Government has introduced have been directed in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the way in which the taxation picture has changed in the last decade, then that remains the case. When we look at taxation, it is important for us to consider the changes that have occurred. The change that has occurred in respect of the capital gains tax is one that is significant and one that I believe will be part of the framework of taxation policy in Australia for decades. I have used this example before, but I am happy to use it again: it is absurd that, where there is not a consumption tax, a wage earner who earns $30,000 a year should have tax levied upon him, yet someone who makes a capital gain from selling a package of shares or from a land deal who made exactly the same income in the same tax year would have no tax liability, according to the proposal suggested by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Fundamental to our understanding of taxation equity is vertical equity, which says that like cases should be treated alike. It is clear that a capital gain made in any income year is exactly the same as income earned in that year and it should be treated in the same way. Capital gains tax is a fundamental aspect of equity which, I believe, needs to be part of the structure of any fair and reasonable taxation system in this country. In the same way, by introducing the fringe benefits tax, by introducing the entertainment tax, by improving the structure whereby taxation on equities was made fairer, we have broadened the base of taxation. The necessity for a generalised goods and consumers tax-as I said, I supported it in 1985-is no longer as great as it was. When one looks at the down side of such a tax and the impost it would bring about, then one can argue very cogently for retaining the system that we have at present. </PARA>
<PARA> There are issues in taxation which we need to look at. I believe the taxation of family units is something that needs serious consideration. We need to consider very seriously the churning effects and the inefficiency as a result of taxing people and then paying them benefits. In respect of pensioners, the Government has outlined that by 1995 all of those who are in receipt of pension income will no longer have a taxation requirement. That will remove the churning effect that presently exists for people in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary for us to continue to look at taxation; it is necessary for us to take a philosophical position about it. In respect of these two pieces of legislation, I point out again that the honourable member for Curtin did not suggest for a moment that there should not be a differential rate between luxury cars and ordinary cars. In a sense, he is accepting the principle behind the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1), but the argument is about something that happened previously. For instance, when he argued that because revenue was down this was a reason for change, he was becoming confused about the principle and the outcome. F</PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the particular measure, one sees that it is very difficult to establish a cause and effect relationship between the taxation change that the Government outlined and the effect that occurred subsequently in respect of revenue from luxury vehicles. In respect of the change that is outlined in the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), which makes it possible for small businesses to pay their sales tax requirement on a quarterly basis, this is a sensible measure. It makes the way in which small businesses will be able to organise themselves more efficient. It generally smooths out the way in which sales taxation will be levied on such small businesses. It gives them the option to continue to pay on a monthly basis or to move to a quarterly assessment. I believe that, as such, it is a sensible and important measure in decreasing the impost on small businesses, which at the moment have many problems with which they are struggling. It is a measure which will ease the load. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) and the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) which are before the House in this cognate debate on sales tax. I would like to address a few remarks to both Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) relates to the Government's decision finally to repeal the discriminatory sales tax it imposed about a year ago on luxury cars-a sales tax which by any measure, international or national, was, in an economic sense, an irrational tax. It was a tax that was introduced not, therefore, for any economic reason, not in order to achieve certain economic objectives, which one would have thought would have been the raison d'etre for a tax of this kind; it was a tax that was introduced for simply political reasons. It was a politically driven tax which endeavoured to mine in the community a sense of envy for those people who have bigger and more expensive cars. It was an attempt on the part of the Australian Labor Party to go out into the community and say that it is the Party which will encourage envy and take action to try to, as the phrase goes, cut down the tall poppies-something that is much beloved in the lexicon of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice also that this strategy has had limited success. In the general community there probably is not a great awareness of this measure that the Labor Party introduced. That is certainly my experience in my own electorate where, inevitably, the vast majority of people do not have luxury cars. They do not think very much about them, except at the motor show. This particular measure has attracted enthusiastic support amongst those who are left leaning in the press gallery. I refer in particular to an article written a little while ago by Ian Warden of the Canberra Times. He writes many satirical and amusing columns. He was an example of a left wing journalist who in particular applauded the Government's initiative in introducing a discriminatory tax on luxury cars because it cut down the tall poppies. The fact is that by this very decision to repeal the legislation this has turned out to be a political debacle, not a political triumph. It underlines the very important principle of politics which, I suppose, the Labor Party will never learn; that is, that envy is a very poor basis for decision making. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has realised that the tax is economically irrational; it has realised that it has done Australia's standing some damage-not major damage-in the international community and has decided at the end of the day that it will not raise very much revenue so it might as well get rid of it. I note that at the end of last year there were quite prominent reports in the media that this tax was going to be abolished. For the record, I remind the House that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, who has responsibility for the car industry, amongst other things, denied that the Government was even contemplating this. Either Senator Button was not telling the truth-something I would not like to assert in a forum such as this-or he was completely out of touch with what was happening within the Government. If a man who is one of the most senior Cabinet Ministers, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, does not have a clue what the Government is doing in relation to tax policy which directly affects important industries in his portfolio, it shows him to be negligent in his duty. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning of my speech, this tax was economically foolish and economically irrational. What a sales tax should do, and other speakers have made this point, is collect revenue-that is the raison d'etre for sales tax-but do so in a way that ensures there are no distortions in economic activity. If there is a level of tax on one item which is higher than the tax on others, or if there is a tax on one item which does not apply at all to other items, then inevitably there is a distortion in consumer behaviour. Obviously consumers are less likely to spend money on products which have a tax because that makes them relatively more expensive than they would otherwise be. They are more likely to direct resources, therefore, towards low tax or no tax services or goods and there is a misallocation of economic resources, or at least there is an allocation which is determined by the Government rather than determined by the marketplace-determined by the natural course of economic and human activity. That constitutes a misallocation of resources. </PARA>
<PARA> In a general sense, the current sales tax regime is a magnificent illustration of how totally irrational a tax system can be and how it distorts the nature of the economy. The fact is that we have three different rates of sales tax and we have this luxury rate as well. Many things are zero rated; effectively all services are zero rated. As a consequence, within our economy we have a wide range of distortions. For example, we pay sales tax on fruit juice which, to paraphrase an expression, one would have thought was a good thing, but we do not pay sales tax on vastly expensive ballroom gowns. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is implicitly making a judgment that fruit juice is less good for us than ballroom gowns. I think most people in Australia would think that was a fairly curious point of view for the Government to hold. It is distorting economic behaviour-at least in theory-away from fruit juice towards ballroom gowns and other things which do not attract any tax. It is quite irrational. Consequently, this whole approach to sales tax that the Government has is one that does not meet with the rhetoric of at least the Treasurer, who argues that he is all in favour of rational economics. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular luxury car tax was a very good illustration, though, of how a government will do something to exacerbate distortions in order to achieve some sort of extremely cheap political objective. The luxury car tax had more against it than the fact that it was a distortion of consumer behaviour. It also was a form of protection, a point that was made by many people during the short and unhappy life of this luxury tax. Honourable members should remember that 92 per cent of the cars that were affected by the luxury tax were imported. Only 8 per cent of them were domestically produced. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequence of applying this discriminatory luxury car tax was to raise the effective rate of protection to 74 per cent on cars in that price bracket that are imported, predominantly from Europe. The Government effectively increased protection in the car industry, quite contrary to all the rhetoric we hear from the dispatch box day in and day out about how the Labor Party is the party that is going to reduce protection and how protection is a terrible thing. In repealing this legislation that it introduced only a year ago, it is doing just that. Why did it decide a year ago to introduce legislation that increased the effective rate of protection for that section of the car industry to 74 per cent? We on this side of the House know that increasing protection is not a solution to the problems of the car industry. For that matter, the Australian manufacturers in the car industry hold the same view. A year or so ago when this legislation was first introduced, John Bagshaw, the former Managing Director of General Motors-Holden's Ltd-he is producing cars in Australia, so he is likely to be a beneficiary of the additional protection-said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is absolutely scandalous from an industry perspective-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the tax. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA>It doesn't affect us very much-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Holden's-</PARA>
<PARA>and it could actually be of some benefit to us. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . but I think if you are trying to guide an industry out of the dark ages into international competitiveness it is absolutely the wrong way to go. This is the wrong sort of image we want in the world market. We must look like cowboys. </PARA>
<PARA>We certainly did, because the international community generally-I expect somewhat to the surprise of the Government-roundly condemned the introduction of this tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall when Sir Leon Brittan, one of the European Commissioners, visited Australia last year. In my conversations with him, like most Australian politicians, I put very strongly the case for the European Community to reduce its levels of protection in agriculture and to phase out its export subsidies. I explained to him, as must have been explained to him by dozens before me, that this policy of the European Community was doing untold damage to the livelihoods of our farmers. His response to me, apart from some rather feeble defence of the common agricultural policy, was, `Well, you can criticise us, but look at the sorts of the things you are doing in Australia. For example, you have introduced this luxury car tax which increases the effective rate of protection on your car industry against European exports to 74 per cent'. It is sort of embarrassing, although as a member of the Liberal Party I was able to say to Sir Leon that we did not support this legislation and that, on election to government, would immediately repeal it. </PARA>
<PARA> The gist of Sir Leon's comments has been more embarrassing for the Government than just those occasional conversations which I know both the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) had with him. It has been broadly embarrassing to Australia because of our approach to international trade issues. We are going around the world saying that the international community should liberalise trade, especially agricultural trade. That is exactly the right thing for us to be saying. As a country we have no alternative but to pursue that policy. But we cannot go telling all other countries that they have to give better access to Australian exports while at the same time we are saying, `We will inhibit access of your exports to the Australian market. We do not want your exports in Australia; we do not want to buy terrible foreign cars in this country. But we want to make you buy Australian wool, Australian wheat, Australian beef and coal and so on'. We cannot do that; we cannot get away with that sort of approach to international trade negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> This luxury car tax made us a laughing-stock. Thank goodness that it will finally be repealed. It was economically irrational. If it was designed to stir up envy in the community-this was not a particularly decent thing to do-it was also designed to bring in some revenue. In fact, by the end of last year, the car industry was claiming that the Government, in the short life of the tax, had lost some $163m of sales tax revenue because it depressed demand for luxury vehicles, including Australian produced luxury vehicles, to such an extent that tax revenue was lower than it would have been had the tax been kept at its original lower rate. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that the Government estimates are not very accurate. They were probably compiled for political reasons. I can imagine the Treasurer sitting in his office with a pencil and changing the estimate of the Australian Taxation Office. The Government officially estimates that the repeal will cost $15m in lost revenue this year. We will never really know the answer to that, but I can assure the House that I am extremely suspicious. It would be very interesting to compare the original submission of the Australian Taxation Office with the final figure that emerged from the Treasurer's office. I bet that there is a difference, but I am not certain. In any case, the tax is being repealed, and that is good. It cleans up a mess and a major embarrassment for Australia in the international forum. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I should add that the rate of sales tax on our motor vehicle industry is still very high. I come from South Australia, where people such as Mr Bannon run around saying that this car industry is absolutely essential to South Australia's and Australia's livelihood. I do not deny this; it is a very important industry to our country and we passionately hope that it will prosper. But it is worth remembering that the Government imposes a very high level of sales tax-20 per cent and 30 per cent-on vehicles manufactured in Australia and subsequently sold within the Australian market. Some things do not attract any sales tax at all. On the one hand, the Government is saying that it really cares about the car industry and that it is vastly important; on the other hand, it is saying that it will tax it at a very high rate-at a much higher rate than that applying to ballroom gowns and meals at the most expensive restaurants in Canberra. Of course, I would not know which ones they would be, so I could not name them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a simple proposition: why does the Government tax such an important industry as the car industry at such a high level and not tax a range of goods and services in other sections of the economy? The present situation does not make sense, and it underlines the need for a goods and services tax which treats all goods and services on a level basis so that the Government is not picking winners and discriminating against losers such as the car industry. Of course, a goods and services tax would have the advantage of reducing the level of sales tax on motor vehicles, thereby making motor vehicles a little cheaper. There are many irrational Government policies and there is still more to do than just repealing this iniquitous proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill before the House is the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991-rather originally named. This provides for small businesses to remit their sales tax on a quarterly rather than a monthly basis. I particularly welcome that measure. During the period that I was the shadow Minister for small business in 1988 and 1989, it was those monthly remittances of sales tax which were the cause of some of the most frequent complaints from the small business community which, I know-as the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) pointed out earlier-suffered very much from cash flow problems; small businesses were not paid by their customers as quickly as the Treasury demanded sales tax should be paid to it. So it is obvious that that created a significant cash flow problem. I therefore welcome this measure and I am sure that the small business community will warmly welcome the measure. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, if we had a goods and services tax, that too would simplify the sales tax system all around. I note that in New Zealand the small business community has to remit the goods and services payments only on a six monthly basis rather than a quarterly basis, so it has doubled the time that is available in Australia even under this admittedly rather progressive proposal. In Canada, with the new goods and services tax which it is in the process of introducing, remittances will be required to be made quarterly. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) made a few general comments about the goods and services tax. I thought I might pick up a couple of those points. First, we are getting from the other side of the House-from the Labor Party-a quite disingenuous and dishonest argument really that the goods and services tax is a frightful thing. Let us remember that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) did go in 1985 to the Taxation Summit arguing for his option C, which was for a goods and services tax. When he found it politically difficult to do he decided he would argue the other case. </PARA>
<PARA> He walked away from the hard, political decision and now he goes around arguing against himself. It does not really enhance his credibility to do that, I would have to say. Also, it is interesting to note that through the life of this Government it has been progressively broadening the base of our existing wholesale sales tax. It cannot go around arguing that a broadly-based consumption tax is a terrible thing on the one hand, and on the other hand saying that it is going to broaden the base of its existing wholesale tax. Anybody can see that. It is a completely inconsistent argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The goods and services tax will, as I have explained already through this speech, be much more neutral in its effect on economic activity than the current ramshackle wholesale sales tax. It will also catch-as the honourable member for Perth pointed out-the cash economy and will have the effect of increasing revenue; although he is a little confused about whether that would be the case or not. It will have the effect of exempting altogether exports from any form of sales tax which, even with the Government's amendments in its industry statement, is still not the case, and that will reduce Australian export prices by somewhere in the vicinity-it is a bit hard to be sure-of 2 per cent or $1 billion, which will give Australia a competitive boost, which is something this country desperately needs. </PARA>
<PARA> It will improve the capacity of people to save. It does not necessarily mean they will save more, but a goods and services tax will improve their capacity to save-the option for them to save. It will give people more choice as to what to do with their pay packet than they currently have because of the Government confiscation of such a large proportion of it. Finally, it will give people a greater incentive to earn that extra dollar through a bit of overtime or whatever. Incentive is what ultimately will drive this economy towards recovery and prosperity and resolve its balance of payments problems. </PARA>
<PARA> So, reducing the burden of direct taxation on people and having an equitable across-the-board goods and services tax will improve incentive. It will improve the capacity to save; it will improve our export performance; and it will largely get rid of the cash economy. So it is a very progressive proposal, a proposal which will turn into reality after the next election when at last economic rationalism will dominate Australian decision making. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to address this cognate debate today on these two Bills-the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) and the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). The purpose of the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) is to reduce the rate of sales tax on luxury vehicles from 50 per cent to 30 per cent. The reduction proposed by this Bill was announced in the 12 March statement by the Government in the document entitled Building a Competitive Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is less than one year ago that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his 1990 Budget announced that the rate of sales tax on luxury vehicles was to be increased from 30 to 50 per cent. As the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) warned this House at the time, this Government introduced legislation to increase the sales tax on luxury cars to 50 per cent; it was never a sound proposition. The Government was warned, not just by the honourable member for Curtin but by many in the industry, especially the Motor Trades Association of Australia Ltd, which claimed that the increased sales tax rate of 50 per cent would be self-defeating. The Association correctly predicted that, because of the increased tax, sales would be drastically reduced and, therefore, the amount of tax able to be collected would be reduced. As the honourable member for Curtin said at the time, the 50 per cent tax would have a negative effect on revenue, and that is exactly what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> The motives of the Government in originally increasing the sales tax to 50 per cent can only be described as motives of greed. It thought it saw an opening to rip off one sector of the private economy by hasty, ill-conceived legislation. By reducing this sales tax on luxury vehicles, the Government has acknowledged that its policy of just eight months ago has been an abject failure. Not only has there been a dramatic drop in sales, but also hundreds of jobs have been lost in the service and maintenance industries-jobs that have already gone, jobs filled by people trying to pay mortgages and maintain a family, jobs that this Government was warned would be lost if it pursued the 50 per cent sales tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Previously viable businesses became the innocent victims of the effect that the 50 per cent rate had on the luxury car industry. The Government estimated a revenue of $105m from the 50 per cent rate, but it was too greedy by half. Industry representatives have indicated that the 50 per cent rate has already cost the Government $163m and that it could cost the Government $400m in a full year. The Government claims that the reduction of the rate from 50 to 30 per cent represents a cost to revenue of $15m in 1990-91 and $45m in 1991-92. I might add that those claims are unsubstantiated. But what has been the cost to industry-a cost in both financial and human terms? That could have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> The action of the Government in increasing the rate on luxury cars to 50 per cent is an example of the insatiable appetite the Treasurer has exhibited for extending sales tax. The 1982-83 revenue raised from sales tax was $3,490m. That has increased to $10,668m for 1990-91, a total of 11.1 per cent of total taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) is to provide for quarterly payments of sales tax, rather than on a monthly basis as at present, for businesses which have an annual sales tax liability of $50,000 or less for the financial year, and this will be indexed annually. That sales tax will be required to be paid within 21 days of the end of each quarter. This is certainly in line with one of the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the frequency of remittances for those on low sales tax liability be reduced from monthly to quarterly. </PARA>
<PARA>This is, at least, some improvement on the current system where businesses, especially small businesses, are required to pay sales tax within 21 days of the end of the month in which the transaction occurs. This creates cash flow problems for small business in particular, as many of these small businesses have to pay the sales tax before they have received payment from their customers. </PARA>
<PARA> This negative cash flow has been particularly acute in the past few years because small businesses have had to borrow at high interest rates in order to maintain a cash flow for their business. There has also been a growing concern by many manufacturers and wholesalers about the increasing market influence of retailers who have been able to extract more favourable credit terms and extend their period of credit. We will never know just how many small businesses have been forced to close their doors because of the impact of monthly remittance with regard to the sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> Although both of these Bills are an improvement on the current sales tax legislation that they are replacing and they will assist business in some small way-and I support them for that-they are part of an obsolete, patchwork wholesale sales tax system that was introduced by the Scullin Government in 1930, designed initially to compensate for the effect of the Depression on other forms of tax revenue. It has been changed in a haphazard manner since that time, with many exemptions being granted and the initial single rate being replaced by multiple rates, until it is now full of anomalies, inconsistencies and interpretational problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I am amazed that this Government has had the audacity to include the recommendations in relation to the wholesale sales tax system that have formed the genesis of these Bills today in its document entitled Building a Competitive Australia. If this Government were genuinely concerned about building a competitive Australia, it would abolish the wholesale sales tax system and replace it with a single rate goods and services tax. The very fact that it is making some changes is an acknowledgment that the current wholesale sales tax system is unfair to business and places an extra cost on business, especially in the administration of the wholesale sales tax system, and is effectively reducing the competitiveness of business. This is especially so for export industries-those very industries which we depend upon to make us a competitive country in international trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University has estimated that 10 per cent of wholesale sales tax falls on exports, and that is over $1 billion per year. The Hughes report also noted the substantial indirect tax burden falling on exports through the taxation of inputs. The report also estimated that the total indirect tax burden absorbed by Australian exporters amounted to some 6 per cent of export revenue in the 1982-83 period alone, approximately double that imposed on British exports. This does not make us into a competitive country. Every aspect of the current wholesale sales tax system is disadvantaging Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already referred to the problems that the current system has on cash flow to business. Although the second Bill we are debating today moves in some way to alleviate this problem, it does absolutely nothing to address the problems of the administrative complexity of a system that is daunting just in the sheer volume of the entire legislation. There are more than 25 Acts with accompanying regulations, written in a language belonging to another era that is often difficult to understand and containing phrases that give wide discretionary power to the Commissioner of Taxation. For example, there are phrases such as `if in the opinion of the Commissioner' or, as is the case in another part of the legislation, `if the Commissioner is satisfied as to' whatever the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation does absolutely nothing to correct the complexity of disputes that constantly arise out of the sales tax system-disputes concerning classification of goods, ascertaining the true wholesale price and the meaning of manufacturing and conditional exemptions, just to name a few of the problems. It is one thing to change the administration of the wholesale sales tax system by changing when the sales tax will be remitted, but this does not address the problem of the multiple rates at which the tax is levied and the various exemptions in the classification of goods to the appropriate schedules. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give just a couple of examples out of thousands of anomalies. Item 35a (1) of the first schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act specially exempts ginseng tea from sales tax. However, those who prefer to make their ginseng tea from a product labelled ginseng extract have been told that the extract is liable to tax at the general rate. The question of classification of some wardrobes and so-called built-in cupboards, such as broom cupboards, has frequently and over many years been the subject of differing interpretations by the Australian Taxation Office and the trade in different States. At one stage, for example, tests such as the provision of screws to build in a wardrobe or the absence of a back have been used to differentiate exempt built-in joinery from taxable free standing furniture. Such classification wrangles frequently involve business in appeals with the Australian Taxation Office. The packaging, printing and plastics industries have all been engaged in such long, drawn-out wrangles. </PARA>
<PARA> New products have proved to be an administrative nightmare, again a problem not addressed by this legislation. Many new products have tended to be classified by the Tax Office on the basis of gaining maximum revenue. Businesses have to face the cost of appeal. However, if business has a decision made in its favour, the Tax Office will frequently appeal to a higher court and insist that the tax is payable in accordance with its interpretation of law until the matter is finally resolved by the higher court. This places businesses in an invidious position. If they act on the lower court decision, should that decision ultimately be overturned, often years later, the parties are then unable to recover the tax from customers and so must bear the cost from their own resources. However, should the taxpayers charge and return tax to the Tax Office on the basis of the Tax Office view, they may not be able to recover that tax when it becomes overpaid tax on an ultimate decision by the higher court to dismiss the Tax Office appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> It is because of the day-to-day nature of the wholesale sales tax system that businesses and especially small businesses often feel inhibited from exercising their objection and appeal rights. Businesses need, under the current wholesale sales tax system, to be able to assess their liability daily, but the current objection and appeal process provides neither speed nor certainty of resolution. Again, this obviously disadvantages businesses, rather than improving their efficiency and increasing their competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> By changing the time allowed for business to remit its sales tax, this legislation ignores the myriad problems inherent in the current wholesale sales tax system. What it does, in fact, is highlight all the inconsistencies and anomalies. It highlights the fact that major change is needed. The more this Government changes the current legislation, the more distortions, the more anomalies, the more inconsistencies are highlighted. The more this Government fiddles with rates of tax, as is contained in the first Bill we are debating today, the more it increases the administrative complexity. The more this Government tinkers with this current system, the more complex it makes the legislation and the more difficult it becomes to classify goods, to determine the rate of tax, to decide on conditional exemptions, actually to arrive at a definition of true wholesale price and exactly what constitutes manufacturing. It just becomes a minefield. </PARA>
<PARA> The only way to overcome all these problems and give business a fighting chance to survive and help build a competitive Australia is to abolish this current patchwork of wholesale sales tax system and replace it with a goods and services tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly is. Only a goods and services tax system will remove these distortions, minimise avoidance, keep administrative and compliance cost to an absolute minimum and allow our exporters to compete on a level playing field.

<PARA> There is little, if any, incentive for businesses in this country today to save and invest, and yet this is what must happen if we are to keep and improve our position as a significant economic power in our region. That is just not going to happen unless we abolish the current iniquitous system of wholesale sales tax and the prohibition it places on the creation of competitive business and, in particular, the export sectors of our economy. It must be replaced with a single, simple, easily understood goods and services tax with minimal compliance cost. That is what is needed to boost the efficiency, productivity and competition for business. In the absence of this real structural form, I support the two sales tax amendment Bills before the House because the decision by this Government yet again only to amend the current system will at least give some small relief to business. </PARA>

<PARA> The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) and the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) are indicative of the mess the Government has got the country into. It is a small area sales tax. It earns massive revenue. The Government has increased its revenue from this area over the last eight years by 136 per cent and yet it claims that it disagrees with indirect taxes. There has been a massive grab at indirect taxes by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), extended beyond all thought of the original concept of wholesale sales tax. Yet the Treasurer continues to say that it is not a part of a reasoned indirect tax policy instigated by him. It matches, in fact, the tax grab that has been foisted on the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is condemned for failing to acknowledge the benefits of an indirect tax system which allows people with their money to make choices in purchasing and by that process contribute to the tax system while at the same time reducing massively the personal income tax that they are forced to pay each week or each month. </PARA>
<PARA> A shift in the tax system is critical to Australia's future. The bottom line is that each week there would be more money in a person's pocket and there would then be a tax on goods and services which would allow those people with more money in their pockets to make the choices they want. If they choose a Mercedes over a Laser they will pay more for that Mercedes through the indirect sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> The stupidity of trying to foist on the Australian community a luxury car tax was condemned from its instigation. The Fraser Government attempted something like that. It had only to check back through the books to realise the impossible nature of it. But ideology won the day and over there in the party room of the Australian Labor Party the left wing ideologues came out and said we must prevent imports from attacking Australian industry. There is not much debate about imports attacking Australian industry. But the attempt to rectify that situation with a luxury car sales tax put people out of jobs, closed down dealers and resulted in a loss of revenue of about $200m for the Government. What an ill-conceived concept that was. It did not help Australian industry or Australian employment one bit. It lost the Government $200m and now, months after its failure, the Government has decided to remove the luxury car sales tax. No apologies were made for the damage done. There was just a flick past by the Treasurer as he introduced the 12 May statement and that was all he was prepared to say. The Treasurer was not prepared to acknowledge what a disaster the whole concept had been from beginning to end or the damage and loss of revenue it had caused. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian car manufacturers are improving the quality of their product, they are improving their productivity, they are improving output and quality, but they still have a long way to go to match foreign cars. That is a matter that concerns all Australians because it is inherent in our system that governments are burgeoning and interventionist, and the workplace practices that we have in this country will not allow people the incentive they need to go out and use their talents, their creativity and their skills to build a more effective and dynamic Australian economy. So it is acknowledged that the automobile industry is a problem, but so is much of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Having dealt with the luxury car sales tax which is removed by these measures, I want to turn to the Government's proposals for small business. I am very pleased to see the Minister responsible for that area, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), sitting at the table. This must mark, I think, his only achievement since he has been the Minister. His single achievement has been to have small businesses be able to put off the date of payment of sales tax to three months instead of being forced to pay it monthly. They have still got to pay it, and with the rapidly declining economy that we have, it is not going to alleviate their problems. If somebody in a stressed cash situation decides to postpone his payment and take up the three-month option, what is going to happen to him? It only means that there will be a bigger bill later on. The increase that the Government talks about in the sales such people will make or in the income they will earn is just window dressing. There is not going to be anything there for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The economy is in deep recession and moving more deeply into recession. One has only to look at the headlines in newspapers today of surveys conducted amongst businesses and manufacturers around Australia to see that they are not optimistic; they are expecting things to get worse. We on this side of the House know that they will get worse, despite the sunshine talk from the Government. Talking the economy up will not produce the results the Government wants. Trying to present it, as the Treasurer has, as being not as bad as it really is will not help the inherent problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst this legislation does allow some more flexibility in the payment of sales tax, it does not remove any sales tax. The requirement is still there that after a three-month period the payment must be made within 21 days. The Government foists on the Australian people conditions of payment that it is not prepared to keep. I would like to meet any Australian businessman or any Australian person who has actually received a timely payment from the Government for money that the Government owes them. It does not matter whether it is tax assessments-one's tax assessment cheque coming back through the mail-or a product or service supplied to government. Governments, especially this Government, are not timely in the payment of their liabilities, but expect the community to present its money right to the dot of the hour or suffer the penalties. The 21-day period that is allowed for people to pay sales tax is an impost that really cannot work in the current climate. </PARA>
<PARA> Business credits run to 30, 60 or 90 days. A lot of them are running out to 120 days at the moment as people are finding it difficult to pay. Yet the Government comes forward with the great innovation of a three-month postponement of sales tax, but one must pay within 21 days. If the Government were to adopt the policy that it foists on others-paying in a timely fashion, within 21 days-that would be a big boost to the economy. That would be worthwhile; people would actually have their money and be able to do things with the money that the Government rightly owes them. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the settlement of many tax assessments for simple personal income tax returns in my area took until March, April or May. Ones that were more complicated ran beyond that date-and there was the Government using taxpayers' funds unjustifiably for a period of six or eight months beyond the due date of payment or return to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government argues that it is complicated, that it has to look at things, that it is getting better and that it has got computer systems. The Government does not worry about those sorts of things when it demands payments from the Australian community. The Government says, `You pay on time or suffer the penalties'. I believe the Government should pay the penalties and the legislation put forward by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) which states that the Government should make timely payments is something the Opposition is going to endorse in government. It will force government agencies to pay in a timely fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes the Government has introduced in this legislation are extensive. The change relating to the luxury car sales tax is an important one. It is late, impossible in concept, but at least has been removed. A slight change, a slight modification which is welcomed relates to the payment of sales tax by small businesses. There is a whole raft of proposals to remove wholesale sales tax from inputs to export industries. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some really weird concepts in the way in which the Government is going to apply this wholesale sales tax exemption for exporting businesses. For instance, if one were to take the goods used in transportation, one finds that it is very selective in the way in which it is applying the exemption. For example, exemptions are provided for products that are going to be transported by rail, pipeline or conveyor-the government operated services-but there is nothing for road or shipping. So it is very selective and narrow and the input impact, to put the best interpretation on it, is marginal. </PARA>
<PARA> The wholesale sales tax is going to be removed from tools. I see a lot of farmers and a lot of other exporters becoming the local hardware shop as they are able to gain access to wholesale sales tax exemption for the purchase of hand tools. There are anomalies here and I just do not know how the Government is going to police them. It has opened up a can of worms by exempting from wholesale sales tax a whole range of input products which the Government says is going to help our export industries. To some degree it will help our export industries. However, the concept is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> In its fetish to avoid a review of the whole sales tax area and in that way not agree with the Opposition, the Government has contrived a whole series of complicated measures that come close to what the Opposition wants but which do not quite reach our goal. In that way, the Government can claim that our proposals are foolish and impractical and at the same time adopt similar practices and claim that they are distinct. The trouble with adopting the technique that the Government has used is that it has foist on the Australian community reams of legislation, impossible policing procedures and impractical taxes at the same time. It is unreasonable to think the Australian community can tolerate, or go on tolerating, the ramshackle system that is our wholesale sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> Previous speakers have spoken about inconsistencies that apply. The Treasurer can wear his Italian suit and pay no sales tax on it. If a person were to purchase, until recently, tools for his employment, they were subject to sales tax. A wedding gown is not subject to sales tax and nor are other clothes. Orange juice is subject to sales tax. Confectionery is interesting because a biscuit covered by chocolate in some instances is a biscuit and in other instances is confectionery. Put a Kit Kat in one's mouth and one is paying sales tax. Put an Arnott's biscuit in one's mouth and one is not. What is the difference? It is crazy stuff. It is time we scrapped this system and had something reasonable in its place. </PARA>
<PARA> The only approach that can be adopted is the scrapping of the wholesale sales tax system and inserting in its place a goods and services tax which is consistent. The wholesale sales tax is only a small part of building competitive industry in Australia. The economy and its management are what is wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. In view of what has become a convention of our system of government, which requires public officials to stand down from their duties when they are subject to allegations of impropriety-and there have been many such precedents-will the Prime Minister request Mr Brian Burke to stand down and, if he will not, will he recall him from active duty as our ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I would remind him that this question has been raised with me previously in this House. I would not accept, in the unqualified way in which he puts it, that there is some convention that where allegations are made against someone it is necessary that that person should stand down. Members of this House will recall, I think, that when I was asked this question previously I said that I have a profound belief in the proposition and principle that a man or a woman is innocent until proven guilty. I think it introduces into the affairs of our society a very dangerous condition if the mere fact of someone making an allegation, whether it be against a politician or an official, is regarded as sufficient or necessary that the person against whom the allegation is levelled should be required to stand down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think if the Leader of the Opposition were to think this through, he would see immediately the dangers of such a proposition. If, in the extremely unlikely event I were to find that the Leader of the Opposition were causing me some difficulty in this place-as I say, that would be an extremely unlikely proposition-all that would need to happen would be for someone to make an allegation against the propriety of the Leader of the Opposition and it would follow that he would be required to stand down.</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members-It happens every day.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. Someone can simply stand up and say that at some unspecified time the Leader of the Opposition had acted with impropriety, that he had done something illegal. According to the Leader of the Opposition's proposition, he should then stand down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply say this: what we are faced with at this stage are allegations. They are, of course, serious allegations. I am not in any way trying-and I do not think I have tried before-to suggest that the allegations do not have serious content. But I resist strongly the proposition-and I would seriously hope that it would be a resistance shared across party lines- that once we have a situation that there is a mere allegation, the person stands down.</PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members opposite will know if they look at my record, I have not sought in this place to take advantage of the difficulties that have been endured by some members of their coalition party in New South Wales. But I simply, because the question has been asked, make the point that in regard to Mr Murray-and I make no innuendo, inference or implication about Mr Murray-there is a situation in New South Wales where there were serious allegations made against Mr Murray. To the best of my knowledge, Mr Murray did not stand down, nor, in my judgment, according to the principle that I am putting, should he have.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I referred to this issue in the House a couple of weeks ago. Since then this study has been published, and I will refer to it again. I notice that today the shadow Minister for small business, the honourable member for Forrest, has called on the Government to abolish the wholesale sales tax. Referring to a meeting I am to have today with the National Small Business Forum, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>At the top of the agenda must be the abolition of the existing ramshackle wholesale sales tax and the introduction of a goods and services tax.</PARA>
<PARA>I am at a loss to know how a 20 per cent tax on hardware or a 20 per cent tax on motel rooms or a 20 per cent tax on cab fares or a 20 per cent tax on fruit and vegetables or a 20 per cent tax on plumbing or on painting can be of any material assistance to small business. It is beyond me. This will be the first business group ever to say, `Please levy a tax on us and make us collect it'.</PARA>
<PARA> As usual, it is a further, and another, regressive policy from the Opposition. If one looks at the Opposition's policies, regression runs the whole gamut of them: the consumption tax, the mooted abolition of company tax, as the shadow Minister puts it in his press release, the abolition of the capital gains tax, the levying of income tax at the State level, zero wage increases, a zero inflation target to be brought about by a draconian monetary policy, health vouchers, education vouchers, no lump sums for workers until they are aged 65, and $3 billion in cuts on Government spending levied mainly on the weak. No Opposition in my time has ever campaigned on a more regressive, savage, partisan policy than that.</PARA>
<PARA> This is what we are seeing from the Leader of the Opposition. He is just another conservative politician, as he demonstrated very aptly yesterday with his ill chosen, untimely attack upon the Australian Labor Party in the course of a condolence motion, and in a totally unprecedented way.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is the honourable member for Bennelong-he is embarrassed about us sending up his Leader. There is a notion that the Leader of the Opposition is not really a political person but a public do-gooder wandering the political stage looking for opportunities to do good works. He showed yesterday that he is just another savage Liberal politician who is prepared, even in a condolence motion, to get into the rough and tumble of Australian politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This savage politician brings with him a load of policies that would make Malcolm Fraser and Bill McMahon wince, or anyone else who was associated with the policies of the post-Menzies era. These are nothing but policies of regression, of hardship. Whether it be a consumption tax or the abolition of the capital gains tax or zero wage increases or health vouchers or education vouchers, these are simply the policies of somebody who does not care for anyone west of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. West of the Sydney Harbour Bridge they are out of his reckoning.</PARA>
<PARA> We are supposed to say, `That's all right, John, you can be the visiting professor who does not have policies but drops issues that are savage attacks upon most Australians'. We are supposed to say, `That's all right; that is all in the interests of public debate. Really, you are not a very political person, even though you will beat-up in the middle of a condolence motion'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Prime Minister confirm that, shortly before the 1987 election, together with the then Premier Brian Burke, he co-hosted a Labor Party fundraising lunch at the Premier's suite, Capita Centre in Perth? Is it a fact that at, or as a result of, that lunch Mr Laurie Connell pledged $250,000 to the Government's re-election campaign, and that other guests, including Mr Alan Bond, Mr John Roberts and Mr John Horgan, pledged similar amounts?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2280" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the Opposition has at last leapt the hurdle of hypocrisy on this matter, because it is part of a coalition which at the State level has presided over the most despicable, grubby and proven exhibition of corruption in the history of this country; of course, I refer to the State of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come directly to the question asked by the honourable member. It is a matter of record that in Perth in June of 1987 I attended a lunch organised by Mr Burke and his office. Also present were a number of businessmen, some of whom have been referred to or are witnesses before the current Western Australian royal commission. Mr Burke told me that at the lunch he intended to seek financial support for the Federal Australian Labor Party (ALP).</PARA>
<PARA> At the lunch I spoke about the performance and the policies of my Government and, may I say, about the hopelessness of the Opposition-which was as true then as it is today-and why, as a result of the combination of the record of this Government and the hopelessness of the alternative, it would be appropriate that the ALP should be supported.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is perfectly normal and proper for a political leader to attend and speak at such a function, and it has been done, as those on both sides of this House know, by leaders of political parties for time immemorial in this country. There is nothing unusual about it whatsoever. In the event, I have no recollection of being involved in any discussion about specific donations. I have no personal first-hand knowledge of what donations, if any, were made during or after this lunch.</PARA>
<PARA> I have noted public comments by a former National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, now Senator Bob McMullan, of funds being transferred from Western Australia to the ALP's National Secretariat, but again I have no personal knowledge of such transfers. I am informed, and I wish to stress, that the Federal ALP has fully met the requirements of the electoral Act governing disclosure of donations. The fact is-and I can say this after eight years in this Government-that no-one buys favours from this Government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are used to empty hilarity from those opposite. In eight years the record of this Government is absolutely impeccable. Let me remind the House that it was this Government that in 1984 enacted the first laws compelling the public disclosure of some donations to political parties. It was those parties opposite-the Liberal and National parties-which up until that time had ensured that all donations were kept secret. Even in 1984 the coalition of the party represented by the honourable member who asked the question and the National Party-the coalition-strongly resisted this Government's efforts to allow people to know who was giving money to political parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Looking to the future on this matter-at this stage we on this side of the House welcome the stated attitude of the Leader of the Opposition, who has said, up to this point, that he is in favour of disclosure. I trust that on this matter of principle the Leader of the Opposition will, just for once, stand up and resist those in the Liberal Party who want to return to the Dark Ages. I know that the stand of the Leader of the Opposition-or, what shall we call it, his disposition or his predilection?-on this matter is going to be sorely tested, so let me give the Leader of the Opposition some ammunition that he might use when he is pressed within the coalition to walk away from that disposition.</PARA>
<PARA> These are quotes from the report of Mr Adrian Roden, QC, Assistant Commissioner of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, who conducted the 1990 Inquiry into North Coast Land Development. The first quote is from page 527, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA>So long as substantial donations can be made to political parties or candidates without public disclosure, they can be used to purchase influence. The law that allows secret political donations, creates conditions conducive to corrupt conduct.</PARA>
<PARA>I turn to page 529:</PARA>
<PARA>The four and five figure sums mentioned in this Inquiry, are substantial, but are probably dwarfed by other donations political parties receive. With the mounting cost of campaign advertising, parties must be increasingly vulnerable to attempts by substantial donors to exert influence.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that this Government was the first government to take steps to provide for disclosure. It is now a matter of public record that we will proceed to seek to legislate for full disclosure, and those opposite will be tested. They can put their vote where their mouth now partially is. We will give them the opportunity to support, in this House and in the other place, legislation which will provide for full disclosure of donations to a political party, and then we will see where they stand.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. May I say that, for the very good reasons outlined by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy yesterday in this place, this Government has decided, as a matter of policy, against adopting a guaranteed minimum price for wheat. There is the Government's position-a clear decision of policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But, Mr Speaker, inevitably the Opposition has no policy position. Instead it speaks with two contradictory voices. I remind the House that, on 1 March this year, the Deputy Leader of the National Party called for a deficiency payment or underwriting for wheat growers for the coming season. And, Mr Speaker, let it be noted the terms in which he spoke. In fact, he referred to `the coalition's policy of underwriting'. It was not an expression of a personal view by the Deputy Leader of the National Party. His words were that he was expressing the coalition's policy of underwriting. Moreover, may I say that he irresponsibly claimed that, in the absence of some immediate assistance to the wheat industry, Australia may not have any wheat to sell. So there we have it, on 1 March, the Deputy Leader of the National Party announcing coalition policy.</PARA>
<PARA> Just three days later, however, the Leader of the Opposition claimed in his now very familiar bubblegum style:</PARA>
<PARA>We have not put a position on the grain industry yet, although I have expressed a disposition against trying to help a very efficient industry by giving them a dose of inefficiency.</PARA>
<PARA>So, Mr Speaker, just three days after the National Party announced coalition policy for the grains industry, the Leader of the Opposition says the coalition does not have a policy and, moreover, indicates a disposition against underwriting or a guaranteed minimum price.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me say this: we on this side of the House are not interested in the dispositions of the Leader of the Opposition; we are not interested in his personal views. But Mr Speaker, more importantly on this matter, I would suggest the wheat growers in this country are not interested in his personal views. What they want are policies-and so does the electorate. We could simply ask members of the coalition again: what is your policy on the question of the joint United States-Australian facilities? What is the coalition policy on this question of a guaranteed minimum price?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, this simply gets down in the end to nothing more or less than a test of leadership of the Leader of the Opposition. The question is: have you got the guts to pull the National Party into line so that what is at this stage your disposition in fact becomes a coalition policy; or will what was announced on 1 March by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, in contra-distinction to your personal view, be the coalition policy? Make up your mind and become a leader.</PARA>

In arriving at the decision in 1987 not to tax gold mining for a further three years, the Government's position was not determined by the views of Mr Burke, Mr Connell or any other individual.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I forget which one it was. The Opposition swaps them around. It was either Peacock or Howard. Mr Speaker, the gold mining industry had got that commitment from the then Leader of the Opposition and a similar statement was sought from the Government.

But we responded to the request from the Gold Mining Industry Council by confirming in writing to it that we would not tax gold mining during our next term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words, this was an issue which was put right at the forefront of the campaign. The industry had approached the Opposition and had got a commitment from the Opposition. It asked us and we gave in writing to the Gold Mining Industry Council the commitment that we would not tax gold mining during our next term. But may I say that it was this Government which in May 1988 announced that this particular distortion of the tax system-one of the many distortions of the tax system over which honourable members opposite presided for so long-created by the Liberal Party and politicised by it would end from January 1991.

<PARA> With hundreds of thousands of Kurdish refugees moving into Turkey and Iran, there is no doubt that the international relief agencies have been simply overwhelmed with the dimension of the emergency. Because of the enormity of this emergency not only in Turkey and Iran, but also inside Iraq as the Kurds attempt to escape, the allied forces are now complementing the relief agency efforts by carrying out emergency relief air drops. Australia has been invited to participate, and has accepted, to provide relief goods for this air drop.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Science and Technology in his capacity as Minister Assisting the Treasurer. I refer the Minister to the action of the oil companies which significantly increased petrol prices just prior to the Easter period and to his subsequent announcement last week concerning a joint Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) and Trade Practices Commission (TPC) investigation into oil company pricing policies. I ask: is the Minister aware that the Motor Traders Association of Australia (MTAA), which represents certain petrol retailers, has described such an investigation as `a waste of time and effort'? In view of the widespread criticism amongst service station proprietors and motorists alike at the petrol pricing practices of the oil companies, how does he respond to the MTAA claim?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I recognise the close scrutiny that he has undertaken in ensuring benefits to consumers in terms of reasonable petrol prices. I am aware of the comments that have been made by the Motor Traders Association. Quite frankly, apart from the fact that it is very partisan, it is wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me just give the House some background to the circumstances that led to us making the announcement, as a government, of the inquiry. Over the past six months the Prices Surveillance Authority alone has received in excess of 4,000 complaints from consumers, distributors and independent petrol station owners about the pricing practices of oil companies.</PARA>
<PARA> In the days leading up to Easter the price of petrol rose by up to 9c in Sydney, 5c in Melbourne and Adelaide, and 3c in Brisbane. That was despite the fact that the maximum wholesale price set by the Prices Surveillance Authority has not changed in more than a month. It is true that prior to that rise there had been substantial discounting, particularly in the Sydney and Melbourne markets. It is also true that consumers benefit from that outcome. But it was an extraordinary situation when on the Thursday prior to the Easter rush-when all sorts of people are on the road and when the demand for petrol is at its highest-miraculously all that discounting disappeared and by some sort of decision, which is what we are trying to find out about, the price went up. But that is just related to the consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the consumers, and quite apart from the franchisee operators that the Motor Traders Association represents, there are other players in the industry. They are the independent retailers and the distributors of fuel. Both of these groups have complained, not just to the Prices Surveillance Authority but to the Trade Practices Commission, about collusion they allege has occurred amongst oil companies that has resulted in discriminatory pricing practices. Selective price support schemes have been alleged by them and, more specifically, collusion between two companies which has resulted in the price to franchisee holders coming down but not to distributors and independents. It is little wonder, therefore, that the Motor Traders Association, which represents the franchisees, says that it is a waste of time. It represents that section of the industry that may have benefited from the selective pricing practices.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a responsibility to a wider community than just one section of the petrol retailing industry. That is what we are discharging. The inquiry that the Government has sought is being pursued jointly by the Prices Surveillance Authority and the Trade Practices Commission, whose responsibility is with the Attorney-General. Rather than waste resources and funds, it will not involve any additional resources but will pool the resources of both of those bodies. The Trade Practices Commission has the capacity to look at the competitive activities of companies and whether or not collusion exists. The role of the Prices Surveillance Authority is to monitor and also have the ability to fix prices at the wholesale maximum level. This step is consistent with the commitment that the Government has made to ensure that there will be competition in this economy and, more importantly, that the benefits of that competition will be passed on to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the TPC and the PSA are involved together is consistent with what the Prime Minister announced in the economic statement on 12 March about the closer cooperation between these two bodies. Out of that we hope to be able to get some options so that our task of ensuring that benefits are passed on to consumers will succeed.</PARA>
<PARA> The one final point that I would make is that, whereas we are effectively using the role of the Prices Surveillance Authority in this exercise, together with the Trade Practices Commission, we should compare our approach with that of the Opposition. The only thing that has been stated on the record as Opposition policy in this matter is where the Leader of the National Party, speaking on behalf of the coalition, has said that it will abolish the Prices Surveillance Authority.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that the honourable member has already almost answered his own question. It is a fact that in the gallery there are 50 of the most outstanding young Australians-those who are the inaugural recipients of the Australian students' prize in respect of their efforts in Year 12 in 1990. These are but 50 of 500 who received the prize. Those announcements were made by the Prime Minister today, as were presentations to the 50 who are here. Someone was moved to observe that with the presence of those 50 students in the House, the average IQ of those in this chamber has gone up somewhat. I hope that as a result of their visit here they might decide to one day make a translation from up there to down here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The prize which each of them received was $2,000, which is of course a significant but small acknowledgment of their great achievement. Also in the gallery are a number of their parents, who, as I said earlier today, can be justly proud of the achievements of their sons and daughters.</PARA>
<PARA> In this country we have sometimes been a little reluctant to celebrate the achievements of some of our academically talented people. We are all very keen to join in the celebrations of the achievements of some of our sports stars-our gold medallists in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games and so on. We are perhaps more reluctant to celebrate the achievements of some of our brightest and most talented young Australians. This prize is a recognition of their achievements. I hope it will assist with the continuation of their studies.</PARA>
<PARA> I also make the point that in trying to acknowledge these achievements, we are moving on a number of fronts. We are now supporting financially the participation of young Australians in the science and mathematics olympics, which are held from time to time internationally. Australia's participation in those olympics has been somewhat haphazard in the past. Now, with this financial support, it can become more coordinated. I am sure that the achievements of our young mathematicians and our young physicians and chemists will improve enormously in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> I simply want to convey to those young people here today-of course, they are just a 10 per cent representation of the complete group of 500-what I am sure is the unanimous congratulations of all of us on both sides of the House on their achievements and to wish them well in their future studies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition that I do not believe there are analogies between the case of Mr Burke and those he has mentioned. If I wanted to, I could add to the example that I did not want to give earlier in this session today when I referred to New South Wales, because I think honourable members know as a matter of fact it is not my style to get into personal attacks where people on the other side of politics have suffered a misfortune and either have been found guilty or have been under some sort of charge; if honourable members look back over my record they will see I am not one who gets into the business of rubbing salt into existing wounds. It is not my style. It never has been. I am simply saying that if those opposite want to get into this business of saying, `I will point to that example', then I can point to another one and another one, and another one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I wanted to go into detail I could point to the situation where there was a royal commission here when the Opposition was in government-with regard to one of its Ministers-and the findings of that royal commission would have led most governments to the conclusion that the Minister should stand down, and should have been stood down. He did not. That is history; that is there. The judgment we have made at this point with regard to Mr Burke is that it is not appropriate, given the position that there are only allegations at this stage, that we should in fact make some judgment against him on the basis of those allegations.</PARA>
<PARA> I have not at any stage, either today or where this question has been raised before, sought to suggest that the matters raised are not serious. But against the seriousness of the as yet unproven allegations, and it is yet to be seen whether they will or will not be proven, I do not think it is appropriate to add what would appear to be a judgment by asking him to stand aside.</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to the Opposition's previous question, I indicated that if a situation arose where the actual discharge of his duties was in question-his capacity to discharge his duties-I would expect that Mr Burke would make that judgment. All I can say is that on the evidence available to me at this point I have no evidence that the Ambassador is not able to discharge his duties.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Richmond for his question. The significance of the Government's acceptance of the Florence agreement for people with disabilities enabling access to a wide range of important aids and appliances at reduced costs cannot be underestimated. The major impact-and one certainly which would be welcomed by those representative groups in the areas of disability, the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled, and the Disability Advisory Council and such groups-will be to substantially reduce the costs associated with disability which have been identified as a significant barrier to the labour force participation of people with disabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Incidentally, the issue of the additional costs associated with the labour force participation of people with disability is currently being examined by a disability task force in which a number of Government departments are represented, with the final report to be completed later this year. Australia's accession to the Florence agreement to take effect as of 1 July this year complements the Industry Commission's 1990 inquiry into aids and appliances for people with disabilities, which recommended a reduction in tariffs on such goods. As a result, the Federal Government announced that tariffs on imported pacemakers, defibrillators and wheelchairs would be reduced from 15 per cent to zero as of 1 January this year.</PARA>
<PARA> The combined impact of these two initiatives will be a substantial step for people with disabilities and represents another important step in the Government's ongoing disability agenda. As I suggested, the actions that flow from the Florence agreement have been sought for some time now. They will certainly be very broadly welcomed by representatives of various groups in this area. They are consistent with the emphasis on labour force participation where very often aids and appliances are a crucial poverty trap that make the difference between someone remaining on pensions or benefits or wholly dependent on social security and being able to make the transition across to the work force.</PARA>
<PARA> Areas of taxation and areas of customs and tariffs are, of course, extraordinarily important to the community in general. But nowhere are those imposts more important than where people approach life suffering severe or serious disabilities. Referring back to an earlier question asked today, one has to consider that the impact in terms of a movement towards a consumption tax, which may well fall upon those very appliances that I have referred to, indicates the dangers involved in taxation reform which is inequitable, which is insensitive to the needs of disadvantaged groups and which is not proposed to be backed by any kind of compensation that ensures equity for people who, if you like, have already started behind the eight ball.</PARA>
<PARA> So when we get into areas of debate such as the possible introduction of such a tax, one has to be very concerned from the point of view of people who are already seeking to achieve change and reform such as that I referred to in my answer to the question. The people who most need to be liberated from disincentives are in fact likely to suffer the greatest disincentives from a move in the direction of a consumption tax. That is why in 1986 such a tax was so strongly opposed by people in the welfare sector and why it would be very strongly opposed today.</PARA>

<PARA> That this House calls on the Government to recall the Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See pending the satisfactory resolution of allegations and other matters raised before the current Royal Commission in Western Australia relating to the conduct of the Ambassador, as the former Premier of Western Australia, and any other investigations, inquiries or proceedings which might arise therefrom. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Opposition is today calling for the Government to stand down Australia's Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See, Mr Brian Burke, until matters currently being investigated by the Western Australia Inc. royal commission are resolved. We see this as a matter of urgency. But we make this call fully aware of the seriousness of the action which we believe is now appropriate. We are doing so today on the basis of some very clear-cut principles and some established conventions. We are doing so because we believe that the allegations about corruption and election campaign funding that have been made are among the most serious in relation to our whole political system. Finally, we are doing so because we believe that our ambassadorial system, and the integrity of that system, has been put at risk by the allegations about Brian Burke. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has been raising questions on this issue in this Parliament since November 1988. Indeed, we asked one question in 1988, one in 1989, 15 in 1990 and eight so far this year. That is a total of 25 questions over 30 months in relation to the performance of those ambassadorial duties by Mr Burke. All through that period we have had nothing but stonewalling by this Government in relation to that appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> To be clear, we are not implying that any or all of these allegations being made against him are true. We are not presuming his guilt before it is objectively proven; but in response to previous questioning on this issue the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) have simply said that they will not usurp the presumption of innocence on the basis of particular allegations, and the Foreign Minister repeated that position again today. On a number of more recent occasions Senator Evans has set parameters on when he would recall Ambassador Burke. For example, on 5 December 1990 he said in the other House:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . if and when some evidence emerges through the courts or elsewhere, or something that would make it inappropriate for the ambassadorial position to be maintained, I will act, but not sooner. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that some of the allegations made, particularly in recent days, have been done in the course of sworn testimony. It would therefore seem that some of the parameters set by the Foreign Minister have now been clearly met in relation to the ambassadorial appointment of Brian Burke. The issue today relates not to the principle of the presumption of innocence; it relates to another fundamental convention of our system of government: the convention that requires public officials to stand down from their duties when they are subject to serious allegations of impropriety-and the Prime Minister has agreed that these are serious allegations of impropriety-until their names are cleared. Mr Burke's guilt or innocence will be decided elsewhere. The issue for the Government today is that, in the context of the charges made in the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters and elsewhere, it is essential that Mr Burke stand down from the high office of ambassador. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me be clear about two things. Firstly, if the charges currently being made against Mr Burke were being made against a government Minister, there are clear precedents that he or she would be stood down until the matters were resolved. The precedents I mentioned in one of my questions in relation to Phillip Lynch in 1977, Mick Young in 1984 and Neville Wran in 1986 are three distinctive cases in point. This view of ministerial propriety is not put only by me or by people on this side of the House. For example, the respected Deputy Speaker of this House and honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) on 1 March this year said that if Mr Burke had been Premier when these revelations were made, he would have expected him to stand down. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point we can be sure about is that if the charges were being made against any Australian diplomat other than Mr Burke he or she would already have stood down by now. A question mark over any Australian ambassador is a question mark over Australia. We need to be very clear about the status of the position Mr Burke holds as an ambassador. Australian ambassadors are appointed by the Executive Council. They hold their positions at the pleasure of the GovernorGeneral on the recommendations of the government of the day. They formally represent the interests of Australia and thus of the Australian Government in its dealing with other countries. By convention and precedent, our ambassadors do not involve themselves in domestic political controversy. </PARA>
<PARA> The status of Australia's ambassadors therefore goes well beyond that of public servants. They have a status and special functions that are formally bestowed on them by the Governor-General. In the table of precedence for the Commonwealth of Australia, for example, only the Governor-General, State governors, the Prime Minister, State Premiers, the President of the Senate, you, Mr Speaker, as Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Chief Justice rank above ambassadors and high commissioners from other countries. Those ambassadors and high commissioners, for example, rank in terms of precedence well above members of the Federal Executive Council and other members of Parliament. Australia's ambassadors and high commissioners enjoy similar status in most of the countries to which they are accredited. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Burke therefore clearly occupies one of the most senior appointments that can be made by an Australian government. Clearly, Mr Burke's current position in regard to the WA Inc. royal commission is inconsistent with his ambassadorial responsibilities and is inconsistent with the status of that ambassadorial position. </PARA>
<PARA> The charges levelled against him, I believe, reduce his effectiveness in representing Australia's interests overseas, given the distractions which the preparation of his defence against these charges will involve. They risk doing considerable damage to Australia's standing in the international community, and they involve him directly in a major domestic political controversy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has been very hairy chested in the course of today and recently about the issue of leadership. This issue about the tenure of Brian Burke as Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See is a question of leadership. It is not a question of mateship. The Prime Minister has said in the past, `If I see my mates attacked without justification, my mates will find me shoulder to shoulder with them'. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was even clearer in what he said. He spoke directly about Australian Labor Party mateship and the crosses carried by people who dare to break with it. But the Prime Minister clearly has a responsibility that goes well beyond mateship. He has a responsibility to show leadership on a matter and not involve himself in the politics of Labor mateship. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition calls on the Prime Minister to show precisely that sort of leadership and to minimise the risk of further damage to our international standing because of the position of Brian Burke as Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See. We urge the Prime Minister to ensure that Mr Burke does stand down as a matter of urgency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion to suspend Standing Orders. The Standing Orders should be suspended because this matter is one of the greatest urgency. It is a matter of the greatest urgency because the position of ambassador representing Australia is a position of significance and of importance. The Ambassador is the spokesman for our country in Ireland and at the Holy See. He is the symbol, the personification, of our nation in that country. That is why the traditions of diplomacy require integrity, stability and decency above all. It is for good reason: because the good standing of the nation is always at stake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this particular instance we are not, of course, alleging that Mr Burke is guilty. The argument that the Australian Labor Party and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) put forward-that it is only under those circumstances that Mr Burke should stand down-is refuted by Mr Hogg, the National Secretary of the Labor Party, who was reported as follows in an interview with the Canberra Times today:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . he was confident Brian Burke would consider standing aside as Ambassador to Ireland if he believed damage was being done to the position by the WA Inc Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that damage is being done to the position. What Mr Burke and his Government did and their relationships with entrepreneurs is at the very heart of the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters investigation. That is clear for all to see. The starring role is played by the Ambassador to Ireland, Mr Burke, the former Premier. He is at the centre of an immense national controversy. As the Sydney Morning Herald, in its editorial today, said, it is `a position highly inappropriate for an ambassador'. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three specific points that can be made. First, the Ambassador in Ireland at the moment simply cannot do the job, and he is not doing the job. He is spending his time briefing lawyers, reading transcripts of the Royal Commission and contemplating his strategy. He is seldom in his office. He does not spend time at his desk. He is worrying about what is happening in Perth. He is running up immense phone bills at taxpayers' expense. There are fax bills. The diplomatic bag is weighed down with lawyers' briefs. The simple fact is that he is also conducting numerous interviews, including interviews on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation only yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing that we have to consider in the national interest is how the Irish and the Holy See would view Australia through this controversy. It is obviously the subject of commentary in the Irish media. The Irish newspapers are full of this story about the Australian Ambassador. Irish Ministers and Papal officials are whispering in corners that the Australian Ambassador is highly controversial. The Irish Embassy has been sending back faxes and cables on this controversy day in and day out. We know that only too well. All this is at a time when Australia should be trying to put its best foot forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The third thing is, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, that there are precedents and conventions about standing down in serious circumstances like this when the Australian national interest is at stake. We had the example of Phillip Lynch; we had the example at the State level of Neville Wran; we had the example of Mick Young. The simple fact is that on each of those occasions very serious allegations-not some fly-by-night assertion but very serious allegations-were made, and in order to protect the institutions which they were part of, those people decided to stand down. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case let me repeat that we are not, of course, asserting that Mr Burke is guilty of anything. We are concerned to protect the national interest and the national reputation of this country around the world. It is important to us that in Ireland Australia is well represented. Ireland is a country which is part of the European Community, a country with long traditional ties with Australia, and yet our ambassador there, our spokesman, the personification of our nation there, is the subject of immense national controversy. The Labor Party for a change should put the national interest before its mates, just this one time, and Mr Burke should stand down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no requirement to agree with this motion. I suppose every Leader of the Opposition has to have his court jester, and I suppose that last five minutes was the five minutes from his court jester. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) had absolutely no grounds to make the allegations he made about Mr Burke's administration in Ireland. He knows nothing about it. In fact, on the occasions on which I have had opportunity to discuss with people who have met him and dealt with him the position he has held as Ambassador to Ireland and as Ambassador to the Holy See, I learned that they find him a very convivial person to deal with. He has been a very effective ambassador in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the honourable member thinks something different from that, he might actually come into this place and present some evidence instead of going off the top of his head on that subject. He, after all, is the attacker here, not the defender, so if he has the evidence, he should present it. Otherwise he should maintain his peace. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point raised by the Opposition is that it is sufficient for Mr Burke to stand down on the subject of allegations, and I will get onto that more a bit later. </PARA>

In fact, none of the allegations put forward against Mr Burke in any of the statements to this point have been particularised by anyone, including anyone in the 15 minutes of blarney from Opposition members. There have been no allegations. It is not simply a question of whether or not they say they support or wish to stand aside from particular allegations; they have not actually presented the allegations which they say they maintain a neutral attitude upon.

If unbeknown to all of us, at least on this side of the House, it has over the last decade or so become a criminal offence, no doubt not only we but honourable members opposite also will have a great deal to answer for on that. Of course it has not become a criminal offence, and the Opposition's position on that is nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Name the allegations about Mr Burke. What particular decision was taken as a result of what particular donation? Nobody in the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in Western Australia has said, `There is an allegation here that if we had not made this contribution to Mr Burke, we would not in fact have received a particular government job or a particular element of government support'. At this point there is nothing standing on Mr Burke any more than was alleged by Tony Eggleton when he went out and said, `If you had contributed to the Liberal Party, you got in to see Mr Fraser faster'. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that these allegations, if they are indeed allegations, are so nebulous. They are assumptions, they are drawing inferences. They are not, of their nature-and certainly not against Mr Burke-a statement of allegation. What there is at the moment is an awful lot of stuff out there in the ether, and a revelation of a series of political donations and a series of events under investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be many more events investigated by this Royal Commission, some of which go back prior to Mr Burke's period in office and some of which occurred after Mr Burke's period in office. Many people will be floating views before that Royal Commission and, as with most royal commissions, people's reputations will be up there for destruction, unless carefully handled, and there will be no opportunity for final clearance in that regard until the Royal Commission finally reports, whenever that might be. It would be a very serious thing for people in this country, when somebody floats something that is interesting or even if he goes and floats an allegation and makes that allegation specific and particularised-in the way in which allegations have not been made specific and particularised in this particular instance-to get into the habit of requiring public officials to stand down; public administration in this country could obviously be seriously destabilised. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one essential difference-and I think members of the Opposition actually understand this-between the position of Mr Burke and the others they chose to name in this regard. That significant difference is that if there are any allegations or merely just embarrassing circumstances or whichever way you wish to define them, they do not in fact go to Mr Burke's administration as Ambassador to Ireland; they go to his administration as Premier of the State-and he does not hold that position now, and there have been no allegations raised with regard to his position in Ireland. But I might say the Opposition has been pretty inconsistent on this other point which it has raised in here that when matters do go to aspects of administration for which people are responsible then invariably the persons who are the subject of that allegation or investigation should stand down. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had, in the case of the position of the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, a series of particularised allegations-not the nebulous ones here-before that commission on corruption, made in regard to the question of his handling of his administration or his performance in New South Wales when he was Deputy Premier. Nobody from the Opposition stood up and said that these matters at the heart of his administration, of the Government for which he was responsible, were of a significance that they ought to require him to stand aside until that matter had been concluded, even though there was the absolute certainty in that case that he would have only had to stand aside for a very limited period of time because it was a very limited, constrained and tight assessment of what was going on; the Opposition made no such suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have, of course, the examples from the Fraser Government where, when the then Minister, Mr Nixon, held a position with responsibility in the area of agriculture and the meat substitution scandal occurred he held his office for the entirety of that inquiry and, at the conclusion of that inquiry when there were doubts cast, indeed, on the effectiveness of administration by the Royal Commission, the Prime Minister of the day sought not to act on those findings-and we are not talking here about particularised or unparticularised or nebulous allegations, but actual findings of the Royal Commissioner. When the then Prime Minister came into this place and put those forward, he defended his Minister, opposed efforts by our side of the House when in Opposition to censure him, and would not hear of the possibility of his removal from public office. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Opposition is very, very selective. It is very selective when it comes to consideration on these issues of when it is proper and appropriate for somebody to stand down, as indeed it is selective on what it regards as an allegation which Mr Burke has to answer. If the allegation that Mr Burke has to answer is that he did not disclose political donations which he was not obliged to expose-but it is terribly interesting to see those political donations when they are exposed-the Opposition has a few questions to ask itself about what it intends to do when we give it an opportunity to make sure that sort of thing never happens again a few weeks from now and whether it intends to make that retrospective. Because if the Opposition is seriously interested in that particular matter, it will not just pass our regulations or proposals when they are put forward; Opposition members will be up at that dispatch box demanding that the proposals be retrospective to both sides of the chamber; that would be the Opposition's position. But it would not do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice also in the statements made by Laurie Connell in the Royal Commission yesterday that he contributed $50,000 to the Liberal Party of Australia and that he was a supporter of that party. Is the position that now ought to be adopted in Western Australia that until we work out whatever Laurie Connell has done in relation to the Liberal Party, there should be a mass standing aside there? No, of course not. That would be a ridiculous position for us to get into. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact of the matter is that those opposite have failed to do these things. They have failed to particularise any allegations; they have said they are there. It is not enough for them to say that they do not agree with the allegations; they must say what the allegations are. Except by an absolutely unsubstantiated, off-the-top declaration, they have failed to demonstrate in this place that Mr Burke is unable to perform his role as Ambassador to Ireland. Most notably, the examples they have given have failed to establish a clear-cut precedent to say that Mr Burke should stand down, and those opposite have failed to indicate how any allegations or attitudes or interests circulating in the ether actually go to his administration in Ireland as opposed to his administration when he was Premier. Therefore this is not a worthy motion to support and we will not support it. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I realise that, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I thank you for your guidance. I think at this stage a few cautionary comments directed at the Government are in order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sales tax legislation before the House has been acclaimed by the Government as being innovatory and of great advantage to the Australian people. I would like to enunciate, by way of summary, exactly what the Government is doing. Firstly, the legislation seeks to remove a tax on luxury cars that was a disaster. The Government set out to protect the Australian automobile manufacturing industry and raise some money for itself. Actually, what it did was continue to send the Australian automobile industry down the chute. The Australian Government actually lost $200m. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) proposed this great innovation following a revelation and a flash of blinding genius. Part of the legislation we are debating today is related to that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Another part of the legislation that we are debating is the issue of extending the payment of sales tax by small businesses from a monthly basis to a three-monthly basis provided that their commitment to sales tax in any one year does not run over $50,000. The Government has not indicated in regard to that concession for small businesses that the economy is still running down and that bills will still have to be paid within 21 days. The Government is just giving small businesses an extended time to pay their commitments to the Commonwealth. Once the payment is due, small businesses have only 21 days in which to meet their commitment, write out a cheque and pay the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> I had mentioned earlier the double standards of this Government in expecting small businesses to meet their commitments to the Government within 21 days. However, the Government can take months to meet its commitments to the Australian taxpayers. It can take eight months and, in some instances, perhaps 12 months, to furnish cheques to taxpayers-money which is rightfully that of the taxpayer but which is held by the Government. Calculations and permutations on tax go on somewhere in the bowels of the Australian Taxation Office and eventually taxpayers receive what they are entitled to. I do not think that these double standards are an innovation; they are not of particular advantage to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> Small businesses, which are strapped for cash, are not being given a great concession by being allowed three months to tot up their sales tax commitment to the Commonwealth Government and write four cheques a year instead of 12 cheques a year. In fact, all they save is the money that they would have had to spend on the Government's bank exchange duty. So, there is no real advantage to small business in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> There has only been an acknowledgment of small business. The brilliant Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), who was so much acclaimed during the election campaign, has done nothing since he became Minister, except in respect of this one issue. If that is the standard of his understanding of how bad things are out there in terms of the number of businesses going bankrupt and the number of people losing jobs, he will continue to be a failure as a Minister. He needs to do far more than he has already done. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation seeks to make changes on wholesale sales tax collections for business inputs which are being used as part of an export process. This concession is part of the Opposition's total package in terms of its goods and services tax policy. The Government has picked up one small piece and said, `This is a sensible idea. Why do we bother taxing those industries which ultimately are going to export their goods?'. That is a concession that is worthwhile. But what is really lacking is a rationale behind wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time the Government assessed this area. There are crazy anomalies. The Treasurer comes in here day after day in his Italian suits; there is no sales tax on them, but there is on orange juice for school kids. Can honourable members imagine anything as crazy as that? That is stupid stuff. Until this legislation, men and women seeking to support their livelihood by buying the tools and implements of their trade were paying tax on those items, but a bridal gown has no tax. Kit Kats have a tax but chocolate biscuits do not. This is just a silly demarcation of definition. </PARA>
<PARA> With a goods and services tax that applies at a low level of perhaps 10 per cent to 15 per cent across the lot, people can then choose what they want. If it is an expensive item, they pay a lot of money. If it is a low cost item, by choice they pay a small amount of money, and the relief to them as taxpayers is significant. They have more money in their pockets because they are relieved of a substantial proportion of income tax each week. So they have a real choice. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is time the Government came to grips with these issues. Unless it does, it will be turfed out on its ear. The clock is ticking over, and a couple of years from now a new government will be in. But why delay on these reforms? Why can the Australian community in these desperate times not have real reforms and real opportunity? The Government must know how bad things are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are dealing in a cognate debate with the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) and the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). A number of members have already alluded to the issues involved, but let me recap some of those points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's decision to increase the sales tax on luxury cars, which was announced in February 1989, at the time of the Federal election, was in my view a cheap trick. No doubt it was aimed at that time at appeasing some of the Government's union mates or some of the left- wing members of the Government who had an obscure reason for believing there was a totally inelastic demand for luxury goods. They thought, incorrectly on that occasion, as they do very often-and once again they also got the economics wrong-that they could simply keep hiking up the price of luxury cars and people would be silly enough to keep purchasing them. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking back, quite the opposite happened and the demand for luxury cars in this price range proved to be almost completely elastic because people chose simply to stop purchasing luxury cars. Perhaps they realised, as they ought to have, that the Government was ripping them off with this tax. The luxury car industry-and I have a number of dealers within my electorate who retail what are called luxury cars in the categories we are talking about-expressed serious concerns at the time about the effect this tax would have on its business. The Government was told very clearly of the effects this tax would have on the sale of motor vehicles, but it proceeded nevertheless to impose the tax, and what happened? We now know that exactly what the industry said would happen actually did happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at some figures I have from a few of the dealers in my electorate, in the luxury car bracket a Jaguar dealer in Southport sold 20 cars between July 1990 and March 1991, whereas in the corresponding period in 1989-90 he sold 83 vehicles. That is an extremely significant drop indeed. On an Australia-wide basis, statistics taken by Paxus Professional Services Pty Ltd on sales at the upper prestige end of the market-that is, Jaguar, Mercedes, BMW and so on-show that 1,956 cars were sold in Australia from May 1990 to January 1991, whereas in the corresponding period in 1989-90, 3,964 cars were sold. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a significant reduction in the sale of luxury cars as a result of the Government's implementation of this tax. It was not just a case of sales dropping due to the recession, although that has had an impact on the sale of luxury cars and on the sale of just about everything else. It was really a direct result, in the words of people I have spoken to in the industry in my electorate, of people not wanting to be ripped off by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government decided to implement this tax, I suppose it rubbed its hands over the predicted revenue, which was to be $105m in a full year. The Bill was passed with the predictable support of the Australian Democrats who, I suppose, could not help themselves in a situation like this where they thought they would be getting at some apparently wealthy people. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is right; they thought they would be having a shot at some wealthy folk. What everyone overlooked-and what the Government overlooked, to its great detriment-was the fact that this industry at its various levels employs a significant number of people. So not only do we have the spectre of cars not being sold and sales tax not being paid; the other side of the equation, as it were, is that as people stopped buying cars the unemployment queues swelled as a result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government apparently became aware of the extent of the problem it had created and it made some modifications to the scheme in the 1990-91 Budget. It effectively allowed a phase-in of the tax over a wholesale range of prices from around $30,000 to around $54,000, but even this failed to achieve the desired effects. Now we have before us legislation by which the Government proposes to reduce the sales tax back to 30 per cent, effective from 13 March.</PARA>
<PARA> What a fiasco this little exercise has been. As if we needed another example of the ineptitude of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and this Government in their management of the country! This is yet another example of many damning indictments on this Government. It goes further: as if this were not bad enough, the Government is now attempting to compound the problem by making claims about its rationale for the change. We talk about this being a change. It was a clear-cut mistake, yet we have never heard the Treasurer get up in this House and in any way acknowledge that he has ever made a mistake. Everything is always all right, we are on track, everything is going well. Let us just call this Bill a change of direction, not a mistake, although it was a mistake. We were told by the Minister when he introduced the Bill that the reduction of the tax on luxury motor vehicles will cost $15m in 1990-91 and $45m in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> So the reduction in the tax, which will take us pretty much back to where we were originally, before we got into this mess, will actually cost us money. It seems to me that only an extremely creative accountant could put this complexion on the result of the Government's efforts in this area. When speculation began around the end of 1990 that the tax was to be scrapped, industry representatives were saying that the tax had already cost the Government $163m in sales tax forgone because of the reduced sales of motor vehicles that had been a direct result. There was speculation at that time that it could actually cost the Government up to $400m in lost revenue in a full year. What we are looking at here is a tax that originally was foreshadowed to raise $105m in a full year looking like losing up to $400m in a full year. What an amazing result. The Government comes up with this terrific scheme to tax luxury cars and raise $105m, and it turns around and loses potentially $400m in a full year. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Mitchell says, what great managers those opposite are! If they were running a private company that had a budget to make $150m profit and they ended up losing $400m, they would all get the sack. We have been asking the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to sack the Treasurer for some time, but our requests have been falling on deaf ears. As I said, one would have to be extremely creative in accounting terms to come up with the cost to revenue figure that the Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean) came up with in his speech. The scrapping of the sales tax, even at this belated stage, should represent a significant net gain to revenue, not a loss to revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition proposes, as a part of its policy, radical reform of the tax system. Much has been said already in this place today of our proposal for a broad-based consumption tax. There is no doubt in my mind, as I move around my electorate and around the community, that there is very significant support for a broad-based goods and services tax or a broad-based consumption tax. That support spreads across the business community and the non-business community. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time it became apparent that we were going to head down this track, industry associations-including the Taxation Institute of Australia, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Business Council of Australia, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, the National Farmers Federation and many others-welcomed the Opposition's initiative for the introduction of a goods and services tax or a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In commenting at the time on the coalition's decision, the Chief Executive of the Confederation of Australian Industry, Ian Spicer, summed it up as well as anybody. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia can no longer remain out of step with virtually all other developed economies. This was highlighted only yesterday in the results of the OECD's annual survey of tax levels and structure. The OECD found that taxes on incomes and profits in Australia accounted for 56.5 per cent of total revenue while the OECD average was only 38.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>There are many examples. I notice that quite a few speakers in this debate already have been citing examples of the inequities-not only inequities but glaring inconsistencies-within the current wholesale sales tax system, a multi-rate system which inevitably gives rise to a whole host of problems. As honourable members would know, there are currently five rates of sales tax in Australia, from 10 per cent to 50 per cent, as well as one group of goods exempt or zero rated. </PARA>
<PARA> The huge number of sales tax rulings bear witness to the administrative nightmare that the current system imposes on the Australian Taxation Office. Here is yet another example: under our current tax system, a poor man who goes down the road to purchase a bag of lollies for his children pays tax on that purchase, while a rich man who takes his children to an expensive restaurant and eats caviar and oysters pays absolutely no tax for the privilege of doing that. There are many such examples. As I said, honourable members have alluded to them. They are not hard to find because of the vast number of inconsistencies which exist in the current ramshackle wholesale sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest proponent of the consumption tax was the Treasurer himself. It is history now that he has been traditionally very much in favour of that proposal because he knows that it is the best and the right proposal. When I see the Treasurer in this place day after day berating the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) for the stand that he has taken on this matter, I like to remind him about what he said in June 1985. Let me remind the Treasurer again here that in 1985 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>If we don't as a nation adopt this proposal-</PARA>
<PARA>and he was talking about a proposal to introduce a consumption tax-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . then you won't see significant reforms in this country in taxation for the balance of the century. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, he has changed his mind. He is locked into a position now and he really cannot extricate himself from it. He was given his marching orders. He was told that no, that was not the way to go. He was given his directions. As I said earlier, he is not about to admit that he was wrong-he says that he has never made a mistake. He is never likely to admit to a mistake that he did make. In this case he is now prepared to say that circumstances have changed and a consumption tax that was right for Australia in 1985 is now somehow not right for Australia. But the Australian people quite clearly believe otherwise. The effective loser in all of this-and I believe the Treasurer knows it deep down-is Australia and the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), I note that the Minister in his second reading speech tells us:</PARA>
<PARA>This measure builds on the Government's previous initiatives to assist small business and it addresses, in part, the recommendations of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology as they relate to the wholesale tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>It was rather quaint, I thought, of the Minister in his speech at that time to refer to the Government's previous initiatives to assist small business. I am not sure exactly what previous initiatives the Minister is referring to, because it is very difficult to find many. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in his speech refers to the so-called Beddall report. That was the small business report that was a result of the inquiry carried out by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. As we all know, the current Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) was the Chairman of that Committee. It was a very successful committee. It was a very good inquiry and it brought forward a significant number of recommendations. But where is the Minister now? He is almost an invisible Minister for small business. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) said when he was speaking, what a disappointment this Minister has been. What hope he held out to us in this place when the Beddall report was tabled; what hope he held out to small businesses as they saw some very significant recommendations coming forward as a result of that inquiry. But where has it gone? It has gone virtually nowhere. The Minister has gone somewhere, but we are not quite sure where. Certainly, nothing is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> The small business report dealt significantly with a number of concerns that small business had with taxation. I have spoken a number of times in this House about the fact that the Government has really failed to take any substantial action at all in respect of those particular recommendations in the area of tax reform that the Beddall report made. The Committee reported that it was this `area of Commonwealth Government's regulation which emerged as the greatest concern to small business'. Interestingly, the report also points out that the Committee believed that the most persuasive evidence was presented in respect of the rapid growth of the size and the complexity of taxation law. It is this size and complexity of law which translates directly into costs as far as small business is concerned. Many small businesses complained to the Beddall Committee that this increased regulation and the cost of maintaining this ramshackle-as we called it-wholesale sales tax system was costing small business a lot of money. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, in the event the Committee made a number of recommendations-there were 25 in the Committee's total of 64 recommendations; recommendations 25 through to 49-which dealt directly with taxation matters and the impact of taxation on small business. A number of these recommendations, if implemented, would have been extremely helpful to small business. They include recommendation 31, which calls for the system of wholesale sales tax exemptions to be reviewed and simplified. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 34 provides for a capital gains tax to be deferred on the sale of a business that is rolled over into another. That was an eminently sensible recommendation that the Committee brought forward, but we have not seen or heard anything about that particular one. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 37 is that the Government reduce the existing difference between the company tax rate and the top marginal personal income tax rate. Recommendation 40 calls for a full review of the provisional and company tax system. The company tax system, and the Government's debacle on the collection of this tax, is another area I would have liked to have gone into in more detail today, but time does not permit. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the fiasco of the luxury car tax which we were talking about earlier-the great tax that was going to raise $105m in a full year and ended up looking as though it was going to lose $400m-it is just another case in point of the Government's total inability or, worse, I suppose, unwillingness to really come to grips with what small business needs in this country. In the Beddall report on small business in Australia, the Government was given a blueprint for assisting the nation's small businesses, but what has it done? The Minister claims he has addressed the recommendations of the report in part, but I submit to this House that it is a very small part indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation before the House at this time is the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) and the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). The first Bill is to remove the now infamous luxury car tax, and the other, belatedly, is to provide a new paying formula for a small business which has a sales tax liability of less than $50,000 per annum, by allowing it to pay quarterly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second measure is a worthwhile initiative, although I point out to the House that I suggested a similar proposal back on 16 October 1985. So it has only taken the Government six years to respond to the initiatives I put forward when I was then shadow Minister for small business. The interesting aspect of that was that at the time the Government had changed the tax scales and got out of a fairly complex structure into three levels of tax, but picked up a substantial windfall, I think $110m in the second year, as part of the process. It was amazing that it carefully selected the numbers so that the tax went up but did not go down. I pointed out at that time that this gave the Government the ideal opportunity to extend the time which small business, or actually business in all categories, was given to pay the tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Others have pointed out quite clearly that under the legislation the wholesaler is in fact the taxpayer. Although most businesses pass that on and frequently clearly identify the component of tax, they of course have no right to collect it from the purchaser. They are responsible for its payment, and irrespective of identifying it, if the purchaser does not pay his account or if that account, including that sales tax, becomes a bad debt, then of course the small businessman as the taxpayer must pay the amount of money. It is similar for a large businessman, for that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> By the way, there is a story circulating at the moment, honourable members may be pleased to know, that there is absolutely no problem in having a small business under the Hawke Government. I am told that one just buys a big one, and waits. But the fact of life is that small business is greatly disadvantaged in many ways by being made the unpaid tax collectors for the Government. This measure of extending the payment period to a quarterly payment means there will be some of that cash in the small businessman's bank account for a short period, thereby compensating him somewhat. It does not take much in this day and age to attract a tax liability of $50,000 a year if one is in business with the massive inflation we have had in Australia in recent times, and it will be only a very small proportion of small businesses which will benefit from this measure. But they at least are to be helped, and I am not complaining about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Had the Government listened to my recommendations back in 1985 it would, of course, have had a progressive extension of the date to all business, making this much fairer. Please remember, notwithstanding how the legislation is written, the business is the taxpayer, and this has raised great difficulties over time because the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Act 1990 is not clear. Definitions as to what is taxable and what is not-when one gets down to specific items, to the definitions as they relate to exempt businesses and individuals-are very obscure, and the misfortune is that once some individual or company is given an exemption, if the exemption is found later by a tax auditor to be wrong, the business itself is treated as though it is a mob of crooks. It is penalised, and generally it is purely for making a mistake in that it has expected or accepted that a particular item was exempt; it is its fault. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, things have not been cleared up very much by the industry statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I have read it, and it is extremely broad, and I guess at some time we will see some legislation in this place that makes it a little clearer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says in that industry statement, might I add, that it is determined to take the sales tax burden away from all inputs to production. Yet it very specifically excludes sales tax on road transport. There is a huge burden of freight on anything manufactured in Australia. That is a natural geographical problem in the beginning; but why tax it? The interesting point is that if something was moved by conveyer belt or by pipeline, or I think if something was moved by camel, the Government would allow an exemption. Of course, the railways, being a government instrumentality, are already exempt in most cases, but the reality is, I think, that something like 80 per cent of the freight moved between Melbourne and Sydney is moved by road. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the sales tax that is imposed on road transport is a major cost disincentive to getting efficiency in Australian industry. A lot of things are shifted by road, a lot always will be shifted by road, and particularly into electorates such as mine, O'Connor, where for large areas there is no rail service, and where a rail service does exist, there is always the extra 50 or 100 miles back to the railhead, which, of course, must be conducted by road transport. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is sitting at the table at the moment and who does not have anything to do with sales tax, does have a lot to do with transport, and he will want to jump to his feet and tell me that trucks do not pay enough for the roads. I point out to him that about 33 per cent of the income of an owner-driver goes in one tax or another. In the case of sales tax, the matter at issue today, if the Minister is unable to convince his Cabinet that the road system requires a bit more of that money back, is no fault of truck drivers. It is his fault; he is just not influential enough in Cabinet. He cannot get the money, notwithstanding he is the Minister for Land Transport and human lives. He has not been successful in getting the money, but the money is paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The example I wish to give is a calculation I made when I was in the trucking business some years ago. The figure would be more today, possibly. We worked out that on a double-bottom road train, something that can legally pull about 40 tonnes along the road, if we took a load of cement-as we were in the habit of doing-up to Port Hedland from Perth, it cost us 50c a tonne for the sales tax on our tyres. I can tell the House who was paying that. We put it on the bill. It was all part of our freight charge. In some cases we were carting groceries and things like that, and the cost was filtering down to single mothers. This is forgotten, of course, by this Minister when the Government specifically excluded any sales tax concessions to road transport from the industry statement, purely and simply because the Government is trying to re-establish the railways, and it has to make them look good-and in that regard I wonder. If, when the Government has ownership of the Commonwealth railways and total regulation by way of licensing and fees of road transport, that is not putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank, I will go he. The reality is, of course, that road transport is efficient with small businesses and owner-drivers and the voluntary employment agreements (VEAs), which have been in road transport since the year dot. Try to give a truck driver the award wages. He would laugh you out of the room. If he is on line haul he wants to know, `How much for the trip?' He is an entrepreneur of sorts. </PARA>
<PARA> With all of those efficiencies they will continue to give the railways the stick and, of course, if both of these businesses end up in the hands of the Commonwealth Government in terms of ownership or control, then we will see the load burden put onto road transport through regulation and taxes, as the States have done in the past, to protect the railways' interest. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is getting a bit away from sales taxes, except for the 50c a tonne sales tax on tyres, and that is a very important issue. It is interesting to note that when one looks at that industry statement in terms of sales tax, in terms of inputs to production, it proposes to remove, I think, $200m in the forthcoming financial year. When one looks at the total revenues for sales tax, as predicted in the Budget this year, they are $10.7 billion. So the offer is not very, very generous, yet it is one that is taxing people who in many cases are producing goods for export and that is no way, of course, to improve the competitiveness of our exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter of course is, as I have said, the great confusion that exists in what is exempt. The agricultural industry has a broad exemption, as far as I am concerned. I am told that a fibreglass tank is exempt but, if it gets a hole in it, the materials one buys to patch it up are not exempt. It is just so stupid, and I have corresponded with Ministers on that very issue and received no satisfaction; the situation still remains. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some people in Western Australia who have done a huge job of trying to resolve some of those issues, but fundamentally wheat growers and wool growers are exporters. There is very little of their production consumed within Australia. Why should there be any question as to the items they buy? If they buy an electric drill and use it in the morning to fix the header and in the afternoon to fix one of their kids' toys, why should there be a debate about which is right and which is wrong? Clearly, they would not buy an electric drill to fix their kids' toys; they would buy it to fix the header. The fact that it is convenient to fix the kids' toys should not be a reason to demand sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> One sees people buying pressure cleaners, and they are sales tax exempt if they use them only to clean down the header or the farm machinery. But if they take them out and use them for some other purpose like jetting a hole in the ground, the Commissioner of Taxation argues that they should be taxed for sales tax-and some people have been sent broke by selling these high pressure cleaning pumps to farmers and finding later that the Commissioner has decreed that, because there was some component of use other than the agricultural component, they are not tax exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> The big argument at one stage was that a header was a means of production because it went into the paddock and it took off wheat; but a plough was not a means of production because there was no end product from ploughing the ground. The end product was when one clipped the heads off the wheat-and those items associated with a plough were not sales tax exempt in the eyes of the bureaucrats. But try harvesting a crop of wheat without first planting it with a plough; it gets a little difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with computers and the scales to weigh the wool: if a farmer wants to improve his wool output and other things today-and there are great pressures on him to do so-and he has the finances, he computerises. He literally weighs every fleece, he identifies the sheep with appropriate bar coded ear tags and things of that nature and he is able to identify the productivity of each individual animal. </PARA>
<PARA> The scale is tax exempt, but the computer that one puts the information into-and if one has 10,000 or 20,000 sheep, without a computer it is an impossible task-is not tax exempt because the farmer might take it up and play computer games on it at night-time, or might actually use it to write a letter to his friends. It gets me. I mean, the fellow buys it to improve the productivity of his wool production and, consequently, the competitiveness of Australia. I hope the industry statement is going to fix some of those things; it certainly does not tell me in detail. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the second aspect of this legislation is that the Government is eventually admitting to history. I do not know if it is really admitting it made a mistake, because this Government has never admitted to a mistake. I mean, it has driven the Australian economy into absolute recession, if not depression, and it tells us now that it really did it all to get down inflation. But apparently, when we were told we were going to have a soft landing and apparently high inflation, that was not the purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government will never admit it got it wrong; it will generally find another excuse. So I am not really sure in this instance. But history has always told us. For instance, other governments years ago put a dramatic increase on alcohol. We had the honesty to come to the Parliament with our increases on excise-Liberal governments always have; we did not have automatic indexation to hide it away so that, when the price went up on fuel or alcohol, nobody knew whose fault it was. We used to say, `It is our intention to increase excise'. But on one occasion I think it was a Liberal government that overstepped the mark and its collections were less because there was a reaction by the public against buying that product. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one lesson of history, and other lessons are legion. If we go too far on a sales tax item, the public walks away from the product; and in fact, we do not collect more, we actually collect less. We do not have to be Albert Einstein to work that out. But His Arrogance the Treasurer (Mr Keating), could make it different-he can reinvent the wheel-and of course he did exactly the same thing with his monetary policy. History has proved time and time again throughout the world that treasurers who rely on monetary policy have never achieved a soft landing, and all the examples of why we cannot achieve a soft landing are there to be read also. </PARA>
<PARA> But, again, the Treasurer thought he could reinvent the wheel, and said we would not have a hard landing-and we have not landed yet; we are down in the ooze, and I guess he might be right, it might be soft in the end, but we will be about half a mile down in the mud. If it is soft in those terms, then we are going to have a soft landing. But otherwise, we have had a very hard one in economic terms and, in fact, we are still bouncing, I guess. </PARA>
<PARA> But the reality is that in the case of the luxury car tax, it was clearly obvious what would happen and, of course, the Treasurer, in playing up to a few left wingers around the place, put that on with the argument that it would also cover a few items of additional expenditure that he wanted to excuse at a time when he was attacking the Opposition in every way possible on `Where's the money coming from?'; he needed to appear to balance the books. </PARA>
<PARA> So at last this act of stupidity is being withdrawn by this legislation, and of course the Opposition supports that. It is a peculiar industry, the motor car industry. We always focus on the manufacturing component when in fact the manufacturing component, as I recollect, employs something less than 25 per cent of the distribution and service component. The really big part of the motor industry is selling motor cars and keeping them on the road. Of course, when the Government overtaxed the luxury car market, a lot of that employment was lost also, and that is not necessarily good for the economy either. So the Government, of course, has not really done much good for us there. </PARA>
<PARA> But just in closing, I welcome the fact that the small business sector at least is about to get some relief from the dreadful burden it has carried being the Government's tax collector in the area of sales tax. I do not think it is enough. I think it is a concession that should have been extended to all unpaid tax collectors, and it is certainly a position I would advocate, as I did. As I said, it was just a case where, with the windfalls that the Government picked up by a changing of the rates for the purpose of rationalisation, it could have extended by a number of days across the board the amount of time people have to pay their sales tax and eventually it might have reached the 60-day sort of situation which confronts most people in the wholesale arena, all of whom give credit. </PARA>
<PARA> At retail there are a lot of cash transactions; payment is made on the spot. But at wholesale, it is nearly all credit sales and, of course, one charges out the wholesale sales tax on credit and, as such, one ends up having to wait for one's money; and yet the Tax Commissioner in most cases was demanding it before it had been collected, and what is more there is no provision to refund that money to the wholesaler if the person buying the product, the consumer, does not pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that is one of the arguments that support a goods and services tax; at least if the goods are not paid for at retail, at the point of consumption, the tax is not collected. This is a major problem for business and it is a larger problem in the present environment where, due to Government policy, so many businesses are going broke. Every business that goes broke no doubt is leaving someone lamenting about the cost of the goods and services that have been provided, which also had a sales tax component. The Government makes no allowance for that, and eventually it sends other people broke. </PARA>
<PARA> We are fixing up the Government's act of stupidity; we are endorsing a situation where at last, and in a very limited fashion, it will give some assistance to the small business sector. If the Government had accepted the Bill I introduced to this Parliament some years ago, which required the Government to pay its debts promptly, I am sure small business would have welcomed it. The Beddall report included a reference to that matter, but we will not see it happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, it was not an initiative of this Government. It was proposed by the Opposition, turned into legislation and presented to this House, and blocked by the Government-mainly, I think, because Government members had not thought of it themselves. That was the silly thing about it. The Government eventually found some plastic cards that were supposed to improve the creditworthiness of government institutions. I am not sure that they have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate so far on the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill has been wide ranging and has not dealt with the substance of the Bill. I wish to turn the attention of the House to the substance of the Bill. For me that may appear to be unusual because I usually use these opportunities to speak broadly on issues, but there are features of this Bill that really concern me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill before the House proposes that a new levy be struck on superannuation funds. The resources gathered by the Government from the levy will be allocated to administering the supervision of the superannuation industry. The funds will go into the account of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and be administered by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> On face value, this looks a fair enough and straightforward way of doing things, but on examination there are real concerns. The previous situation was that a flat fee of $40 was paid for each return lodged, and that is currently payable when a return is lodged. Under these proposals the existing fee will be replaced by a superannuation supervisory levy. It is a strange thing for government to introduce regulation and legislation and then say to the industry, `You will now pay for the process we have decided to put upon you'. It can hardly be called a levy; in fact, it is referred to as a tax in the second reading speech of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean). It is a tax and it should be known as the superannuation supervisory tax. The industry and those superannuants who contribute to the funds have no choice but to pay this, and we are legislating today for that process. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic fee will be prescribed from time to time. This legislation allows for a maximum fee of $30,000 for a fund. It is currently estimated that a $5,000 maximum fee should be adequate for most funds. It seems strange that we are proposing to have an upper limit of six times what is proposed to be the rate that will be introduced by the Government. It gives great scope for expansion by regulation of the amount of money the Government collects from superannuation funds-from the industry and from superannuants-in order to administer the supervision of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The global collection of funds under this legislation will be $6m to $8m, as best as can be calculated. The prospect of this fund growing to six times that initial amount is a matter of deep concern. I do not approve of legislation which offers through the process of regulation the prospect of increasing fees to that great amount without proper reference to the Parliament through legislation. I would like the Minister to inform us why this process has been adopted. It is an unusual technique and assumes that there will be a burgeoning increase in the income of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission by foisting a tax on the industry it is supposed to be serving. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me point out that last year the Government raised something over $300m from the superannuation funds and from the contributions of people preparing for their retirement. In this year, that $300m has risen to $800m, and the Government, in a miserable, mealy-mouthed way, brings forward legislation to control that industry, seeking to impose a further tax on it and on the contributors to superannuation. That will be paid as a part of the contribution of people who are members of superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government brings in legislation to supervise funds, refuses to pay for that process of supervision, although it is already collecting $800m by new taxes from superannuation funds, and expects the funds and the people who belong to those funds to meet the cost of this additional supervision. </PARA>
<PARA> The logic is wrong. The process is wrong because the Government has some weird concept of `user must pay'. For the Government, `user must pay' works in the following way. The Government says, `We do not like what you are doing; we need to protect the public against the operation of superannuation funds, so we will raise legislation to control superannuation funds'. Then, on this perverted view of `user must pay', the Government promptly charges superannuation funds for something the Government initiated. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not a user-pays concept; that is an impost, a tax, an extra claim by the Government against superannuation funds-a claim that the community does not recognise. The community does know that tax after tax has been placed on retirees and their benefits and that there has been a manipulation of the benefits of retirees and those anticipating retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Government do? In a sneaky way in this Bill, it ups the ante and ups the demand on superannuation funds and, therefore, on the people who contribute to these superannuation funds, and then imposes with that process the prospect of increasing it six-fold further. What is the Government up to? It is up to milking retirees for every cent it can get out of them. It cannot be presented in any other way. I intend to speak in general terms about some of the problems of superannuation funds, the need for proper practices within funds and the protection of the contribution people have made to superannuation funds. The Government is off the moon on this issue. It even has the gall to have the following statement before the House in the case of a late lodgment: `The late lodgment amount is not a penalty'. If a firm or fund makes a late lodgment there is an additional charge of 20 per cent. The Treasurer (Mr Keating), the Treasury and the double-speak they have adopted are seeking to convince us that black is white. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government makes the blatant statement that this is not a penalty, but it cannot be construed as anything else. To have people believe it is not a penalty because the Government says it is not a penalty is the most devious approach of the presentation of public affairs that I have seen. It is a penalty. If a normal businessman imposes a charge for a late payment of 20 per cent on the customer, that is a penalty. We all know that process. This Government has imposed a 20 per cent charge for late payment. It then has the gall, the effrontery, to say that it is not a penalty in official documents. Come on! Where is a little directness and honesty?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government feels that a user pays concept needs to be established. I will debate that because of the principle that I have enunciated. The Government imposes the regulations and it should supervise them, and they should not be paid for by the contributors to superannuation funds. The Government is milking the superannuant contribution for $800m a year, which will grow massively as the tax starts to bite on superannuation funds. To supervise that industry, the Government has the effrontery to introduce regulations whereby the user must pay. I cannot understand that concept and I reject it. It is about to place the same sort of concept right on the life insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to supervise the life insurance industry, this Government is about to impose a levy on that industry, a tax on that industry, paid for by life insurance offices and it will say that that is a user pays process. The Government says, `We need to protect you, we write the legislation and then we are going to levy you for that privilege'. I cannot understand it. It is wrong in principle and wrong in concept. There is a need for supervision. The Government should do it because it writes the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have dealt with the 20 per cent penalty, which the Government says is not a penalty, and I have dealt as best I could with the legislation. I note that the guidelines within which this legislation operates are not available. To produce anything like this to the Parliament without the full details being readily available to all honourable members is another neglect of the processes of government that is occurring again and again. In two notable instances we have seen legislation introduced into this Parliament, but the most notorious were the changes to the Immigration Act where no regulations were available and the Government expects the Opposition to agree with it blind. This is another instance where guidelines for the industry are not available for us to examine. That is a practice that must stop. As I have said, the total take from the superannuation industry is $820 billion in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> Insurance of retirement benefits is an area that is rapidly changing. People are looking for different packages and different ways of preparing for retirement. The supervision of retirement packages has been somewhat difficult; in fact, they can be bunched in a conceptual process towards banks with safety nets and levies to protect the funds. On the other hand, they can be bunched towards companies with level playing fields and strong disclosure requirements and caveat emptor-let the buyer beware. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hold, and the administration of the Government seems to be, that superannuation and insurance fall somewhere between the banking process and the company process. The supervisory role of the Reserve Bank of Australia which applies to banks-it has controls and guarantees of liquid support-is the protection of the banking industry and the people using the banking industry. With regard to company processes, the Australian Securities Commission is the corporate regulator and law enforcer. It demanded that enough information be provided for members of the community to be well informed and make their own decisions and that certain rules should be followed. People should be allowed to lose their money. That is the basis of the operation of the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody in Australia would believe that the open slather of caveat emptor of the companies code should apply to the careful savings of people investing in superannuation funds. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission plays a middle role. I do not believe that it has been properly defined in Australia at this stage. On the one hand the Government wants a hands off position; on the other hand the Treasurer wants to tell superannuation funds how they should invest. He will run off at the mouth at the drop of a hat as to where these funds ought to be directed and how the trusts, placed for the retirement of individuals, would best serve the interests of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the Treasurer's own record of management and financial decision making, one would have to say that there is nobody worse in Australia to give that sort of advice. It has been said that he could not run a chook raffle. He cannot even get the luxury wholesale sales tax right, which we have just been debating. He expected a gain to revenue of $140m, but finished up losing $200m. His Budget never comes in on track. Even in his own job, he cannot demonstrate a predictability and a certainty which is critical with the management of superannuation funds. Yet we have had two or three instances over the last few months where the Treasurer wants to direct the use of superannuation funds to areas that he thinks are important. I reject that manipulation of the well-being and future security of Australia's workers and the Australian people. If one looks at the processes of the life companies and tries to assess what the fallout has been for companies, such as the Occidental and Regal fiasco, one comes to an even worse situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that questionable investment happens every day in a capitalist system. Fund managers and their clients usually wear the consequences of that process. The losses that have flowed from questionable decisions and financial markets have occurred by the score over the last few months. There were no bail outs for the shareholders of Qintex, Hooker and Bond, but the Government seems to be moving towards a bail out process for Occidental and Regal. It seems intent to foist a levy onto the clients of good insurance companies who have invested well and carefully, which will bail out the decisions of Occidental and Regal. I think that is also questionable. Those investors have made sensible decisions, have been careful in their investment and have not been quite so greedy. The expectation of investors in those companies was a little beyond the normal investor's return. Why should the solid and carefully managed funds or their investors bail out the Occidental and Regal fiasco?</PARA>
<PARA> There is a real uncertainty over this area at the moment and it is deeply worrying. The funds have been managed such that imprudent investment activity by two companies may be supported by those who have been prudent. That is wrong. I believe that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission has a duty to promote the efficient working and orderly development of the insurance and superannuation sector. I believe that it has a separate role. The Government must adequately fund that from its own resources. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission must move to rectify the asset and liability disclosures. In that way it could have helped prevent some of the problems that were raised in Occidental and Regal. That disclosures provision is two years too late. The mess of what has happened is upon us. </PARA>
<PARA> Capital adequacy, greater accountability, increased disclosure and more uniform measures of performance are far more important in the industry's future than the rescue of two organisations. The rescue that the Treasurer appears to be playing with will be to the cost of investors of safe and well-managed funds. It is a difficult decision, but ultimately we must get confidence back into the insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has raised many problems with his representation problems on superannuation funds, whether they be for unionists and employees. He has stomped around in this area just pouring off words from the top of his head. This legislation is a reflection of the Treasurer's uncertainty, his willingness to try to manipulate and control and his unwillingness to really play fair with the Australian community. It is another example of his wishing to milk the funds that people have stored away for their retirement. The operation of this Treasurer in regard to that sector of people has been grossly unfair. </PARA>
<PARA> We now see raised improperly a levy against insurance funds which will be met by those people who have superannuated their future. They will pay the levy for a government proposal that seeks to supervise the insurance industry. The supervision is fine; the Government should pay for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill, I will take issue with some of the points made by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). It is worth noting at the outset that this particular legislation proposes to amend the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act of 1987 to enable, among other matters, the collection of the superannuation supervisory levy which is proposed to be imposed by the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Taking these two Bills together, as we are in this debate, the proposal is that funds which lodge annual returns will be required to pay those particular levies. The legislation reflects the experience that we have had since the previous legislation was introduced and since the establishment of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC). At that time the Government decided to recover the costs of the superannuation supervision and had a lodgment fee of a flat $30. Costs recovered under that fee have been only approximately half the cost of the relevant superannuation functions because the number of funds lodging returns has been less than half than was expected at the time by the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill goes on to establish the principles that apply to both the payment of the levy and the late payment arrangements. I do not propose to go through those matters in detail. Suffice it to say that the principle of cost recovery that has applied since the establishment of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission is still the principle that is being followed through in this particular legislation. That principle is being adapted to the circumstances and the experiences that have occurred since that time. The arrangements were set out then; many of the principles are still just as valid. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular legislation highlights the Government's continuing determination to put the whole question of superannuation and superannuation supervision on the public agenda, and rightly so. If we go into a little of the experience, given that this debate has ranged quite widely, it is worth noting that an award basis for superannuation is most definitely a phenomenon of the last seven or eight years, the time of the Hawke Government. Prior to that, as I have said before in this House, award based superannuation arrangements applied to less than 45 per cent of the work force. For most of the period less than 40 per cent of the work force had coverage from superannuation. Today we have award based arrangements involving superannuation applying to in the vicinity of 85 per cent of the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing that so directly and so starkly highlights the difference in perceptions, attitudes and views about the labour market and the role of labour market issues than the gulf between the Opposition and the Government on the question of superannuation and workers' award rights to superannuation coverage. It is something that this Government takes very seriously. It is very proud of its record in that regard. We have treated superannuation as an integral part of the broader retirement incomes policy which we have sought to develop. </PARA>
<PARA> Other speakers in this debate have talked about the fact that we have an ageing population, the fact that we need to plan properly to provide for that ageing population and the fact that provision of superannuation coverage, as a matter of principle, is something that needs to apply across the board. That has been the Government's fundamental objective in the whole question of occupational superannuation arrangements. I do not know how anyone who relates the question of superannuation today to the experience in 1983 can come to the conclusion that the honourable member for Mitchell did: as far as the respective performances of this Government and previous governments on this issue are concerned, the available figures will stand any scrutiny that might be thrust upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental principles that apply are: superannuation should be promoted and encouraged for all and it should be part of award provisions because that gives the certainty and predictability. Currently something like 70 per cent of workers are actively contributing to award based superannuation arrangements. That has a number of very positive effects. Firstly, for the workers themselves it has very positive effects because it helps them to provide for their own retirement, which is something we would wish to plan and see occur. Secondly, and equally importantly, the contribution that those superannuation funds are making to the national savings effort is something that the nation is going to continue to reap the benefits of over the decades to come. </PARA>
<PARA> In talking about that it is relevant to say that the arrangements in terms of the supervisory and prudential requirements that apply to superannuation funds are a matter of great concern, not only to everybody in this chamber but also to the great bulk of the population, who are now at long last, after so many years of conservative rule, getting the benefits of superannuation from a Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with those things in mind that I think it is very important to take account of what the levy is designed to do and the important role that the ISC has in ensuring the ongoing security and scrutiny of the arrangements for those funds, particularly in terms of the funds managers. It is very important obviously that there be public confidence in that process. </PARA>
<PARA> I was certainly very pleased to note the actions of the Reserve Bank of Australia a fortnight or so ago when it released new guidelines for the banks involved in management of superannuation funds. In recent times many people have raised this key issue and it has been the subject of discussion during the inquiry of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into the banking system. Many people who have made submissions to that inquiry have raised this issue as a very legitimate concern. There is a need to ensure that the arrangements that apply to the banks' involvement in the management of those superannuation funds is not blurred with other banking operations. It is urgent that the Reserve Bank develop those matters in comprehensive detail and that the liaison between the Reserve Bank and the ISC is comprehensive so as to ensure a thorough and comprehensive coverage of the supervisory arrangements. The management of funds in the climate of recent major corporate failures has highlighted how important that is. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of this legislation is the concept of the social wage in terms of superannuation. We on this side of the House make no apology for seeing the provision of that social wage, of a real retirement incomes policy. Again, this has been the development of this Government; no previous government has made proper provision. I could nominate many of my constituents who have retired without having had any semblance of a chance to obtain superannuation. Pleasingly we now have a real retirement incomes policy which encourages people to provide for their retirement. It gives the incentive through award arrangements and thus enables them to do it. At the same time, it recognises the need to provide real security for those people who lack the opportunity to get superannuation coverage in their working life. That is being done in a number of ways. Principally, it is being done through a separation of the age pension arrangements from the income area. This is a central part of the Government's comprehensive policy. It has been the subject of our endeavours in this field. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mitchell referred to the fact that Government members and many others have been saying that we should not reinvest part of the great pool of savings acquired through superannuation as a result of our initiatives in productive arrangements-new production, new investment, plant and equipment, industries and so forth. With the greatest of respect, I suggest that the honourable member for Mitchell did not appreciate the difficulty of getting finance in this country for many of those initiatives. If he was talking about specifics of projects, it would be understandable. But as to the principle of trying to ensure that the superannuation funds move away from the high concentration of investment in property related investment, there is a very strong case to argue that this country has not been conscious enough of the need to invest resources in productive opportunities. With proper prudential standards and proper arrangements it is timely to ensure that, as that pool of national savings is developed because of the much greater involvement of the community in superannuation, we try to harness some of those resources back into things other than the property fields in which people and, in particular, the major institutions have wanted to be the principal investors. We should be saying to those institutions that they should be trying to develop a better mix in the portfolio of investments, so that part of those resources and financial funds that they manage can be channelled back for the well-being not only of this generation of Australians but also those that follow. </PARA>
<PARA> Be it in urban industry, manufactured goods or rural Australia, the principal issue is that we need to develop the notion, as many other countries have, that investment in those sorts of things can be just as successful as any other form of investment if the right climate and the right standards are applied. As time goes on it will become critical that Australians get full value for their contributions to the national savings that the superannuation extensions provide. It is important that we do all we can to encourage that objective. </PARA>
<PARA> Time and time again we see the difficulties-this has arisen in the banking inquiry as well-many Australian companies have in getting capital to embark upon new ventures. Particularly small businesses have difficulty in getting the wherewithal-even though they are very successful operations-to expand, develop and diversify. Superannuation savings and the funds that they offer are potentially the greatest generation of capital for many of this country's investments. We should be trying to promote and encourage that. </PARA>
<PARA> Much is said about what arrangements should apply in the reform of the labour market. I pay tribute to the role that the trade union movement has played. For the benefit of its work force and constituents, it has sought to extend the whole area of superannuation. Fortunately it no longer is up against the argument that many in the work force, particularly blue collar workers, do not have a right to superannuation. We now know that that is not the case. That has been a very positive reform of the trade union movement. It has recognised the need to move away from a wage based purely on a pay-what people take home each week or each fortnight-to the concept of the social wage. This is a very important initiative. As has been said previously, part of that has involved the accord process and part the reduction in real unit labour costs. A large reason for that has been the tax-wage trade-off participated in by the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions during the life of the Hawke Government. The other critical part of that has been the extension of superannuation coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> That social wage is fundamental. The work force will accept and is willing to support initiatives that do not involve just extra take home pay and make a contribution to national policy and to national savings, as superannuation clearly does. The work force will support those broad national objectives very comprehensively and very thoroughly. But it will also seek an equity attached to those fundamental principles. It will seek a sense of social justice that should rightly attach to those arrangements. Because of that the trade union movement has been so supportive of the particular arrangements for superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard a number of Opposition speakers say, `We don't believe that employers should be responsible for this sort of superannuation business'. No doubt many of their constituents have been the beneficiaries of superannuation for years. In the past all sorts of tax shelters were built into the process. These gave real incentive to those people fortunate enough to have superannuation. It is only since this Government came to power that fairness and equity have been applied to that. There has been a recognition that those arrangements for superannuation should be applied on a more broad spectrum to ensure that all members of the work force are able to derive the certainty and the security of knowing that part of their retirement will be paid for because of their contributions during their working life. </PARA>
<PARA> I think those initiatives and the application of the fundamental principle of the social wage will be increasingly important in this whole area. Much is made about the notion of the importance of national savings. I do not believe there are any ways of saving that are nearly as effective in being a positive contribution to the national savings effort as the Government's approach in the area of superannuation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The key points in this particular legislation are to ensure that the means of supervision for those arrangements through the ISC, through the arrangements it has devised in conjunction with the Reserve Bank, with its supervisory role over banks, are effective so that the managers of those funds know clearly and precisely what their obligations are going to be, and to ensure that there is certainty for the investors in those funds.</PARA>
<PARA> This whole question of security, prudential requirements and various sorts of corporate stands that are set-capital adequacy-have become increasingly important issues in recent times. We have seen in a variety of fields concern being expressed about institutions in which people are investing their money in one way or another, be it the banking system, superannuation or other things. The public has a right and expectation at all times to ensure that the Government lays down precise and clear guidelines so it can have full confidence in those arrangements. With these measures we are saying we are making sure those arrangements are there. It has always been determined that those arrangements would be determined on the basis of cost recovery. If one considers the value of what is involved here, it is a perfectly reasonable arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestions that were made that taxpayers should automatically pick up the bill would be inappropriate. The measures contained in these Bills provide a very fair and effective way of ensuring, I believe, the future well-being of superannuation funds and, particularly, that contributors to superannuation funds have their needs provided for and, importantly, that their confidence is assured. Therefore, I have pleasure in supporting the Bills before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, as honourable members who have previously spoken have said, this is legislation to create a funding mechanism for the supervision of superannuation funds. Considering there has been a plethora of those in recent times with the development of occupational superannuation as we know it-in other words, union superannuation funds-it has become very clear that government has a more demanding role in ensuring that the so called savings of individual Australians, paid for them by their employers, are protected so there will be some funds left when these people reach retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a pity the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) has just left the chamber because some of his remarks are worthy of comment. He made all the usual remarks about people's savings and how superannuation is going to be to the national benefit. I hold an entirely different view. I totally support government initiatives and government incentives for people to generate retirement savings. I just do not think superannuation is necessarily the answer. I am totally positive that our so called occupational superannuation is not the answer. It is not the answer in the first instance because three per cent is a joke. Six per cent is a joke, and I am told amounts up to 15 per cent would be required before any reasonable sum of money would be available to a person on achieving the age of 55. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is also stupid to make those retirement funds available at 55. People are quite capable of continuing to work after the age of 55. The Opposition today supports an age higher than 65, if that is the choice of the individual. Why should we be encouraging people to grab the money and to run at 55? All we are doing is financing a couple of overseas trips. Then they are back onto the public purse, anyway; that is not smart. </PARA>
<PARA> So the operation is flawed. There is also the basic benefit to the contributor. The contributor is not the employer who makes the payments; it is the employee who will eventually get the benefit. Some of my constituents have been smart enough to ask questions of the insurance company concerned when their employer has been obliged to pay the money; they took some time in getting that information. I am talking here of a couple of shearers who are in casual employment-one might say itinerant employment-and have numerous employers who are obliged to pay in this money, which creates problems in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA> These people were interested to see how they were going. One individual in his first year of operation, the period from 15 March 1989 to 23 January 1990, received contributions from a variety of employers of $165.64. He now has an account balance of $34.58. That is a great help to his retirement. The other person is a little bit luckier-this only proves the point that the more money people get under this so called workers occupational scheme, the more money they are likely to keep-he was paid a much higher rate in this period and received $382.86, and now has an account balance of $191.35, which is still less than half of what he received. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we look at another person who has taken advantage of the Government's $3,000 deductible amount. Last year, at the end of the first year in the scheme, he had a balance of $2,940. He had made contributions during the year of $3,000-the maximum tax deductible amount-giving him a total for the year, the balance plus the contribution, of $5,940. He now has $5,630.52 net balance. That is less money than he contributed. The question is: how can that happen? Let me point out that has happened in the good times of 1988, 1989 and 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> In the third case I gave, the interest that was credited to that account was paid at 11.6 per cent. That sounds pretty good when one reads in the papers of funds giving dividends even higher than that, sometimes 20 per cent. But what we are never told is that that is not what the employer or the worker personally contributed, but it is what is left after everybody has had their finger in the till. In the case of occupational superannuation, we start with the trade unions. I have tried desperately to find out exactly how much money individual trade unions take out of occupational superannuation, but that is about as secretive as donations from WA Inc. to the Federal Labor Party. I cannot get the information in the places it should be. Maybe now that we are funding a better supervisory system that question will be answered because the contributor, the poor old worker who has to front up one day and presumably live on that grandiose sum, is entitled to know. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that quite some time ago, when the building unions got into this caper, I think the employer contribution was $11 per person per week, and the union was taking $1. The next thing we read was that there were three million contributors in this scheme, so presumably the trade union movement drags off something like $3m a week-but that is a guess. I do not know. All I know is that every time an employer makes a contribution to one of these schemes, the trade union profits, notwithstanding it has practically no involvement whatsoever in many of these schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, of course, there are the fund managers who invest the contributions of the worker. These people are paid a substantial amount for turning this money into more money. I want to come back to that remark in a minute because they get paid even if they do not turn it into more money. They get their money up front. That was not too bad for a while until the Treasurer (Mr Keating) decided that he was missing out on this bonanza and that he also should take 15 per cent up front. In the case of the third example that I gave of a person who made contributions of $5,940 and ended up with $5,630, $450 was taken out of his retirement investment up front. Consequently, superannuation under this Government is a pretty lousy investment. </PARA>
<PARA> But it gets worse. These are the sorts of results that were achieved when the investment climate was excellent and when huge returns, some of a paper nature, were being achieved by fund managers. The Australian Financial Review of 12 March 1991 contained an article by Anthony Boyd. Under the headline `Property downturn stings super funds', the article states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the second half of 1990, a number of balanced fund managers with direct property investments felt the effects of lower property returns. Returns from the property portfolios of five major fund managers varied from-6 per cent for the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust to 8.2 per cent for the National Mutual in the year to December 31, 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a good year. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The average in 1990 was-0.3 per cent, but in the final three months of 1990 dropped to-3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>So we are not even getting a growth component; we are actually seeing the funds reduced further at the present time. This is what the Government is imposing on the workers of Australia. It is talking about putting the figure up to 6 per cent, which will double the Government's profit up front, which will double the fund managers' profit up front and which will no doubt increase trade unions' profit to some degree. </PARA>
<PARA> The average worker does not have a clue because, unlike the three people to whom I referred who had a bit of `I wanted to know', most people never ask. Employers never ask. Although this is a statutory requirement, a fraud is being practised on the Australian working community. The alternative is for people to put the 3 per cent in their pockets. Take it from me, they may as well go and have a bet on the dogs, the horses or anything else with the money because their chances of getting a profit are somewhat better-not good, but somewhat better. Those who are a little more responsible might at least put that money in a savings bank and have some guarantee of a return in terms of interest. They might also invest it in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA> So that is the situation today. However, what has been happening will not stop there. Already the Government has its greedy eyes on superannuation. The honourable member for Parramatta did not allude to this once; he alluded to it two or three times. He told us that what is happening is going to be in the national interest and that the money will be able to be used in so many ways to promote Australia. I suppose it can. </PARA>
<PARA> But what has been suggested? Let me refer to Australia Reconstructed, an Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) document that was written after a delegation had rushed off to Sweden and other countries of Scandinavia to find out how to run Australia. Of course, it passed this on to the Government. The members of the delegation expressed great concern about the investment practices of large superannuation funds and I have a similar concern. This is the other great problem. The Treasurer tells us that shortly $600 billion will be locked up among a very limited number of fund managers who, of course, are having great difficulty in finding the sorts of investments they need in Australia to service that money and give an adequate return. But the reality is that too few people are controlling too much money. </PARA>
<PARA> In an official speech to the ACTU in Sydney, the Treasurer told the trade union movement, `Listen, boys, you are losing industrial muscle. You had better start and grab management control of the funds. You will have to exert some financial muscle'. That is very encouraging to the contributors. We have just seen what Cain has managed to do to the finances of Victoria. He is a good Labor man. We are hearing daily of the disastrous financial management in Western Australia by successive Labor Premiers. They were good at fundraising but not much good at fund management. </PARA>
<PARA> It is being suggested by the Treasurer and the ACTU that there should be more government involvement in the management of these funds, whether contributions are made compulsorily through the occupational superannuation arrangements that are written down in awards or privately by people as a retirement arrangement. I think Australia Reconstructed said that 20 per cent of all the assets of these funds should be put into another fund to be invested by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day Senator Button tried to heavy the private insurance companies into establishing, I think, a $1 billion fund so that he and others could start making decisions on picking winners and lend money to the lower end of the small business market. We all agree that more funds should be made available for the small end of the business market. But we do not want governments starting to decide which business has a chance to succeed. Their track record is diabolical. Of course, the superannuation funds were a little reluctant because their managers and directors are charged with delivering the highest possible profit to their contributors. But government is going to get its sticky fingers into this area. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the things that we are being confronted with. Do not worry, there will be further erosion. Government keeps nibbling away. Even the chief officer of the AMP said the other day, `Oh well, I suppose we have to start thinking about these things'. The Government has given hundreds of billions of dollars to big companies. These companies, which think big, are not really geared up to lend or are interested in lending Mr and Mrs Smith $5,000 or $10,000 so that they can start their own small business. Of course, the system does not allow Mr and Mrs Smith to save their own money tax free and invest it in their own small business, which would be a lot more practical. </PARA>
<PARA> Why can the system not do those sorts of things? It is quite a practical proposition for the Taxation Commissioner to allow a couple to invest in a second accommodation unit with $3,000 a year tax free. That would help the building industry. It would take away some of the burden on government of providing additional housing for the homeless. But more importantly, at the end of that ownership the value of that bricks and mortar asset would always represent the values of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> This arrangement is in stark contrast with superannuation. Unfortunately, superannuation deals in dollars. This is no fault of the companies. The simple fact is that superannuation companies pay out contributors with an amount which is usually agreed to. However, inflation destroys the value of that amount. The simple fact today is that, one after another, people who pick up lump sum superannuation payments entered into 20 or 30 years ago are receiving an average of $50,000 or $60,000. This amount of money will not even buy one a decent motor car today. When those people entered into an agreement 30 years ago and someone said, `The benefits payable under this policy amount to $60,000' they thought, `What a fortune'. Two or three years ago I was given the example of people entering into a contract for a superannuation payout which at the time would have bought them a block of flats. Their plan was to use the lump sum to buy a block of flats, live in one of them and have a good income from the rest. Of course, the money will not buy half a flat because the value of the property assets has exploded but the money has remained the same. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is fraudulently misleading Australians when he tells them what a big deal he has done for them. It does not work. Conversely, the Government could say about the $3,000 a year that is presently allowable as an investment in superannuation, `You can invest it in bricks and mortar; the Commissioner of Taxation will put a caveat over that property to ensure that your tax-free investment is kept for your retirement'. That is quite practical. It has minor administrative problems; it would be hard work, but there would be no problem administratively in doing that. People could then invest in something real. They could invest in the bricks and mortar component of their own small business or farm. Why not, if that is what they are going to live on in their retirement?</PARA>
<PARA> The big thing is that it spreads the investment around Australia. Through occupational superannuation the Government is channelling investment into these very large companies. They have looked around Australia and they cannot afford to own any more of BPH or one of those companies. They say, `There is nothing suitable for our investment policies in Australia; we will go overseas.' That is not all wrong, as the Treasurer tells us. If we can build up a few assets overseas, at least they will compensate for all the money we have borrowed overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in terms of jobs for Australians, there is not much hope in big investments overseas. That is what is worrying the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I agree with its concern; it just has the wrong solution, which is, as I mentioned, obliging people to give the money to the Government so that it can invest it on their behalf. They might have some chance with a Liberal government, but on the track record of recent Labor governments, they do not have one scrap; there would be nothing left. </PARA>
<PARA> At this very moment the funds are profiting at minus per cent, so why force people to put their savings into them? Why force people to put their savings into a system where so much money is taken out up front by various people with their fingers in the till that the net benefit in any one year-notwithstanding that interest has been earned, because interest is earned only on what is left after all those things are taken out, including the fund manager's percentage-is less at the end of the year than it was at the beginning? What is the benefit of that? We may as well give the people the money. As I said, if the millions of workers who are now being forced into these occupational superannuation schemes had their money in their pay packets and could put it into savings banks, they would all be better off. So much for this wonderful scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, Australia will be better off when individual Australians are encouraged to save. It still might be superannuation, and I do not object to that. If that is their personal choice and they want to put their money into a superannuation fund because it is easy, good luck to them. They just will not have as much as the person who goes out, tries a bit harder and, say, invests in bricks and mortar or some other practical investment and saves his money. They will have a capital guaranteed return on their retirement, which is good for Australia and which reduces the tax burden, and their investments will be good for other Australians. It is about time the Government woke up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Superannuation is one of the important issues that go with people's long term retirement plans. It is such an important issue that it should not be brushed aside as some sort of alternative; people should plan for their retirement to ensure that they have a solid and stable income and can enjoy their lives at a time when they should not have to worry where their next dollar is coming from. Certainly, in preparing for retirement, superannuation is the real answer, and this Government has had a very strong commitment to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coming to the fore of superannuation in Australia stands as one of the strongest achievements of the Hawke Government, especially in the way that superannuation has been taken out of the realms of the rich and made accessible to all Australians. At one stage it was the case that only the rich actually benefited from superannuation and they used it as a great tax deduction. Now it has become an area for retirement planning. It is available to all Australians, particularly to Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA> Through such initiatives as dividend imputation, for instance, incentives have been given to superannuation funds to invest in Australian companies, as has already been said here today, while through award-based superannuation average Australians are being given the foundations for greater independence when they enter their retirement years. </PARA>
<PARA> Before outlining some of the ways in which the legislation before us today will build on these benefits, I wish to pay tribute to the work of the trade union movement for the realisation of many of the superannuation benefits now afforded to the workers of this country. I emphasise that it is only via this consultative process with the trade union movement that genuine improvements can be made to the overall wage outcome for our workers. Under the industrial relations regime proposed by the Opposition, such changes would be stifled to the detriment of all workers. </PARA>
<PARA> Following this track, the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991 contains provisions that propose to make individual superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts pay for the services of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission on a more equitable basis. Specifically, these relate to the certificate of compliance required by funds and trusts to obtain relevant taxation concessions. It is currently the position that $40 is paid by these funds with each return lodged. The Bill proposes to replace this fee with a levy called a superannuation supervisory levy, which would consist of two components-the basic levy and the late lodgment amount. </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriately, so as not to stifle the smaller funds and to allow them to grow, it is proposed that funds or trusts with assets of $500,000 or less will pay a levy which approximates only the actual cost of processing of the return. This is because, generally, small funds make little or no call on Insurance and Superannuation Commission resources other than the processing of their returns. In turn, measures are contained in the legislation providing for large funds to pay a graduated levy, with a maximum levy applying at a level which would recoup all the remaining costs. It is intended that the amount of the levy be prescribed by regulation, with the initial ceiling on the levy being set at $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures combined will result in full cost recovery for the operation of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The decision to bring about this change in the service fees paid by funds and trusts to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission reflects the adaptability of the Government to change the framework where necessary to further foster the superannuation industry in Australia. I point out that while on the surface the maximum levy of $30,000 may seem much more than the flat $40 fee imposed currently, for large funds or trusts the new scale is proportionate to the current fee being paid by a fund with $500,000 in assets. </PARA>
<PARA> While the ceiling proposed is $30,000, it is expected that the maximum levy imposed by regulation for the first year or so of operation will be about one-sixth of that, or around $5,000, as an additional incentive for funds or trusts to lodge their returns before the date specified by the Commissioner. As proof that this is not a penalty but rather an incentive, the late lodgment amount is not to be charged until a 14-day period of grace has passed. I point out also that its prime purpose is in line with the original aim of this legislation, which is to effect full cost recovery on the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the incentive side of the argument, the amount will cover the additional costs involved in processing annual returns that are lodged late. The value of this additional protection measure is not to be underestimated, and this potency is reflected in the intended formula for its calculation. Subject to a minimum amount, the late lodgment amount will be 20 per cent per annum of the basic levy for the particular fund for the year of income to which the return refers, with this amount calculated monthly and rounded up to the next whole dollar. Following from this, the minimum monthly amount will be 12.5 per cent of the smallest basic levy for the year of income to which the return refers, calculated monthly and, as with each late lodgment amount, rounded up to the next whole dollar. The total of the late lodgment amount would be the sum of the monthly amounts calculated. </PARA>
<PARA> So we see that in this Bill there is that central theme of equity encompassed in so many of the policy initiatives of the Hawke Government. However, as I pointed out earlier, one of the latent provisions in the legislation is its strongest feature as far as the benefits it delivers for the Australian worker are concerned, and that is the way it helps to open up superannuation to more and more people. The Hawke Government's commitment to this ideal is seen clearly in its recognition that superannuation is the best way to save for retirement. For too long, generations of Australian workers slaved through their working lives not being able to look forward to much independence once they retired. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite would do well to reflect on what they did for the Australian worker in the superannuation area when they had their chance. What did they do? Absolutely nothing. Under previous Liberal-National regimes, with scant regard paid to superannuation as the best way to provide for oneself in retirement, workers had to resign themselves to the most meagre of pensions. What did the Liberals and Nationals do on that score? Again, nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the House that it was not until this Government came into office that the nettle was grasped and superannuation was brought out of the realm of the rich and made available to all Australians. As a community this view was held for one good reason: those opposite had instilled in our workers-the average Australians-the mentality that superannuation was out of their league, and they alone can carry the can for this being maintained. As a direct result of this Government's policies, we are now turning this thinking around. No matter how old or young people are, they are now realising that with good planning they can look forward to a better standard of living in retirement by supplementing the age pension with superannuation or providing for their own retirement pension through a superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In the superannuation arena the Government also recognises a greatly increased proportion of women in the work force and the associated benefits they will receive from superannuation incentives for, through the consultative process with the union movement that I referred to earlier, many of these working women are sharing the benefits of award superannuation. As a result of an agreement between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions in 1985, awards which cover about 85 per cent of the work force are earning workers 3 per cent of their wages in superannuation for their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, it is the Government's view that superannuation benefits should be accessible to all in the work force, be they full time or part time, male or female. Through the efforts of this Government, people who work as little as 10 hours per week can join a superannuation scheme. More evidence of the commitment to providing flexibility at the same time as accessibility is the measure which allows people to leave work for up to two years and to continue contributing to their superannuation fund. This is of particular benefit to women who may wish to leave work temporarily to start a family. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at the benefits that the 3 per cent award superannuation has brought to Australian workers. It is available to the majority of the work force. It is paid by their employer. The benefits are not lost if they change jobs. The benefits are maintained until at least the age of 55 or in later retirement. Significantly, the Government recognises that award superannuation is not the end of planning for one's retirement for, on its own, it will provide only a modest supplement for superannuation. So to provide further inventive for workers to contribute more of their earnings towards superannuation, the Government has instituted a significant extension of tax deductions for personal superannuation benefits, which took effect from 1 July 1990. Again I point out that these tax deductibility provisions have come about only after long consultation with the industry and the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements now mean that, for a self-employed person and for employees without employer superannuation support, tax deductions will be allowed for the full amount of the first $3,000 per annum of personal superannuation contributions and 75 per cent of all additional contributions up to the amount necessary to fund benefits at the reasonable benefits limit for the individual concerned. Further, employees whose only employer superannuation support is under an award based industry superannuation arrangement will be able to receive a tax deduction for personal superannuation contributions of up to $3,000 per annum, as was the case previously. Also following these changes, other employees with modest levels of employer superannuation support will now be entitled to a tax rebate for personal superannuation contributions, the level of which will depend on the level of employer support and the employee's actual income. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence of the Government's desire for a smooth administrative transition with any new arrangements is seen in the modifications made to the measures used to calculate employer support in superannuation funds for employees with modest levels of support. These changes also remove the existing anomaly whereby employees with award superannuation support were afforded tax concessions for personal contributions while employees with comparable levels of non-award employer superannuation support were not. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard many tirades from the Opposition about what it sees as the downside of dividend imputation; yet this single measure has a great deal to do with the healthy and competitive environment that has been created, ensuring dedicated and sustained investment in Australian companies. The system operates to impute and allocate tax paid at the company level as a credit to such shareholders, who will be assessed on the total amount of the dividend and the imputation credit. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been made very clear by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on a number of occasions, if a superannuation fund is managed well, the 15 per cent tax imposed on the funds can be reduced to as low as 3 per cent or 4 per cent through dividend imputation. I would go so far as to say that any fund that is not substantially reducing its tax commitment via dividend imputation is doing a grave disservice to its policy holders. </PARA>
<PARA> One only needs to look at the actual tax paid by some superannuation funds and trusts to see real evidence of the benefits to be derived from dividend imputation. I refer here to page 139 of the 1989-90 annual report from the Commissioner of Taxation, which shows that for that year pooled superannuation trusts in Australia reduced their tax commitments from 15 per cent to 1.77 per cent through dividend imputation. This highlights the importance for investors to select their funds wisely and the benefits to be gained for policyholders who do so. </PARA>
<PARA> While on the subject of superannuation and associated taxes, it should also be pointed out that, of the 13,000 superannuation fund tax returns for the 1988-89 year processed as at 11 March 1990, as a group they paid no net tax. Not only did they pay no capital gains tax; they did not pay tax on any other income, either. These figures stand as testament to the success of dividend imputation in attracting more Australians to look at superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> I alluded earlier to how previous conservative governments had all but ignored any constructive planning for retirement. While on the subject of superannuation and its importance in this regard, I feel it timely to outline the achievements of the Government in improving our pension entitlements. For all their shallow criticisms of reforms in the pensions area, those opposite should first look at what they did for senior Australians. Under conservative governments, pensioners were the forgotten Australians. The clearest example of the difference in approaches to addressing our ageing population between this Labor Government and previous coalition governments is a three-stage reform plan included in the document Better Incomes: Retirement Income Policy into the Next Century. </PARA>
<PARA> So we see that when it comes to planning in this country for a fast-ageing population-of which the superannuation legislation before us tonight is an integral part-we have two plans. We have the one put forward by the Government, which delivers a comprehensive package of measures that is both sustainable and equitable, addressing all the needs of an older community, or one which is made up of a haphazard solution that serves only to create a greater demand on the public purse in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Government came into office, the legacy of the previous coalition Government had pensioners receiving a mere $77.25 per week or 22.7 per cent of average weekly earnings. Today the standard pension rate for singles is $301.60 per fortnight or 25.4 per cent of average weekly earnings, further surpassing the goal of this Government to make the standard pension payment at least 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. For married couples, the combined pension rate has increased from $128.80 per week under the Fraser-Howard Government to $235.40 per week now. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we all recall the days when our pensioner population had to sit down on Budget night and wait to see whether they were going to get an increase in their pensions or not. Now we have our half-yearly adjustments, which certainly ensure that our aged population is well cared for. </PARA>
<PARA> In real terms, after allowing for inflation, both the standard and combined pension rates have increased by 9.9 per cent since March 1983, compared to a fall of 2.4 per cent under the previous Fraser Government. This Government has not been content merely to increase the amount of money going into pensioners' pockets each week. In 1987 the Government brought a greater degree of flexibility in earning capacity for pensioners with the introduction of the pensioner earnings credit scheme. This scheme allows maximum rate pensioners to undertake seasonal or casual employment with earnings above the free area for short periods without a reduction in pension. In this way, it provides encouragement for pensioners to supplement their incomes. These achievements show that it has been this Government's ability to plan ahead for the multitude of changes that will face Australia into the next century that has not only become its hallmark but has stood us clearly apart from members opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> I will comment briefly on some of the comments of the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) last night. I was surprised at some of the figures that he was using and I took the opportunity to have a look at them today. Towards the end of his speech last night-I think he had about two minutes before he was due to finish-he briefly touched on the coalition's policy. That is understandable-it would probably take less than two minutes to run through it, although retirement income policy is a very complex area and is not something that one can just brush aside in a couple of minutes as almost an afterthought at the end of a 30-minute speech by the spokesman from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I was rather surprised to hear the comments of the honourable member for Dawson that the coalition's policy on superannuation is certainly on the record. It was certainly on the record that the members of the coalition have done nothing for many, many years, and they probably will continue to do nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dawson used a lot of figures here last night, and I was rather intrigued as to how he worked them all out and as to what we can do with figures, how we can distort figures when we come to use them. The honourable member for Dawson, in my view, has done a very neat job in telling only half the story in his comments last night about this Government's record in Budget deficits and their linkage with providing a stable environment for savings. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the sum total of Budget deficits and surpluses of this Government being $7 billion, the honourable member for Dawson is correct. However, the Government stands proud on its record of being the first government in Australia's history to produce a Budget surplus. In all Budgets delivered by this Government after the first, there has been a gradual progression in cutbacks in spending, with the $7 billion deficit recorded in our first Budget being a legacy of the $10 billion Budget deficit that we inherited from the coalition Government. In that one year, this Government was able to reduce that legacy of the coalition by some 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> For the honourable member for Dawson the news gets worse. On a best case outcome, the sum Budget position for the Fraser-Howard years is $17.295 billion. The true position in budgetary management is reflected, though, when budgetary performance is expressed as the same percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) in today's terms. Realistically put, that figure would equate to around $59 billion in today's terms. At that same percentage of GDP, this year's expected Budget surplus would instead be a deficit of $28 billion. I ask the honourable member for Dawson: what does that do for savings? Of course, it does very little. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to mention some of the things the honourable member for Dawson mentioned last night in trying to suggest that we do not benefit a lot from superannuation as a form of savings, because I really believe we do. Superannuation, as a means of retirement savings for people, has been one of the great innovative things that this Government has done. We often hear criticism of employers having to pay the 3 per cent. It must be considered that that 3 per cent was actually negotiated with the Australian work force through the trade union movement as part of the income package. So the 3 per cent is not something that workers receive in addition to what they were actually entitled to, but it is something they actually put aside for their own retirement. It is not by any means a payment that employers gave them in addition to the normal income entitlements that they were looking for. </PARA>
<PARA> I think those sorts of things need to be put aside. Really we should consider the long term important things that superannuation does for this country and for our savings, and also for looking after people in their retirement. I think many of us here now who have parents who are retired understand very much how that is--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to take part in this debate. The Bills, the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill 1991 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991, are relatively narrow in their objective, but it is proper for us to ask what, in achieving their objective, is the purpose behind the imposition of this cost collection system on the superannuation industry?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Insurance and Superannuation Commission was established under the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner Act 1987. In its most recent report, the annual report for 1989-90, it drew attention to the fact that in establishing the Commission, the Government had decided that full costs of the supervisory operations of superannuation should be recovered by the establishment of a lodgment fee for the annual return form. </PARA>
<PARA> It went on to point out in the report that the fee that it was charging was not fully recovering the costs of its operations, and it said that the need for a change in fees required to cover costs of supervisory functions in respect of superannuation had been brought to the attention of the Government. I guess that, the Government having had it brought to its attention, that was the origin of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we need, even in legislation such as this, to go back to basics and to ask ourselves what is the role of government. Some would say the role of government is to lay down the requirements for peace, order and good government of the people. One of those significant elements of the good government of the people is to provide security for the people, not only in an external sense but also in a domestic sense. That security not only means law and order; it also means security for the environment and security for the economic circumstances in which individuals and their families operate. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the areas which become important is that if it is part of government policy that there should be a retirement incomes policy, whereby people are in large measure encouraged to provide some, if not all, of the resources they need in retirement, it is one thing to encourage that to happen, but it becomes a legitimate role of government then to set the standards by which people as consumers can save for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Previous speakers in this debate have talked about the principle of caveat emptor-the risk is on the buyer. That is relatively easy to administer when I go into a supermarket and buy a kilogram of apples, but it is more difficult when I am saving the value that I might have spent on the apples as a small element of my retirement income. If I am 25 when I am making that saving, will the money be there when I am 65, or even at some later age? Therefore, I think it is very important that governments do set standards that are commonly described as the prudential standards relating to long term savings. </PARA>
<PARA> In this country we have had a very long tradition of requiring the life insurance industry to have proper prudential standards, to have its commitments to its policy holders properly actuarially assessed, so that the assets that are being built up in the funds that will ultimately be drawn on, sometimes 40 years ahead, will be there to discharge the obligation that was entered into by the life insurance company. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that we have been as rigorous with the superannuation industry as we have been with the life insurance industry. I do not believe that today we are sufficiently rigorous with the superannuation industry, and indeed it may be we are not being sufficiently rigorous with the life insurance industry itself, although that industry is quickly shifting the emphasis of its activities from life insurance to superannuation-which is like life insurance except that one takes it out at 65 rather than taking it out at death at a later or earlier stage, which is the prime element of the life insurance contract. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important that there be consumer or saver protection. This legislation is to make that industry that is gathering the long term savings of the community pay for, out of those savings and the income those savings earn, the cost of supervision. My grave worry is that the amount that we will allocate to setting and implementing prudential standards may be totally inadequate to achieve the expectations of the consumers, the individual people. It is not a matter of what the industry likes or what the industry can afford; the industry is there as a service industry to provide a safe haven for the long term savings of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> We should spend everything that is necessary on the supervision of that industry not to guarantee but to be as sure as we possibly can that the savers get the returns when they call on those returns. If people want to buy other products unrelated to retirement income, unrelated to life insurance policies, other products that do not have taxpayer benefit because there is significant tax sheltering available to the life insurance industry as well as to the superannuation industry, then let them do so-if they want to take high risk and perhaps win or perhaps lose. We cannot afford to do that with the nation's long term superannuation savings. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0K4">Mr WILSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I may be. He was quite significant in the contribution he made to this House. My concern is not that a charge is being imposed by this Bill. My concern is: is that charge adequate? After having looked at the 1989-90 report of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, I do not think-certainly from the reading of the report-that it has supervisory standards sufficiently rigorous to achieve the objectives of the Australian people. Bearing in mind that it has only been in operation a relatively short time and maybe it has not got its act together-and I will give it the benefit of that doubt-I hope that in its next report the Commission will begin to spell out in far more detail the sort of standards that it seeks to impose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are some very worrying features about the things it says in that report. It says that one of its primary functions is to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . supervise insurance companies, insurance brokers and superannuation funds in accordance with the requirements of relevant legislation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then, of course, we have to look at the legislation, and in parts of the Commission's report it touches on that. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>In performing its functions, the Commission aims to carry out its supervisory and policy responsibilities in a way which avoids unnecessary intervention in the business activities of the industries. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that, if it is talking about involvement in the day to day investment management policies of business. But I am a little worried that there is a sort of almost cop-out element to that statement. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In order to achieve this, it places emphasis on consultation and discussion with relevant industry, professional and other bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>That is important, but are we getting the standards that are needed to guarantee to the 25-year-old his retirement income in 40 years time?</PARA>
<PARA>The objective-</PARA>
<PARA>it says-</PARA>
<PARA>is to ensure the financial protection of insurance policyholders and superannuation fund members, while at the same time being flexible and responsive to the need for the industries to adjust to changing social, economic and business conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>It says also that the economic climate has changed-and it has-and that life insurance policy people move to favour stable capital guaranteed insurance products rather than market linked ones. Is it examining and does it have prudential responsibility for market linked ones? I wonder whether that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> So it becomes, I think, a very important thing that we ask the Commission: if it is getting the fee, is it raising enough to enable it to do the job that this Parliament wants it to do for the Australian people? I am not yet reassured that it either is collecting the money or has the standards of prudential requirement to actuarially assess every fund to ensure that those funds can pay out the amounts that are due in the future. I am not sure that it has sufficient standards to minimise the Occidental type of payment. </PARA>
<PARA> How did that happen? Why did not the supervisor have in place audit check arrangements that prevented that from happening? Maybe it did; maybe the administration failed; maybe it was an inevitability. I do not know, but I am not reassured that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission regards that as its responsibility, for elsewhere in its report it says, `Yes, we require every fund to put in an annual report and, with it, to include an independent auditor's certification that the fund meets the operational standards as set out in the form'. How adequate are those operational standards? What responsibility are those auditors taking? Is the Commission shifting the responsibility to the auditors and, if so, has the Commission made clear to those auditors what their job is and what is expected of them?</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission also wants an actuarial report to be prepared periodically in the cases of defined benefit funds. Periodically? How often; is it sufficient; and why only in relation to defined benefit funds? Where funds are going into superannuation that is not necessarily defined benefit funds, but they are going in with a huge amount of tax sheltering and tax relief, why is it not that we want actuarial reports on those funds so that we here in this Parliament can say to those who are providing their money through superannuation schemes that it is safe and that they, like the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who drew the attention of the House to this, can be assured that they will get more money out of a superannuation fund than they would have if they had been allowed to keep it themselves?</PARA>
<PARA> I move on to that point. There is tax sheltering to an oligopolistic group of insurance funds and superannuation fund managers. I think the system should be freed up. I think the individual Australian should be able to choose where he or she wants to invest his or her superannuation funds-and I have said this before in this House, I will say it again and I will keep on saying it until it happens-so that the individual Australian, if he or she gets tax sheltered savings as a result of the concessions available to superannuation, if he or she gives a guarantee that he or she will not call on the social security system to the extent that that contributor has benefited from tax concessions, can save it as he or she pleases. They should be able to put it into their house so that they can provide the third or fourth bedroom for their children; put it into any saving that they like. </PARA>
<PARA> Let the Australian people determine what they want to do with their savings and not an oligopolistic group of superannuation fund managers, who very often do not make those funds available to the household economies and do not necessarily make the best business decisions in the interests of the Australian economy. I hope that, as time goes on, the Superannuation Commission might even touch on some of those more radical ideas and, if it does not, I hope that other policy makers will join me and the honourable member for O'Connor in asking whether people can have a freer opportunity to invest their own savings as they choose. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested in the contribution to this debate by the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) when he talked about the social wage. I think he was giving a 1990s definition of the social wage because I think it was something different a decade ago or 40 years ago. But what he was saying was, I think, very interesting because he was arguing that the social wage is the take-home pay-that is, the after tax take-home pay-plus the other benefits that an employee may get. </PARA>
<PARA> I happen to believe that we would have a much better system if everyone's pay and remuneration were grossed up to them as individuals and that, if there are then to be tax concessions available, the tax concessions could be dealt with on a tax neutral-revenue neutral basis so far as the individual is concerned and so far as the Government is concerned. Instead of my employer making a contribution for my superannuation, it should be grossed up and treated as part of my total money package. As to whatever percentage the Commonwealth is putting into a superannuation scheme for me as a member of parliament, I am to get it net of tax and I should get equivalent tax relief to bring it down to the same net result. </PARA>
<PARA> We could still describe it as a social wage because at the moment we have a distorted system. We have a system whereby if the employer pays the superannuation he gets a tax rebate, first dollar to last dollar, at the corporate rate of tax. If the individual makes the contribution, the individual gets a reduction in tax in accordance with that individual's marginal rate of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be much better in an intelligent society if we converted our pay and remuneration packages into dollar values and then showed the amount that went into superannuation and the extent to which there was tax relief in respect of those superannuation contributions and tax relief in respect of the income of the superannuation fund and tax payment when the money comes out of the fund. I think as a result we would have a much better understanding of what we are on about in trying to encourage people in the Australian community to save for their own retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I want to make is with regard to people saving for their own retirement. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission said in relation to the statement made by the Government in 1989 about retirement income policies:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . confirmed the role of occupational superannuation as one of the twin pillars (with the age pension system) of the Government's strategy for meeting the needs of those in or approaching retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>If there is tax sheltering, people should have it once and once only. Either they should have it in the form of tax sheltering of their privately contributed superannuation scheme or they should get it on the basis of the actuarial value of their social security pension. There should be a direct linkage between the two, because the amount of value we give to a social security pension is equal to approximately three times average weekly earnings. For many people who contribute into a superannuation scheme the tax relief they get in advance of reaching retirement age is sometimes substantially more than three times average weekly earnings. I think there should be a flat rate of benefit over a lifetime for that tax sheltering through the superannuation contribution scheme or in the social security scheme or by a mixture of both. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to follow the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) and I listened with a great deal of interest to what he had to say. The Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill imposes a levy on superannuation funds. The Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill enables the collection of this levy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently there has been a major thrust by government towards ensuring that people in the community provide for their retirement. I fully support that thrust; productivity superannuation certainly is a major step towards that goal. However, as the honourable member for Sturt and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) said, the legislation still does not go far enough. </PARA>
<PARA> There are still many problems with occupational superannuation. As a result, many Australians are still not covered by superannuation. The entire Australian work force must be considered, not just employees working under awards which make provision for superannuation payment. All employees must be covered; in fact, in this day and age employers must also look to providing for their future. Consideration must be given to the Australian work force and the Australian population as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of the superannuation industry can be measured by the value of the assets and income received by the trust funds. The superannuation industry currently has assets approaching $130 billion. If we look to the year 2000, the industry is projected to have assets of $600 billion-that is, within nine years. The income generated in 1988-89-in other words, the contributions made by employers on behalf of employees-was $5.4 billion. This compares with our nation's exports in 1988-89 of some $5.8 billion worth of coal. If we compare that with the $5.4 billion income generated from superannuation, the latter measures up as a very big industry. In the same period, $2.4 billion worth of beef and $4 billion worth of wool were exported. </PARA>
<PARA> However we measure it, the superannuation industry is a large and important industry, and it is going to grow rapidly in the years ahead. Obviously it is an important industry with a vital function. The income in the trust funds is clearly money available for investment in Australia and perhaps overseas. However, under this current Government I do not see any incentive for managers of these funds to invest in Australia. What a tragedy that is. If we look at the income generated-$5.4 billion now and $600 billion by the year 2000-it is a wonderful sum of money to be investing in Australia. Under the current Government I cannot see this happening. </PARA>
<PARA> Superannuation is a forced saving. I believe everyone must make provision for retirement and should not remain dependent on the generosity or otherwise of government to receive a pension. Occupational superannuation certainly is here to stay, but it still has many problems that I believe the Government has not addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's rapidly ageing population highlights the need for us to move quickly on superannuation to ensure that our entire population has superannuation cover. Prior to 1950 there were six people in the work force for every person who was retired. By 1980 there were four people in the work force for every retired person, and it is predicted that by the year 2010 there will be only two people in the work force for every person who is retired. </PARA>

These figures have come about as a direct result of the population imbalance brought about by the baby boom after the Second World War. I am in fact a product of that baby boom-and I humbly say that it was a very good crop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1901, 4 per cent of Australia's 3.8 million people were 65 years and older. By 1986 the imbalance was such that 10 per cent were 65 years of age and over; by the year 2005 almost 12 per cent of our population will be over 65 years of age. In the year 2025, the figure will be 16 per cent. They are alarming figures, no matter how we look at them; they graphically illustrate how our population is ageing. We are confronted with a population imbalance. By the turn of the century, one-third of our population, or 8.5 million people, will be 45 years of age or older. At that stage we will have six million people in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> One point I want to come to is: who controls these funds? Clearly, we vest the responsibility in trust managers for the funds which have been contributed on behalf of employees. The problem with this is the manner in which trustees are appointed. Traditionally, these funds have not been supervised. However, following the 1990 Budget announcement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), from 1995 all large superannuation funds will be required to have equal employer-employee representation. Perhaps at first glance that looks quite reasonable, but it really extends the current cosy relationship that this Government has with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). Indeed, the current deal is so cosy that until recently one leading and now former trade union official was chairman of two of the leading funds and a director of a third. Furthermore, a current ACTU official is a trustee of at least five funds. </PARA>

In practice, most of those appointed are chosen on their industrial relations talents rather than their commercial skills. I believe that is a sad reflection of this country today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ultimately, these trust managers will control thousands of millions of worker owned savings. They will be controlled by a few key industrial relations players and bureaucrats. This is certainly alarming to me. I believe that the manner in which these trustees are appointed to those funds is undemocratic. Honourable members should bear in mind that members of these funds, the people who have these employee contributions, have no option but to contribute to a nominated fund. This is an area that we must look at. I urge the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, to look at the manner in which these people are appointed to administer these trust funds. It is a huge industry and I believe that we must have some guidelines or people should have some formal qualifications before we give them responsibility to manage these trust funds. </PARA>

<PARA> I refer to your contribution of $56.01 to the above Plan, received by this office on 16 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> It was noted however, that the property from which you corresponded is located in Queensland. Rural work in Queensland is not covered by the Pastoral Industry (Superannuation) Award 1988, the Federal award administered by Australian Eagle Insurance. The Queensland Pastoral Industry operates under a separate State award for which Eagle is unable to accept superannuation contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> Farm employees in Queensland are required to register with the Suncorp organisation (Austsafe scheme) for work undertaken in that State . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This letter is saying that an amount of $56 is paid by someone who has come from another State and that that money must be directed to the industry specific fund in that State. It is creating problems for employers and is certainly creating future problems for employees. The same applies right across Australia. My real fear is that as these people move around different States in Australia these funds are going to get eaten up in administration charges. </PARA>

Of the original 284 superannuation awards handed down up to 30 April 1989, 162 awards offered no choice whatsoever, directing employer contributions to a single fund. Honourable members should bear in mind that we have trust managers for these funds and that their appointment is undemocratic. Employers' superannuation contributions must go to the State in which they are currently employed. Clearly, there is no freedom of choice. Therefore, these people are severely disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, most of these very modest contributions are often eaten up by administration. I would like to see individuals permitted to direct their superannuation payments to authorised funds of their own choosing. This would clearly overcome the problem of some of my constituents and I am sure many other people in Australia. It will certainly save on administration charges. Costs clearly need to be saved because presently it takes up to five years before a superannuation fund becomes remotely profitable. One could draw the simple analogy of a seasonal worker, an itinerant worker. He could work in five States of Australia in five different jobs and spend 25 years working and at the end of that time receive virtually no benefit. Why? Because the benefits would have been eaten up by administration charges. Clear evidence of that is starting to come forward because the first five years of the life of any superannuation fund is eaten up by costs. I believe that supports the case for people to be able to direct their superannuation entitlement to the fund of their choice. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem in my electorate is the employment of people from overseas. I have New Zealanders in my electorate who are shearing. They come to Australia seeking work and are entitled to superannuation payment. This money goes to the industry specific funds in the State in which they are working. It begs the question: what happens to that money? If these people go back to New Zealand will it eventually be made available to them or will it lie here lost forever? In those circumstances we need to look at the problem of the itinerant worker, the seasonal worker, who in some cases comes in from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The original superannuation agreements allowed for 3 per cent of gross wages based on productivity and a further 3 per cent was to be made payable in the very near future. I would have to question the timing of the further increase in superannuation payments. I have to ask whether, during this recession, it is the right time to move further down this path and increase superannuation. If an increase is agreed to it must be based on productivity, and there must be a clear demonstration by the unions that there is an increase in productivity because that is the key to any future competitiveness in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU's goal of 12 to 15 per cent employer contributions in the near future, unless we can get a demonstration by the unions that they will seek productivity increases, will, I am afraid, clearly be a very bitter and steep blow to the employers of this nation. Under the productivity superannuation arrangements there is no incentive for an employee to contribute. We should be looking at ways to give incentives to the employees to contribute. It should not always be the employer who contributes to these funds. I think employees should be able to voluntarily contribute to these funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem that has confronted me in my electorate is the unclaimed moneys from some of these funds. I have had representations made to me by constituents illustrating the problem of unclaimed funds. Recently a constituent came to me and said, `I have this money which I have been unable to allocate'. The responsibility is still left with the employer to allocate these funds to an employee. In some cases they are itinerant workers. Perhaps they have used a wrong name or perhaps they did not want to be positively identified. But the employer has the responsibility to make that contribution on their behalf, and it is still creating enormous problems for employers. I think it is exacerbated by the seasonal nature of many workers in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, superannuation is a good thing and it must be encouraged across the board. Employers must accept superannuation as a good thing. Likewise, the employees must be encouraged to contribute. The Government clearly has a responsibility to simplify productive superannuation and to make it more cost effective. The way around that is not to have industry specific funds. I believe there must be more freedom of choice so that people can nominate the fund to which they want their contributions to be directed. It would save on administration costs. It leads me to the path of a superannuation number. Perhaps something such as a tax file number will be the only way around this setback. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is debating the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill. These two pieces of legislation, among other things, implement the administrative requirements for the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) and also apply a levy of $40 for the lodgment of annual returns. Effectively, the purpose of the legislation therefore is to bring about full cost recovery for the ISC. Naturally the Opposition does not object to the user pays concept. However, the point needs to be made that benefits coming from the ISC to the beneficiaries and managers of superannuation should be obvious. In the end, this is a tax on beneficiaries; it can be seen as nothing else. For that reason we need to know what the ISC spends most of its resources on and therefore how it intends to utilise this tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most of the activities of the ISC are fairly direct tax gathering. Some are less direct but are very resource demanding, such as monitoring the reasonable benefits limits and, in the end, providing tax payable information to the collecting agency. The superannuation industry-and that means beneficiaries or members of the respective funds-is in fact funding the gathering of its own payable tax. It is rather like asking a pay as you earn taxpayer for a fee payable on the lodgment of a tax return. Perhaps the Government will even reach that point, on the basis of its current pernicious attitude towards taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth asking the Government and the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) whether they can tell us how many of the ISC resources are being occupied in the all-important areas of prudential supervision and in the monitoring of reporting from trustees and its members. Quite frankly, there is little in the report that makes this absolutely clear. On the basis of the recent circumstances involving the difficulties of two superannuation companies and two life offices, one has reason to question the effectiveness of the ISC at this particular time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, may I make the point that in my not short period in this House this is the first time that I have ever had to suffer the indignity of speaking to government benches that are absolutely empty. It demonstrates clearly for all to hear the contempt with which this Government and its members hold this House. It is a disgrace that the Australian Labor Party and the Government should be seen as such by the Australian people. We are debating a very important piece of legislation involving many millions of Australians and their life savings. For those people to be held in contempt in this matter is an absolute disgrace. We in the Opposition parties-the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia-are aware of our responsibilities and, on that basis, we will continue the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before those remarks I was making the observation that, to be fair to the ISC, the collection of statistics in a complex area such as superannuation is absolutely vital. We hope that the funds now being collected from the various organisations and individuals involved in superannuation will lead to a more satisfactory assembling of superannuation statistics in this country. Nevertheless, the ISC must be held to account for the current unsatisfactory prudential standards. They are inadequate and the evidence relating to Regal Life Australia and Occidental Life Insurance Co. of Australia Ltd makes it absolutely clear. Because of legal action we have yet to find the bottom line of what went wrong with Occidental and Regal Life, but it certainly seems that the ISC had no clue about what was taking place until it was too late. In fairness one could claim that the regulations did not require the companies to advise the ISC of a change in ownership, but the circumstances involving those particular companies give us no reason for satisfaction whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of years ago the Treasurer (Mr Keating) told the Australian people that he anticipated that, as a result of the Government's reforms to superannuation, by the end of the decade there would be some $600 billion-in fact, some estimates were as high and as ambitious as $1,000 billion-savings to the Australian community through superannuation. At that time I thought that the assumptions upon which those figures were based were, at best, ambitious. For example, they assumed 100 per cent coverage-not only in the public sector but also in the private sector. Over a number of years it has become quite clear that the likelihood of reaching that level of coverage is unlikely, taking account of the fact that there are some 2 1/2 million Australians at least, and a growing number at that, who are involved in partial and part time employment and therefore whose coverage of superannuation is far more difficult to arrange. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent survey entitled Superannuation 2000 conducted by Allen Consulting Group Pty Ltd demonstrates on a rational basis that the assets are more likely to be between $350 billion and $400 billion by the turn of the century. Nevertheless, that is a very respectable figure. Superannuation 2000 was commissioned by 15 major companies and institutions. The estimates also coincide with the realisation that the financial and investment sectors have been the main forecasters of the boom in superannuation, rather than wage and salary earners, who had to be convinced to give up take-home pay in a complex system which offered only long term benefits. But even if the total superannuation assets are lower-as I said, a level between $350 billion and $400 billion-that will still be a significant achievement for Australia in terms of improving national savings and easing the burden on future government budgets. </PARA>
<PARA> The total stock of superannuation assets is projected to grow on average over the 1990s at 7 per cent per annum in real terms, or 12 per cent in nominal terms, to a figure in the year 2000 of $205 billion or, in end-1989 dollar terms, $350 billion. The flow of superannuation savings, which represent contributions plus interest, is projected to grow on average over the 1990s at 7.3 per cent in real terms, or 13 per cent in nominal terms, reaching an annual flow of $34 billion in end-1989 dollars or $58 billion in the dollars of the day in 2000. It is also worth noting that the earning rates are projected to be low on asset portfolios in the immediate future. With the condition of the Australian economy in the foreseeable future, that is certainly a responsible judgment. Coverage of the work force by superannuation award provisions is unlikely to change significantly, although we will probably see increases from 66 per cent to 75 per cent of all employees covered by an award for superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the first half of the decade, as the award standard rises from 3 per cent to an anticipated 6 per cent, which is the current claim by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, decisions are projected to be taken in the private sector which would result eventually in one-third of those employees who would have been covered by company schemes being offered only award superannuation. The important point to emphasise is this: should that occur, it will effectively mean a lowering, not an increase, in the level of coverage of many hundreds of thousands of Australian workers currently covered by both industry schemes for the current 3 per cent so-called `productivity' claim and, in addition, the level of coverage that they may have from their existing employers. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the fastest growing sector, from a relatively lower base-certainly when compared with the public sector-is expected to be industry funds. They are projected to grow in asset terms at 27.5 per cent per year, in real terms reaching $33 billion in the year 2000. One of the most important factors which this Parliament must consider in that context is whether or not we are prepared to see by the turn of the century, through the current ACTU policy of mega unions, the establishment of a smaller range of mega superannuation funds which will hold, as I said, some $33 billion of the assets of the Australian people who will therefore have the capacity, if it is in the wrong hands and handled by irresponsible people, to significantly influence the direction-in fact the life, if not the death-of many individual employers and companies in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The implications of that in terms of the control of assets is a matter of the gravest importance and one which I would urge this Parliament to take far more seriously. The net budget costs of private sector occupational superannuation are also expected to rise over the next half decade and then to decline steadily, at no time exceeding 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). The other factors, however, which demonstrate so clearly the advantages of having the maximum level of superannuation coverage possible can be seen in these figures: the net budget costs of public sector superannuation are expected to rise steadily over the 1990s and then to plateau and begin to decline during the next decade. At no time are they expected to exceed 0.25 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> The net budget costs of the age pension, as a result of what we hope will be an effective policy of superannuation coverage, will decline from about 3.7 per cent now to 3.4 per cent at the end of the decade and continue to decline thereafter-a very satisfactory objective, and hopefully the conclusion of a policy which is being applied by both the Government and the Opposition in government in the context of maximising the capacity of the Australian people to fund or at least partly fund their retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus the growth of superannuation reduces the overall costs of retirement to the Government budget. From the late 1990s on through the following decade it is expected that by the year 2011 the net cost will fall to 3.6 per cent of GDP compared with 4.2 per cent now. These projections show total superannuation saving rising from 5 per cent of GDP to 7 per cent by the end of the decade. As I said earlier, this demonstrates so clearly that the prospects for superannuation over the 1990s do imply a very worthwhile contribution to addressing the nation's economic challenges and specifically being able to play a major role in increasing the domestic savings ratios within the Australian economy which, when compared-as the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) so rightly pointed out in his address-with most of the members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), shows that Australia is well down on the list in terms of our capacity and preparedness to make a contribution to domestic savings. </PARA>
<PARA> Compliance with the 3 per cent award provision is currently very high in the public sector, anticipated to be about 95 per cent, but it is much lower-in fact, not much more than 66 per cent-in the private sector, which means that overall between 60 and 65 per cent of Australian employees are receiving it and the rest are not. It is therefore significant that when the Treasurer and the ACTU speak with such optimism about the level of coverage, despite their current intention to bring out the big stick and use regulatory controls on employers, the fact of the matter is that the largest section of the private sector which is not covered are those people in non-permanent and temporary and part time employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The saddest part is that those people who are covered by the existing 3 per cent funding arrangements in many cases never actually receive the money because most of them, by definition, are itinerants; they move from employer to employer, and at this stage the ISC does not have in place adequate administrative systems which can guarantee that those people, at the end of the day, from age 55 onwards, will ever see their 3 per cent or more contributions which they made for so many years. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been calculated by my honourable colleague Senator Alston that one would need to have an income in excess of $4,000 a year before one gained any benefit at all from the existing 3 per cent payment. That is because over one per cent of that payment goes on life insurance coverage-which is appropriate-and because much of the remainder goes in the costs of administering the particular fund over which there are no adequate controls. </PARA>
<PARA> When many of those funds continue to hold the contributions of workers who may well have left that industry, in many cases the funds are still withdrawing what they see as their share of administrative costs, although contributions are no longer being made. It is also worth noting that there are major problems in the capacity of members in industry funds to have any choice whatsoever. Of the 284 superannuation awards handed down by 30 April 1989, 162 offered no choice; in fact, they directed employer contributions to a single fund. Nearly always these were union sponsored schemes. A further 90 provided a choice only between a union fund and a pre-existing employer fund. </PARA>
<PARA> The House may be interested to know, for example, that according to the ACTU, as of March 1990 there are approximately 1.3 million workers covered by 90 to 100 industry funds. In fact, more than half of those workers belong to five major schemes. There is the BUS scheme, covering the building industry; the ARF scheme, a general purpose scheme jointly sponsored by the Chamber of Manufactures and the ACTU; the STA scheme, which is for metal manufacturing; the HESTA, which is a health union scheme; and REST, a retail union scheme. In all, these five unions covered 729,000 workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The cash flow of these industry schemes is now a massive $20m to $25m a week. They are now holding assets in excess of between $3 billion and $4 billion, or approximately 3 per cent of total fund assets. On current growth rates, these are estimated to reach 9 per cent by 1995. Perhaps by the year 2000 it will reach 20 per cent of what is estimated by Treasury to be then the $600 billion mark, which I have already emphasised is far too ambitious. Nevertheless, we are seeing significant changes in the pattern of savings in Australia which are of considerable importance. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a number of points: the time has now come when we must look for flexibility in the overall superannuation arrangements. On the one hand, there is clearly a need for employees to have some choice as to whether they should put their money in an employer scheme, a union scheme or a 23FC type scheme; when we come into government, we will be offering all employees, and especially those involved in part time employment, the opportunity to go into retirement savings accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> The beauty of the retirement savings account is that it works like a bank account. The control is, however, that one cannot take money out until at least age 60. The advantage is, however, from the employee's point of view, that he does not lose 3 per cent of his contribution in administrative costs. Apart from normal bank charges, there would be no administrative costs. It has the advantage of enabling people for periods when both in and out of the work force to have that fundamental savings flexibility which we all need because of differences in lifestyle over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> The other important factor I would like to refer to is how we can link together health insurance on the one hand and superannuation coverage on the other, and also the ability to purchase one's own home. For young people, the need to fund the purchase of their first home is of fundamental importance. Invariably, it takes higher priority than superannuation. Superannuation is something for people when they get old. We all know from our own experience, young people never get old! Yet what we need in this country is a forward looking approach which links together people's capacity to fund their first home and to access adequate funding for the deposit while at the same time locking them into a long term superannuation membership. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year I developed a proposal called the Homesure account which did precisely that. It enabled a worker, for example, to come into a scheme by which, if he were aged 25 and earning average weekly earnings, he would have saved in his superannuation fund, including interest, $22,206. On the basis of Homesure a person could withdraw $17,500, indexed. At age 30, a person would have saved in his superannuation fund, including interest, $34,942. He could still withdraw via Homesure $17,500. This is the maximum amount which an individual may take out of his superannuation fund due to the effects of the reasonable benefit limits which seriously inhibit a person's capacity to arrange his income or contributions to increase the amount of withdrawal. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, married couples would have the capacity to withdraw significantly more. It is this forward looking approach which we desperately need at this time to encourage all Australians to regard long term savings for their retirement as a serious matter of national policy as well as a means for helping them finance their first home. </PARA>

<PARA>It was suggested during the second reading stage that the Opposition would be moving this amendment. Unfortunately, because of lack of time I was not able to deal with this matter properly and some wires have been crossed in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that when regulations are made, the Minister is directed to consult with the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia and the Life Insurance Federation of Australia and that he has regard to the views, if any, expressed by those organisations. What we are doing is laying down within the framework of those regulations an instruction to the Minister to consult on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Many aspects of the original supervisory levy that have not yet been determined will be determined over the next few months. I understand that a ready reckoner will then be available to enable industry to calculate the levy that will apply. What we are saying is that obviously this calculation is going to be contentious in some ways. Although the Minister might have indicated that those consultations would take place, I have moved this amendment to make sure that these changes are made. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the framework of this debate, I would like to say something about the comments that were made about my speech during the second reading stage. I do not want to rehash or regurgitate that speech but the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) made some comments about the accuracy of the figures that I quoted. I have not been able to determine precisely what he was getting at, but I point out that one set of figures that I used was taken from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) calculations and statistics on home domestic savings. When I was talking about public savings and public expenditure, I used figures from Budget calculations. All of these figures were very relevant. I also used a figure quoted by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in respect of the estimation of what superannuation funds would be worth by the year 2000. So I fail to understand why the honourable member for Oxley spoke about the accuracy of the figures when they came from statements of the Government, from the OECD and from comments made by the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> I just want to put on the record that it is very easy for an honourable member to peruse the speech made by another member the day or night before and then try to build his own speech around it. I take some credit for the fact that the honourable member for Oxley looked at my speech and gained some knowledge from it. But I wish that he could have made accurate comments about what I said. The Opposition believes that the amendment is reasonable. We see no reason why the Government should not pick it up. All we are asking for is complete consultation to take place with the industry before any further move is made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Chairman. The honourable member for Gippsland is an absolute disgrace to this Parliament, carrying on like the professional clown he is. If he wants to be an actor, he should go on the stage. The Minister responsible has apologised for not being able to be here. He has ministerial duties, and it is absolutely wrong for the honourable member for Gippsland to slight him in this way. It is typical of what we have come to expect from the honourable member for Gippsland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister appreciates the reason for the Opposition's proposing the amendment. Indeed, the Government has had the importance of consultation with the industry very much in mind and has directed the Insurance and Superannuation Commission accordingly to maintain full liaison on these matters. The Commission has already undertaken consultation with the industry on the levy for the first year of its operation. However, the Government opposes the amendment for the reasons I will outline. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reading speech indicated that the intention of the levy is to recover the cost of supervision of the industry and that there will be an annual discussion with the industry in determining the scale of the levies. The second reading speech also indicated that consultation is to take place between the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the Department of Finance in determining the amount of revenue needed to fully recover the costs. Discussions have already been undertaken with industry representatives concerning the amount of the first year levy. These industry consultations have involved a wider group than the two associations mentioned in the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also relevant that the involvement of the Minister in this level of discussion would not be appropriate. It may not be practical to comply with subsection (2) of the amendment if industry associations express divergent views. That would threaten the validity of the whole of the levy regulations. The requirement in the amendment to have regard to industry views is too restrictive as regard must also be had to other factors, including the views of the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, on behalf of the Minister I thank all those honourable members who have made a responsible contribution and I totally reject the nonsense of the honourable member for Gippsland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the information of the House, we are debating the second reading of the Bounty (Citric Acid) Bill 1991, which applies a bounty on the production of citric acid derived from a specific fermentation process-that embodied in the plant and production facilities of Sirius Biotechnology Ltd, a company located in Altona in Melbourne. The bounty is intended to operate from 1991 through to 1996. All in all, the owner of Sirius Biotechnology Ltd, which will shortly be the multinational food and industrial conglomerate Bunge Industrial Ltd, will receive $7.27m from the operation of the bounty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The intention of the Bill is to provide an economic incentive for Bunge to retain the operation of its soon to be acquired citric acid fermentation plant in Melbourne. The point of the exercise is not, however, to see the development of the local citric acid production capability as such. It is rather to seek to ensure the presence in Australia of production facilities that will enable Australia to further capitalise on its research and development strengths in fermentation-based biotechnology. That is to say, the Government is hoping by way of the bounty to retain a facility in Australia that will enable it to move closer to the commercialisation of existing biotechnology research and development programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition parties in opposing the Bill do not do so on the issue of the significance of the biotechnology research effort under way in Australia. There is no doubt that this effort is internationally competitive. The research work in this area, particularly that at Melbourne University, is well recognised abroad. It has duly received considerable financial support from both the Government and the private sector. What is at issue, however, is the integrity of the process by which the Government is seeking to achieve the goal of preserving the production facilities in Australia, the implications of this in respect of the signals it sends to other private sector companies, and the capacity of the bounty to deliver its intended result-that is, its simple practicality.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill fails on all three counts. To date the Government has not provided an honest analysis of the core of the legislative initiative before the House tonight. It has claimed that the bounty is offsetting domestic and international pricing distortions and, by so doing, it is simply giving Sirius the necessary price compensation to compete in the citric acid market. In presenting this argument the Government has grossly oversimplified the factors affecting the performance of the company since its establishment in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> To be sure, Sirius made a decision in 1984 to enter a market which was going to be hard to crack. Presumably it was aware of the vast size of the global market and the volatility of citric acid prices. Owing to oversupply in the international market last year, the price of citric acid slumped by 20 per cent. Presumably it was aware of the duty free status of citric acid for entry into the local market-an important issue when one considers that Sirius was trying to capture 3,000 tonnes of the 6,000-tonne Australian market. Presumably it was also aware of the unfortunate pricing distortions that characterise the international market. </PARA>
<PARA> I would add that at the stage when Sirius took the commercial decision to establish its plant seven years ago, it was also aware of the cost structure surrounding the domestic price of sugar under the old embargo system. Sirius also battled against other excessive cost inputs, especially excessive freight charges and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, given the small size of the citric acid market in Australia and the relatively low volumes of production, cost inputs played a disproportionately larger role in the company's performance than should have been the case in a larger market. As with any innovative production facility, it too had its teething problems, so to speak. Sirius, after establishing itself in 1984, went into production only in the second half of 1990 for a few months. It produced only 300 tonnes of citric acid before closing. In essence, Sirius ran a business plan that went badly astray. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to make any comment on the soundness of the company's original business strategy, but one is left wondering whether Australia was ever in a position to provide a platform in these circumstances for an import replacement operation of this nature. The Government has made much of its claim that Sirius was undone by locally produced sugar prices. It has laid the blame for this on the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point again that Sirius entered the marketplace under the old embargo system, which it had to weather for five years-1984 to 1988-89-until a new tariff structure was imposed on the industry in May 1989. Notwithstanding this, the Government contended in its second reading speech that action taken in the Senate by the coalition parties and the Democrats between November 1988 and May 1989, in regard to the tariff structure applying to the sugar industry, pushed up the price of sugar purchased by domestic users. This action, so the Government claims, placed Sirius in an uncompetitive price position relative to imported citric acid. This is a simple furphy and it is an argument that discredits the Government's cause in respect of the object of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government did itself determine the form and level of the amended tariff as originally proposed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). The coalition parties were responsible for having the initial tariff legislation referred to an all-party committee in the Senate in November of 1988 on the basis that the Government had not conferred sufficiently with the sugar industry in devising the proposed legislation. The Government did not accept the all-party Senate committee recommendations, as it deemed them inconsistent with Australia's position on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, in May 1989 the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy implemented, at his own initiative, a compromise position which took the form of the amended tariff. The responsibility for the tariff, which has ostensibly affected the competitive position of Sirius, is primarily the Government's. Notwithstanding the issue as to which party was responsible for the imposition of the tariff, any evaluation of the impact of the tariff on Sirius would need to examine, firstly, the differential between the cost of sugar purchased locally under the previous embargo system and that under the agreed to amended tariff regime and, secondly, the gap between the price of domestic sugar purchased by users under the Government's original tariff proposal presented to replace the embargo and that which resulted from the amended tariff flowing from the Government's compromise legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact on company performance of the amended tariff would then have to be determined on the price increase represented by the differences between the prices paid for domestic sugar under the various alternative arrangements in the context of the number of tonnes of sugar purchased by the company over the period from mid-1989 until late 1990. This would then have to be balanced against the overall cost structure affecting the company performance. The Government has been unwilling or unable to provide an analysis of this order to prove the impact of the amended tariff. The Government cannot or will not substantiate its accusation that it was the coalition's moves in the Senate between November 1988 and May 1989 that forced up the domestic price of sugar. If the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who has carriage of this legislation for the Government, wants to drag in arguments of this sort--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister for Science and Technology, in introducing this legislation in his second reading speech, accused the coalition parties by their actions back in 1988 and 1989 of forcing up the domestic price of sugar; yet he has not presented one scintilla of evidence. If he had been here earlier, he would have known that he has to substantiate those claims by providing all of the other cost structures that have affected the company performance of Sirius Ltd. If he is going to give those accusations any factual basis, he must present the evidence to the House. In any event, it should be noted as an aside that Sirius plans to utilise wheat, not sugar, in any future citric acid production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from this matter, the coalition considers the exercise of applying a bounty to the production of citric acid to a particular registered user to lack transparency altogether. It is an easy thing to float a seemingly magnanimous gesture in the media, as the Minister has attempted to do. It is a more difficult thing to build a policy response which distributes resources fairly and evenly. </PARA>
<PARA> To begin with, the coalition is unconvinced that the bounty will effectively yield the desired results. The exercise lacks sufficient transparency to justify the appropriation of public funds. Despite a departmental briefing, the Opposition has not had access to sufficient information on the cost performance circumstances affecting Sirius Biotechnology to justify support for what is, in effect, a cash transfer payment. </PARA>
<PARA> As the requisite regulations are still to be determined, there is no firm indication as to the nature of the transaction which has been carried out between Bunge Ltd and the Commonwealth to guarantee a suitable return to the Australian community for the outlay of more than $7m. </PARA>
<PARA> The explanatory notes for the Bill make reference to the requirement that the company continue research and development, contribute to product development, explore new markets and take all responsible steps to provide for the participation of local companies. The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce agrees that whilst it is possible to determine whether or not these objectives are being carried out, the level of the commitment will be a matter for subjective assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> So what is the Australian community getting in return for its outlay of $7.27m? What makes matters worse in this regard is that the Chairman of Bunge (Australia) Pty Ltd is reported as saying that Sirius is `a baby in the whole area' of fermentation technology, and that it would be a big struggle to develop a market for citric acid in Australia. Given this, the capacity of the future owner of Sirius, even with the injection of the bounty payment over the next four years, to build a competitive market position is in question. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce agrees that if Sirius is unable to compete in the citric acid market here and overseas, it will not maintain Sirius as a manufacturing base; that is, if Bunge determines at some point that it is still not in its interest to manufacture in Australia, it can pack up and go home, and it can do this without repayment of the bounty, any part of it that it may have received, before departing our shores. Nor is there any indication that Bunge would retain its operations in Australia beyond the terms of the expiry date for the bounty. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, the Government has claimed that the presence of the plant and the fermentation equipment is essential for the commercial development of the research and development base in food related biotechnology. Again, there is no guarantee that the intellectual property derived from this effort, which will be held by the University of Melbourne and Bunge, will be commercially developed through the Sirius plant. It is also more than possible, given its prior financial investments, that Bunge would have retained its commitment to the research and development program regardless of the availability of the Sirius operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The link is not between the bounty and the continuation of the research; it is rather, as I pointed out earlier, between the retention of the Altona factory and the possibility-and it cannot be put at any higher level than that-of commercial development of that research taking place in that plant. The bounty is, therefore, simply ensuring that the technology process embodied in Sirius's plant and production processes is not in the short term sold off overseas under licence. It is, therefore, effectively a shot in the dark using over $7m of taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond these concerns there is also a larger question as to the merits of doing deals with corporate entities in order to retain their manufacturing or research bases in Australia. What kind of signals, after Kodak and the like, is the Government sending to foreign owned businesses operating in Australia through making further payments of this type? What are the wider implications of building once again on the Kodak initiative? Do we soon start to see queues of multinationals outside the ministerial doorways seeking access to government largesse in return for retaining their production bases in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> Bunge (Australia) Pty Ltd is a massively capitalised private company for which the scale of the bounty must be of marginal significance. It has annual sales across all of its divisions of some $750m. Given this, its commitment to a production facility must therefore also be considered marginal. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of the global market for citric acid of between 300,000 and 500,000 tonnes, domestic consumption in Australia is only 6,000 tonnes or so. Would not any multinational prefer to stay closer to the main markets of western Europe, Japan and the United States of America? I do not say this with any condescension whatsoever regarding Bunge's corporate strategies. It just seems to be good economic reasoning for a business entity like Bunge to think in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition also believes there is insufficient evidence that the competitive position of Sirius could not have been sufficiently enhanced to the extent of the bounty payments by other reductions in the domestic cost structure affecting its performance. Given the size of the bounty, is it genuinely the case that other costs, either external or internal, could not have been brought under control by appropriate action by its management or the Government, and, if so, is not the application of the bounty simply then a compensatory measure-compensation, that is, for the company's management and compensation for the Government's inaction in not acting on the relevant micro-reform and taxation issues which could have given Sirius a more viable position in the local market?</PARA>
<PARA> There is an outstanding issue as to why the company could not source manufacturing support or financial support from domestic sources if its commercial potential is so obvious. The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce advises that the owners of Sirius explored all available avenues for such support. That is to say, late last year the company looked for local Australian interests to buy into the company, and failed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's position that it is simply offsetting domestic and international price distortions disguises the fact that the operation of the local market is so profoundly distorted in its own right that it is incapable of supporting strategically located industries within a medium to long term profit outlook. What has gone wrong with Australia's venture capital industry and its manufacturing base so that apparent winners, like Sirius, cannot source local investment? Is it just that industry and investment funds are all myopic, or that they have an astute sense of the limitations and gaping weaknesses in the economy? Despite the Government's stance, the bounty then is a traditional assistance measure designed to obscure its own failings. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a larger and more potentially dangerous tendency in this legislation. The Government in this instance has selectively chosen a single area of strategic technology development for assistance. The benefits of the bounty accrue to a single company utilising a particular technology. It is extremely difficult to justify the decision to single out a particular technology for support over another. </PARA>
<PARA> If this technology, why not Black and Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd's high technology production facilities? And what of Adidas's high technology robotics mould production processes which are being relocated abroad because of the hostile cost structure in which it had to operate in Australia? Why not offset costs impinging on ICI Aust Ltd's advanced ceramics program, given that external charges are undermining the effectiveness of its research programs? Why was support not given to retain the manufacturing presence of Pacific Dunlop Ltd's medical manufacturing arm, Telectronics Pty Ltd? Telectronics shifted the manufacturing of the implantable pacemakers to Miami last year with a loss of over 200 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Why, alternatively, not take up a public interest ownership in gene shears technology, or provide another cash transfer payment to offset the cost impediments which currently stifle the development of an array of other technologies with, presumably, equal claim to strategic technological significance, such as the gallium arsenide computer chip, the Airtrak pollution detection system, and the Amskam automatic electronic identification system, which has potential application throughout the global transportation system?</PARA>
<PARA> How do we explain to all these other strategic technology interests that they are not as strategic as another technology, in this case, Sirius? What are the deep reasons for the failure of the open marketplace to seize on these technological initiatives?</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, given the nature of the Bill, how does the Minister explain to the confectionary industry, which is a major user of local sucrose, that it is acceptable to use public funds to meet input costs for Sirius, but not for it. The confectionary industry no doubt considers its role in the economy to be significant, so what does the Minister tell it? Does the confectionary industry now start to threaten to move overseas in order to attract a bounty to redress-to use the Minister's words-domestic and international economic distortions? Generally, the administrative process of selecting such industries or technologies for special assistance is ultimately a political exercise and it is open to special pleading, lobbying and even, in extreme cases, corporate blackmail. Once concessions are made of this sort, the Government has revealed its susceptibility to special pleading and, therefore, politicises the process by which it seeks to allocate resources. To the best lobbyist goes the spoils. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, which bears a similar parallel to the initiative here under consideration, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, implied that Kodak was the case which proved the rule. It would now seem it was the case which broke the rule. The only course of sensible action that a government can take in these matters is to send the right signals to the business sector, local and foreign owned. That signal is that the Government is committed to building the economic environment and reforming the economy to the point where it makes good sense for it to invest locally and maintain its production facilities here. That is to say, the best thing a government can do is build the confidence and put the policies in place that provide across economy returns to all industry groupings. Once we give up on this larger purpose, once we turn away from the greater tasks of government, then we start looking for one-off solutions-and this legislation is hardly a solution to anything. </PARA>

It is about backing a winner, and I believe that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The bounty assistance is provided to the Australian manufacturers of citric acid by fermentation. It provides bounty support for development and commercialisation to try to attempt to give us an edge in the technology in this area in the world. The bounty arrangements contained in the legislation provide, in clause 9, for a bounty to be paid at the rate of $700 per tonne in the first year reducing to $150 per tonne in the final year. The bounty applies to citric acid produced from 12 March 1991 to 31 December 1995. I would like to point out that it relates only to the production of citric acid by fermentation, even though strategic implications are wider. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the certain circumstances and advantages we have in agricultural production in Australia, there are opportunities for the production of organic chemicals based on the fermentation of carbohydrates, such as sugar and wheat, and this is, I believe, an indication of that. The world market for chemicals produced by fermentation is estimated to be in excess of $10 billion-that is $10,000m. That is big bickies, and I do not think it should be dismissed in the way in which it was by the honourable member for Gippsland. </PARA>
<PARA> In the longer term, of course, there is an opportunity to even value add on to that because the technology could well go to the degree that we could replace some of the petrochemicals with ecologically sustainable products and, of course, at the same time create export opportunities in our food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. So I believe that it does have great potential and, if we are successful in this, it is going to be backing a winner. Certainly the Japanese have never been backward in backing a winner and have been quite successful. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1984, Sirius Biotechnology Ltd has been developing technology in this field originally invented by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). Some $14m of shareholders' funds have already been committed to the development of the technology and the commissioning of scale up production facilities. Sirius has also developed strong strategic linkages with industry and the research community. In recognition of the strategic importance of this technology and its development, it has been supported by the Government. -</PARA>
<PARA> Sirius has received some $375,000 in grants to citric acid production research projects with CSIRO and the University of Melbourne, which were receiving a total of $932,000 in Commonwealth funding. In view of the importance of Sirius technology production facilities of-as I have said-a carbohydrate based fermentation in Australia, the Government has decided to introduce this bounty. As I have said, we have problems trying to sell our wheat, we have had difficulties in the past trying to sell our sugar and, if we are able to value add to these commodities, these carbohydrates, here and to break into new technological areas, that will be a plus for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, as we have often said in this House, it has always been easy to dig up a mountain. It is very simple; it does not take much mental capacity. It is much harder to get out there and get into that tough world of new technologies. Consequently, if we look at the countries that have done well, they are the ones that have based a big part of their economy on grain based industries. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present time in Australia, we have only something like 5 per cent of our economy based on grain based industries. Some of the Scandinavian countries have 40 per cent plus. So the Government has decided to introduce this bounty assistance. The bounty is not a protection measure, but it is a support mechanism-and I would like to stress that because I am against protection. I have argued that case in this House at every opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> It is protection that is destroying our agricultural opportunities overseas and it has corrupted world markets, particularly the Europeans. But it has been designed to offset distortions that could well prevent competitiveness for Sirius technology. The important thing is if we are able to achieve commercial viability, as I believe we will, as I have said, we are going to add value here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The assistance is relevant to a number of conditions and they are these: that bounty recipients be registered under the Act with registration subject to, firstly, the bounty recipient continuing to research, develop and apply the technology to the commercialisation of citric acid in Australia; secondly, that the bounty recipient contribute to research in new product development arising from or associated with the fermentation technology the subject of the bounty, with a view to the commercialisation of those new products in Australia; thirdly, that the bounty recipient explore international market opportunities for the technology and the product-because that is where the big potential lies and, as I have said, with a $10,000m industry there is a great potential there; and, of course, finally, that the bounty recipient take all responsible steps to ensure maximum advantage is taken from the expertise and know how associated with the development and production of citric acid and other new products in Australia by suitable licensing, franchise or other arrangements. So in other words, we believe that the support in the form of a production bounty is most appropriate and an appropriate assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Sirius will also need to make substantial investments in plant expansion in order to benefit fully from the support. Research is aimed at reducing the cost of wheat based fermentation substrates and, as I said-and the honourable member for Gippsland commented on the fact-Sirius has switched from using sugar to wheat. That is relevant to which carbohydrate and the price in the market, and I will go into more about sugar in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is firmly committed to realising opportunities to apply Australia's scientific and research skills and, of course, it adds on to the value of our agricultural industries in this regard. We do need to capitalise on every opportunity with our existing primary industries and, as I have said, this is a great opportunity to do so in the large amount of production that we have in sugar and wheat and, of course, both industries relying heavily on export markets. We have such a small domestic market in Australia for our large industries because of our population-it is such a small population. It is anticipated that the total cost of this bounty will be $7.27m in current prices on a financial year breakdown as follows: $1.05m for 1991-92; $1.65m for 1992-93; $2.17m for 1993-94; $1.85m for 1994-95; and $0.55m for 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to speak on this Bill, and I do have a personal interest. Being a Queenslander and the only cane farmer in this Parliament, I would like to see value adding in the sugar industry at every opportunity. One of the difficulties in the sugar industry has come about because of the tariff argument. I have always led the charge to reduce tariffs in the sugar industry. Some 20 per cent of the product from our industry has a domestic market; 80 per cent has to be sold overseas. If we protect the 20 per cent of the market here, we protect it at the expense of the other 80 per cent. As the industry expands over time, which it will do, that 20 per cent will get much smaller, until it becomes 15 per cent, 10 per cent, perhaps 5 per cent, as we develop the resources on the Burdekin and expand in Ingham, Tully, Bundaberg and other regions. </PARA>
<PARA> It has always been important to break down tariffs. The other side of that is that the high tariff structure in Australia impacts on users of sugar, whether it be the confectionery industry or industries such as Sirius, because they have to purchase that sugar domestically. There is an emotional view that if we drop the price too far we allow cheap sugar to come in from overseas. That has not been the case. I can understand that argument; it was used politically for about 12 months in the debate that occurred when the sugar embargo was to be lifted. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that most growers now understand the complexity of world trade and the advantage that can be gained by dropping tariffs and at the same time utilising the opportunity of cheaper sugar in Australia for end users. The confectionery industry is a classic example. Sirius is another example. In my local city of Bundaberg we have a massive opportunity as a result of the recent reduction in tariffs on sugar because we have a soft drink factory that exports soft drinks overseas. What we are doing is exporting sugar in aluminium cans. It amounts to the same thing: it is adding value, and dozens of people are employed in that factory. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the broader aspect of value adding in an industry such as sugar. But the situation is complex. As we reduce tariffs on the one hand, we have a concern about the impact of products coming into the country; at the same time, we reduce the cost margin, which enables the end users, and food processors too, who use a lot of sugar, to become more viable. Such a reduction reduces the consumer price index because it reduces import costs, and at the same time more sugar is used, which any primary producer wants to see. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to our concern and the reason why we put on the bounty. There was a difference back in 1985 or 1986, when this company was involved, because we had an embargo. The price structure changed, subject to a Senate committee inquiry, and finally we came to a position. However, as I have said, it is very complex to work out how far the price should go down and how that impacts on end users and farmers. I believe we have come to the best possible situation by again reducing tariffs in the sugar industry through the proposals outlined in the industry statement. Even though the reduction in tariffs has been criticised by the National Party, it has had to be done in line with other reductions in tariffs, which have taken between $350m and $400m off the backs of farmers, something that is in line with what the National Farmers Federation has wanted. </PARA>
<PARA> I have always supported tariff reduction as being a positive approach. It will still prevent sugar coming in and competing in this country because we are by far the most efficient sugar producers in the world and we still have that margin. But the benefit of that reduction is that our end users, such as Sirius and the confectionery industry, can be more competitive. We have an opportunity, and not only domestically, to expand the end use of sugar. We have an opportunity to look at export opportunities overseas. In doing so, the whole industry will gain. </PARA>
<PARA> The hardest thing is to get across to people-whether they be workers in the sugar mills or the fields, farmers or people who work in confectionery factories-that we are all part of the one industry. It is not just one part of the industry that has to be looked at in isolation; we have to look at the whole broad industry. I believe this bounty benefits end users. Whether they use sugar or whether they use wheat is relevant to the prices. Reducing the tariffs on sugar across the board, as we have just done, certainly makes sugar more competitive and perhaps gives us the opportunity to get back. Selfishly, I guess, I would rather see sugar used than wheat, but obviously, with the problems in the wheat industry, if people use wheat it will benefit another great Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of that I believe that this Bill is certainly brave. I think it is courageous, and I fully support it. At the end of the day it will give us a competitive edge in a technological area that was never thought of before when we were cowards and hid behind high protective barriers and refused to be a part of the real world. We are a part of the real world. We have shown courage through the Cairns Group, and we are showing courage with this legislation. When it is successful it will be the forerunner of many other things. This Bill has a big future and it is the start of many better things to come in this area. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I am confounded by the logic of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), who on the one hand spent much of his time-and I commend him for it-singing the praises of protection reduction in the main and in general, and on the other hand supporting the Bounty (Citric Acid) Bill. As announced by the Government on 12 March, the Bill proposes to introduce a bounty for the protection of citric acid by way of a specific fermentation process which is used by one Australian firm, Sirius Biotechnology Ltd which, as many people know, is half owned by Bunge (Australia) Pty Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, as you may know, Sirius is the dog star in the constellation. It follows on the heels of the hunter, Orion. It has-no reflection on Sirius-following it, as described in the Oxford Dictionary, a dim companion or pup which is a white dwarf. Be assured, Mr Deputy Speaker, that after the admonitions of your predecessor, who gave the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) a word or two of advice, I would be the last to accuse the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who, I am glad to say, has now arrived puffing at the table, as being a white dwarf. This brilliant star pierced the eye with a steely glitter, as Thomas Hardy once said. Quite frankly, I think that Sirius has pierced the eye with the steely glitter of a dim companion in this case, or indeed a puffing member of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In the lead-up to the industry statement we witnessed some jockeying by various Ministers to gain some degree of ascendancy in the policy development area. The Minister was especially prominent in his advocacy, along with a still defiant Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), of a more interventionist approach to industry policy. All I can think is that the dog star threw a bone to somebody when the debate was lost in the run-up to 12 March. </PARA>
<PARA> In the coalition's view it was fortunate for Australia that the Minister's view did not prevail and that the Government has in the main forgone any major change in direction on the question of industry assistance. Regrettably, however, it forbore making any major change in the direction of micro-economic reform. That is a matter I will touch on in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting back to the matter of positive assistance, whilst by and large the Government stuck to its guns on the need for a more neutral and lower assistance to industry, there were one or two sops to cater to the predilection of those who advocated a more active role for Government. The bounty Bill in front of us tonight was one of the sadder of those. Of course, separately we still seem to have the prospect of a compulsory/voluntary venture capital fund floating around somewhere in the corridors. It is being dangled in front of a few people. I actually take comfort from the fact that the life offices and the financial institutions now appear eager to protect a little more keenly the interests of their investors, as indeed they should. In the climate of improving behaviour by corporate citizens in Australia in the 1990s, which I am sure we are bound to see, I imagine that the trustees of some of these funds would be somewhat worried by these sorts of semi-compulsory investments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government justifies its decision to introduce the citric acid bounty on the grounds that the bounty will facilitate continued development and commercialisation of leading edge Australian fermentation technology, at a cost of a little over $7m over the next four years. At first blush it might appear reasonable, even sensible, that we should do so. At any rate, the amount in the general context of protection and government protective mechanisms is not large. Perhaps it would be if the whole theory of protection reduction were not to be challenged by this decision. In fact, the whole purpose and thrust of the Government's industry document on 12 March was justified by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and many other people on the basis that it was really going to challenge Australian industry to compete by being able to move out from behind the protective walls. But the coalition, I have to say, firmly believes that, small though this handout might be, the proposal is really the antithesis of a gradual reduction in protection levels and the reduction, therefore, in distortions in assistance between industries-objectives which we thought had broad bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA> My first objection is the general one: it cuts across the general thrust-as I said, a bipartisan thrust-which was and is and should be to throw Australia into the situation where it can be internationally competitive, and an industry in the country is not able then to be diverted by the temptation to come running cap in hand to Canberra. I think, in the main, that that debate has been gently going on in this country for 20 to 25 years, more vehemently for the last five or 10 years, and with a great deal of thrust over the last few years. Therefore, I find it very surprising and quite illogical that this Bill should move against the general thrust of that debate and consensus. </PARA>
<PARA> We are opposing this Bill not because we do not consider that the fermentation technology developed is unique or worthwhile, but because it is a retrograde step in terms of industry policy for a number of reasons; and many of those have been mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for Gippsland. It will benefit only one company and only one form of technology. He mentioned five or eight-or was it 10?-other forms of technology, high technology in some cases, and I could mention more. Again, it seems illogical that one company should be picked out of all those quite excellent performances by Australian inventors, Australian innovators, Australian scientists and Australian businesses and be singled out for a special result. It is an unhealthy precedent because assistance to one company suggests, rightly or wrongly, in some cases a less than arms length relationship between government and business. I do not think there could possibly be such a thing. It is extraordinary to one looking in from the outside, as many people have mentioned to me since this was mooted on 12 March, that one company should be singled out for special treatment over and above all the others. </PARA>
<PARA> I have one other point that I would like to make in the main on this subject: as has been mentioned by the honourable member for Hinkler, the previous investment in this technology appears to be somewhere in the area of $14m to $15m, and I am informed by a senior member of the company itself that it expects to put another $7m into this venture. Of course, the proposal by the Government is to put another $7m in over about four years. </PARA>
<PARA> It would not be unreasonable to assume that the total investment in this company will be about $35m in four years time when we get to fruition. One would expect an international company, even in straitened times such as we are in, to expect a return on current capital employed of about 20 per cent. A few years ago in the high point of the 1980s we might have been looking at 25 per cent or a percentage point or two more, but we would expect the company to be looking now at 20 per cent, which indicates to me that it would be expecting a return at the end of this time and from thenceforth of $6m or so. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hinkler has told us in glowing terms of the prospects for this company and that in fact there are $10 billion worth of opportunities out there in the industry. I want the Minister to address this subject because, if it is true, as the company says, that it is a risky venture and that the returns will not be there, then obviously the returns will be perhaps less than $6m. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us say that they are not. Let us say that the company gets a 20 per cent return on current capital employed. How can it produce only that result if it does that and if this technology is so all encompassing and so earth-shattering that it will be of great financial benefit to a whole lot of operations in this country, operations which have a total value of, if you like, $10 billion. I have heard that figure before; I think it may well have been in the second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the case and if these opportunities are there, I simply ask, how is it that the company can only expect to make $6m? If it is expected to make much more than $6m, why would Bunge (Australia) Pty Ltd, acting for its international partner which already has 48 per cent of the company, put in the measly sum of $7m to give this marvellous, earth-shattering opportunity a run?</PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that that is the illogical part of the argument, and I would like the Minister to address that because this is a very important matter. It might seem small, but it is important when it is separated out from the general thrust of the protection reduction policy in the statement, with which we totally agree. As I said before, I can only assume that it might have been the bone that was flicked out from the Cabinet to one or two interventionists who felt that there should be something for them to chase. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not speak at length. I wish to join my colleagues in regard to this matter. I do not see any logical reason why taxpayers' funds should be paid out in trying to pick a winner, a winner that has failed. I do not know how the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) came to be advised. Was he advised by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), or was this some prospect of his own that he alighted on this company and decided that the taxpayers should fork out $7m to support it? The company, as the House has been informed, closed in February. It has been subject to a takeover by an international firm. There are thoughts that the technology may go offshore. His timing is illogical and appalling. What is he trying to do?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As part of his speech the Minister says that sugar prices is one of the reasons-he was blaming the Opposition-why the company failed. I wish to read to the Minister a letter from CSR Ltd dated 27 March. I will let him have the details. I hope he is aware of the facts. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>There have been a number of comments in the press and elsewhere in recent months regarding the pricing system for Australian sugar and, more specifically, the impact of this pricing and the current structural adjustment (tariff) arrangements in increasing sugar costs to users such as Sirius Biotechnology. While it is not CSR's practice or intention to reveal details of its commercial arrangements with its customers, some of these comments warrant a response. </PARA>
<PARA>First, Sirius was identified by CSR at the outset as a potentially valuable longer term outlet. In particular, it was seen as creating a new market in an area outside the traditional sweetener market and, as such, deserving of special attention. It is relevant in this regard that, at least in the initial stages, Sirius' preferred fermentable feedstock was understood to be domestically produced glucose, and the competitive situation was therefore dictated largely by the price of alternative fermentables rather than domestic or international sugar prices. </PARA>
<PARA>Backed by support from the Queensland Sugar Industry, CSR was able to supply sugar to Sirius during the 1989/90 period at prices which were not only competitive with alternative fermentables but were significantly below those prevailing in the sweetener market. Indeed, prices to Sirius were maintained around or below those prevailing prior to deregulation of the domestic sugar market on 1 July 1989, notwithstanding the generally buoyant international sugar market. </PARA>
<PARA>The question of any ``distortion'' imposed by the tariff arrangement is, we believe, basically irrelevant given that, over the period during which sugar was supplied to Sirius, the pricing support provided by the Queensland Sugar Industry enabled CSR to more than compensate for the full extent of the tariff. </PARA>
<PARA>CSR certainly remains interested in supplying any future fermentation requirements Sirius may have. While it is not possible to give an open-ended guarantee of support, CSR would continue to look for ways of providing encouragement in the event of any resumption of operations. </PARA>
<PARA>That is from the head office of CSR. I would like the Minister to respond to that. If he is going to blame us for the collapse of this company, he should check his facts. I think he needs to do that before he comes into this House throwing things around as a basis for handing out $7m of taxpayers' funds to a company that has failed. I do not know whether this happens to be a little gem of his own. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the world market for citric acid, we find it is a massive market; it is a market that is filled by very low cost production. The new technology that Sirius was developing is an important technology. It picked the wrong thing to run with; that is what it amounts to. Citric acid is easily and cheaply produced world-wide. There was a burgeoning world market. Prices were falling and, of course, the company could not compete in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I think those are the broad facts. I would like the explanations because the fact is that picking winners in today's environment is dangerous. If we look at Australia's citrus industry rather than citric acid, we find that citrus farmers would enjoy-if we are going to pick winners-$7m at the moment. There are 101 different companies or industry groups which would welcome such a benevolence from the Federal Government by way of investment, by way of subsidy and by way of budgetary support-anything we like to think of. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is funding an international company to pursue Australian developed technology, with no control on where that technology will end, and the Government is doing that at the cost of the Australian taxpayer. I should like the Minister to explain the facts in better detail than he did in his second reading speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I first heard about the Bounty (Citric Acid) Bill 1991 and read the detail, I could hardly believe that the Government was proposing to pay $7m for the benefit of a foreign owned company with no assurances that we would get any real benefit back for Australia. On reflection, I probably should not have been surprised because it is consistent with the interventionist line of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), which typifies the Government's short term actions in the absence of a science and technology strategic approach. It shows that the Government is prepared to cede the benefits of protection to foreign companies and it reverses, with breathtaking speed, the lower protection words of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the micro-economic statement last month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, it is such a serious matter that what we have seen from the Government's side tonight is one speaker and not a single supporter in the chamber for the Minister this evening. The honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) earlier said that we would oppose the Bill, and they spelt out many of the reasons, and I should like to reinforce some of those points and to add some further points. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is about government assistance to the owners of Sirius Biotechnology Ltd for the production of citric acid and the stated reason is that:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill gives effect to the Government's decision, announced in the industry statement, to provide bounty support for the continued development, and commercialisation, of leading edge Australian fermentation technology in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>We are also told that:</PARA>
<PARA>While the support relates only to the production of citric acid by fermentation, it has much wider strategic implications for the development of an Australian fermentation-based biotechnology industry. </PARA>
<PARA>In reality it is common knowledge that Bunge (Australia) Pty Ltd is about to take over Sirius Biotechnology Ltd and Bunge may not go ahead with that without the Government handouts and, therefore, Sirius and this technology could be finished if the Bill does not give the taxpayer's money to the Bunge-Sirius combination. </PARA>
<PARA> By coincidence, I visited the operations of Bunge (Australia) Pty Ltd in Melbourne last week and, together with the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford), I visited the company's north Melbourne research and development facility and its Parkville production facility, which is not yet on line but which is well advanced. We were looking at biotechnology activity where Bunge is attempting to develop a product to enhance the growth of certain animals, and there will also be other applications later on for other breeds of animals down the track. I must say they are undertaking some excellent work in that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> The company is located in Parkville at the premises of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL). There is a heavy investment in the project and a long payback period. But a major cost benefit for it is the very generous basis on which CSL premises and facilities are being rented to Bunge by the Government. To have set up without such government generosity would have probably put the project under some strain. In short, the taxpayer is again subsidising Bunge. This activity is being undertaken in Australia because of an Australian staff initiative at Bunge-which I think is commendable-but the bottom line is that the general cost base of doing business is so bad in Australia that it needs government handouts to compensate and be able to undertake this sort of development. </PARA>
<PARA> During a two-hour tour of Bunge, the subject of Sirius came up, and I was given to understand that its view is that the citric acid market in Australia could rise in the not too distant future to about 10,000 tonnes, which is minute in world terms but significant in terms of what it is trying to do in this country. The pricing levels of input to the production process have moved favourably towards the Sirius-Bunge operation. It is a small facility but it is relevant to this country's needs. The plant is designed efficiently; so if other input cost factors were to be equal, then Sirius would of course be a competitive company. The advanced design of the plant itself can be sold overseas as it stands so that it can go and sell a complete plant to somebody else somewhere in the Asia-Pacific region. So selling the technology rather than necessarily producing the product is where Bunge sees some of the advantages. </PARA>
<PARA> The plant is also capable of producing products other than just citric acid, and of course the company plans to do this. With this present from the Government that we are talking about tonight, and no binding commitment from the company in return, Bunge can do very nicely-thank you very much. Just this week the Minister said, when commenting in this chamber during Question Time on the gene shears deal, that the Government would attach `conditionality' to foreign partners where they do deals in respect of shipping our technology overseas. We have foreign ownership in this case. Where is the conditionality?</PARA>
<PARA> Bunge has grown recently in Australia, partly by acquisition, and this is part of its further expansion which is being funded by the Government. The company will stay as long or as short a time, I would suggest, as suits it. It is getting Sirius at a knock-down price and it obviously knows a gift-horse when it sees one. The Australian taxpayer is providing the gift for what I believe is a questionable long term benefit to Australia. I quote the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>Internationally, governments are intervening to assist the production of citric acid and other fermentation-based chemicals through subsidising the price of fermentation substrates and by providing tariff protection to their local industries. European Community producers, for example, are able to purchase sugar or other carbohydrate substrates at world competitive prices through a system of rebates on raw material costs. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to the duty free access of citric acid to the Australian market, tariffs of 30 per cent apply in Indonesia, 24 per cent in Japan and 6 per cent in the United States of America. Imports into Australia are mainly from Ireland, China, United States and Indonesian producers which benefit not only from subsidised raw material costs but also a protected domestic market. In other words, a combination of domestic and international policies have distorted the operating environment. </PARA>
<PARA>If this is so, I ask the Government: why not give the taxpayer detailed information on the actual implementation details of this deal with Bunge? What is the return to the Australian community going to be? Why is there no penalty to be applied if Bunge breaks the deal? Why go to these lengths to retain the technology here if it is truly a viable commercial proposition? Instead of more protection, why does the Government not lower other cost structures for all Australian companies-lower the tax rates; lower the transport rates; lower government charges; and all the rest? Why pick this particular winner? I very much regret having to say it, but it does not look very much like a winner to me. Did the Government side not learn anything from Victoria's inglorious record of picking winners?</PARA>
<PARA> In the last sitting week the Prime Minister said he was lowering protection. This seems to me to be a very funny way of lowering protection. Is the Prime Minister prepared to tell other struggling companies why they are to pay for the good fortune of Sirius? We are informed by the Minister that Sirius has also developed strong strategic linkages with industry and the research community; and that research into a number of other applications of the technology is currently under way in collaboration with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the University of Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> The significance of the Sirius operation derives not just from commercial opportunities for the technology; the skills and production facilities at Sirius represent a key base on which future fermentation-based biotechnology potential can be built in Australia, and they are not available elsewhere. We are told that in view of the importance of the Sirius technology and the production facilities as the foundation of a carbohydrate-based fermentation industry in Australia, the Government has decided to introduce this bounty assistance scheme. The bounty is to be payable on the production in Australia of citric acid by the high technology production process involving the fermentation of carbohydrates in the air lift fermenters. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we are told by the Minister that the bounty is not a protection measure but is a support mechanism. That is an incredibly fine distinction. It is a support mechanism aimed at offsetting the distortions which prevent the intrinsic competitiveness of the Sirius technology being realised, enabling the company to achieve commercial viability in citric acid production. </PARA>
<PARA> Is this perhaps a sop to the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), in whose electorate I understand Sirius falls? I am well aware, as we all are, that it is an area of special interest to him. </PARA>

The proper solution would be to offset the market distortions we have heard about by actually dealing with those distortions in transportation, in the labour market and in the rest of the market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality of the world is that the cutting edge of our economy is a small group of internationally competitive enterprises that are either exporting or competing against imports. Unfortunately, relatively few Australian enterprises export outside of our resource industries. Services and raw material inputs into export and import competing industries are a significant proportion of costs-for example, distortions in the labour market, transportation and also in the protected commodity prices, as in this case. Inefficient suppliers and appalling infrastructure in many cases are avoidable impediments to Australian companies being internationally competitive. These are the areas where Government can set the proper competitive general environment for all companies, not just picking out one. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, all industries need to lift their performance to international best performance standard. This applies not just to those who are actually directly competing in international markets. Manufacturing relies heavily on other industries providing inputs and manufacturing companies will benefit from efficient improvements elsewhere in the economy. This applies to sugar pricing in the Sirius situation or to wheat or whatever, as much as it does in any others. Sadly, as only a relatively small proportion of the Australian economy is directly engaged in international trade, a great deal more effort and reform is needed if Australia is to get the message about competition through to managers and to workers across the board. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should carry out reforms to allow all industries to derive benefits. All companies need to engage in export or import replacement. The Government should reform the freight system, labour productivity arrangements, lower manufacturing input costs, and so on. It should not retreat from its anti-protectionist stance. The Minister's second reading speech stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is firmly committed to realising opportunities to apply Australia's scientific and research skills to the development of new industries in Australia. Few areas offer better opportunities than technologies which add value to Australia's intrinsic strengths in agricultural production, particularly in the food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics sectors. The bounty, which is the subject of this legislation, is aimed at ensuring that the opportunity to capitalise on Australian developed technology for citric acid production, as well as to build a substantial chemical fermentation industry in Australia, is not lost overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> What an untrue statement. This Bill turns on its head the Government's own stated policy. It will benefit Bunge, an overseas company, not Australia. It reveals the Minister for Science and Technology as a short term thinker, not a strategic thinker. The Australian taxpayer is to hand over $7m with no commitment whatsoever from the recipient to deliver the promised benefits. Of course it is sad to see another case of Australian technology not being taken up by our industry. We all want to see greater development in Australia of Australian technology. But this is not the way to do it. I urge honourable members to oppose the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The anti-protectionist sentiment that supposedly drives industry policy today should dictate that all bounty schemes of a kind dealt with in the Bounty (Citric Acid) Bill 1991 should go the same way as tariffs and be phased out completely over the next decade. At least, that is the direction in which the Opposition is properly and sensibly moving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the Bounty (Citric Acid) Bill, however, we have the introduction of a wholly new bounty scheme, which is to cost taxpayers $7.3m over the next five years, assuming always that the Government does not decide to extend the scheme any further. This new bounty on citric acid production is for the benefit of one firm, Sirius Biotechnology Ltd, the only producer of citric acid by fermentation in Australia. As has been mentioned already by so many speakers on this side of the House, this measure is, thus, a classic example of attempting to pick an industry winner. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill has more to do with finding a new owner for Sirius than it does with supporting an emerging biotechnology industry in Australia. The bounty is designed to act as an inducement to the foreign-owned Bunge Industrial Ltd to purchase the ailing Sirius, for which an Australian buyer could not be found when it ran out of capital late last year and shut down its operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government originally threatened not to make the bounty available to Sirius if it were foreign owned but obviously it has had a change of heart about foreign ownership in the absence of any Australian purchaser. Now the bounty is, in reality, to be a reward for the new foreign owner for taking over the faltering company. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) argued in his second reading speech that `the bounty' to Sirius `is not a protection measure but a support mechanism'. He bases this distinction on the fact that Sirius faces numerous distortions in the domestic and international prices for its feedstock as a result of government-sponsored marketing arrangements for sugar. It is argued that the new bounty is designed simply to overcome these price distortions. Unfortunately, we have no way of assessing this claim, given the dearth of information from the Government about Sirius and just how the bounty is intended to facilitate its operations. My colleague, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), who preceded me in this debate, made the point very well. </PARA>
<PARA> We know very little about the cost structure facing Sirius. In particular, we know very little about the difference that the current sugar tariff arrangements have made to this structure compared with what might be possible with a more liberal import regime, for example. Therefore, it is impossible for us to assess whether the proposed bounty payments are an appropriate form of assistance for this firm-if assistance happens to be what we are trying to give. It could well be that any number of micro-economic reforms on the part of the Government would more than offset any cost disadvantages that Sirius faces as a result of protection for the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Such reforms would have the advantage of benefiting everyone and, what is more, without cost, which is certainly not the case with the proposed bounty. Furthermore, there is some evidence from the various reports on this matter that the actual business plan on which Sirius has been based is not viable even with reduced factor costs. The fact that Bunge even required a bounty as a pre-condition for any bid for Sirius suggests that the proposed production activity is a marginal proposition. If that is the case, then it is hardly a sound basis on which to launch an import replacing production facility, let alone develop export markets as proposed now by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the actual state of affairs, we should not kid ourselves that this is not a protectionist measure. There is a growing tendency on the part of this Government, typified by much of what was contained in the industry policy statement, to re-label protectionist measures as assistance, in the apparent belief that the new nomenclature somehow changes the final impact of these measures. But this Bill is unambiguously protectionist in its implications for the firm concerned. It imposes costs on Australian taxpayers so that Sirius might have a better chance of competing against foreign producers of biotechnology products. This is done in the name of increasing value added production in Australia and increasing export opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> They are very much `in' terms and describe objectives with which the Opposition is wholly in agreement but, of course, what happens so often with well arrived at terminology is that that terminology is being abused-in this case, to conceal what are blatant protectionist intentions. It will be left to the Industry Commission, or some other review body, to pass judgment over the next five years as to whether Sirius has returned benefits to the Australian economy that justify the cost of this bounty to Australian taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> We are going to have to wait several years down the track at very best to be able to determine the efficacy of what is now proposed. It does not matter if we find out, as many of us suspect, that it is ill-directed assistance-ill-directed protectionism-if, after three or four years, we find that it does not work, because the taxpayers will have coughed up and there is no way of retrieving that $7.3m. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of available evidence we have every reason to be sceptical about this proposal. We need to remember that the more than $7m involved in this scheme does not come cheaply. Taxation, the source of this $7.3m, involves considerable compliance costs on the part of business and individuals, and collection costs on the part of the Australian Taxation Office. There is also an opportunity cost to taxation. These tax dollars could deliver a greater return if left in the hands of their original sector owners. Thus, any benefit to value added production or to the current account may be offset by the costs of this scheme to the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Even more spurious than the Minister's attempted distinction between protection and assistance is the claim that the bounty `directly addresses the pricing distortions' that result from statutory marketing arrangements and which are, apparently, the rationale for this Bill. The Bill manifestly does nothing of the sort. Indeed, if anything, it entrenches these distortions by reducing the pressure to remove the tariff barriers that result in higher sugar prices. Obviously, the most preferable policy option to assist Sirius and the biotechnology industry in Australia generally would be to accelerate the structural adjustment processes for the domestic sugar industry, which would obviate the need for this bounty and just might allow Sirius to compete effectively without imposing a burden on the rest of us. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that the Minister attributes some of the blame for this situation to coalition actions in the Senate as they affected the prospects of the sugar industry. Of course, in doing so he ignores the fact that it was the Government that presided over an embargo policy for six years before acting to reduce protection in the sugar industry in a way that was then unsatisfactory from the point of view of the Opposition. Rather than engaging in that debate any further, I simply make the point that an important part of the battle against protectionism, both in Australia and overseas, is openness and transparency about assistance arrangements on the part of the responsible authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we do not play down the true implications and costs of protectionist measures by trying to wrap them up as something else, such as in this case so-called assistance to value added production. Bounty measures such as this should be accompanied by a full appraisal by the Minister of its net costs to the rest of the community and its implications for the future competitiveness and viability of the firm or industry; otherwise we simply make the job of the protectionist forces that much easier by helping them to obfuscate the real issues at stake. The information supplied by the Government in support of the proposed bounty for citric acid is woefully inadequate. Therefore we are in the position of being unable to make an informed judgment, and the scheme should be rejected for that reason alone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the chamber on the Bounty (Citric Acid) Bill 1991 and to support the comments just made by my colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). In the explanatory notes that cover this Bill the Government contended that the bounty being offered to Sirius Biotechnology Ltd is not a form of protection for an inherently uncompetitive company, but a measure to redress domestic and international price distortions which would enable the company to realise its competitive potential. On that basis, this sort of injection of funds should occur in businesses all around Australia. Hundreds of businesses, particularly labour intensive ones, could make exactly the same claim as has Sirius in this claim for some form of bounty protection. I represent labour intensive industries that have every right to be indignant at this action because they have themselves sought intervention from the Government, quite unsuccessfully, in areas such as this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us for just a moment compare what is happening in the production of citric acid in the Sirius Biotechnology plant with the production of the related product, citrus fruit, in my electorate. Citrus growers could well claim precisely the same sort of protection on precisely the same sort of basis. They could say that they want protection only to redress international price distortions warped by the impact of Brazilian concentrate, and yet they would be ruled out of order by this Government. This same Government is led by a man who in the run-up to the February 1983 election told those citrus growers that there would be no fall in protection and that there would be an injection of funds into the citrus fruit industry such as he is currently offering the citric acid industry. What happened? When the election was over, the promise was entirely forgotten and the citrus growers, who could make just the same claim as the citric acid growers are currently making, found themselves facing a fall from what was then a 30 per cent tariff wall to a 15 per cent tariff wall, not bearing in mind the five per cent developing country preference that Brazil, their major competitor, enjoys. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of this Bill, I am indignant because I found myself only last week in the electorate of Barker defending to citrus growers this Government's policies in the area of tariff reduction. What would they say if they knew that the same Government that expects them to live in a tariff reducing market is proposing to offer protection to the manufacturers of citric acid? Is it any wonder that I am a little annoyed? As the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said, there is not much joy in going out, as an Opposition member, and defending the Government; but I have found myself doing it on a number of issues. I would expect some consistency from the Government so that, as a result of my defence, I would feel that I was standing on firm ground. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mayo is precisely right. Clearly, I cannot anticipate that, because this Bill indicates just how inconsistent the Government is prepared to be. What do we have? Just last week, in defence of the industry statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), I told citrus growers to live without protection; and tonight I am expected to come into this House and support a Bill which injects $7.2m worth of protection into Sirius Biotechnology, Altona, Victoria-a manufacturer of citric acid. It would not be so bad if this protection and the taxpayers' money were going to an Australian company. But no, it is going offshore to an overseas company. Worse than that, it is going to a company which, having put out its hand and taken this money, takes it without any long term commitment to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has supported the Government; we have supported that part of the industry statement which has said that we will take bricks out of the protection wall in Australia in order to have firm ground on which to negotiate the removal of bricks from other people's tariff walls through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations. Here we find ourselves with a one-off, totally inconsistent payment which goes to an industry-based where? Pardon my cynicism, but I note that it is based in an Australian Labor Party electorate. All this does is add distortions to what should otherwise have been a pure approach from the Government; clearly, as the honourable member for Mayo has said, that cannot be anticipated. As the Minister would have to agree, members of the Opposition have had a pure approach to tariff reduction.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the honourable member for Adelaide that we support falling protection walls in the citrus industry, in support of that which the Government has advocated. In fact, we have been prepared to go even further than the Government and be consistent in our approach by advocating a deregulated wages market and a deregulated transport market. But the Government expects us to come in here and support regulation and increased protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Everyone in this House knows that what Australia needs most is an additional generation of export income. What do we do? Generate additional income by loading every one of our exporters with a further cost? Of course we do not. The Minister knows what happens-every one of those tariff bricks in Australia's current tariff wall is a brick over which the major export producers in my electorate have to jump in order to get into the export market; an additional cost that they have to bear; a cost which exporters pay.</PARA>
<PARA> It has been calculated-and we have heard it a thousand times, and tonight's legislation simply adds to it-that the already existing protection levels around Australia cost our exporters something like $8 billion per year. We have committed ourselves to doing something about it. We, the Parliament, had-until tonight. From tonight onwards, we, the Opposition, are the only ones who will have maintained a consistent role in that direction-and maintained it in support of the Government, which has now walked away from our commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> The commitment we, as a Parliament, once had to lower tariff walls, we, as an Opposition, have also had with regard to lowering protection levels in the transport and wages areas. If tariff protection would save our exporters $8 billion per year, it is calculated that removing protection in the transport area could save exporters up to $22 billion per year and, as the SPC Ltd experience has clearly illustrated, removing protection in the wages area could save untold hundreds of billions of dollars per year and offer Australia a real, competitive edge. </PARA>
<PARA> Does he expect us to walk away from that sort of commitment and opportunity by offering inconsistent support to the legislation that has been put before us tonight? If you will pardon the pun, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister cannot be serious about taking $7.3m of taxpayers' revenue and injecting it into an overseas company. Even that $7.3m would be more efficiently and more equitably collected by the Opposition than it is currently being collected by the Government; of course, we would do that through our already enunciated goods and services tax. In the interests of every exporter, and in the interest of the competition that every Australian producer wishes to enjoy, we in the Opposition cannot support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-There are a number of points that I think need to be responded to. Let me say at the outset, because it seemed to be a common thread running through all of the contributions that were made, that the payment in relation to this bounty is not a payment made to Bunge (Australia) Pty Ltd because the payment did not have to be made to Bunge. Because Bunge had a takeover offer in place, it could have bought Sirius Biotechnology Ltd, because Sirius was prepared to sell, taken this technology overseas and developed it to its advantage without any regard to the building block, the breakthrough technology, that had been developed in this country. So let there be no illusion that this is about making some sort of payment to Bunge that we did not have to make. That is a ridiculous assertion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point that commonly runs through all of the points is the assertion that by giving this support mechanism there is no commitment by the company in terms of Australia. That, too, is arrant nonsense and I will come to it. Before I do that, I think we have to come to grips with the price distortions argument. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, it is true that a decision of the National Party of Australia and the coalition resulted in a price for sugar in this country higher than in the rest of the world. That cannot be ignored at all. But it is also true that it is not only a price distortion in terms of sugar that is involved here; it is a combination of the distortion of a domestic policy foisted on us by the Opposition in combination with support mechanisms undertaken by countries overseas. What do honourable members on the other side of the House say-that we ignore the fact that other countries are providing support mechanisms to their companies in this same industry? Is that the level playing field that they talk about-that we ignore it; we do not try to even up? If that is what they are saying, they should get out into their rural electorates and their city electorates and argue it, because I do not think that anyone in this country believes that, if there is not a level playing field, we should be the dupes. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have to come to grips with is that it is not just the fact that two years ago the Opposition created a circumstance in which the price of sugar was higher than it otherwise should be; it is these other practices in other countries, which the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) alluded to when he quoted from my second reading speech, that are real. They have caused the circumstances in which this company was not able to compete fairly and are why it has sought assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the point that is referred to in the CSR Ltd letter because the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) made reference to this. In response to his question about whether we did check the prices at various stages, my answer is yes. But it is important to note that the letter from CSR is quite selective in terms of what it says, because in the third paragraph-and he quoted the whole letter; I will not do that again-it talked about the prices being not only competitive with alternative fermentables in the period 1989-90, but also being significantly below those prevailing in the sweetener market. </PARA>
<PARA> That might technically have been correct, but it was still substantially above what other producers elsewhere in the world were required to pay. It is also true that in 1989, CSR was prepared to offer prices at about the level of world prices. I cannot go into the figures on the record in this House because these are figures in commercial confidence. But when the world price of sugar plunged dramatically, CSR did not drop its price. I am sorry that the honourable member for Mitchell is not in this House to hear this, as he made the allegation. So a circumstance existed in which the price CSR was charging-whilst it might argue that it was a concession and that it was below what it was charging the others in the sweetener market in Australia-was still substantially higher than the price prevailing in the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> That forced a position in which Sirius had to look to alternative substrate and that is when it went to a wheat substrate. It was able to do that on a cheaper price than CSR was charging. Nevertheless, that same price was still higher than what all of its competitors around the world were able to do it for. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the distortion that the Government had to face up to-not just what the those on other side of the House foisted on it by their nonsensical policy in another House-because of the interacting with other distortions carried out by policy in other countries over which we have no control, but which those on the other side of the House would say we should ignore. Quite frankly, we on this side of the House do not ignore those circumstances. We say that we have to be internationally competitive, but we do not in the process become internationally hoodwinked. This exercise has been about addressing that distortion. It is not a protection measure, as I said in my second reading speech. It is about overcoming an impediment over which the company has no control. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gippsland said that we should look at all the other cost structures, but what sort of competitive position do we put a company in in this country if it has to pay a substantially higher price for an input than its international competitor? That is what Sirius had to do. Do those opposite say that industry should pay more of an input cost to try to become more competitive? If that is what they are saying, they should get up and say it honestly. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point that needs to be addressed is the question of the benefits of this technology. The honourable member for Gippsland asked a lot of questions, but he did not give too many answers. One of the questions was: what are the benefits? I think other speakers who have addressed this debate have recognised the significance of the technology. In the time I have left, I will go to the issue of why it is considered so essential to support this technology. </PARA>
<PARA> The technology is unique in two important respects. Firstly, the fermentation takes place in air lift fermenters developed by Sirius, as opposed to conventional fermenters. That is the breakthrough. Sirius has discovered and developed it. That technology has a number of advantages, particularly in relation to the energy efficiency of the process and in relation to the efficacy of the fermentation. That is why, on the first score, this technology is unique. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, Sirius has developed a strain of micro-organism which produces high yields of citric acid from a variety of carbohydrates and which is genetically stable and able to be maintained and propagated in a production environment. In addition, the process utilises downstream technology which is not only internationally competitive but also available to only a few companies worldwide. The calibre of that technology is recognised overseas to the extent that one technology sale in excess of $1m has already been made. </PARA>
<PARA> So they are the benefits of the technology. That is the reason why Australia should still be trying to capture the opportunity to develop it in this country and not let it go overseas, which would have happened if we had not taken this decision. Let there be no mistake: if the Government had not made this decision the company would have been bought out by Bunge with no conditions attached, and the technology taken overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Is that what the Opposition is saying we should have allowed to happen, because that is what would have happened? Honourable members opposite have to make up their minds honestly against the alternatives, not the ideal. I agree that it would have been a far better circumstance had the private sector in this country, or another company or an Australian company been prepared to put their money up. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the first instance in which this has happened, that the failure has occurred in that regard. Gene shears is another example of it. As I said in answer to a question in this House today, or it may have been yesterday, I take the view that, if in fact we are faced with the alternative of no Australian company and losing it totally overseas versus attaching conditionality to the circumstances in which the foreign partner participates here, I go for the latter. That is what this exercise is about. The alternative, the turning-the-back approach, would have meant that this technology would have been lost to Australia completely. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us just go to the question of the conditions. The honourable member for Gippsland raised this in his contribution. I am surprised he raised it because he quoted at length from my second reading speech, and these aspects were contained there in other forms. Under the bounty scheme, payments of the bounty will only be made if the product is produced in Australia. So, in other words, if the production does not take place here, if the company does walk overseas, as the honourable member for Gippsland suggests it might because there are no conditions, it does not get the bounty. No bounty is going to be paid unless that product is commercialised in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition-and this is the staged process as is required by all bounty legislation-the Controller-General of the Australian Customs Service, in administering the bounty, has to carry out periodic inspections and examinations of the operations and production records of Sirius to ensure that the bounty is being claimed in accordance with the Bounty (Citric Acid) Act 1991, and that requires it to meet certain production targets in accordance with the conditions of the agreement that we have entered into. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is a further benefit associated with the agreement that we have entered into with the company, and that is that, in order to benefit fully from the bounty, Sirius has to undertake a major program of investment in the order of a $7m to $10m expansion. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me address the naive point that the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) made. I might reflect on two things. I am surprised that he did not lead the debate given that he is the shadow Minister for industry. He left it to the honourable member for Gippsland. The honourable member for Barker came in and made a speech in about half the time-10 minutes instead of the 20 minutes-and had the gall to have a go at me for not being here before because I was tied up with other activities. Then he promptly left as soon as he finished speaking, and I cannot see him here now to hear the answer that he so fervently urged me to give to what he considered to be his great knockout blow. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member tried to go through some postulation as to the size of this company in terms of the size of the market I referred to potentially being available as a result of encouraging this technology. He fails to understand that we do not expect Bunge to be the company that develops all manner of options, opportunities and outcomes associated with the global market opportunities. We are simply seeking to establish the base upon which the outcome-the product, the technology, the fermentation, the process if you like-can be used to assist and be the building block for other industries, for example, pharmaceuticals, food processing and a whole range of industries which really do not get a look in, in terms of market opportunities unless they become innovative through the technology that is based upon this process.</PARA>
<PARA> The global market opportunities-the $10 billion that I talked about-are all potential offshoots in which we can participate as a trading nation, if we position ourselves properly. We cannot position ourselves properly in the food processing or pharmaceuticals industries in the future unless we have a strength in biotechnology. Why should we not position ourselves in that regard if we have the research?</PARA>
<PARA> Our problem is that we have not had the capacity to commercialise that research. Australian industry has not been prepared to take up those opportunities as well as it should. In those circumstances we should not run away from other alternatives that enable us to develop that research. That is what this exercise is about. As I say, the conditions contained in this legislation will be prescribed by way of regulation. This was made available to the advisers from the Opposition who met with the Department to go through it, so I am surprised to hear most contributions on the other side of the House asking what we can get for it and what the conditions are. </PARA>
<PARA> The first condition is that the company, Bunge, will continue the research, development and commercialisation of citric acid-the immediate prospect in Australia. Secondly, it will contribute to research in new product development arising from or associated with the fermentation technology-another commitment in terms of new development and new opportunities. One commitment is to the commercialisation of what is there and another is to the continuation of the research. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the company will explore international market opportunities for the fermentation technology to see where the international market opportunities are. It will undertake that as part of this agreement. Finally, it will ensure that the maximum advantage is taken from the expertise and know-how associated with the development and production of citric acid and other new products in Australia by suitable licensing, franchising or other arrangements. Those are the conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I go to is the question of the intellectual property, because the honourable member for Gippsland made reference to how that was protected. Sirius considered patenting key elements of the technology but received advice that, although these elements were patentable, patents would not be the most effective way to protect the intellectual property in these cases. It stems from the fact that it would be difficult to identify infringement of the patent from the final product, because the detailed knowledge of the actual production process that produced the product would in most cases be considered commercial-in-confidence. I note that there is concurrence with that assessment from the other side of the House-or at least sections of it. Instead of going down the patent route, Sirius is going to enter into confidentiality agreements with organisations and employees who have access to the technology. That is how it will protect the intellectual property. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, we have heard a lot of rhetoric on the other side of the House. We have heard an attempt to try to label this as a singling-out mechanism and something that is retrograde, that goes back in terms of what we have done in reducing tariff protection. It is none of that; it is part of the rhetoric that the Opposition seeks to throw up because it is not prepared to come to grips with the fundamentals. The fundamentals are these: we do have to have a vision for the future; we do have to position ourselves strategically; and we do have to recognise that there are important opportunities in this country in significant growth sectors such as pharmaceuticals and food processing. The latter point will significantly benefit the rural communities in value adding opportunities. We need to be able to position ourselves so that we can have innovative capacity, and we need to position ourselves separately so that we can take advantage of those market opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot do that without the development of the research. We have got the research. What we have failed to do in many cases is to make the best advantage of applying that research and developing it. In circumstances in which it cannot be done in this country, we have to look at all avenues by which we encourage strategic alliances with overseas companies but in ways in which the research is still conducted in this country. They are the guarantees; they are the commitments; and I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to talk about the latest and greatest in the Industrial Relations Commission upholding the real value of industrial relations in Australia. Upholding a decision of Troubleshooters Anonymous a week and a wee bit ago, the Industrial Relations Commission reversed an earlier ruling which held that family day care workers are not subcontractors. Is it not a welcome day for Australia? The decision is a blow to industrial anarchy and is a giant step forward for democracy in our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many honourable members will know that family day care is described by the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health as a scheme in which a network of individuals, usually women, provide care in their own homes for other people's young children. Family day care is aimed primarily at children from nought to five, but it can also assist school aged children up to the age of 12. </PARA>
<PARA> These women care for young children in their homes under a scheme financed by the Federal Government with grants to local municipal organisations in the State of Victoria. In my electorate, the Shire of Sherbrooke has over 400 full time care places in the family day care system. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1989 Commissioner Brown held that those individual family day care workers were, in fact, municipal workers. Mind you, they use their own homes and they bring in other people's children to take care of during the day, but the Municipal Employees Union went to the Commission in the first place and said, `We want to represent these women who take care of other people's children in their own homes'. All this is supervised by either shires or city offices and under the auspices of the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The union said, `Look, these people who operate in their own homes to take care of other people's children are employees of the municipality. Therefore, they have to have four weeks annual leave, long service leave, superannuation, holiday pay, Workcare, payroll tax'-I have probably forgotten a few because there a few more thrown in there somewhere. Anyhow, the whole scheme was going to be blown out of the water. This thing has been going, I might add, since 1972. The Shire of Sherbrooke is an already disadvantaged municipality in the outer east of Melbourne. We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have very little rail service, almost no bus service, inadequate roads and inadequate infrastructure. It is bad enough that it is so expensive now to live there that most of the women in the Shire of Sherbrooke work to help support the family so that they can meet the costs of this Government's high interest rate policy which has devastated home owning. All these people now have to travel to the city to find work if, in fact, it is available. </PARA>
<PARA> I already have a devastated community in my electorate and the union wanted to further devastate it by wrecking a good, simple subcontract scheme. We had a meeting in my shire late last year of some 400 or 500 people, including many of the care givers-the women who take care of children in their homes-many of the parents who participate in the scheme, the Shire Council officers and myself. Let me tell the House that there were two union representatives there and they were the only two people in the entire meeting who supported their application to call subcontract women `municipal employees'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to express to the House my horror at the terror and brutality that the Kurdish people are at this moment facing from the Iraqi forces of Saddam Hussein. Before I continue, I must commend the Government-and I think everyone in this House will join me in applauding it-for its support of the United Nations Security Council resolution No. 688, condemning Iraq for its repression of its citizens and calling on the United Nations and its member states to support humanitarian relief efforts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased also that our Government has responded to the call from international relief agencies for the urgent consideration of relief funds to help the Kurds who have fled their homes in fear of Saddam Hussein. Australia will, as we have been informed by our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), contribute $1m to this cause, which will be passed through the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The United Nations resolution demands that Iraq allow humanitarian organisations access to the country so they can monitor the situation. Resolution 688 also requests the United Nations Secretary-General be allowed to investigate and report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Kurds have traditionally been a race of people persecuted by the more powerful peoples surrounding them. According to an article entitled `The Kurds in the 1990s' published in the January-February issue of Middle East Insight, the Kurds have always been caught in political games they want no part in. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA>With their aspiration of carving an independent homeland out of parts of Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey, the Kurds have long been pawns in the byzantine game of international politics in the Middle East. They may well continue to be pawns in the 1990s as the interested parties in the region, ranging from Syria and Iraq to France and Iran, pursue their own national interests. </PARA>
<PARA>This is what we have been witnessing since August 1990-Saddam Hussein pursuing his own personal political interest to the detriment of anybody who dares stand in his way. </PARA>
<PARA> The horror of what the Kurds are facing is all too clear. For many Kurds now lucky enough to be living in Australia, it is distressing, to say the least, to sit back and watch on television the terrifying plight of their relatives in Iraq. I have a Kurdish population in my electorate, and many of these people have not heard from their families for months. Many do not know the whereabouts of their relatives or even if they are alive. The situation is deplorable and has been so for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Kurds, with nine million people in Turkey, five million in Iran, four million in Iraq and over 800,000 in Syria, constitute the fourth largest ethnic group in the Middle East. Recent newspaper reports have stated that as many as two million Kurdish people are struggling across the frozen mountains of northern Iraq towards the borders of Syria, Iran and Turkey. </PARA>
<PARA> The Kurds, who have retained a separate language and culture, account for almost a fifth of the population of Iraq. They have been fighting for countless years for their own independently recognised state. The birth of a Kurdish state has never come to pass, despite repeated efforts from the Kurds. The fight between Iraq and the Kurds is not a new one. According to a report by Amnesty International, the following is the case:</PARA>
<PARA>In August and September 1988 over 55,000 Iraqi Kurds fled to Turkey from northern Iraq to escape military attacks by Iraqi government forces on civilian targets using, among other things, chemical weapons . . . Turkey granted the Iraqi Kurds `temporary shelter' in the expectation that they would seek permanent asylum in other (third) countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Turkey has not been so accommodating to the Kurds in this latest onslaught by Saddam Hussein's regime. As a result of this, Amnesty International has called on the Turkish Government to protect the Kurdish refugees and other Iraqis from a forced return to Iraq, where many would face certain death. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation in the Middle East remains tense and the war against Iraq is far from over. It is just being fought in a different way. The Kurdish people need our help. They need our help now and that of all other countries which value freedom. I urge our Government to continue its policy of support for the United Nations and its condemnation of Iraq and the brutal actions of Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath regime. In closing, I would like to express my deepest sympathies for all those Kurdish families in Australia who have loved ones suffering in Iraq. My wish is for peace to come to these people and for the torment and cruelty to them to finally end. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Friday at about 7 a.m. I received a phone call from a friend of mine, Mr Jim McGann of Whitton. Jim is a rather large man, and he is typical of the farmers of the Whitton area. I was glad that I was not with him face to face when he received a letter from the Australian Wheat Board the night before, because he was very irate. If I read this letter to the House, I think honourable members will get some idea of why he was irate. The letter reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>As you are aware the A.W.B. has recently made post harvest payments on 1990/91 Season Wheat Pool deliveries. </PARA>
<PARA>In your case however no payment has been possible, due to a number of factors, which will be apparent from the attached payment advice slip, but include low protein and higher than national average storage handling and freight costs. </PARA>
<PARA>We have also enclosed a table setting out the post harvest gross payment levels for all grades and protein levels, and a copy of a letter sent to growers eligible for a payment. </PARA>
<PARA>In most cases ASW below 9.6% protein did not qualify for a payment because the GrainCorp, State Rail and Maritime Services Board costs combined exceeded the amount payable. </PARA>
<PARA>Although your statement indicates a negative amount, you are not being asked to refund any money. The A.W.B. will hold these debits against your future pool equity and deduct them from later payments. </PARA>
<PARA>If you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact the A.W.B. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I guess that honourable members can imagine, by hearing that letter, just how angry wheat growers would be, expecting as they did some further payment for their wheat. I think this is indicative of what is happening to the farming community today, not only in the wheat area, of course, but also in other areas. The letter mentions GrainCorp, State Rail and the Maritime Services Board costs, but it is the general input costs that are affecting farmers today. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of weeks ago Senator David Brownhill and I visited banks in Sydney to ask what they were doing to try to help farmers and people on the land to cope with the rural downturn. The interesting thing that was relayed to us was that the problem that farmers face today is not so much the downturn in commodity prices-because these downturns have not hit them yet-as the culmination of all input costs: taxation, interest rates, fuel prices, other rates and taxes and the cost of water. All of those costs have been imposed on them at a time when they just cannot get their production up and cannot get the amounts due to them for their production. Those farmers were already suffering before the downturn in commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of this now we find that we have the European Community and the Americans fighting out a trade war. This is also impacting on farmers. On top of that we have the Middle East battle and then, of course, the problem we face with the downturn in commodity prices caused by the world recession and by overproduction throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently in the March statement the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) spoke about cutting tariffs to help the economy. I would like to say to the Prime Minister-I know that most of my farming community would like to say this-that it is no good cutting tariffs without doing something about making the industrial relations system more flexible, looking at the taxation system and giving some incentive to people in Australia to work, to save and to invest. If we try to do something about tariffs without doing all of these other things all we are going to do is close down the manufacturing sector, and those people who are doing any good are going to move offshore. That will not do anything for Australian productivity. It certainly will not do anything for farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been talking about wheat farmers in particular, but this applies to wool farmers and to the whole of the agricultural sector. The Government must act, and must act quickly, if people such as Jim McGann and his farmer colleagues are going to stay on the land. One thing we cannot afford to lose is their technical know-how and their managerial skills. We must keep these people on the land not only for humanitarian and social reasons but also for the welfare of their communities and for the welfare of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Prime Minister to have a look at what he is doing to this nation. If he is going to do something about the tariffs-we know that has to be done-he must do something about making the industrial relations system more flexible, looking at the taxation system and giving some incentive to all Australians to work, to invest and to save. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to talk about a matter of concern to many Australian taxpayers and people in remote localities in Australia, that is, the services provided by Radio Australia. Radio Australia currently has a number of functions. One is obviously to project Australia to the world. Might I add, it has transmitter stations at Brandon in Queensland, Carnarvon in Western Australia, Darwin in the Northern Territory and Shepparton in Victoria. I would add, incidentally, that I think the Government needs to do something substantial about upgrading the power and the quality of those transmitters. We really need to see greater resources given to Radio Australia for that purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make two specific points. The first applies to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). On a Saturday Radio Australia takes the 3LO domestic service from Melbourne and gives Australian Football League and race calls and transmits those all around the world. Many people in remote localities, particularly in mining towns in the north-west of Western Australia who cannot get television, can get Radio Australia's services. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, on a Sunday it takes the 2BL-which is Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio in Sydney-feed which, in effect, gives it the rugby league match of the day and other services. This is well received in many remote localities and also overseas. To my horror I discovered early this year that Radio Australia had taken a decision to abandon the Sunday broadcast. When I checked with it, it said that it had changed its priorities. I wondered what its priority was, given that it was playing Beethoven in place of the current sporting service. I happen to like Beethoven but I really wonder what service it is providing to Australian taxpayers in many remote localities in Western Australia and other parts of Australia and also overseas. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AG4">Mr RONALD EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. It is the people who polish Volvos in Manuka who make rules for the ordinary working class people in Australia and give no consideration to their needs. I object strongly to the fact that the broadcasts are relatively cheap; in other words they are free. They are already provided by the domestic service of the ABC. I would add, incidentally, that such is the ability of Radio Australia to reach a market that Neville Oliver, who currently is in the Caribbean, now carries a card which says, `Neville Oliver: Radio Australia' because that is the basis on which he is known. When he carried a card which said `Neville Oliver: ABC Radio', people in overseas localities did not know who he was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is my very strongly held view that we should upgrade the quality of the transmitters and insist that Radio Australia continues to provide these sporting services on a Saturday and a Sunday, because they are services for Australians both within Australia and overseas. Australia is well known for its sporting quality. It is one way of advancing the interests of Australia. For the life of me, I cannot understand how playing music such as Beethoven in place of a sporting service will advance the interests of Australia, given that people can easily find that service anyway through some other radio program. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to put before the House the fact that I think Radio Australia needs to look at its priorities and needs to consider this very important sporting service on both a Saturday and a Sunday for expatriate Australians, as well as people living in the Australian mainland. It is important that Radio Australia is able to provide this service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes; I understand that an adult and a juvenile koala were sighted in an area approximately 5 km from Compartment 2453. Forestry Commission officers subsequently confirmed the sighting of an adult koala in this area on 5 and 6 November.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am advised that Compartment 2453 is in the area where a local resident reported sighting a koala in 1976 and there have been two subsequent reports, one of a dead koala on a property near Compartment 2453 in 1987 and one of a live koala in a gravel quarry adjoining the same property in 1988. I understand that the 1988 sighting was not confirmed by subsequent inspections.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that Dr. Norton has spent a day viewing Compartment 2453 from the adjoining property mentioned above and reported that he considered the forest areas which abut or are close to Compartment 2453 are suitable as habitat for koalas and that he considered that koalas were resident in the area.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4 &amp;5) From February 1989 until December 1990, 20,345.86 m3 of sawlog and 143,014.22 tonnes of pulpwood were harvested from the Tantawangalo and Cathcart State Forests.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Yes; Mr Causley issued a press release on 9 March 1990 noting that the Forestry Commission of NSW and the National Parks and Wildlife Service were undertaking a joint regional study of koalas. He stated ``If we do find evidence of koalas living in this area, I have directed the Commission to stop harvesting in the immediate area''.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) I have been advised that at present there is no logging in the Mount Darragh area of Tantawangalo State Forest, although one coupe in the area may be logged if wet weather causes the cessation of logging in other areas. Any decision to log in this wet weather coupe will, however, take into account the findings of investigations into the sightings of koalas in the area.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Yes; I also understand that the Forestry Commission and the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service are formulating a regional koala management plan which will ensure conservation of koalas in the region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) As I noted in my answer to question No. 392, I have been advised that at present there is no logging in the Mount Darragh area of Tantawangalo State Forest, although one coupe in the area may be logged if wet weather causes the cessation of logging in other areas. Any decision to log in this wet weather coupe will, however, take into account the findings of investigations into the sightings of koalas in the area.</PARA>
<PARA> I have also been advised that Harris-Daishowa is not at present employing any logging contractors on any private property in the Mount Darragh area. The company has plans to conduct logging operations on one property in the area, but I understand that the property is not in the area in which koalas have been sighted and is not considered to be koala habitat.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Harris-Daishowa's export licence does allow the export of woodchips derived from wood from private property.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In November 1990 Sawmillers Exports Pty Ltd and Brisbane Forest Products Pty Ltd were designated as proponents under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. Designation of the companies will allow a full assessment to be undertaken of the environmental issues associated with the export by these companies of woodchips derived from private property and, for Sawmillers Exports only, from silvicultural residues from State forests. Under that Act, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories is responsible for determining whether an environmental impact statement or some other form of assessment is required.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that a re-examination of the environmental impact statement of Harris-Daishowa (HDA) under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act is warranted at present. The October 1990 agreement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments on a reservation system for the South East Forests took the findings of HDA's statement into account as well as those of other reports and investigations such as the report of the Joint Scientific Committee on the South-East Forests (JSC). The JSC Report recognised that relatively rare species such as the koala will require individual habitat management for them to survive in small local populations, even though these animals are in marginal habitat or at the limit of their range. The Forestry Commission of NSW and the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service are formulating a regional koala management plan which will ensure conservation of koalas in the region. I also understand that the Forestry Commission will not schedule logging in the immediate area of the 4 November 1990 sighting until thorough surveys are conducted to ensure that koala individuals and their essential feeding areas are not disturbed.</PARA>

<PARA> 3. Charges Levied for Certificate of Competency Courses</PARA>
<PARA>Overseas students enrolled at the College for Master Class 1/2 and Second Mate studies during the period 1986-88 were admitted under the Government's subsidised overseas student program, and were therefore not charged any tuition fees. They did, however, pay a visa charge of approximately $1,000 (Masters) and $500 (Second Mate).</PARA>
<PARA>Since 1989 the Master Class 1/2 and Second Mate courses have been available to overseas students on a full fee-paying basis. The fees are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Master - $6,000</PARA>
<PARA> Second Mate - $3,000</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Short Courses</PARA>
<PARA>All mandatory short courses required for the issue of a Masters or Second Mates Certificate are included and costed in the study program and are at no additional cost to the student. Other short courses may be undertaken on a full cost recovery basis.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Recommended Cost of Short Courses</PARA>
<PARA>The College offers a large number of short courses, the cost of which vary according to the type and content of the course, and consumables involved. The average cost of a short course at the College for the last few years has been approximately $300-$500 per student.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Cost of Master and Second Mate Course</PARA>
<PARA>See answer under 3. above. Since 1989 the above courses have been offered as an integrated educational program leading to the award of Advanced Certificate in Marine Operations (2nd Mates) and Diploma of Applied Science (Shipmaster-Master Class 1/2). The mandatory short courses have not been considered as separate entities and have therefore not been costed separately.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Commonwealth Grants</PARA>
<PARA>During the period 1986-88 all overseas students enrolling at the College were sponsored either by AIDAB or through the subsidised student scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>Since 1989 all overseas students enrolling at the College have been admitted as full fee-paying students in accordance with government policy, their fees being met by themselves or through an aid program such as AIDAB.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The information of 5 April 1989 was updated by the present Minister on 7 November 1990 (Hansard, page 3506) in the response to Question No. 177 of 22 August 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> Further to my answer to Question No. 177 of 22 August 1990 to determine what progress has been made to standardise fire-hose couplings it would be necessary to contact every fire service in Australia. I understand that the reason the Australian Assemblies of Fire Authorities has decided not to consider the issue of standardisation further is because there is not agreement between all Australian Fire Brigades that the Storz design is the preferred coupling.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. Government instrumentalities which are significant users of fire hose couplings are the Civil Aviation Authority's Rescue and Fire Fighting Service and the various arms of the Department of Defence. Replies on this matter have previously been given by a former Minister for Transport and Communications (Question No. 230 of 2 December 1980) and a former Minister for Defence (Question No. 229 of 2 December 1980).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. There would be no reduction in Australian Government expenditure if fire-hose couplings were standardised throughout Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) EFIC loans are frequently of a type or to countries that are not provided by commercial financial institutions. EFIC either assumes the risks of loan non-payment on its own account or for exceptionally high risks it can extend loans on the Government's behalf in the ``National Interest''.</PARA>
<PARA> Each proposal is considered against all necessary risk assessment criteria.</PARA>
<PARA> EFIC responds to applications as soon as it has completed its assessment of all risk-related criteria. This can take from one to two days to several months depending upon the competence and standing of the parties to the transaction, the country of the buyer, the complexity of the transaction and how quickly the information required is provided by the parties involved in seeking to establish a loan.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) EFIC loan agreements have been signed within periods ranging from one week to sixteen months after supply contracts have been signed.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The time between the signing of a contract and of the EFIC loan agreement is influenced by several factors, including:</PARA>
<PARA> i. its requirement that the export contract is commercially and legally in a form compatible with the provision of finance;</PARA>
<PARA> ii. the acquisition of all necessary approvals within Australia, in particular in relation to aid funds, where these are used to concessionalise the loan terms. The criteria relating to the approval of aid funds are naturally stringent;</PARA>
<PARA> iii. satisfactory negotiation of the various agreements between all parties to the loan transaction. More than six different organisations may be involved and more than eight different agreements may be required;</PARA>
<PARA> iv. acquisition of all necessary approvals required by the borrower to enter into the loan. In high risk countries this can be a difficult process but one that is essential to protect the interests of EFIC and Government;</PARA>
<PARA> v. the need to assess the technical, commercial and financial capacity of the exporter to undertake and to satisfactorily complete the contract; and</PARA>
<PARA> vi. the need to assess that finance is to be provided within the terms of EFIC's charter and within the terms of Australia's OECD obligations.</PARA>
<PARA> Careful attention is required to all details to minimise the possibility of any problems during the performance of the contract and repayment of the loan.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) EFIC is acutely aware of the importance of providing timely assistance to exporters. Its experience and that of comparable organisations overseas underlines that it is essential to ensure that loans are underwritten prudently.</PARA>
<PARA> The progress of individual transactions depends upon the attitude of all parties to the negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) EFIC charges fees related to risk and to meet all operating expenses. The fees vary according to the loan terms, the borrower's country and the standing of the borrower.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) In 1989-1990 financial year EFIC provided 58 indications or offers of finance support for prospective contracts valued at $1,076 million. In that year 23 loan agreements were signed for $626 million.</PARA>
<PARA> In the current financial year to date EFIC has provided 62 indications or offers of finance support for contracts valued at $1,469 million and has signed 12 loans for $78 million. Loans for over $300 million are currently under negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Throughout the period from July 1989 to the present EFIC has had 8 officers involved on a full time basis in the consideration and negotiation of loan proposals, supported by legal officers as appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Any delay in the processing of a claim for pension can cause frustration for the applicant. There can be many reasons for a delay in processing a claim, including insufficient information provided with the claim, difficulty in verifying the information provided, need for medical examination in invalid pension cases etc.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department has defined acceptable standards for timeliness of processing claims for pension and continually monitors regional offices on their performance. These standards are incorporated into the new Management Information System introduced on 26 March 1991. This system will enable the Department to improve identification of the causes of processing delays.</PARA>

<PARA> Age Pension New Claims-28 days</PARA>
<PARA> Invalid Pension New Claims-56 days</PARA>
<PARA> Widows Pension New Claims-21 days</PARA>
<PARA> Sole Parents Pension-21 days.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) Based on the above information, no.</PARA>
<PARA> In the second and third weeks of January this year the times taken to process age and invalid pension claims beyond the standards mentioned above increased considerably. Delays are usually a short term phenomenon at this time of the year arising from backlogs associated with the Christmas/New Year holidays. Even so, there was a reduction in the proportion of Sole Parent Pension claims processed above the standard time. While the situation for age and invalid pensions improved in February and in the early part of March, a close watch is being kept of processing times in the Nowra Regional Office to ensure that delays are not excessive.</PARA>
