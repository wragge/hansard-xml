<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OG4">Mr LINDSAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I have great pleasure in presenting this report. The report describes the broad evaluation of the National Crime Authority which the Committee has carried out pursuant to its duty under the National Crime Authority Act to monitor and review the performance of the Authority in its functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee commenced the evaluation in July 1990 at a time when the Authority was the subject of much media comment and public criticism, not least in relation to its Adelaide office. The Committee sought submissions from a wide range of individuals and organisations. Fifty-six submissions were received and the Committee held 12 public hearings. Hearings were held in all States except Western Australia. Sixty-four witnesses appeared and 1,730 pages of evidence were taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time since the Authority was set up in 1984, the National Crime Authority gave evidence in public to the Committee. The decision to take public evidence has paid outstanding dividends. It has enabled critics and commentators to put their concerns on the public record. It has also given the National Crime Authority a public forum in which to respond. The basic finding of the evaluation is that the National Crime Authority should continue to exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was put to the Committee at the outset of the evaluation that National Crime Authority secretiveness and limits in the National Crime Authority Act on the Committee's powers would affect the Committee's ability to carry out a thorough evaluation. The open and frank approach taken during the inquiry by the National Crime Authority's Chairman, Justice John Phillips, ensured that this did not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the report recommends amendment of the National Crime Authority Act to clarify the Committee's right to receive information from the National Crime Authority. The report outlines the history of differences between the National Crime Authority and the Committee in previous parliaments. Conflicting legal opinions have been obtained on the extent of the Committee's right to information from the Authority. The Committee considers the issue too important to have to rely on the cooperative attitude of individual National Crime Authority chairmen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the report recommends technical amendments to section 55 of the National Crime Authority Act to clarify what aspects of the Authority's activities the Committee may examine. In addition, it recommends an amendment to the main secrecy provision in the Act, section 51. The amendment will make it clear that the secrecy provision does not prevent the National Crime Authority providing information to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Committee believes that the National Crime Authority Act should be amended to restrict disclosure by the Committee of sensitive information received from the National Crime Authority. Senator Spindler, a member of the Committee, currently has a private senator's Bill before the Senate to amend the National Crime Authority Act. The Bill, among other things, defines information which is `sensitive', and prevents the Committee from disclosing this sensitive information in Parliament or to the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recommends adoption of the Spindler Bill definition of what information is sensitive. The report recommends that the Minister responsible for the National Crime Authority, currently the Attorney-General, should arbitrate if a dispute arises between the Committee and the National Crime Authority over whether a piece of information fits within the definition of `sensitive'. Senator Spindler dissents on this point, preferring a judge to act as arbiter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee considers that it should continue to be the primary means of external scrutiny to ensure that the National Crime Authority does not abuse its special powers. The National Crime Authority Act provides for an Inter-Governmental Committee made up of Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers. This Inter-Governmental Committee has the function under the Act of monitoring generally the work of the Authority. The report demonstrates that the Inter-Governmental Committee has neglected this function. For example, it has met only 16 times since 1984. It has failed to comment on the last three National Crime Authority annual reports, although the National Crime Authority Act specifically provides for it to do so. It does not appear to have provided any strategic direction for the Authority or to have taken action to dispel the criticisms which have surrounded the Authority in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recognises that there needs to be an improvement in the means of resolving complaints from individuals who have been dealt with by the National Crime Authority in an unacceptable manner. I should add, however, that the Committee has received few complaints regarding the Authority. A very small number of complaints have required detailed examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recommends that, to supplement the role of the Committee, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be given jurisdiction to investigate complaints against the Authority, its staff and those seconded to work for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is not aware of any specific complaints that the National Crime Authority has infringed individual privacy in unacceptable ways. Nevertheless, it recognises the validity of the general concerns put to it about the potential for the National Crime Authority to intrude on privacy. The report recommends that privacy guidelines be developed to cover the National Crime Authority's activities in much the same way as guidelines are now being developed to cover the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aura of secretiveness that has surrounded the National Crime Authority's activities has reduced the public perception of the value of the Authority's work. The National Crime Authority Act requires all National Crime Authority investigative hearings to be held in private. Justice Phillips told the Committee that it would assist the Authority to dispel the aura of secretiveness if it could hold some of its investigative hearings in public. The Committee agrees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recommends that the Act be amended to give Authority members a discretion to hold hearings in public. The Committee recognises that there is a risk to innocent reputations if hearings are public. The report recommends that guidelines be developed to ensure fairness to all involved in the hearings and the Committee expects the guidelines to draw on the experience of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption and the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report deals with Justice Phillips's future directions policy. This policy, announced in November 1990, is designed to focus the National Crime Authority's activities in ways appropriate for the 1990s and to overcome some of the criticisms levelled at the Authority in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report generally welcomes Justice Phillips's initiatives. It recommends action to ensure that police forces are adequately resourced to take over investigation of drug related matters that the National Crime Authority is no longer treating as its prime focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes the potential for unnecessary overlap between the National Crime Authority's intelligence activities and those of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the Australian Federal Police. Further, the report recommends continuing review of the intelligence activities of the three bodies to ensure that unnecessary overlap does not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report deals with a number of suggestions for finetuning the current powers and functions of the National Crime Authority, including a proposal to give it a power to bring prosecutions. The report also considers the role of police officers in the Authority, and the need for extension or addition to its existing special statutory powers to obtain evidence. I should mention that the report deals with some aspects of the operation of the National Crime Authority's Adelaide office in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Crime Authority has been through a difficult period since mid-1989. It was subject to consistent criticism in late 1989 and early 1990 because of its perceived excessive secrecy and administrative failings. I stress that the National Crime Authority is the most important agency in the national effort to combat organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a tribute to the particular skills and abilities of Justice Phillips that the Authority is such a dramatically different body to the Authority of a year ago. I and the Committee believe that Justice Phillips deserves great credit for the work he has done since becoming the Chairman of the Authority. The Committee recognises the extent of his achievement and congratulates him on his appointment to the position of Chief Justice of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Committee I thank those who made submissions, who appeared at hearings and otherwise assisted the Committee with its evaluation. In particular, I would like to thank the secretariat of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to concur with the comments of the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), in relation to the work undertaken by the secretarial staff and the number of submissions that were made during our evaluation inquiry. I would also like to pass on congratulations to Justice Phillips on his appointment as Chief Justice of Victoria. This will be a sad loss to the National Crime Authority. In the time I have available I will deal with two issues. The first issue is the question of the Authority's relationship with other law enforcement agencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, the Authority was created to fill a perceived gap in the ability of traditional law enforcement methods to deal with organised crime. It was not, however, meant to replace or duplicate the work of Australian police services. The Authority was never intended to become a ninth police force. Under the NCA Act the Authority was intended to be a national body that would work in close cooperation with other law enforcement bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's report concluded that there was a continuing need and role for the National Crime Authority in Australian law enforcement. The Committee's evaluation, however, considered criticism that the Authority had in the past failed to effectively liaise and cooperate with police services. Particular criticism was directed to the Authority's unwillingness to share intelligence and cooperate with police in the conduct of investigations resulting in overlap and duplication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to report that since November 1990 when Justice Phillips's Future Directions policy was launched it has focused the work of the Authority and taken important steps to improve the Authority's relationship with other law enforcement agencies, particularly police services. The Committee notes that changes were, in part, responses to criticisms levelled at the Authority in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that the Committee was encouraged to note that Future Directions has received widespread support from Australian law enforcement agencies. Successful implementation of Future Directions in the coming years should lead to greatly enhanced cooperation between the Authority and Australian law enforcement agencies and this can only lead to more effective action against organised crime. Notwithstanding its support for the Authority's shift in focus the report makes the following recommendations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.that the re-allocation of resources required by police forces to compensate for the Authority's changed emphasis be given urgent attention.</PARA>
<PARA>The report also considers that greater police involvement in the Authority is needed. The report recommends that consideration be given to appointing a senior police officer, either serving or retired, as a member of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the question of the minority report to the evaluation report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS>. That report is in the name of Senator Crichton-Browne and Senate Vanstone, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), and me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minority report turns on the question of the Operation Ark report and asks the question: which report is the report? It indicates that the issue should be resolved to satisfactorily ascertain which report was in fact the correct version of the Operation Ark report. In the qualifying statement to the Committee's 1990 Operation Ark report the majority report did not address issues to satisfactorily resolve the question of which report was the correct Operation Ark report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal of interest was generated by the tabling of the report and issues surrounding the use of in camera evidence. However, the report has done little to resolve the issue of which report is, in fact, the real Ark report, the matter on which this turns. These issues should be resolved in order for the Committee to fulfil its statutory duties. Some Government members, not the least the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), have criticised incorrectly the authors of the qualifying statement for publishing in camera evidence. The Government's response to the Committee's Operation Ark report, the minority report, endorses this view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues on which this matter turns are the questions of the two reports and the suppression of one of these reports by the incoming National Crime Authority following Mr Justice Stewart's retirement in 1989. The important questions are these: was there a completed report on 30 June 1989 and can an Authority report be duly authorised without a minuted meeting of the persons purporting to be the Authority? The Committee should have sought evidence from the former members of the Authority and the former Chairman, Mr Faris. Thus far this evidence has been denied to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unresolved issues should have been the subject of inquiry during the current evaluation and the Committee should have followed up the qualifying statement. The only exception to this was the hearing which the Committee held with Justice Stewart. The Committee's failure to take sufficient evidence to try to resolve the question of which report was the real Ark report is a clear failure of supervisory duty in relation to the Authority. In the final analysis, the majority's failure in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS> to properly resolve this question of the Ark report is a significant failure to fulfil its statutory role to oversee the Authority, as was originally envisaged in the debates at the time of the Authority's creation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join my colleagues in briefly commenting on the evaluation of the National Crime Authority. In the few seconds available to me I will comment on three issues. I join with my colleagues in complimenting Mr Justice Phillips for the undoubted contribution he has made in lifting the status and the quality of the NCA. We made recommendations at the close of the previous coalition Government for the establishment of such an authority. The recommendations arose out of the Costigan report and the difficulties of maintaining a continued royal commission. I confess that I was disappointed when the Hawke Government was first elected that it decided not to proceed. Later that year, of course, the NCA was constituted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my understanding of the affairs&mdash;I was not on the Committee at that stage&mdash;the Authority had a somewhat chequered history under its earlier Chairman. I think that it was not until Mr Justice Phillips came along that it was apparent that the NCA had the confidence of not only the police authorities around Australia, but also the members of the Inter-Governmental Committee. I believe that Mr Justice Phillips deserves a great deal of credit for that. The fact that there was this contrast highlights very much the difficulty there is now in securing a suitable successor to him. I compliment Mr Justice Phillips on his appointment as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria and wish the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the IGC well in the search for his successor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, it is important that his successor take on board the contrasting administrative styles of Mr Justice Phillips and his predecessors; that he take on board the recommendation that there is an opportunity, as the Chairman of the Committee has said, for some inquiries to be conducted in public; and that he recognise that the role of the NCA is not to replace the present investigatory powers available to individual State police authorities. The Authority is not to operate in such a way that it can be seen as an independent body in its own right, but rather as a cooperative body, working with seconded police staff from each of the States. It must work with the IGC across State borders and in areas where individual police authorities find themselves unable to proceed adequately in investigations. Inevitably, therefore, the character and nature of the Chairman and the stamp he places on the Authority are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second brief reference I want to make is to recommendation 3 with respect to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the role that he might play. There is a difficulty in the role of this Parliamentary Committee. I gather that it really resulted from an amendment moved by former Senator Don Chipp on behalf of the Australian Democrats. It suggested that the nature of an all embracing crime investigatory body was such that there should be some opportunity for parliament to oversee its operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In much the same way as ASIO's operations are examined, it was felt that there needed to be a parliamentary committee examining the operations of the NCA, and this Committee has been constituted. Yet there are areas where, because current operative matters are denied to the Committee, there are inevitably problems in determining whether or not the NCA is operating as it should. It was for that reason that the Committee in its deliberations decided that it might be appropriate for the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, an officer now in place&mdash;one who I would imagine is not overburdened by his task in that respect&mdash;to be given an additional jurisdiction, that is, to investigate complaints involving these operative procedures, matters which are denied to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that the role will be seen as one which can permit reference from the Committee and reporting back to the Committee in areas beyond its capability. I believe that it is a valuable addition to the supervisory function of this Parliament and I commend that recommendation in particular, as I do the others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to compliment the Chairman of the Committee. In particular, I would like to compliment the staff for the work they have undertaken. I assure the Parliament and the people of Australia that the National Crime Authority, under Mr Justice Phillips at least, has certainly been undertaking its task with due diligence and has been exercising a proper overall coordinating role in a way that I think enhances the investigation of crime in our society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and as Chairman of the Defence Sub-committee, I present the Committee's report entitled the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Defence Force Reserves</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in presenting the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Defence Force Reserves</EMPHASIS>. On 17 March 1989 the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) referred for inquiry the issue of the structure and capabilities of the Australian Defence Force reserves. The inquiry attracted a great deal of interest from Australian Defence Force personnel, defence academics and the general public. By the dissolution of the Thirty-fifth Parliament in February 1990, more than 120 submissions had been received and four public hearings held.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of reference were referred to the Committee on 13 June 1990 following its reappointment in the Thirty-sixth Parliament. The Auditor-General's report on the Army Reserve was added later through referral by the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this present Parliament the Committee received a further 130 submissions, totalling 2,500 pages, and conducted nine public hearings, amassing over 1,500 pages of oral evidence. We also travelled extensively to service establishments around Australia to inspect facilities and discuss issues of concern with both reserve and regular members of the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several major events affected this inquiry&mdash;for example, the pilot's strike during the second half of 1989 and the Federal election early in 1990. A further factor was the force structure review undertaken in 1990 and early 1991. The Committee decided to delay finalisation of its proceedings to take account of the review's outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the tabling of the force structure review by the Minister for Defence on 30 May 1991, the Committee sought further submissions and held a final public hearing in Canberra on 26 July 1991 to allow for comment on the impact of the force structure review on the Australian Defence Force reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a protracted and complex inquiry. Indeed, this inquiry has been a mammoth task, involving hundreds of hours of work by members of the Committee and the secretariat. At this point, I acknowledge formally the efforts of my fellow Committee members and Committee staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the Committee's assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of Australian Defence Force Reserve forces. Naval reserves contribute only indirectly to readiness. However, the Committee found that naval reserves were performing their current roles effectively and that the estimated annual cost of some $17m was being applied efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the more than 20 years and $100m spent in its development, an operational Australian Defence Force mine countermeasures capability is still at least many years off. That is bad enough. The force structure review, however, reversed a longstanding policy of employing auxiliary minesweepers manned largely by reserves to complement the mine-hunting capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Army reserves make a major and direct contribution to Australian Defence Force readiness. The operational roles concerned relate mainly to surveillance, protection and logistics. The Committee found that Army reserves provide marginally effective surveillance, ineffective vital asset protection, and an ineffective level of logistic support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broad costs of the Army reserves include equipment worth some $268m with planned near-term acquisitions of about $100m; facilities worth at least $130m; and recurrent funding of half a billion dollars a year. The Committee has no doubt that the military capability being generated currently by the Army Reserve is grossly inefficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ready reserves will be introduced at the expense of one of Army's only three regular brigades&mdash;and essentially without any rigorous consideration of 26,000 general reservists. The force structure review has reduced these reservists to third XI status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of a total of 35,000 personnel in Army's combat forces, some 6,000 regular and 11,500 general reserves are allocated to other than priority roles established by Defence policy. In force structure terms, this equates to seven infantry battalions, or about 30 per cent of all such units in the total Army. Of these, some 40 per cent require 90 days or longer to become operationally ready and some 13 per cent require about a year to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of Army Reserve operational readiness is the weak link in the concept of defence-in-depth. Australian Defence Force ground forces are manifestly unable to secure the bases required for deployed maritime forces. I stress that this is not a reflection on the energy or dedication of reservists themselves but a reflection of major deficiencies in Reserve policy development, equipment and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Air Force reservists contribute only indirectly to the performance of many operational roles at an estimated annual cost of some $12m. This is cost effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Australian Air Force's most serious operational weaknesses are its low aircraft-to-aircrew ratio and the relatively few technical and other personnel to support operations at forward deployment airfields. The Air Force plan to introduce reserves as airfield defence guards is sound and will now be enabled by the Ready Reserve program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No serious attempt has been made to extend Royal Australian Air Force operational effectiveness by widening the application of integrated Regular-Reserve force elements. We believe that Air Force should introduce an integrated structure in at least five or six operation squadrons employing a mixture of Reserve and permanent air and ground personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee came to the firm conclusion that a corporate planning approach is the only way that Reserve force development will be achieved comprehensively and effectively, and recommends that the Department of Defence develop a corporate plan for the development of the Australian Defence Force Reserve forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plan should address, among other things, the introduction of an mine countermeasure operational minesweeping capability into the naval Reserve at an equipment cost of about $20m, to be offset against the planned replacement of five Reserve patrol boats by fleet support vessels; the restructure of Army's manoeuvre and follow-on forces, so that the available Regular and Reserve force structure can be applied to priority capability requirements; and the introduction into Air Force of integrated operational squadrons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that additional resources be programmed as follows: an estimated $100m for each of the seven general Reserve infantry brigades to equip them fully; in the order of $2m in the short term, rising to $50m a year after 10 years, for Army general Reserve operating costs; and an estimated total of $50m over 10 years to acquire unit equipment for the three Reserve airfield defence guard squadrons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee concluded that the Auditor-General's report on the Army Reserve is a very valuable document both in its own right and for the impetus and guidance provided to the processes of calculating and attributing the costs of Australian Defence Force activities. The past record of policy development and implementation for reserves has been anything but satisfactory. Transparency and regular review should be features of the long term implementation process. The Committee recommends, therefore, that the Department of Defence publish a reserves corporate plan by the end of 1992 and thereafter report annually to the Parliament on the extent to which key milestones have been met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the way ahead for reserves must accommodate uncertain strategic circumstances, severe financial constraints and even increased attention to the structural concerns of productivity, effectiveness and efficiency. However, the Committee considers that the planning environment over the next 10 years or so does not represent the major problems facing Australian Defence Force Reserve forces. As this report so clearly shows, the central challenge is to redress the failure of the force development process to adjust the military capability of reserves in response to evolving Australian strategic thinking and the Government's defence policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat my thanks to the Defence Subcommittee members, the staff and everyone associated with the preparation of this important report.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say a few words about the report. This investigation has been going on for a considerable time. It started in 1989. A number of submissions, and investigation through public meetings and visits to establishments, really do make this an extremely well-considered document. It will be an extraordinarily useful document to those who have an interest in defence, and defence reserves in particular, because the scope of the report takes in the historical background and makes some very practical recommendations as to what should be done in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was extraordinarily disappointed in the performance of the Government over the last few years in relation to the reserves because I believe that the present Reserve structure has been absolutely starved of funds over the last few years. It is a tribute to the dedication of those members of the Reserve that they have maintained the interest that they have displayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one talks to the commanders of Reserve organisations one finds that training days are way down, that equipment is in scarce supply and that the opportunities to effectively develop their capabilities are really being denied, and have been denied for a long period of time, by this present Government. I personally found it very disquieting that the Government made major announcements as to changes in the Reserve structure whilst the Committee was in the course of its investigations. I would have thought it prudent for any government to have waited whilst this major investigation was being undertaken to see what recommendations were made by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as if the Committee is an inconsequential one. It is not as if the members of the Committee have had no experience in the area. It is not as if the Committee has a history of making wild recommendations. It is rather the reverse. The work of this Committee is really one of the major achievements of the Parliament, and the reports of the Committee and of its subcommittees have been a feature in their depth of analysis and in the sound and practical recommendations they have made. This report is no exception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it very disappointing that the Government made major decisions affecting the reserves prior to the completion of this report by the Committee. If the Government had waited&mdash;and I do not believe there was the degree of urgency that it exhibited&mdash;it could have made more resources available to the already existing reserves and, secondly, I think it would have benefited from the consideration that the Committee gave in depth to this most important subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly endorse the views contained in the Committee's report. One of its features was that the weight of evidence was so compelling that people who had very differing views at the start of the process were forced by the weight of logic to come up with this agreed document and the recommendations that it contains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve forces are an extraordinarily important part of the Australian defence structure. I believe they have been poorly served by this Government. The Ready Reserve concept is hasty and has not been well thought through, and if one reads the report, and particularly the submissions to the Committee in relation to the Ready Reserve concept, one will find a concerted, sustained and well thought through criticism of the way in which the Ready Reserve concept has been brought into place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will not, in my view, serve the best interests of an adequate and balanced approach to force structure, and I would recommend to all who are interested in the defence area, and particularly in the Reserve aspect of the Defence Force structure, that they take this report and read it very closely indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add my contribution to the debate on the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Defence Force Reserve. </EMPHASIS>I compliment, firstly, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman and, secondly, the staff&mdash;in particular, Air Commodore Ian Westmore, who did an admirable job, in my view, in reviewing some of the earlier work and in the scripting of much of the report as it is finally drafted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three things I wish to say on the substance of the report. The first is that quite obviously there are enormous difficulties in maintaining adequately equipped personnel in the reserves and generally in the Australian Defence Force. In particular, I would like to draw the attention of the responsible Minister to recommendation 11, which talks about shortfalls in equipment within the ARes and makes suggestions upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter relates very much to the same thing: the difficulties there are in trying to ensure that part time reservists are in fact able to adequately serve the number of days required to meet their role and readiness requirements; and that is covered in recommendation 10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More fundamentally, the problem is that the Government has set up a Ready Reserve which, on all the criteria that we have examined, really does not meet the task. The twelve months period of training followed by subsequent service does not really provide the balance necessary if we take into account the existing regular force on the one hand and the existing reserve force on the other hand. While there is no doubt that in the Air Force and in the Royal Australian Navy perhaps those ready reserves may have a role, in my view in the Army they are really not going to fit happily into the blend of other forces. The substantive recommendation that has come through from this report takes account of the strategic assessments that have been made and the consequence of Dibb's report and the White Paper that followed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have looked at where the defence needs of this nation should be placed. We have concluded that the Ready Reserve, as now structured, will use excessive resources, both financial and otherwise, of the regulars and the reserves. It is likely that it will need to be very significantly reviewed. In the last few weeks we have had the absolutely appalling disaster in Timor. Inevitably, in events of that kind one tends to look at the implications with respect to units of one's own forces and to wonder what would happen if there were to be some added strategic requirement in our region, whether it is in respect of existing circumstances or those not foreseen&mdash;and it was in that respect that I referred to Timor. We do not know what is going to happen and what pressures will be placed on us. As I see the Ready Reserve it will not be able to meet the strategic task in the way that I believe an upgrading of the existing part time reservists would have permitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned that the Government has committed itself and so many of its human and material resources within the Australian Defence Force to establishing, at least as far as the Army is concerned, something that will dominate its thinking&mdash;all at the price of the elimination of a permanent unit that was so badly needed. I feel very strongly about this; the report has addressed some of these problems and I trust that the Government might examine them. I think that the existing reserves have an important role. If I have a reservation about the report, it is that perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on vital asset protection. It is a difficult area. It is an important area. Yet, as we have concluded, vital asset protection is one way by which we can give the reserves a distinctive role without derogating in any way from the other responsibility which the reserves have traditionally exercised since the report under Tom Millar recommended that they be integrated within the total Australian Army. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is an excellent one. It is a good analysis of a difficult situation. I trust that those within the Government will implement our recommendations because I think that if they were to be followed many of the problems that I foresee as a result of the creation of the Ready Reserve would be eliminated. I compliment the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman, Air Commodore Ian Westmore, and the staff, who I think have been excellent in the services they have provided to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Few involved in corporate Australia during the 1980s can look back on that period with a sense of pride. While the vast majority of company officers are honest and concerned with the best interests of their shareholders, a high profile minority has given Australia's corporate reputation a collective black eye. It was against the background of the excesses of the late 1980s that the Committee commenced this inquiry late in the life of the last Parliament. Interrupted by the dissolution of Parliament and the 1990 election, the inquiry did not begin in earnest until June of last year. The Committee's approach has not been to seek scapegoats for the failures in corporate behaviour and regulations, rather to identify deficiencies in the regulatory landscape and to suggest mechanisms to empower market participants, particularly investors, in enforcing their rights and responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last 12 months have witnessed many reforms to the corporate regulatory framework. Foremost is the national companies scheme and the establishment of a single regulator in the form of the ASC. The ASC has at its disposal far more adequate levels of funding than were provided by the States and the Commonwealth under the cooperative scheme. The Committee views both the establishment of the national system and the provision of adequate resources to the ASC as the two single major changes that could have been made to safeguard the fair operation of the stock market. Also of considerable importance has been the process of debate that has occurred within the various players in the operation and regulation of corporate Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Stock Exchange, the accounting profession and institutional investors, amongst others, have all undertaken a vigorous examination of the role they have played in the 1980s and the appropriate measures that should be adopted to ensure the abuses do not recur. The Committee believes that it has played a role in prompting and facilitating that process of debate. Self-regulation and self-help are themes which the Committee has broadly endorsed not only in this inquiry but in its earlier study on insider trading. Consistent with that approach, the Committee reviewed the operation of the corporations law specifically in the fields of market manipulation and the rights of shareholders in relation to the management of their companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that, generally speaking, the failure of the regulatory system to cope with the abuses of the 1980s did not result from deficiencies in the substantiative law but rather was linked to poor enforcement by a flawed regulatory system and under-resourced regulators. Hence the Committee does not recommend more than some quite specific changes to the corporations law. The recommendations rather focus on the role of the Australian Stock Exchange, its relationship with the Australian Securities Commission, the issue of disclosure, and mechanisms to help shareholders enforce their existing rights more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Australian Stock Exchange, the Committee was impressed by what it considered to be a genuine attempt by the industry to lift its game. To this end the Committee recommends that the ASX adequately fund its detection, surveillance and enforcement division, which can play a valuable role in conjunction with the ASC in detecting market malpractices. Further, the Committee wishes to see develop a greater level of cooperation between the ASX and the ASC in the enforcing of the exchange's listing rules. This would involve the sharing of information and the use by the ASC of investigatory powers to assist the ASX in determining whether a breach of listing rules has occurred or is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also recommends that the Australian Stock Exchange proceed with its proposal to reform the listing rules to ensure a greater level of disclosure of material transactions; secondly, that its rules be drafted by those versed in statutory drafting to ensure clear interpretation and enforcement by the courts; thirdly, that directors be under an obligation to procure compliance by their companies of the listing rules. Failure to do so can be enforced by the courts and be subject to penalty. Finally, we suggest that the ASX be given the right to institute proceedings under the corporations law to have its rules complied with without first having to give undertakings as to damages. The Committee accepts that the stock exchange is not a regulator as such, but the Committee believes that the listing rules can provide protection to investors and that the ASX, in cooperation with the ASC, should play an enhanced role in seeing that the listing rules are complied with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 4 of the Committee's report canvasses the vital issue of disclosure. It is through the disclosure in the form of accounts and the release of relevant information that shareholders and the market generally are able to make informed judgment about a company's performance and, in particular, the performance of directors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee took a great deal of evidence about misleading reporting and the perceived failure of the audit process. There is no doubt that false and misleading reports were a major tool used by fraudulent company officers. There have been significant reforms in this area, including the long overdue adoption of a consolidated group account standard and the amendment of the corporations law to ensure that companies present all accounts in accordance with approved accounting standards, rather than relying on the more nebulous true and fair rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The auditing process was examined by the Committee and several recommendations were made to complement the work already being undertaken by the profession and the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board. These recommendations include:  firstly, that the Australian Auditing Standards Board enjoy similar recognition to that currently enjoyed by the Accounting Standards Board and that it contain within its make-up a unit to monitor compliance with auditing standards; secondly, that auditors be required to notify the ASC of malpractice when an auditor has reasonable grounds to suspect that malpractice has occurred; and thirdly, that the ASC be given the ability to approach a court to seek an order to have a court appointed auditor on occasions where there is clear evidence that proper auditing standards have been breached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Companies and Securities Advisory Committee has released a discussion paper on continuous disclosure. The Committee favours the introduction of a system of continuous disclosure, but it is reluctant to see excessive regulatory burdens imposed through legislation. The Committee contends that the ASX listing rules, if remodelled as canvassed earlier, can provide a mechanism for ensuring disclosure. In this way, a regime as extensive as that foreshadowed by CSAC can be introduced but via a system which is more flexible and responsive than legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 5 of the report looks at the role of shareholders in regard to the management of their companies. Traditionally, shareholders have been excluded from the day to day involvement in management decisions. The Committee has considered various proposals that were submitted to it to strengthen the law with regard to directors' duties. In this area we support the introduction of a business judgment rule and measures to regulate situations where directors can seek authorisation or ratification of possible breaches of their duties. We have also adopted and supported measures, such as audit committees, to improve communications between management and those dependent on their decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to remedies available to shareholders, a great deal of attention was paid by the Committee to the old rule in the case of Foss v. Harbottle. Basically, that rule states that a company is the proper plaintiff in actions involving the company and that a shareholder as such cannot question the internal management decisions of a company. In Canada there has been for some time, notably in the province of Ontario, a procedure whereby shareholders and other proper plaintiffs can apply for leave to proceed in the name of the company to pursue a wrong against the company. The procedure avoids the complexity of the rule in Foss v. Harbottle. A feature of the procedure available in Canada is that in appropriate circumstances the court can order that a person given leave to proceed can be indemnified out of the company's resources to mount the action. The availability of such a procedure would overcome one of the principal inhibitions that have stopped individual shareholders asserting their legal rights against directors, namely, that they are required to finance the entire action from their own resources against defendants who often have access to the resources of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee does not offer this proposal lightly. It is aware that it could be subject to abuses if not properly controlled. However, it is reinforced in its confidence that such a measure can be safely introduced by the fact that it has been available in Ontario and other parts of Canada for over 20 years. The proposal has been thoroughly examined by the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee and was recommended by it, and it was supported before the Committee by the Australian Securities Commission and the legal profession, as represented by the Law Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have qualified our recommendations in relation to the derivative action concerns of who would have automatic standing to apply for leave. We have also suggested a range of mechanisms to safeguard the operation of the action, including involving the court in an effective case management role and also to ensure that directors are safeguarded as well. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

This brings to an end the role of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for the current period in the business law area. This is the last of the trifecta of reports. The first was the report on mergers, monopolies and takeovers some years ago, the next was the insider trading report, and this report on the rights of shareholders is the last.

The work of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has culminated in this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Corporate practices and the rights of shareholders</EMPHASIS>. To the Chairman I say thank you.</PARA></TALK.START>

Particularly in relation to this report, I say thanks to Donald Nairn and Anne Hazelton for their work and that of the supporting staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to canvass the issues, because the shadow Minister for corporate law reform, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), wishes to speak, as does the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), if time permits. Both were actively involved in this detailed report, and I say thank you to both of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one point I would make. To allow the market to operate freely, there is always a balance to be struck in this area of the law between the public interest and the protection of shareholders and their rights. The bias and the direction of this report is to ask the industry itself to take it more seriously and to be far more active in its own surveillance and peer review, whether it be with auditors of the ASX or whatever. It is far preferable for the law to be focused in the direction of the markets in that way rather than to provide greater resources and greater levels of intrusive law for more regulation. In my view, over the years that I have been working in this area the regulators have been experts at putting cases for wanting to have more and more law. I think that needs to be resisted, and the best way it can be resisted is for the industry itself to be far more active in self-regulation and peer review. That is the bias that is evident in all the reports that we have produced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that the Government has embraced some of the things we have said in the insider trading report&mdash;indeed, nearly all of it&mdash;and much of what we said in the mergers, monopolies and takeovers inquiry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) indicated in a speech outside the Parliament that he felt that committees were indeed important.

I say thank you to Mr Greg Bateman, an outside consultant whom we engaged to help with this difficult report. That is an example of how a committee's role can be enhanced. I say thank you to all involved and as Deputy Chairman, and as one who probably will not be on the Committee for much longer, I can say that I have enjoyed my time on this particular endeavour. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that every time there is a boom in the Australian business cycle and a boom on the Australian stock market that turns to bust, there is a parliamentary inquiry of some kind or another to try to look at the law to see whether we can prevent the next boom and bust cycle from occurring. This report really comes out of the consequences of the crash of October 1987 and the failure of numbers of business corporations. We sat down, as the Rae committee did after the Poseidon boom, and looked at the law to see what went wrong and to try to improve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the temptations is to look at the current law and at how it failed and then try to add a few sections here or a few chapters to an Act there, saying that we have now tidied it up and it will not happen again. The reason I say that it could be a failing is that in every boom and bust there is a collective mentality that takes over; there are new ways of doing things. For every section that is introduced, five ways of getting around it are found, and sometimes we make the law so complicated that nobody knows what it is and as a result do not observe it in any event. The provisions which were introduced for regulating companies buying back their shares is an example of that. In this report we have borne that in mind and tried to steer away from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the ongoing themes of this report is how much corporate regulation should be exclusively carried by the Australian Securities Commission and how much by the Australian Stock Exchange. I think there has been a bias on the part of the Committee, and it is my bias, that wherever possible we should look to almost self-regulation through the Australian Stock Exchange&mdash;empowering it to take proceedings in court, without having to give undertakings as to damages, to enforce listing rules, empowering it to enforce continuous disclosure and empowering it to operate market surveillance. All the members of the Committee were very impressed when they went to Sydney and saw the facilities for market surveillance that the Australian Stock Exchange now has in place. I think the surveillance system of the s<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>tock exchange is probably the best chance to detect rigged market practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In this report we have also picked up a number of ideas which have been around for some time&mdash;for example, the business judgment rule, which was mentioned by the Chairman. I think that was first recommended by the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee, the CSLRC, which was chaired by Professor Ford, in its report No. 10. Now that many of the crooks have been chased out of the boardroom, it is time to encourage good people to come back in. We need to have a sensible situation so that good people are not scared off being company directors by liabilities that can put all of their personal worth at risk, even for failed business judgments. That is why I think that recommendation is right and good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I underline that a lot of good work was done by the CSLRC in its final days. We have picked up on that good work in relation to the statutory derivative action, which came out of report No. 12. It has been convenient to say that everything that went before the Australian Securities Commission was wrong and bad and that nothing good ever came out of it, but I think in the final days a lot of good did come out of the CSLRC. I hope that by picking up those recommendations and advancing them we can bring some of those good ideas to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rose to speak because I entered as a reservation some comments in relation to the statutory derivative action. The Chairman has outlined how that recommendation would work. The recommendation empowers shareholders, directors, former shareholders and former directors to bring a statutory derivative action. I have a reservation about that, and it is set out at the end of the report. That is not to say that I cannot be convinced that former shareholders and former directors should be able to bring actions. On the material and the argument we heard I was not convinced, but if somebody could think of a reason why it is necessary I would be happy to come on board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern was that, by empowering former shareholders and former directors to bring such actions, people who had no connection with the wrong that was being taken up in the company's name and who possibly had no interest in the outcome of the action would be bringing actions in the company's name. I think it is important that, when it comes to allowing the derivative action, the court should assess who is the most appropriate person to bring the corporation's right of action. It may be that a former shareholder who was not there at the time the wrong was committed and has no interest in the outcome is not the right person to enforce the corporation's right of action. If provision is made for the court to take that into account, as I have said in the reservation, I have no difficulty; but I think to widen the class and not make any specific proposal as to how that can be taken into account is too bald and too wide<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> on the basis of the evidence that came before the Committee. That is why we entered that reservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the Government does work through the recommendations that are made in this report. There are a lot of good and very sensible recommendations. I think they would improve the standard of corporate law in this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to place on record that this was one of the most fascinating visits that I have had in my parliamentary experience&mdash;a visit to the world's largest democracy, a land of many contrasts and certainly a land of exotic culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 850 million people living in India and growing at a rate equivalent to Australia's population each year. It is certainly a land of extreme contrasts&mdash;from the very poor through to the very wealthy. There are thousands upon thousands of homeless people in New Delhi and there is a lack of infrastructure within that city. Things that we normally take for granted, such as water, sewerage, basic housing, drainage and electricity, are lacking in some areas. However, since the green revolution in primary industry in that nation, it has added to its sustainability of agricultural production;  in fact, the Indian people are now largely self-sufficient in food production, and this is having a tremendous impact on the country of India. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was an excellent conference with 216 delegates attending from Commonwealth countries. The interchange of ideas amongst participating Commonwealth parliamentary delegates, as always, was very enlightening and very fruitful. The Australian delegates played a major role in the conference and, in fact, there were Australian speakers, Australian delegates at every plenary session and several panel sessions. Senator Margaret Reid, one of my colleagues, contributed to the plenary session on violence against women and children; Dr Theophanous participated in the first, second and third plenary sessions and in panel aid discussions; I had the privilege of participating in the panel session on `what Commonwealth parliaments can do in furthering food production marketing and consumption'; and Dr Catley was a panellist in the session on `the role of the press in a democracy'. </PARA>

<PARA>The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be known as UNCED or Earth Summit 92, will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 1 June to 12 June next year. UNCED is expected to be the largest gathering of heads of state and government ever to consider environment and development issues, and about 30,000 delegates will attend. The conference is a bold attempt to have the nations of the world find a common basis for action to protect the future of our planet. It seeks to lay the foundations for a global partnership between developed and developing countries to secure for all people a more equitable and sustainable future. Recognising that the issues of environment and development are often juxtaposed in a very confrontationist way, the Brazil conference aims to put environmental protection and sustainable development at the centre of the decision making processes of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last five or so years have seen much debate about the concept of sustainable development. The concept was first introduced in a comprehensive manner by the World Commission on Environment and Development in the now well known Brundtland report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our Common Future</EMPHASIS>. It defines sustainable development as development which:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</PARA>
<PARA>Governments around the world have been grappling with this concept and trying to create policies which reflect its meaning. The Australian Government has been very active in developing policies to ensure that what we call ecologically sustainable development practices are followed. However, many of the environmental problems of today are global and can be addressed only in forums with representation from around the world. That is what UNCED is for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next year's Earth Summit will provide our global community with the greatest opportunity yet to give practical application to the concept of ecologically sustainable development in the decision making of developed and developing countries. Key issues which the conference will address include protection of the atmosphere, that is, climate change, depletion of the ozone layer and so on; protection of land resources, including combating deforestation, soil loss, desertification and drought; protection of freshwater resources; protection of oceans, seas and coastal areas, and the rational use and development of their living resources; environmentally sound management of biotechnology and hazardous waste, including toxic chemicals; prevention of illegal traffic in toxic products and wastes; improvement in the quality of life and human health; and improvement in living and working conditions of the poor by eradicating poverty while stopping environmental degradation. I hope it will also find a way of tackling the problems created by extraordinary growth in world population whilst remaining sensitive to the economic demands of the poor in developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference is expected to produce an Earth Charter, which will provide basic principles for the sustainable economic and environmental behaviour of peoples and nations; Agenda 21, a blueprint for action in all major areas affecting the relationship between the environment and the economy into the twenty-first century; and conventions on climate change and biodiversity. It is also expected to formulate institutional mechanisms to implement the outcomes of UNCED. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the motion I have moved today urges all members of this Parliament&mdash;this House in particular&mdash;to actively support Australia's role in the lead-up processes. On issues such as these, Australia has often been able to take the lead and galvanise opinion at both a regional and an international level. The recent decision on Antarctica is an excellent example of just how important Australia's role can be in terms of changing international opinion on environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the success of UNCED really does depend ultimately on all nations cooperating and being committed to implementing policies which may seem domestically very difficult to achieve but which contribute to global well-being. Possible outcomes for a convention on climate change are but one example where such commitments are needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure all honourable members recall the intense debate when Australia adopted the interim Toronto target of a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2005.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our House of Representatives Standing Committee is involved here. We are undertaking an inquiry. Recognising that the biological diversity advisory committee is drawing together specialist information in developing that national strategy for the maintenance of biological diversity, our Committee is inquiring into the extent to which Commonwealth assisted community based projects contribute, either directly or perhaps incidentally, to the protection of biological diversity and the maintenance of ecological processes and systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, many members of this Parliament are members of a group called Parliamentarians for Global Action. This is a worldwide group, not of government representatives but of representatives from many different parties in many parliaments and legislatures throughout the world. The House would be interested to know that the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), formerly on the executive of PGA, is a member of my House of Representatives Committee. His place on the executive has now been taken by Senator Reynolds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As its name suggests, PGA is concerned with issues of global significance. In recent years it has put much effort into attempting to raise awareness amongst parliamentarians of the need for substantial policy shifts if we are to combat the global warming problem. It is also involved in preparatory work for the Earth Summit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great strengths of PGA&mdash;and the main reason why it is so well placed to contribute to some of the preparatory work for UNCED&mdash;is that its members come from many parliaments in many different countries. Importantly, both developed and developing nations have active representation in PGA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of this fact is very simple. It is highly unlikely that developing countries will accept any propositions arising out of UNCED which place the major burden of policy change on them, without there being a significant shift in the thinking of developed nations as to their environmental, economic and development assistance priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The global distribution of wealth is therefore an important issue which has to be addressed. The example which is most commonly given to illustrate these problems is that of the ongoing destruction of the Amazon rainforests. Removal of tree cover to the extent that has occurred in these forests over the last 100 years has been shown to influence global climate patterns, and ultimately will contribute to the global warming problem. As Brazil attempts to meet its huge debt repayments to the World Bank, it sees its natural resources as a readily accessible form of wealth, easily converted into foreign currency to repay these debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recognition of these problems has been around for many years; it is very evident in our region in South East Asia. But proposals which could comprehensively solve the problem have not been forthcoming. That is what UNCED has to face up to. It has to help developing nations and undeveloped nations to come together. If it can achieve only that&mdash;this is the obvious source of great disagreement at UNCED&mdash;it will be an enormous success and more than meet its objectives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am not a member of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, which the honourable member for Phillip referred to, I am sure all in this House support the intent of the motion. It is important that we make sure that we do not just indulge in pious and nice thoughts, but that we actually look at some substantive action. During my contribution this morning, I will make a few comments along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agenda of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, of course, deals with three major areas: conventions, the Earth Charter and the action plan or Agenda 21. The conventions are the global climate change convention and the biodiversity convention. They are actually being negotiated separately from the UNCED proper, but they will be signed or, as I understand it, agreed to at the conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Earth Charter is there to set up the basic principles for the conduct of peoples and of nations towards each other and the Earth to ensure a sustainable common future. The action plan, Agenda 21, is to provide an agenda and concrete measures for the implementation of the Earth Charter principles through an agreed international work program in the period leading into the twenty-first century. In a sense, that is almost the most important part. We can talk all we like but, if we do not have some committed plans for action, we will get nowhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told by the then acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett), in a press release on 23 October, that the UN conference to be held next year in Brazil would be the largest gathering of heads of government and senior Ministers in recent history. That is an indication of the significance of this conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's Ambassador for the Environment, Sir Ninian Stephen, led Australia's delegation to the preparatory meeting, which was attended by representatives of 160 countries and 300 non-government organisations. We are talking about getting a very large scale movement under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to note that at the outset Sir Ninian Stephen highlighted the need for a very realistic approach. He said that the concern of developing countries, their fight to overcome poverty and achieve economic growth, should not be compromised by anxiety to protect the environment. Looking after those countries economically will be important, as will encouraging them to do the right thing environmentally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Developing countries want to ensure that any limit on their development efforts is balanced by enhanced aid, and the transfer on concessional terms of relevant environment friendly technology. Those seeking to strengthen the international legal regime have to take note of those arguments. It may well be that the most appropriate response in some cases is political and economic rather than legal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were reminded just last month that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced at the recent Harare CHOGM that he intended to attend UNCED in Brazil next year. I hope he will go through with that because it will be an important meeting. For example, President Bush from the United States and Prime Minister Major from the United Kingdom have indicated that they will attend. It is important that we be represented at the highest level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Prime Minister, if he goes, to concentrate on getting some results and not just a lot of talk. I say this in the best possible spirit, but I do have to say that the Prime Minister unfortunately has a record of sometimes trying to politicise the environmental debate in this country. He really does need to concentrate on substance and not theatre. We do not need lots of big statements; we need some actual implementations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the Government is seeking bipartisan support for the conference in Brazil. I know the coalition welcomes the approach of a bipartisan attitude to that conference. In fact, we would like to see Australia send a bipartisan delegation. The shadow Minister for the environment, my friend and colleague the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), who is at the table at the moment, wrote to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) on 4 October to offer that suggestion. If the honourable member for Phillip and her colleagues can encourage the Minister to respond in a positive sense, because she has not responded as yet, we would obviously be most encouraged and pleased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a test of perhaps how serious the Government is. If it really wants to be bipartisan, it needs to allow for full participation. This would be a test of the Government's bona fides. There are, of course, precedents for this. We have bipartisan representation at the ILO and at many other international conferences. Just last month I was in Tonga at the South Pacific Commission conference with members of the Government as a bipartisan delegation. I think this is necessary if we are to project ourselves adequately outside this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference outcomes will be long term. Thus, we do need both sides of politics involved to ensure that there is continuity on an ongoing basis. Whoever is in government needs to progress those outcomes in a consistent way. In Australia we have sometimes had difficulties in terms of implementing environmental policies, particularly in that environmental and biodiversity area, because we have this Federal-State relationship under which we often seem to be at war. Rather than indulging in productive issues, we actually fight each other. We need cooperation between the Federal and State governments because we do not have the time and we cannot afford the cost of the legal battles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to talk and we need complementary legislation. We all know that the air does not change when we get to the border between Victoria and New South Wales. It is a national thing. We all know that the air does not change when we get to the border between New South Wales and Queensland, though perhaps some of us from outside Queensland might have a slightly different view. We all know that land degradation in this country is an important national issue and we are all committed to ozone protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important, not only here but overseas, to make sure we get the economics right. A sound economy, a strong economy, means that one can have strong environmental policies. A weak economy invariably means that countries have weak environmental policies. One can look at Russia and eastern Europe. Eastern Europe economically is a wasteland; environmentally it is an absolute disaster. Even in Brazil, where the conference will be held, trees are being cut down&mdash;purely because there is the economic need&mdash;and that is causing a lot of environmental problems. It is hard to be an environmentalist when one is sick and starving. Many of the countries causing environmental problems are poor, so the developed world must help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that recently Japan suggested it will contribute $15 billion to aid some of the underdeveloped countries along the path of development so they will not have to indulge in a lot of these environmentally damaging practices. That is to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia in itself is a relatively minor polluter. That is not to say we are clean, but in percentage terms&mdash;in terms of the whole world situation&mdash;we are a relatively minor polluter. It means also that whatever we do here, however right we get it, our impact in global terms will be small. That is why perhaps some of our most effective action is not necessarily what we actually do here, but the impact we can have in international forums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have good skills in Australia in the environmental sciences area, so we can help our smaller neighbours. We can contribute to international research. The diversity in our own huge country means that we actually have a tremendous width and range of environments in which we can develop skills and knowledge that we can pass on to others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to sum up, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil in June next year will be a very critically important conference for all of us. When I say all of us, I do not just mean in Australia&mdash;I mean for everyone across the world. The Prime Minister should go and should concentrate on results. I think it is important that we do not make it a political football. For the sake of all of us, let us make it a bipartisan approach, let us have the Opposition in the delegation and let us make sure, therefore, that we get some continuity and agreed action that can then be implemented on an ongoing basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must remember not to dictate to the Third World. We must offer it some real help so it can do the right thing as we would perceive it. Australia should become a strong player, not only at the conference but in the work prior to it and in the subsequent action plan coming out of that conference. I commend the honourable member for Phillip. I support her wholeheartedly, and I urge the House to support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) for working so hard to have this motion put before the House. I note also that she wants the Parliament itself to take a part in the formation of the ideas and processes leading up to UNCED. Also, we should congratulate Sir Ninian Stephen, Australia's Ambassador on the Environment, for his work in preparation for UNCED.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pick up a particular theme that will be most important at UNCED. Australia understands that UNCED seeks to achieve the effective integration of economic and environmental considerations. One of the most important issues here is how we price our resources. Two of the most important principles concerning resource pricing are polluter pays, that is, those who generate or benefit from pollution and waste should bear the cost; and user pays, that is, the users of goods and services should pay prices based on the full life cycle costs of providing the goods and services, including the use of natural resources, including the global commons, and the ultimate disposal of any wastes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the sense that all parties in this Parliament ought to share those views, I want to take up the point whereby currently the Opposition has a view that it should drop the price of petrol in this country by means of taking off some excise tax. Irrespective of debate about whether that will be achieved, I want to make the point that if we do drop the price of a resource, we run the risk of, firstly, making sure that that resource is used inefficiently, so it is not necessarily economically a smart thing to do; and, secondly, overusing that resource so it is not environmentally particularly satisfactory either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to work together in developing an Australian position for UNCED, we ought to be careful about how we price things like petrol in this country so we ensure that we get the best&mdash;that is, the most efficient&mdash;use of the resource for economic purposes. That does not mean to say we have a cheaper resource. The two oil crises of the early 1970s and the early 1980s, which put up the price of oil and, by translation, petrol, around the world, translated into a more efficient use of oil products, especially in countries like Japan which is heavily oil dependent. Japan realised that, if the price of oil stayed high, it had to use less of it in its productive processes. So it worked for the more efficient and effective use of oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it was an economically sensible thing to do, the spin-off of using less oil for a given amount of production is that it is an environmentally sensible thing to achieve&mdash;that is, there is less pollution generated because of the consequence of the higher oil price. I do not say that we should deliberately go out and jack up the price of all carbon products. I know that is an extremely complicated debate which we will have to enter into at some stage or another. But to actually drop the price of a resource will not bring a more efficient use of the resource. It will almost certainly lead to an overuse of the resource and, therefore, greater pollution for a given amount of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Opposition to reconsider its idea of lowering the price of petrol in this country because it does not sit well with our views in UNCED, where we want to consider resource pricing under the principles of polluter pays and user pays. I urge the Opposition that at least leaving the price of petrol or in time lifting it, so that we might use it more cautiously and effectively and sensibly, will be economically smart as well as environmentally smart. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) and to confirm the bipartisan support for Australia's participation in this conference. I would like to say to the House and to the honourable member for Phillip, who has brought this forward, that the Opposition is not declaring this position for the first time and that it is not merely because she has brought this useful motion forward that leads us to make that declaration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, on 14 September I addressed a United Nations Association conference here in Canberra and issued a statement pursuant to that paper in which I indicated that the Opposition would welcome a bipartisan approach to this most important conference. I give that assurance to the House. I hope that the bipartisan approach we seek and the support we offer for this conference will see a reciprocal response from the Government and a preparedness to involve the Opposition in something which, I think, should be beyond party politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) has already made the point that the Opposition has sought representation at the international conference, and we believe that that would confirm the broad support within this country for sensible environmental programs on a worldwide basis. In making that request of the Government, I pointed out to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) that there has been bipartisan support for many significant environmental objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a competitive political situation: politics in Australia, like the legal system in Australia, is based on adversarial presentations. But the fact of the matter is that on very significant and particularly significant international environment issues there has been a high degree of bipartisanship. For example, it was in fact the Opposition which in 1989 adopted the principle of having targets for Australia for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. We welcome the fact that in December 1990 the Government adopted targets which were very similar to those of the Opposition. I think, in fairness, the Government in turn qualified its targets but in a way which, the Opposition publicly conceded, was a sensible meeting of the concerns about the economic impact on Australia and the great uncertainties that exist in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we actually get down to it there is a high degree of bipartisanship, as there was with another great and important international initiative with respect to ozone depleting substances. I think this reflects the politicians' response to the broad community concerns that these issues should be tackled as a matter of substance. I hope that we will be able to maintain a broadly bipartisan approach to such key issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional point I wish to make this morning, though, is that I think it is very important that Australia, as a relatively wealthy country&mdash;and, even at a time of some economic stress, we are a relatively wealthy country when we look at the great range of countries who will participate in this conference&mdash;should go to the conference not merely preaching what others should do, but providing a lead by our own actions. In that respect, as far as greenhouse is concerned, I would commend to Government members the comment made in our Fightback program which does touch on our environmental concerns. With respect to greenhouse, we say that it is important that the Commonwealth itself be prepared to play a leadership role in this matter. It should be a matter of doing things as we do rather than as we say. To actually quote the document, we say that we should:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ensure that Federal Government agencies maintain the best energy management practices so that the Commonwealth plays a leadership role and is able to urge the rest of the community to do as we do (rather than do as we say);</PARA>
<PARA>The other thing that I think is vitally important&mdash;and we are reminded of this by the horrific situation in the Darling River&mdash;is that we have major environmental challenges here in Australia which are purely Australian, within Australia. And I would commend to the Government our view that, whilst existing programs are very worthy of support, much more needs to be done. The blooms of poisonous algae in so many of our watercourses are a great warning of the fact that we have much more to do than we have realised to this point. Again, I hope that would be a matter in respect of which we can say to the world, `We are tackling these key Australian issues which go to so many things, including biodiversity, in a positive and constructive way here within Australia', as we join in broader international efforts to handle these things on an international basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in joining this debate and supporting the motion moved by the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh). Some of the issues that have been skirted around during the debate would perhaps suggest a debate that could go down the track of being party political, but I do not think that this is the time to have that type of debate. The concerns that are to be tackled by the UNCED conference are too important and too relevant to the whole of society to allow us that indulgence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), in his comments, talked about how environment knows no political boundaries in the way in which the Australian Federal system works. That is certainly one of the important things about the work of the UNCED conference, and the intent of this motion is to indicate that the environment in an international sense has no boundaries. That is why international and global environmental policies are so important. Throughout the 1980s&mdash;and certainly it is the case now in the 1990s&mdash;there was a realisation of this. Popular magazines such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time</EMPHASIS>, which made the endangered Earth the planet of the year in its annual awards in January 1989, illustrate the types of concerns which have come to the fore in the late 1980s and which are now to be tackled in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference in Brazil in June 1992 has its genesis in UN resolution 44/228<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>. The UNCED conference follows 20 years after the World Conference on Environment and Development, where there was an attempt to set out a long term global environmental agenda. At this UNCED conference, of course, the world will aim to set an agenda for the next 20 years&mdash;Agenda 21. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been indicated earlier in the debate by the honourable member for Phillip, the UN resolution which I have mentioned lists nine environmental issues. They are not in any order of priority, but they are issues that need to be tackled in a global sense. Briefly, they include the protection of the atmosphere, including considerations of ozone, climate change and greenhouse; protection of the quality and supply of fresh water resources; protection of the oceans and of coastal areas; protection and management of land resources, encompassing consideration of forms of land degradation and deforestation; the conservation of biological diversity, a matter which was alluded to by the honourable member for Phillip; and environmentally sound management of biotechnology, an issue that the honourable member for Aston and I, as members of the House of Representatives Industry, Science and Technology Committee, are currently trying to come to grips with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further issue is the environmentally sound management of waste, particularly hazardous wastes and toxic chemicals. Again, that is an issue that has been tackled by committees of this Parliament. Finally, there are the issues of the improvement of the living and working environments of the poor and the protection of human health conditions and the improvement of the quality of life. These are the types of economic issues that the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) introduced. It must not be thought that we will be able to look in some isolated way at environmental issues without thinking of the social and economic consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the honourable member for Phillip has called for the House to take an active interest in the issues before the conference and, indeed, to take an active interest in the conference itself. Standing Order 28B, which sets out what standing committees may do, indicates that the House of Representatives environment committee might be called upon to play a more active role&mdash;even a role in the preparation of the conference. That would embrace honourable members on both sides of this chamber and would include all political views. Already in the run-up to the conference the non-government agencies have been given an excellent opportunity to be involved. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>As I would expect of him, the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) has just said&mdash;this is my assessment of what he said&mdash;that this issue of the environment has run out of legs as a party political issue. It has become so important to each and every family across this nation that it has run out of legs for side votes or as a means of support to get a government over the line.

As an outcome of that conference water might be better in Westernport Bay&mdash;a boundary of my electorate; water off Sydney may be better; and we may learn new ways to treat sewage in Australia.

What we are saying is that, although we have a great country with clean air in many parts, we still have some pockets with dirty air. That means that pollution is affecting somebody we know.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House acknowledges the importance of our primary industry sector to Australia's national economy.</PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to this motion on the importance of Australia's primary industry, I must first acknowledge the tremendous contribution that the mining industry has made, and is continuing to make, to Australia's economic welfare. A case in point with which I am familiar is the silver, lead and zinc mining industry of Broken Hill, which is still in operation after 100 years of mining. Not only has the Barrier field provided great wealth to State and Federal governments and added to the standard of living of all Australians, but its resources have provided the foundation for much of Australia's industrial growth. In addition, the names of many people whose initial training took place in the Broken Hill mines permeate Australian business and, indeed, industrial establishments throughout the world. One needs only to mention John Ralph, the late Sir Maurice Mawby, Dinni O'Leary, Liebelt and Espie. All of these names, of course, are well known to most Australians. Some of them have become household names. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt, Broken Hill, although outstanding, is only a representative sample of other great Australian mining fields. Of course, we now have great gas and oil fields. We have Mount Isa Mines, Mount Morgan&mdash;one could go on and on. One field which is underestimated and which not many people know about, although I know that many honourable members have certainly travelled there, is the great North West Shelf development. That development of natural liquefied petroleum gas to be sold in the Japanese market will bring in income of $2 billion per annum to the Australian economy. Indeed, it represents a great contribution to our national wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While today the mining industry contributes very significantly to Australia's wealth, I wish also to speak about the rural industry's contribution to the Australian economy. From slow and difficult beginnings in the early days of European settlement, primary industries developed rapidly and have featured prominently in the Australian economy since about the 1820s. Those industries now account for approximately 10 per cent of our gross domestic production. Although that figure may not seem very large, our primary industries are basically export oriented. It is these exports that are extremely important to Australia because of the export income they generate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Primary products make up about 70 per cent of the total value of all our exports. This export income enables us to finance the import of the goods and services that we have no comparative advantage in producing. In this way, thanks to our rural and mining sectors, Australians enjoy a higher standard of living than they might otherwise do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent phenomenon which has not had a precedent for many years is the coverage that rural areas are receiving in the media while the economy is in depression, commodity prices are at their lowest levels for many years and drought is gripping most of eastern Australia. Over many years, the only news we would get in most of the printed media would be that giving readers an impression that most people who lived in rural Australia, particularly if they worked on the land, were very wealthy. But now, to use the words of Morris West, `Many farmers have been reduced to peonage'&mdash;that is, almost to the status of serfs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At last, however, a few photos of drought and desolation are appearing on page three of the capital city media, but I am still sure Mr and Mrs Average Australia are not aware of the pain being felt by families in the bush and how this will spread and eventually affect them. As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said recently in Parliament, the interest rates of 18 months to two years ago have had an effect only quite recently. So the present drought in eastern Australia and the rural downturn will not have an effect on most Australians for perhaps another six to 12 months. Then, unfortunately, I am sure that most Australians will understand what recession and depression really mean. Most people would now be aware just how wrong the media image of farmers has been and indeed how poor many of our farmers are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But how did this poverty come about? How can the farming sector, which has played a major part in carrying the Australian economy for so long, find itself in such a precarious situation? There are many reasons. The major ones include low commodity prices, the collapse of the communist empire, the EC subsidy programs, the United States export enhancement program, and of course now the drought, just to name a few. Many of these we can do little about, but we can certainly do something about the farmers' greatest handicap, namely, an inadequate government. We can do something about getting government off the back of our rural industries and in providing a framework that will enable the rural sector to get on with the job. That is one of the reasons why the National Party in partnership with our Liberal colleagues is proposing a wide range of fundamental reforms that will be of enormous benefit to regional and rural Australia and will recognise the important contribution rural Australia makes to our economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For starters&mdash;as the honourable member for Maranoa says&mdash;under our tax reform package, fuel prices for the average motorist will fall by 19c per litre, and every time an average car tank is filled it will cost $11 less. That will be a great boost to country people because it is normally country people who travel the longest distances on our worst roads. I will give an example. As the member for Riverina-Darling, I find that the trip between my two major centres, Broken Hill and Griffith, takes about 7 1/2 hours if I drive on the bitumen road and about 5 1/2 hours if I drive on the dirt road. However, it is not always possible to use the dirt road. One can imagine how much fuel is used on such a trip and what the cost is to the taxpayer. The costs to the people who live in an environment such as that are prohibitive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) say earlier that lowering the cost of fuel would cause environmental damage. It is my belief that world parity pricing was latched on to in the early days because it provided a milch cow to allow government to get excess taxes. It would have been all right had those taxes been spent on roads, but a number of governments have not spent those taxes on roads; they have added them to their income. The honourable member for Petrie said something about the environment. We could always walk or get onto a horse, but I believe the environmental problems caused by horses, particularly in New York at the turn of the century, were far worse as far as greenhouse gas emissions go than those caused by cars, particularly in outback Australia. We really do need cheaper fuel in outback Australia because the price of fuel has a cascading effect as it moves through the economy; it is very important to people in outback Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will also abolish for farmers the excise on fuel used on and off farm. This will save farmers 26c per litre, or over $1 billion per year. Under our policy they will pay no excise or GST on diesel fuel or petrol used on or off farm for business purposes. That will be a real bonus for farmers. The excise abolition will also apply to fuel oil, heating oil, kerosene and aviation gasoline, Avgas. The Avgas price will fall even further than that of petrol because the current excise on it is higher. This will mean cheaper fuel for general aviation. </PARA>

We cannot allow that to happen. Regional airlines will also be more competitive, which will be great news for rural Australia. Hopefully, the expected lower prices will see the reintroduction of some airline routes that regional and commuter airlines have been forced to drop owing to high government costs, which resulted in high fares and low patronage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party in coalition will increase the children's boarding allowance to $2,400 and it will abolish Labor's assets test for the assistance for isolated children scheme. This is most important. Many people in my electorate, because they cannot afford it for one reason or another, but mainly because of the rural depression, are withdrawing their children from boarding schools and hostels. It is a tragedy for those people in rural Australia who are disadvantaged as far as eduction is concerned compared with their capital city counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will abolish the assets test for retirees living on the family farm as well as for families suffering extreme economic difficulties and receiving Austudy, family allowance and other welfare payments. The remote area allowance and zone rebates will increase by at least 25 per cent, and fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax will be lowered. We will go further. We will abolish payroll tax, one of the greatest imposts on employment, and we will review the depreciation allowance and income equalisation deposits as well as the fringe benefits tax and its effect on remote areas. I call on the Government to match these moves that are being made by the coalition, because those of us in rural Australia are in dire straits. The nation relies so much on rural Australia.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two major problems with a retail sales tax. A single stage tax is easier to avoid than a multi-stage tax.

<PARA>It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only a value added tax guarantees that business inputs for further processing and distribution are free of the sales tax.</PARA>

It does not say `all'; it says `most'. So not only would we have the tax that we have to have, which those opposite want to introduce, but as well the statement is not clear in what it says.

Under his Party's policies they will cop a 15 per tax on their fruit and vegetables. When they sell their produce in the markets there will be a tax of 15 per cent levied at the retail end. That means that there will be less produce sold and that the 15 per cent at the top end will go into the pocket of the tax collection agents, not into the producers' pockets. That is what the Opposition will give to them. </PARA>

Throughout the entire Australian society this tax will impact more harshly on Australians living outside the non-metropolitan areas&mdash;rural Australians. They are the people who will suffer most under this package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are these great platitudes from those opposite: `Look, we are removing a tax on inputs to business, which is particularly going to help our export industries'. Like the honourable member for Groom, my electorate has many primary producers&mdash;banana growers, tropical fruit growers and strawberry growers&mdash;but on the whole they produce for the domestic market. They are not exporters; they produce for the local market. There is no great benefit in terms of so-called hand-outs to exporters, but they get hit with the tax. They become tax collectors for the first time in their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same party says, `We will get the burden of Government off people's backs'. We are saying, `You are now a tax collector'. They are saying, `My crime is to be a banana grower, but now I am a tax collector, and I have to fill in all the forms and get it all right'. Many of them will not do it. The Opposition is saying that there is a certain policy which is going to crack down on the black economy. We say that it will contribute to it. These people will not bother to become tax collectors. They are not earning enough income to be paying income tax, yet they are going to be paying tax on everything they buy for their family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Riverina-Darling and his colleagues have the nerve to come in here and try to pretend that this package is going to be of some benefit for people in rural Australia. It will not be a benefit. It will be the biggest slap in the face that they have ever received. As that message is understood they will walk a million miles away from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Maranoa will be joining the debate shortly. If the honourable member understands the package, I ask him to explain how this package will benefit the growers who produce in his electorate, the 40 per cent described by the honourable member for Groom who are not paying any income tax. How will it benefit those producers when they are paying tax on all their consumption? I ask the honourable member for Maranoa to explain that to me. He will not be able to do it because there is no explanation. It is a slap in the face. It is a kick in the guts to Australians living in rural communities. It will not be accepted by the Australian people. This Government looks forward to meeting the Opposition on the hustings to debate these issues. </PARA>

It is an indisputable fact that the agricultural sector has given Australians the quality and standard of life that they enjoy today. While our mineral industry has boomed in recent years, this is very much a finite resource. Australia has an abundance of land and resources that can continue in a productive capacity long after our mineral deposits have dried up. The honourable member for Riverina-Darling has said that many of these mines are still in operation and will go on for a long time. Ultimately, however, they will dry up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Labor Government is actively engaged in a policy to eliminate farmers. The latest ABARE figures suggest that the average farmer in Australia in the next 12 months faces a deficit income of $30,000, and this must send alarm bells right across the nation. This has to be compared with what ABARE said only six months ago. It was then predicted that farmers would have a negative income of only $3,000. If this Government takes that sort of advice, I would suggest that it bring some private consultants into ABARE to get the real picture, because ABARE is obviously providing historical information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question we have to ask ourselves and the question this Parliament must ask itself is: do we want an agricultural sector?

As we sit in this Parliament today, six will leave the land. They are leaving at the rate of six per day, even today. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate some comments were made about the impact of the Fightback package&mdash;or the Throwback package, as the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) has indicated. It is of great concern to me that the honourable member for Riverina-Darling and others have indicated that there will be a transfer of the taxation burden from those industries involved in the export of primary products at this stage. The honourable member for Riverina-Darling did indicate how important they are to the Australian economy, and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) pointed out that from the near Asian region Australia receives the benefit of an approximately $7 billion trade surplus on agricultural products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the transferring of tax from one section of primary production to another will be horrendous. It will be transferred to the domestic side of primary production. The Opposition is saying, `It doesn't matter about the domestic industries&mdash;we'll tax the daylights out of them'. At the moment the primary producers pay almost no tax, for a number of reasons which have been mentioned on both sides of the House. This is, regrettably, because of the economic conditions prevailing around the world at the moment. Under the Fightback package they will start paying tax at an enormous amount&mdash;some 15 per cent&mdash;on everything they buy. Under the present taxation system, much of the income the farmers are able to derive and the money their families are permitted to spend does not attract any tax. They will have to reduce their spending because 15 per cent will be handed straight across to the Government. </PARA>

Not everyone will be interested in keeping all the paperwork and not everyone will be so nice as to come across and become a tax collector for the Government. Instead of having less than 100,000 people collecting sales tax, as we have at present, somewhere near one million people will have to do the paperwork.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 1991 is to stop the payment of Medicare benefits for certain pregnancy termination procedures. This Bill has been before the Parliament for over three years&mdash;three years of procrastination, stalling, diversion and avoidance. Is it any wonder that the Australian people are crying out for leadership and guidance from their elected representatives when they cannot take a definitive decision regarding $7m or $8m annually that is used to fund a growth industry in the most unsatisfactory birth control mechanism in the world?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that Australian people are deeply concerned about the leadership in this social area of Australia? I do not believe it is, because here is a situation in which for three years this Parliament has procrastinated and avoided the issue. It did not want to debate it and now does not want to bring it on for a vote, because it cannot justify spending $7m or $8m a year on what is, as I say, the most unsatisfactory birth control mechanism in the world. Today, with the easy availability of cheap contraceptive measures, no leader should continue to provide government funding for the premeditated taking of the life of another human being. What kind of leadership do we have when the taking of life is assisted by governments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Disregard for the sanctity of human life has now reached the highest level of society, which now disregards the sanctity of life. We have lost our sense of decency and of what is important when the unborn is abandoned&mdash;and that is exactly what is happening today. The leaders of this nation&mdash;all of us collectively&mdash;are abandoning the very heavy responsibility which we have for unborn children. But instead of getting bitter or emotional, or allowing a sense of despair to overcome us, we in this Parliament should start to show the compassion and courage that are required, by re-establishing the value of respect for life, for procreation, for fathering and for mothering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Would it not be an exciting thing for the people of this country if they could look up to the people whom they have elected to see all of us espousing a very, very high regard, if not the highest regard possible, for life, for procreation, for the process of sexuality and sexual union, and to observe us uplifting these activities in our society and putting a great emphasis on the need for fathers to be dedicated to nurturing, fathering and caring and on the need for mothering and that kind of care? If we uplifted those traits in this nation, I am sure that many of the economic ills and budget problems which we face because of the massive fallout&mdash;the lack of fathering, the lack of mothering and the lack of respect for life&mdash;would not be anywhere near as severe as they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pregnancy should not in any circumstances command a surreptitious, hidden and unconscionable solution. It should command financial and emotional support&mdash;love, friendship and compassion&mdash;but at the moment we are divided as a society between accepting, on the one hand, that responsibility to care for, nurture and have compassion for the unborn and the mother in all circumstances and allowing, on the other, what I say is unconscionable&mdash;the taking of a young life. Is this great country of ours unable to show or incapable of showing that emotional support for which I plead? I do not believe so. But it is up to us to give to the community the lead that is necessary so that other people can follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have had a debate about the environment, and people have been passionate about the importance of the environment. Over the last decade, we have seen people passionate about saving whales, about the orange-bellied parrots, banded bandicoots, eucalypts, rainforests and staghorns. And that is quite proper. But what about humankind? Why is it in our society today that we can be compassionate about the animals and plants of this world but lack compassion for the possible new life of a human being?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that humankind was created to manage and to be good stewards of the world&mdash;and that includes the unborn. I do not believe future generations will regard us well if we are seen to have cared more for the bandicoots than for the babies&mdash;and that is exactly what is happening today in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> many people probably would have noticed a headline `Doctor suspended after botching abortions'. This is the difficulty we are faced with. We as a parliament are continuing to encourage these procedures in this country, and it is time we stopped that encouragement. Let me just illustrate what is occurring as a consequence of our allowing this procedure to go on in what we call our civilised society. This doctor's medical licence was suspended because he severed the arm of a foetus who later was born. Is that not a tragic set of circumstances, absolutely tragic?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That particular incident occurred in another country, one in which this process goes on. But of course, that process, which we support as a parliament, goes on in our own country, and maybe there have been similar occurrences which could have been used as illustrations. But today's paper today reports that a child was born without an arm because of a botched abortion. Can we allow this to go on? I do not believe we can. We had a debate in this Parliament only yesterday about the massacre in East Timor&mdash;about life, about the importance of life. We make a lot of it, as we should. But why do we not show the same compassion and thought for the nurturing and caring of the child in the womb?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes in this Parliament we try to divide things up in the words that we use, and we split hairs. Maybe that is a consequence of having a lot of legal minded people here. They are important to the process, but I believe that in this particular instance as a civilised society we are indeed splitting hairs as we have never split them anywhere else. Let me illustrate the point. If we are doing in vitro fertilisation with animals, we take the living embryo and implant it at a very early stage, when there are eight, 10, 16 or 32 cells in the formation of the new animal. That is the essence&mdash;life begins at the point of fusion. There is no doubt about that. We all know that; yet here we reject it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank the House, as I have spoken before on the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill, which is now before the House. I cannot support the Bill, but I do support this: Parliament should have a vote on the matter and dispose of it because it has gone on for a number of years. Each of us has views that each of us holds dear, and I do not think we can allow this debate to go on and on and on without the resolution of the Parliament. So I do agree with members opposite that we should bring it on and vote on the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the reason I object to the Bill is simple: State law determines the legality of abortion in Australia and, by and large, State law&mdash;or, at least, the judges' interpretation of that law&mdash;has determined that abortion is legal in Australia. My view&mdash;and I would bet the view of the majority of Australians&mdash;is that where there is a legal procedure Medicare should fund that procedure. What members are attempting to do by not having Medicare fund this procedure is impose a harsher view of abortion than is the case under State law. This is a matter for State law. We should not override the interpretation of current State law in Australia by suggesting that Medicare should not fund abortions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Abortions under certain circumstances are legal in Australia. Those people who have to make the very difficult decision to have an abortion are entitled, I think, to have Medicare funding for that procedure. What I am saying is that women who have to make such a difficult decision should not, when approaching the abortion, have the added difficulty of paying the full cost of that abortion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that this is a debate by proxy. It is a debate that is really about abortion itself. I understand the views held by those opposite, and I wish and hope that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) will allow us to bring on a vote in this place. I argue that he should do so. I know that the vast majority of honourable members will support my view that we will not support abortion funding abolition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essence of this is that Medicare funds most legal procedures&mdash;though not all; we know that. Abortion is a fundamental and important procedure; it is not one that is readily accepted by all in the community but it is an important and essential medical procedure, important to the well-being of women. If women make the decision, if their conscience allows them to have an abortion, then we have no business whatsoever in interfering in the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of the funding of abortions should never become a substitute for the question of the morality of abortions. If we want to debate the morality of abortions, let us have the debate, but let us not have it under the guise of the question of funding. I know people want to air the question of the morality of abortion and they do it by these means. That is a reasonable thing to do, but it is not a decent substitute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point again that under State law, which controls the legality of abortion, abortion under certain circumstances is legal in Australia. We should not seek in effect to overturn that by removing Medicare funding of abortions. That would mean that the Australian Parliament would impose a harsher penalty, a harsher view, on the question of abortion than does any State government in this country. </PARA>

I concur with the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) that it is time this Bill was brought before the House for a vote.

Medicare is not a State issue; it is the responsibility of this Federal Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remind the honourable member for Petrie that this Bill has support on both sides of this House. It is recognised by many members of this Parliament that there is a tragedy continuing in our community. It is a tragedy that, with our hands, we fund. As we pass the Bills that come before this House, we fund, through Medicare, the abortions that take place under the sections provided in the legislation. We never have the conscience to remark that it is also legal to smoke and drink, but this House promotes and spend millions of dollars on health campaigns. The fact that it is legal in Australia to go through certain procedures does not mean that this House should turn away and wash its hands of what is an existing problem for families in Australia&mdash;a problem, I say sadly, daily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was elected to this House by the people of Corinella, they knew exactly where I stood on this issue. I have never denied that I am pro-life. I also say to the honourable member for Petrie that it is some women, not all women, who will have their well-being threatened due to their pregnancy. Not all women have their well-being threatened. But do we deny that our medical fraternity has the ability or the discernment to judge when a patient is under threat?  Have we not got the right to stand before this House and say, `I am standing for the child, the unborn child, and I am standing for parents who have to deal with a most difficult decision'. I am also standing for the people with the seared hearts, the nurses and doctors who perform these procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as Federal politicians have an input and here is an opportunity for us to say that we stand against the funding of abortion through the Medicare system. We have a very good safety net. It is administered through our medical system, our hospital system, our doctors. Here is a chance for the members of this House to stand up and say, `This is unacceptable in this nation'. I am sure the people who are so passionate at the AIDEX exhibition honestly believe that by their actions, by their protests, they are saving lives. We desperately need to save lives in the Australian community today. We must stop the deaths of so many unborn Australian children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time to turn the nation back and say, `Let us have a good look at ourselves, because we can no longer go on with the death of unborn children through abortion'. If we have to draw the matter to the attention of the House through the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill and we are left no other option, that is the way to do it. I believe that in State Houses and local government councils across Australia, and in this House, there are men and women prepared now to stand up for unborn children.

The other party did not feel the same way, and, since she was having the child, it was, in my view, entirely up to her. I think anything that takes away the rights of women in this case is clearly a reduction in their quality of life. I feel very strongly about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are doing here by attacking abortion funding is, in my view, extremely cynical. Does anyone seriously think this will stop abortions in Australia?  Of course it will not. It will mean that rich women get abortions while poor women either do not get them or are forced into backyard procedures. That is where we will get the botched abortions. The real risk to the life of the mother is in these backyard operations. It is abundantly clear&mdash;and everyone knows it in their hearts&mdash;that if we stop this funding we will simply force abortion back into that dark age. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a great collector of articles that I think are important. In returning to my files a little while ago, I took out an article written in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> on 16 October 1987 reporting the address of Professor Boris Schedvin of the Melbourne University, one of Australia's leading historians. In October 1987 he was warning Australia, warning the Treasurer of the country, presumably&mdash;if he bothered to read this article&mdash;of what we confronted if we did not do something about our economy and, most importantly, our growing foreign debt. There is a graph included in this particular article, which I have shown to the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is at the table.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Professor Schedvin told this particular conference that there have been two occasions in practically the last century when the cost of servicing Australia's overseas debt exceeded 25 per cent of the value of our exports. The first occasion was during the late 1880s and early 1890s; the second occasion was in the late 1920s and early 1930s. We do not have to be told what that was as a situation in Australia. I will quote from a few places in this article:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accompanying chart prepared by Schedvin makes it clear that Australia is no stranger to indebtedness, and that its debt has been sustainable only when the annual level of debt service payable abroad remains less than about 20% of the annual value of exports. Schedvin argues that above the 20% level is a danger zone. When debt moves to more than 25% of exports, as it has in two notable episodes before now, the economy simply cannot afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At June 1987, Australia's debt-service ratio stood at 29.76%</PARA>
<PARA>The alarm bells were ringing, but typical of this reactionary Government&mdash;I say `reactionary' as it has never taken any initiative of consequence in its nine-year history; it has always reacted to the circumstances of the day&mdash;its reaction was to bury its head in the sand and, in Micawber-like fashion, hope that something would turn up. Of course, had it listened to this noted economic historian, it might have heard some of the other things he had to say. More importantly, in the end, the article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedvin says that in the past debt levels approaching those we are experiencing now have been "solved" brutally and autonomously. "It is hard to think of any previous occasion where policy had in fact produced much in the way of correction of debt. Adjustment to debt problems has always been resolved by lenders, or the market in general taking a sudden view about the unsustainable level of debt," he says.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"In the 1890s the purgative was mass unemployment accompanied by severe market restructuring. In the 1930s we also had mass unemployment accompanied by something approaching autarchy, a withdrawal from the world economy.</PARA>
<PARA>It was amazing, because Schedvin also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This time&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and he is talking about the 1980s&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the increase in indebtedness has been remarkably rapid. The danger zone of a debt-service ratio over 20% was pierced more swiftly than in any other period, except possibly the mid-1880s. Between 1983 and 1985 we moved from 12% to 25%.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the facts as presented to Australia in that particular conference, which was sponsored by the IPA. These facts have been ignored by this Government, but they certainly were not ignored by me. Madam Deputy Speaker, I think you have been in my company time and again in public speaking when I have warned about the growth of this debt and what it will do to us. The historic evidence of what will happen is still ignored and we are still in this situation. But we are told that it is not a depression. It was a depression in the 1930s and it was a depression in the 1890s. We are told, `There is some miracle about to happen. Don't you worry about that'. Yet all the evidence is, by that indicator alone, that Australia has huge financial problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is notable that in reading into the depth of articles quoting our new and possibly temporary Treasurer, Mr Kerin, he is often heard saying, `Of course, we have not got the options of 1983 to fix the problem'. The option used in 1983 was massive borrowing by government and massive encouragement of the private sector to borrow by an irresponsible deregulation of the financial sector. I am not opposed to saying that deregulation was wrong; it was irresponsible in its application and, because it was reactionary, it seemed to be a good idea at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is equally a problem that we had an irresponsible and reactionary deregulation and float of our currency. Nobody sat down and considered what might happen when we did it&mdash;a good idea applied incorrectly. What has happened is that we have become the spectators' darling. We see our currency at a massively high level&mdash;still pushing US80c&mdash;when we have got a depression at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aussie dollar is the share certificate of Australia. I would like to say `Australia Incorporated', but that has another meaning in Australia today. It means dirty government deals in Western Australia, and Victoria in particular. The Aussie dollar is our share certificate. Who would pay US80c for a share certificate in Australia after the mess that these people opposite have put us in because of their lack of financial management?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact today is that each month 500 billion Aussie dollars change hands on foreign exchange markets; we need $8 billion to finance our normal trading activities. The rest is all funny money, shuffling backwards and forwards. We have very large institutions in the rest of world dictating to Australia what its currency will be valued at, because it is the value that suits them. Honourable members should remember that they are the repository of this $133 billion&mdash;they probably hold $166 billion, because $133 billion is the net figure of our overseas debt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">Approximately three months ago I was asked to chair a breakfast meeting in Rockhampton to hear a fellow called Jack Sonnemann from the Australian Federation for the Family. I was asked to go along simply to hear his presentation because he was arguing that children were at risk because of the availability, the visibility and the accessibility of soft pornographic publications throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went along, I suppose, with specific and built-in views because over a period of time I have waged my own campaign against stores in my own area, one of which had edible condoms in amongst children's toys and cards in one of the shopping centres. Another newsagent sold comics that promoted incest and bestiality. So I have had an interest. When I went along I was somewhat surprised because what I suddenly saw at this meeting was a way around the problem, a very cheap and efficient way to protect kids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jack Sonnemann was saying we needed to use blinder racks in our newsagencies and retail outlets. Soft porn magazines&mdash;and we can include all sorts in that, including <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Penthouse, Playboy</EMPHASIS> and even <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Picture</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People</EMPHASIS>, as I will demonstrate as I speak&mdash;ought to be put up on high shelves with blinder racks so that kids cannot see them or easily access them. I went away from the meeting thinking about this. I thought it was a very good idea, so I took the matter up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have had a campaign in central Queensland that is spreading not only through Rockhampton but throughout the whole of Queensland. I put out a press release saying that the campaign was hoping to light a bonfire against the sale and exhibition of soft pornographic material and I was hoping that it would rage across the nation. Unfortunately, one of the journalists misunderstood this, whether intentionally or otherwise, and wrote that I wanted to burn and ban everything. He even misrepresented the issue to Terry O'Gorman, the President of the Queensland Council of Civil Liberties. But in a phone call to him, in the presence of Jeff Jones from the TLC, he indicated that he personally saw nothing wrong with what we were suggesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea has caught on. Thousands of people have signed petitions that will go to the Premier, Wayne Goss, asking that we voluntarily have newsagents and retailers do this. It has the personal support of Wayne Goss. It now has the support of the Rockhampton City Council. In fact, the Council has now declared Rockhampton a porn free area for the visibility and accessibility of soft porn. We have had support from the Queensland Newsagents Federation, which says it has been concerned for 18 months, and not because of this campaign. It is now asking its newsagents to adopt the practice. The service station division of the Motor Trades Association of Queensland is now backing it. Churches, schools, community groups, P&amp;Cs and the Central Queensland Consumers Association support it. In fact, the list goes on and on. I hope it will go further, on and on across the nation like a bonfire or like a bushfire. I hope it will rage and make people realise that our kids are at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I picked up the preamble to the Office of Film and Literature Classification, commonly know as the Film Censorship Board. It says:</PARA>

Children and young people, in particular, must be adequately protected from material likely to harm or disturb them, and people who may be offended by certain material have a right to expect that it will not be thrust upon them against their will or without warning.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the campaign is about. It is saying that we need to protect our kids from those who talk only through their cash registers, that is, those who promote the porn of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not having a go at newsagencies, because it has been innovative newsagents who have come up with an idea different from that in America. They recommend that instead of building in blinder racks, agents should simply put the magazines on high shelves so that the magazine in front hides the cover of the one behind&mdash;so simple; no cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One newsagent did it because, with his staff, he had to go repeatedly through the comics because kids were coming into his stores, taking these magazines and going over near the comics to read them. When someone came along they would hide them amongst the comics. What he has done is put them on high shelves up front near the cash register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that this innovation will spread because we are faced with a dilemma. The evidence that I have gathered needs a community verdict.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me most is that the publishers of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People</EMPHASIS> magazine and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Picture</EMPHASIS> magazine say publicly, as they did in Rockhampton, that they are family magazines and ought to be displayed everywhere. The 18 September 1991 issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People</EMPHASIS> magazine included a six-page glossy catalogue; it was an insert. It depicted group sex, two women in a lesbian act, a woman on her stomach pulling the cheeks of her bottom apart and explicit sexual acts. Yet the publisher of the magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People</EMPHASIS> said it was a family magazine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also looked at some other issues and I was amazed. When this fellow said this publicly, he did not bother to tell the reporter that on the back of this very magazine was a full-page advertisement about Disney World books featuring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. I wonder how we can possibly have a publisher promoting magazines that have this sort of rubbish between the covers when on the back cover Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck appear. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Picture</EMPHASIS> has done exactly the same thing.

What do we find on the back cover of the magazine? We find not just Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, but also Big Bird and Ernie, the Sesame Street characters, Dr Seuss and friends, such as the Cat in the Hat and so on. I say enough is enough and we ought to do something about. </PARA>

<PARA>I am not talking about hard porn&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">resulted in a loss of compassion towards women as rape victims and towards women in general.</PARA>
<PARA>Another study was done in 1984 by the Delancey Street Foundation in San Francisco. Its report says:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has come to my attention that a leading taxation lawyer and respected member of the Jewish community has been subject to personal attack from a member of this Parliament under privilege. As Mark Leibler has no other redress against the comments made about him in this place, I take the opportunity to place on the parliamentary record a letter from Mr Leibler which gives his response to comments which have been made by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred). Mr Leibler has a house in Frankston in the heart of my electorate. It is a pleasure to place his letter on the record. The letter reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Ford,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I confirm that on three recent occasions Mr Ken Aldred launched personal attacks directed at me from the floor of Parliament. Mr Aldred enjoys the protection of absolute privilege which effectively denies me legal redress in respect of his overt acts of defamation against my character and reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Aldred alleges that my activities as a taxation lawyer put me "in a position of acute conflict of interest and potentially compromise the integrity of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)" because of the allegedly "enormous influence" which I wield as a member of three "key tax advisory bodies".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the activities identified by Mr Aldred are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)In common with virtually all tax practitioners, I have, on occasion, tendered advice to clients in relation to proposed arrangements which are quite legal but could reasonably be labelled as "tax avoidance" or "tax minimisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)I have, on occasions, differed with the Commissioner of Taxation on his approach to particular tax avoidance problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)I have not hesitated to make representations to tax officers at an appropriate level of seniority where, in my view, Tax Office activities were open to criticism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)My firm has sought access to certain Tax Office documents under the Freedom of Information Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e)Whilst I respect and admire those who are responsible for the conduct of our tax administration, there have been some exceptions who have been the target of criticism from myself and others.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f)I have been publicly critical of certain allegations made by the Martin Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g)I have passed on advice to shareholders in particular companies spelling out the impact of those provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act which relate to capital gains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of the foregoing activities are of the kind that one would usually associate with the professional work of a taxation lawyer. Any suggestion of "conflict of interest" can only be attributed to Mr Aldred's deliberate attempt to discredit me by distorting the role of the representatives of the various external bodies on the Commissioner's Advisory Panel, the National Tax Liaison Group and the Capital Gains Tax Subcommittee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Mr Aldred well knows, the relevant advisory bodies to the Commissioner of Taxation serve merely as a conduit through which the Tax Office receives input from a variety of professional, tax practitioner and industry-based groups. Full and detailed minutes of the proceedings of meetings of those bodies are published. Tax advisory bodies are not possessed of any statutory authority and the Commissioner of Taxation is free to reject any advice given. The Commissioner of Taxation understands that those representing tax practitioner groups on these bodies will continue to represent their taxpayer clients in disputes and litigation with the Tax Office. Indeed, the whole point of external representation on these bodies is to allow for a free flow of ideas, information, feedback and suggestions from the Tax Office's clients (ie taxpayers) to the Commissioner of Taxation. It is precisely because of my credentials, to quote Mr Aldred, as "a taxation lawyer of long standing", that the Law Council of Australia (not the Commissioner of Taxation) has seen fit to nominate me as its representative on the relevant advisory bodies. This is a role which, according to the Taxation Institute of Australia, can only be filled by an experienced tax practitioner. Given this context, there can be no question of a conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a member of these advisory bodies I do not receive any remuneration whatsoever. I do, however, devote a considerable amount of time to providing constructive input on issues relating to the administration of our taxation system. For example, over recent months I have been consulting closely with the Victorian Law Reform Commission on a pilot project involving a plain English redraft of a selected part of the Income Tax Assessment Act. At the same time, I have been spending many hours at home&mdash;and many days in Canberra&mdash;working with senior tax officers and other representatives of professional bodies on the detail of the Government's proposals for introducing a system of full self-assessment. The Commissioner of Taxation and I do not agree on everything. However, I believe that the Commissioner would readily confirm that, over a period of years, I have made a constructive and welcome input on a range of issues relevant to tax administration in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any "influence" which those representing various external groups have been able to exert is totally unrelated to their length of service on the relevant taxation advisory bodies. Such influence, to the extent that it exists at all, is solely related to the ability of the representatives in question to put forward solid, constructive and sensible arguments which stand up on their own merits. Indeed, that is precisely the function of persons appointed to represent external groups on the National Tax Liaison Group and the Commissioner's Advisory Panel, and that is precisely the sort of input which the Commissioner of Taxation welcomes. Is Mr Aldred seriously suggesting that I have some special "hold" or "influence" over the Commissioner of Taxation? Such a suggestion is not only ridiculous but is also clearly offensive in that it directly challenges the integrity and credibility of the Commissioner of Taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contrary to what was alleged in Parliament by Mr Aldred, the Law Council of Australia has never dissociated itself from anything I have said or done on its behalf. Indeed, in a letter to me dated 24 October 1991, the President of the Law Council, Mr David Miles, makes the following observations:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I appreciate that you are fighting to protect your reputation with one hand tied behind your back when Mr Aldred is continuing to use the shield of Parliamentary privilege.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much has been made of your membership of taxation advisory bodies. On two of those bodies, the National Tax Liaison Group and the Commissioner's Advisory Panel, you are the nominee of the Law Council of Australia pursuant to an invitation by the Commissioner to the Law Council to nominate a representative.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Law Council greatly appreciates your long and committed service on a voluntary basis in the very important area of taxation law. Your work over two years as Chairman of the extremely busy and highly regarded Taxation Committee of the Business Law Section was invaluable.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your appointment by the Law Council as its representative on the above advisory bodies reflects the high regard in which you are held as a senior and highly experienced practitioner in taxation law.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that you will not be discouraged from continuing to serve the Law Council of Australia, and thereby Australian taxpayers, by Mr Aldred's utterances in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Aldred's allegations are both outrageous and unsubstantiated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As each day has passed since last Thursday and the opportunity to examine the Opposition's tax package has increased, we find more and more areas of doubt, question and camouflage in the package which it has put before the Australian people. I want to address a couple of those areas which those opposite in the Liberal and National parties have avoided commenting on throughout that period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Central to the Opposition's platform is a GST as a replacement for the wholesale sales tax system that we currently have. That wholesale sales tax system has a number of features that commend it to the population and to the Parliament. However, I would like to draw attention in particular to the fact that in the coverage that has been given to date on this matter there has been a superficial assumption that wholesale sales tax levied at the rate of 20 per cent increases the cost of goods more than the GST levied at 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not talk about this in detail because I had the opportunity to refer to some of these matters in a debate earlier in the week. However, I do wish to point out to the House the comments of the Indirect Tax Manager of KPMG Peat Marwick, Mr Robert Olding, as reported in the Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> of last Friday:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said items presently sales taxed at 20 percent or 30 percent would not necessarily fall in price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was because sales tax was levied on the retailer's purchase price, whereas the goods and services tax would be levied on the retailer's selling price, which is higher than the purchase price due to retail mark-up.</PARA>
<PARA>The other day in the House I gave a number of examples which identified that difference. I wish only on this occasion to make reference to a couple of those which relate to vehicles. Of course, there is a wholesale sales tax on vehicles which the Opposition says it will abolish. However, the tax regime that this Government has in place ensures that the tax on vehicles which the ordinary person buys is kept at a minimum. The tax on prestige vehicles is at a much higher rate. So a person who purchases a standard family vehicle such as a Ford Falcon or a Holden Commodore for $24,000 to $25,000 would receive a GST benefit of about $100 on the purchase of that vehicle. If one bought a small four-cylinder car like a Mazda 323, the saving would barely be $75. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, where the real saving comes into play is for those prestige vehicles that are in the above $45,000 bracket. For example, if one were to buy a Mercedes-Benz 300E there would be a saving of nearly $7,000, which is a substantial cut in tax revenue afforded by the Opposition to the rich. Similarly, if one were to buy a prestige vehicle such as a Porsche or a Ferrari there would be a saving of up to $15,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more stark, though, is the contrast with second-hand vehicles where, at present, there is no tax whatsoever levied by the Commonwealth. The Opposition policy would introduce a goods and services tax on those second-hand vehicles and increase the cost of that second-hand car to the average Australian, who in most cases purchases a second-hand vehicle, not a brand new, off-the-showroom-floor car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, leads us to the point of tax free goods generally. There has been a good deal of publicity about the fact that most supermarket items are tax free now, but will not be under the Opposition's policy. I do not propose to go into those now, given the time constraints on me. This also leads us to the question of services&mdash;which are currently tax free but which will be subjected to a GST of 15 per cent&mdash;such as bus fares, theatre tickets, football game tickets and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, somebody dubbed this tax, I think quite appropriately, the `Midas tax'; everything one touches is taxed. It will be remembered by the people of Australia when they review this in 18 months time. Every time they put their hands in their purses or wallets the hand of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) will go in with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I want to look at is not just the wholesale sales tax debate; I want to look at a couple of the issues that the Opposition has carefully avoided in its presentation of the package. I will come to education shortly&mdash;I hope the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), will still be in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I will go to the question of road user charges. The Leader of the Opposition is quoted in today's press as reiterating the Opposition's view that it will drop the Federal excise on fuel and that there will be no Federal road user charge. The Leader of the Opposition has chosen his words carefully by saying that his party will not impose a Federal government road user charge. However, there is absolutely no doubt about the Opposition's policy, should it be given the opportunity to introduce it. Page 82 of the main volume of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The incoming Coalition Government, therefore, will request the newly established National Road Transport Commission to review a national system of road user charges to apply following the implementation of our tax reform package.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall level of road user charges and road expenditures will be the responsibility of the National Road Transport Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>The document clearly commits the Liberal Party and the National Party to the introduction of a road user charge which is currently under consideration by the States and the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In choosing his words carefully, the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite are seeking to deceive the Australian public by playing with words. They may well introduce a charge which will not be levied by the Commonwealth, nonetheless it will be a charge authorised by an instrumentality set up by this Parliament and either levied directly by that instrumentality, by this Parliament or through the instrumentalities of the States. The level of that user charge has been costed by the State and Commonwealth authorities investigating the matter presently at about 16c a litre which is, coincidentally, roughly the savings that the Opposition claims will be made in the price of petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the Government has committed itself to the road user charge but pointed out quite clearly that it will be offset against the current excise duty so that there will be no increase in the petrol pump price. The major part of the Opposition's claim on road user charges and on petrol prices is a deception; it is a deception and fraud which will not be sustained in the 18 months ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, in fact, an even greater deception that has been put upon the people of Australia in this package. That deception goes to the very heart of people's take-home pay and their wages. I might add that the document is a 700-page epic that has been constructed in a very user-unfriendly way. It has been constructed quite deliberately to require people to go from section to section to section, rather than looking at particular issues in toto. It is not, in fact, designed to encourage people to go through it at all. Rather, it is designed in the hope that people will take the superficial view put by those opposite and look no further. Let me tell the Opposition that that will not be the situation. The document will be subjected to scrutiny not only by this Government and this Parliament but also by the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what the document actually says about wages. It projects an outcome for the rest of this decade of zero real growth&mdash;and that is the optimistic estimate. It means a wage freeze on all Australian workers to the year 2000. That is, in fact, the best that the workers of Australia can hope for under the Liberal Party and National Party package. On this point I also refer to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of Friday, 22 November. Under the heading `Strategy on jobs relies on wage cuts', the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reported this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A cut in real wages underpins the coalition's strategy for winding back the dole queues and restoring `full employment' by the turn of century.</PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, its entire strategy is founded upon the need for 1.8 per cent fall in real wages over the rest of the decade.</PARA>
<PARA>The people of Australia have not been told that by those opposite. They have not been told that the Opposition's plan for their incomes is, at best, to freeze their salaries until the end of this century or, under one of its other scenarios, to reduce their incomes in real terms by 1.8 per cent. That deception which is buried in the Opposition's document will be exposed in the months ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the question of education because education has been trumpeted as one of the great winners of the GST package. Again, when one turns to the documents on education and looks at the supplementary papers, one has to go through the three volumes to actually get the full gist of what the Opposition is on about. But, having done that, one finds that instruction in courses which are part of a program to develop or enhance students' occupational skills will be included in the zero rating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Opposition shadow Minister at the table: what is the Opposition going to do to the inputs which are now tax free? All the items that are purchased by schools&mdash;the equipment and facilities which the schools purchase and which this Government exempts from tax&mdash;the Opposition will impose a GST on.

Will the tempest-tossed lovebirds, Hawkey and Keating, ever kiss and make up or is their house about to be torn asunder?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government lurches from crisis to crisis, each of its own making. The crisis in our tertiary education system is due to the overwhelming of facilities by a flood of students who have not been able to obtain work. For some 18,000 students, there are not even the places for them to be able to stand or sit in lecture theatres&mdash;if they are lucky enough to be able to get in&mdash;to take notes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, this Government has no interest in the three Rs; for the Government, it is the four Bs which it constantly exercises its fervid imagination with.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alfred Deakin's prescient observation about Federal-State relations that whoever holds the purse strings governs Australia has no more obvious manifestation than in the organisation of higher education in the past five years. The history of higher education over these past years reflects an increasing concentration of power, not only federally but particularly in the hands of the Minister himself. This drive towards the centralist, coercive, corporatist control of higher education is the abiding feature of the Dawkins era, which unhappily is not yet dead except in the quality of its conceptualisation. The Dawkins conceptualisation makes higher education nothing more than an amalgam of through-put, input and output, a mere species of industry and subject to the same mercantilist management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us review the emergence of this process. The Commonwealth assumed full financial responsibility for education in 1974 as part of the expansionist dreams of empire of the then Whitlam Government. But the Universities Commission, as it was then&mdash;later the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission&mdash;was a salutary buffer between the dreaming spires and the new red bricks amongst the brolgas, and the Government. The triennial reports of the Commission which existed at arm's length from the Government, liaison with State bodies and the resultant public discussions promoted dialogue between the tertiary sector and the Government. That dialogue is virtually non-existent today with communication consisting chiefly of fiats from Canberra. In place of the autonomous Schools Commission and Tertiary Education Commission, the Minister created his own creature, the small, exclusive National Board of Employment, Education and Training, with understaffed sub-councils for schools and higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Challenge of Higher Education in Australia</EMPHASIS>, Minister Dawkins laid down the gauntlet to academia and followed this with his green and white papers. Dawkins's attack on the universities has united academics from the right through to the left of the political spectrum. The left-wing professor of English literature, Stephen Knight, commented in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Challenge Ahead</EMPHASIS> that the only model offered for what Australia should become was South Korea. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the Federal education ministers and their powerful advisers want is a one-day cricket version of university education&mdash;quick, garish and profitable&mdash;without its own history and without its own organic development and above all, not allowing the time that is crucial to let something mature whether it is a double century or a powerful education.</PARA>
<PARA>According to the Dawkins's blueprint for creating an Albania of the south, existing institutions were made megalithic through amalgamation in order to be easier to control centrally. The number of tertiary institutions was reduced from 76 at the end of 1989 to just 36 at the beginning of 1991, achieved largely through threatening the funding of the reluctant partners. The binary divide which saw the happy co-existence of the universities and the colleges and institutes of technology was destroyed. Instead, we now have combines of universities and colleges of advanced education, some of which are geographically far removed from their forced marriage partners: all this in the simplistic belief that if somehow the old college or tech that you are attending is called a university, you will get a university level education and status. This Labor Government is hooked on names and image creation. Never mind the substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People doing university courses en masse do not automatically make for a skilled work force. Japan, for example, has proportionately much less of its youth in university education.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has failed to monitor the effects of its clawing back of money from the universities.

In the last 10 years female enrolments have shot up by 91 per cent, compared to 25 per cent for men. Fifty-eight per cent of women are enrolled in arts and education courses. Their courses, according to the Dawkins theory of imminent economic return, are supposed to get short shrift.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today is to do with the Child Support Agency, an organisation which we are all aware has been operating within the Australian Taxation Office since June 1988. Before I begin on my grievance, I would like to commend the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) for some of his honesty in his statements. But when he previously heard his colleague the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) describe his concerns about another colleague, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred), I was quite amazed he did not bring that to the forefront. I thought, `Finally, we are going to get some honesty from the Opposition about what is happening on those benches.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My grievance concerns the Child Support Agency and I will give some background information about that Agency. In 1986 the Government announced its intention to undertake a major reform of the child support and maintenance system within Australia. This announcement marked the end of a debate which had been going on since the early 1980s considering the faults of the existing system and the urgent need of reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980, a parliamentary Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act recommended the creation of a maintenance collection and enforcement agency. This recommendation was endorsed by the report of the national maintenance inquiry in 1984, which made detailed recommendations for the creation of a national maintenance agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985 a ministerial committee was set up to develop government policy in this area. Finally, in 1986 the Government proposed to introduce a system of formula based assessment of maintenance administered by a Child Support Agency attached to the Taxation Office. Collection of maintenance was to be through the withholding of payments at point of payment of wages or salary, wherever possible. I might add that prior to the introduction of the Child Support Agency only 30 per cent of child maintenance was paid at all and the few available statistics indicate that very little of this was paid regularly. It was apparently accepted practice for the children of separated families to be supported from the public purse through the social security system, with some top-up in the form of child maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the inception of the Child Support Agency, about 70 per cent of all liabilities registered with the agency are now paid. The average level of court ordered maintenance per child per week rose from $27 in April of 1988 to $39 in June of 1991. The average amount of assessment per child per week for 1991-92 is $50. There are more than 90,000 sole parent pensioners declaring receipt of maintenance and this number continues to rise by some 1,000 a month. This saved the taxpayer $56m in sole parent pension pay-outs last financial year alone. The percentage of sole parent pensioners declaring maintenance rose, I am pleased to say, from 25.6 per cent prior to the scheme to some 37 per cent now. Each month the Child Support Agency collects and distributes $12m in child support payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that the CSA has obviously improved the system of gathering maintenance payments and ensuring these payments reach the children in need of them, there are still a number of problems with this relatively new Agency. The Agency, I believe, is too far advanced now for me to call these problems teething problems, yet I sincerely hope that they can be quickly addressed and rectified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I cite the particular case of one of my constituents which deeply concerns me, I would like to share some statistics with the chamber. According to the Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman's annual report, which was tabled in this place yesterday, the CSA was the source of the fifth largest number of complaints received by the Ombudsman in 1990-91. Telecom and the Department of Social Security had the dubious honour of being the sources of the most complaints overall to the Ombudsman, but when we consider the number of people affected by these two bodies in comparison to the number of people affected by the CSA, we realise there must be something wrong for a body of this nature to be receiving so many complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that the staff of the Child Support Agency have an extremely stressful job, having to deal with highly emotional issues of relationship breakdowns and maintenance payments to children of these relationships. But surely something could be done about the number of complaints about the Agency which have now been raised with the Ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the report, the total number of complaints received by the Ombudsman's Office about the CSA rose from 330 in 1989-90 to 922 in 1990-91. Of the 163 written complaints that were finalised during the year, 136 were investigated, with 83 per cent of those resolved in favour of the complainant and 17 per cent in favour of the CSA. Of the oral complaints that were received and finalised, 76 per cent were resolved in favour of the complainant and 24 per cent in favour of the CSA. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By early 1990 it was apparent that there were significant administrative problems within the CSA. Large numbers of payees complained about delays in registering maintenance agreements and orders, in collecting arrears of maintenance, and in commencing deductions from payers' salaries. Others complained about CSA staff failing to return telephone calls or answer correspondence.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously the Child Support Agency has a lot of pressure on it, with some 135,000 cases currently registered and 1,100 new registrations a week. Also, admittedly, the CSA has the highest collection rate in the world for a child support scheme and is now, as I stated, paying out some $12m a month to children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main reasons for this high collection rate is that the CSA is part of the Taxation Office and has access to a wide range of taxation information. Currently, 30 per cent of the child support debt remains uncollected; the reason that 22 per cent of this amount has not been collected is that the payer is still being traced. The information available to the Child Support Agency from the Tax Office is used in its attempts to trace non-custodial parents to make them pay maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this access to the Taxation Office information that I am most concerned about. The CSA has access to employment declarations, which are the forms that everyone fills out with a tax file number when commencing a job. These forms provide the Child Support Agency with up-to-date employment information to enable it to trace delinquent non-custodial parents. What happens, however, if the information the CSA takes and uses from the tax office is incorrect or, worse still, belongs to the wrong person?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September of this year one of my constituents came to me because he had been in receipt of a number of letters from the CSA demanding that he pay in excess of $4,000 in maintenance payments. The letters stated that, if he did not pay the required amount by the date specified, the money would be deducted from his pay. The letters also said that he would be required to pay 20 per cent of the amount owing as a late payment penalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was one major problem with all this &mdash;the Child Support Agency had traced the wrong person. It took my constituent a number of visits to the local CSA office, and representations from me, before the CSA would do anything about his problem.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance concerns the levelling of a fringe benefits tax on rural and remote Australia. A fringe benefits tax is imposed on the value of certain perceived benefits provided by employers to their employees. Under many Queensland State awards the provision of free food and accommodation is mandatory. Free board, or keep as it is known, has been an award specification since the first Sheep and Cattle Station Employees Award&mdash;State came into being in 1918. Free accommodation has been a State Worker Accommodation Act provision since 1915.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions have not evolved over recent years, as suggested by the then Treasurer, now the high-flying back bencher from the other side of the House the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), in his second reading speech on the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1986, as a conspiracy industry to avoid the type of tax on remuneration that has now been identified as a fringe benefits tax. Workers under these awards are not high income earners or high-fliers out to impress big business with fancy lunches. These people work in remote areas of Australia and are provided with what I call compensation to alleviate particular hardship they endure as a result of distance and isolation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland awards have provided for the mandatory provision of free food and accommodation for the best part of 70 years. These Queensland award structures are entirely different to those under the terms of the Federal Pastoral Industry Award of 1965. Under that award the employer has the choice of either employing workers on a without-keep basis and negotiating the charge for use of the premises and power or employing workers on a with-keep basis and charging a set amount fixed by the award for the provision of accommodation and food. Employers in Queensland are not committed by law to charge found or fully kept employees for accommodation or food. The mandatory provision of free accommodation and meals under the Queensland awards prohibits employers from negotiating the value of any non-cash benefit, renegotiating the value of any provided benefit, or withdrawing any benefit which has been provided in accordance with the requirement of the award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxation Office clearly defines a taxable housing fringe benefit as one where an employee is granted a right to occupy a unit of accommodation as the employee's usual place of residence. In Queensland this right is not granted; it is mandatory under the Station Hands Award and Pastoral Workers Accommodation Act. The employer in Queensland has no right to exercise any choice. The employer is forced by law to provide a benefit and then is taxed on that provision while the recipient is not taxed on that benefit. The result of such an incongruous arrangement has resulted in the withdrawal of all the minor benefits previously enjoyed by employees such as free meat and eggs and some provisions, electricity, the use of workshops for work on private vehicles, provision of accommodation above the award, the use of employer's land for running of a few livestock and, in some cases, children's ponies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's answer has been to suggest that industry organisations apply to the State Industrial Commission for a variation of the Station Hands Award enabling employees to be paid on either a without keep basis or a with-keep basis. Since 1960 on four or five occasions industry organisations have indeed sought to do just that to address this anomaly. However, they have been unsuccessful. The industry organisations have been restricted in terms of opportunity to have this matter addressed. It is often the unions, and in Queensland's case the AWU, which are reluctant to address this issue because it opens up the debate on voluntary employment agreements. That is largely what has hampered the discussion on this very issue. The Commission, largely also in Queensland, remains very unsympathetic to the industry's request to have this issue addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The blatant anomaly between the Federal and State awards continues to cause havoc in Queensland, particularly to primary producers when calculating their fringe benefits tax liability. A pertinent example for the members of this House is the dispute now being waged between the AWU in Queensland and a farmer in my electorate. The farmer has been engaged in what is known as cashing out. He pays his station hand a certain amount over the award and deducts a specific amount to reduce his fringe benefits tax to zero. However, this procedure is illegal in Queensland and, as a result, the farmer now owes the Taxation Office $10,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very clear example of how a farmer in this case has negotiated something with his employee to their mutual agreement and, because it is illegal and because of the reluctance of the Industrial Commission and also the unions to discuss voluntary employment agreements, that farmer in my electorate now owes the Taxation Office $10,000. Where a provision of free accommodation and meals is stipulated in various State awards, employers should be exempt from fringe benefits tax requirements. Agricultural industries operating in remote areas should be exempt from the fringe benefits tax requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mining industry provides another example of the inequity of levelling a fringe benefits tax on remote area food and accommodation. In calculating a mining company's fringe benefits tax liability, the value of on-site housing must be determined. Often a discrepancy arises between the mining company's housing rental valuation and the Australian Taxation Office's valuation. The question is: how is the commercial value of housing in a mining town determined? Clearly, without the mine one does not have the town. If one takes the mine away, the town goes. So it is very difficult to determine the value of that housing in these situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While mining companies are liable for this fringe benefits tax on housing, electricity and water, and vehicle allowance is paid to staff, they are not subject to fringe benefits tax on the cost of transporting their staff to the sites on a regular basis. The so-called fly-in fly-out arrangements are not subject to any fringe benefits tax requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increases in fringe benefits tax are inevitably going to lead to the demise of many of these mining towns in rural Australia. One such town in my electorate is Blackwater in the north, almost entirely settled by miners and there to service the central Queensland mining region around it and on the central highlands. Companies will reject the idea of setting up permanent town sites in preference to fly-in fly-out arrangements. This situation makes a mockery of the Government's regional development policy. Decentralisation sponsored by mining companies will be terminated forevermore unless this issue is addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural and remote Australia deserves special consideration when considering fringe benefits tax. The lurks and perks do not enter the equation. Workers in the agricultural and mining sector are after a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. Employers demand consideration of the difficulties of attracting appropriate people to these isolated communities. Those working in the agricultural industry under many Queensland awards are not provided with free accommodation and food. I stress: this is a mandatory provision and should not be taxable in the hands of the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of housing in agriculture and mining is reliant upon the existence of those respective industries. Valuation discrepancies arising between companies and the Australian Taxation Office are best avoided by exempting remote area accommodation from fringe benefits tax. Any increases in fringe benefits tax threatens the rural mining towns, undermines the Queensland rural awards and repels an equality of education and health opportunities in so many parts of Australia because of the vital infrastructure which is built up as a consequence of these mining towns. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the House's attention to the fact that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) actually has a friend in Australia. He is a new import from New Zealand actually; I do not know what he has come here for. I thought he was a member of the Young Liberals, but I think he must be a member of the Young Nationals, because just recently he rang the Leader of the National Party who was speaking on a talkback program in Brisbane. He had one of those questions that appeared to have come out of his head, but he was obviously well organised. But the first thing he admitted was that he always watches the Leader of the National Party in Parliament at Question Time. Of course, when he admitted that, the Leader of the National Party certainly admitted that he was a tiger for punishment. I think anyone who found it entertaining to watch the Leader of the National Party in Question Time would be a glutton for punishment.</PARA></TALK.START>

Once again, it referred to the costs that a lot of people were going to have to meet. In my electorate most people who buy essential items such as groceries, meat, bread and milk are going to be severely disadvantaged by a 15 per cent tax. But what did the Leader of the National Party do? He went on with more fraudulent, inaccurate statements suggesting that people would not be affected by the 15 per cent tax. They certainly will be in my electorate. I know that as time goes on people will realise that the whole GST package is a fraud. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3555" SPEAKER="Kerin The Hon J.C." NAMEID="QH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WERRIWA" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australians understand that there is a clear and direct link between inflation, inflationary expectations and interest rates, and over the last 18 months we have witnessed a substantial decline both in inflation and in inflationary expectations. As a consequence, interest rates have fallen dramatically. Sustained low inflation, with consequent low rates of sustained interest, provides the basis for employment growth, increased competitiveness and more productive investment. Nominal interest rates are defined as the real rate of interest and an additional inflation component correctly defined as an inflationary expectation but approximated by the prevailing rate of inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to my first major point. Interest rates increase as a consequence of increases in inflation and as a consequence of expected increases in inflation. Were a new indirect tax to be introduced, then interest rates would increase prior to the actual implementation of such a tax. In anticipation of higher rates of inflation, lenders would demand a premium on the interest payments which they receive. Borrowers would face increased repayments, not from the date of implementation but from the time when it became clear that such a new inflationary tax would be introduced. Given that the administrative task of introducing such a tax could take up to 18 months, families and households who are borrowers would face a prolonged period of increased repayments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the second major point. The fact of life is that the major loan which Australians take out is the home mortgage. Increased inflation and higher interest rates mean increased repayments. The size of the average mortgage in Australia is about $40,000. That equates to a monthly repayment of about $420. The average size of new mortgages is approximately $75,000, and therefore the average monthly repayment is about $850. So I will be generous to the Opposition. I will assume that the increase in interest rates resulting from the coalition's own calculations of a 4.7 per cent jump in inflation is a mere 2 per cent. It is an heroic assumption, but I am generous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in mortgage repayments as a consequence of an increase in interest rates of 2 per cent is unambiguously rotten news for Australian families. A 2 per cent increase on a mortgage of $40,000 means an increase in repayments of $60 a month. A 2 per cent increase on a mortgage of $75,000 means an increase in repayments of $113 a month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite propose to introduce a new tax if they ever get government. The result will be high inflation and high interest rates, and they assert that Australians will be compensated. That is wrong&mdash;dead wrong. Nowhere in the manifesto of the conservative parties are mortgage holders compensated for interest rate increases. The arithmetic is brutal for those requiring to purchase homes because they are just not adequately compensated.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They would not be adequately compensated. Let me provide an example. Consider the individual earning $20,000, remembering that 50 per cent of Australians in the work force earn less than $23,000. The Opposition proposes a cut in income tax of $15.60 per week. However, that individual would pay an additional $13.80 per week on his mortgage of $40,000. That just about wipes out the tax cut of $15.60. It leaves $1.80 to cover the price increases everywhere else&mdash;in food, in clothing, in health and in State charges and taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me provide another example. An individual earns about $30,000&mdash;about average weekly earnings&mdash;and has a mortgage of $75,000.

For instance, one needs to take account of the fact that it is currently expected that there will be very strong growth over the balance of this financial year and into next financial year in housing starts and in the housing industry in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for his question. Indeed, it has a very special relevance in the light of the answer that has just been given by my friend and colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications, because on 20 August 1985 the then Minister for Finance in New Zealand announced the introduction of a 10 per cent consumption tax together with substantial cuts in marginal tax rates. The rhetoric, I inform the honourable member, was grand. The Minister for Finance, Roger Douglas, concluded his speech to the Parliament with the following remarks:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tonight's announcements will help us to achieve greater and more lasting economic growth. It will allow our economy to produce the jobs and living standards that all New Zealanders want.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the rhetoric of the Leader of the Opposition here has been similarly grand, as will no doubt not have escaped the honourable member who has asked the question, because the Leader of the Opposition here in introducing his package said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Hear, hear!' they say, `Good on you'. On page 44 of the summary document, once again it is claimed that a consumption tax will mean a lasting gain in jobs. So I suggest to the honourable member who has asked the question that it is a very interesting and educative exercise to look at the promises. Those opposite have relied on New Zealand. They have plagiarised it; their whole package is couched in terms of the New Zealand experience. That is what they have put in their package. I suggest it is a very revealing and educative job to compare the promises that were made with the introduction of the consumption tax in New Zealand. Compare the promises and the results. First, there is promise No. 1, which is greater and more lasting economic growth. That was the promise made in 1985 with the introduction of the consumption tax&mdash;greater and more lasting economic growth. What was the result? A five-year recession in New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>

The result is that employment has fallen by 6 per cent in New Zealand since the introduction of the consumption tax. Of course, as the honourable member for Capricornia will appreciate, with there not being the increase in jobs as promised, but with a massive reduction in employment, living standards have been devastated. In contrast to that massive fall in employment in New Zealand, over the same period employment in Australia has risen by almost 10 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that in the context of the release of its `tax everything in sight' package last week, the Opposition had some things to say about industrial relations. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition elevated this area to the top of the reform pile. When he launched this package at the Press Club he said, `Our industrial relations package is probably the single most important element of the entire package'. He did not shirk in putting it to the top of the pile. This most important element of the entire package took up about two pages out of several hundred pages. Most of that was about expenditure cuts. There was practically nothing about industrial relations policy per se. The reason for that is that the policy, in so far as it has been enunciated by the spokesman, is a pretty simple policy.

There would be no protection for any other conditions of employment, such as standard hours, overtime rates, annual leave, sick leave, lunch breaks, long service leave, amenities and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>

Those in a weak bargaining position would be open to exploitation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, in light of what has already occurred in Question Time, all this is very similar to what has happened in New Zealand. In fact, it is worse, because New Zealand has set some minima for conditions such as annual leave and sick leave. But the Opposition in Australia has no apparent intention to do that. New Zealand has set no minimum wage for teenagers, which has meant that teenagers have been open to widespread exploitation. The Opposition in this country has not, to my knowledge, said whether the minimum wage that it proposes would apply to teenagers. We simply do not know whether it intends to emulate the New Zealanders even further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will doubtless argue that all this will pay off in jobs and opportunities to improve real incomes through enterprise productivity bargaining, but there is absolutely no reason to expect that. If we look at its scenario C, which it says depicts the outcome of all its reforms, and then look at real wages, where are they in the year 2000?  They are less than they are now. All of this enterprise bargaining, which is supposed to open the door to a brave new world for workers of this country, would result in lower real wages than they have at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to jobs, in New Zealand, as has already been mentioned by the Prime Minister, there is absolutely no evidence of an explosion in jobs as a result of reforms of the kind that are now being proposed by this Opposition.

I have seen what he had to say yesterday on this issue. Unfortunately, what the Leader of the Opposition has issued now, in his latest twisting and turning, raises more questions than it answers. It is clear that the pressure from the National Party has proved too much for the `strong and durable' doctor and that in the face of National Party pressure he has had to back down and back away from any sensible distance related road user charges.</PARA></TALK.START>

Come on, John, look at us. Turn around, John. What does he do then? He then suggests&mdash;and this is truly incredible&mdash;they might use hub meters. Let me tell the Leader of the Opposition and the House what the Australian Road Transport Federation said about hub meters in its submission to the Inter-State Commission. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The set-up costs alone for a heavy vehicle could be $30,000.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dust tends to clog the workings. Rough roads can vibrate the internal workings and often cause the device to fall off altogether. Foreign objects such as sticks, stones, and the odd kangaroo, can also cause damage or total loss.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has already referred to that quite incredible media release that the Leader of the Opposition put out yesterday. He indicated, quite correctly of course&mdash;as the Leader of the Opposition himself knows&mdash;that it was put out as a result of panic and the Opposition's concern that the package itself was just being smashed apart. That media release yesterday simply confirms that the members of the coalition intend, as they say, to abolish Federal fuel excise and to save private motorists approximately 19c a litre. He said that `down the track'&mdash;whenever that might be&mdash;a future coalition Government would want to see a form of road user charge for commercial vehicles, especially heavy transport. So they are going to abolish the fuel excise, in government, and then down the track they intend to put in some sort of road user charge. But the Leader of the Opposition says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But this will not&mdash;repeat not&mdash;take the form of a fuel tax'.</PARA>
<PARA>Probably more than anything else these elements of road funding and fuel excise and the GST in relation to fuel highlight the basic deficiencies of that whole package, and that was the reason why the Leader of the Opposition responded yesterday as he did. It leaves a gaping hole in the whole of the financial arrangements of that particular package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the coalition have indicated on a number of occasions that they accept the principle of user pays or road user charging for the road asset. That has been reflected in all of the statements that they have made, including the speech that the Leader of the Opposition made to the VRTA Congress in Melbourne in July. Quoting his exact words, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no alternative other than, in our view, to implement user pays pricing principles for roads.</PARA>
<PARA>No alternative, no qualification&mdash;an absolute commitment to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the calculations which underlie that package. Firstly, the coalition claims that its package will reduce fuel prices by 19c a litre. Let us see whether they will. The present fuel excise, which the coalition claims it will abolish, is 27c per litre. Therefore, the GST clearly will be 8c a litre on fuel. But all of the road user charging analysis shows that not 8c a litre but 16c a litre is required from motorists out of the present 27c fuel excise as their contribution to the construction and maintenance of the road network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three options only available to the Opposition in its package in that context. The first option is that the coalition could add the 16c per litre road user charge to its 8c per litre goods and services tax in order to finance the $4.5 billion road program. It could do that, but the statement of the Opposition Leader yesterday specifically ruled out that possibility. He said that the road user charge for commercial vehicles, to repeat it again, `will not&mdash;repeat not&mdash;take the form of a fuel tax'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second option available to him is for the coalition to collect the $4.5 billion by direct charges on motorists and on commercial vehicles.

Similarly, we do not have to go out and deliberately mislead the people of Australia. The sort of `analysis' we heard today about what is going to happen to inflation under our Fightback package was a total and deliberate misrepresentation of the direction of change under our policies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just pick up a few items that have appeared in the debate this week and deal with some of them to show the extent of the misrepresentation by this Prime Minister and his Ministers. One of them has related to the decision of the coalition in the Fightback package that there will be no petrol excise. The fact is that that would flow through to a 19c per litre fall in the price of petrol to average motorists and a 26c per litre fall in the price of petrol to business users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is obviously shaken by that decision. He has focused on that decision, and I will bet that he has polled that decision. Do you know what he found when he polled that decision? He found that an overwhelming volume of Australians think it is precisely the sort of decision that ought to be taken until we get this country back on its tracks. When they see it as part of an overall package to eliminate $20 billion of taxes on the business community, they understand what we mean when we say you can create two million jobs in this country. The business community is going to have the central part of creating the jobs that the average Australians want. Fundamental to that is eliminating that mountain of taxes&mdash;that batch of hidden taxes&mdash;that you have used behind the scenes to fund your programs. That batch of hidden taxes needs to be abolished if business is to get on and do the job that it is supposed to do in terms of giving Australians the opportunities of employment that they really want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to respond to what you know is not only a correct economic decision, but a correct political decision, you have started this mindless scare campaign about how we cannot deliver that cut in petrol excise. Let me give you an absolute guarantee, Prime Minister, and see if this can go through and stick in the middle of your head: we will abolish petrol excise, the excise on petroleum products. We will abolish it totally and we will not reinstate it. If that is not a clear enough message to the people of Australia, they will not be swayed by your mindless misrepresentation of the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the background, of course, the Prime Minister comes up and says, `There is a whole structure there, a user charge structure that has to be put in place and a clear sense of direction for my Government as to the way we have got to go, and you are going to tear all that up and throw it away'. The answer is yes, we are. We are going to tear it up and throw it away because it is a total shambles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have had three sets of reports coming before you&mdash;two from the Inter-State Commission, which had one go and was not too popular so it had another go, and one from the Industry Commission. They give quite different views about the way to price road use in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You also misrepresent the fact that you have an agreement with the State Premiers about the nature of user charging on road transport. The nature of that agreement runs to just 5 per cent of road transport&mdash;heavy trucks&mdash;and the detail of that agreement has not been settled. It may well have been settled a little more if you had been able to go to the last Premiers conference, but you did not make it. The fact is that you have no agreement, you have no policy and you have nowhere to go. All you are doing is scaremongering and trying to divert attention from the fact that you have used petrol excise as a milch cow. You have raised about $42 billion gross from petrol excise and the Commonwealth has spent $12 billion or $13 billion on roads. The difference&mdash;nearly $30 billion&mdash;has gone into your kick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we think about that&mdash;$30 billion in a Budget of $100 billion&mdash;you have used petrol excise as a milch cow. We add to that the fact that you have stolen from the people of Australia a host of other revenue by backdoor means&mdash;the use of sales tax and bracket creep. You have collected $22 billion worth of bracket creep. You have not been prepared to give us a commitment this week that you will even hand that back. We cannot get a clear-cut answer from you on any direction in policy. If we put those two or three things together we see that more than half your Budget has been raised in the last eight years by stealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your Budget and your public sector would be half the size it is today if you had not relied on those areas as milch cows. That is why, when we see you come out and try to attack us on the nature of road user charges and so on, we start to understand your acute sensitivity. You have no policy and you have no sense of direction. Most of the numbers you have used in the Parliament this week have been a fiction of your imagination or they have been a deliberate misrepresentation of the findings of one or two of those reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as we are concerned, petrol prices in Australia are fundamentally important: they flow through the system, they cascade through the system. The abolition of petrol excise is fundamental to turning around the business community in this country. When we add to that the payroll tax, sales tax, the training levy and so on, we start to understand the extent to which you have used the business community as a milch cow and why you now have one million Australians unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can laugh and joke about some of the examples that we have given about how much better off people will be under our decision to abolish petrol excise. I will give an example of a major coachline in Queensland: 67 coaches on the road in 1990-91 used 7,500,000 litres of diesel fuel and spent $500,000 on tyres, $1,800,000 on spare parts and servicing, and so on. Under our package, they would save $2m in costs. Think about that. This bimbo here who got up and misrepresented the nature of that debate, his standing with the trucking industry is legendary. I will read a couple of quotes from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Transport News</EMPHASIS> about the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) and his standing with that industry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Brown has not only proven himself over the last year to be incompetent, albeit at times well meaning, but he has also deceived the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Brown blathers, but he does not listen, and most importantly he does not have the clout to stand up to the State Premiers and the ministers and the senior bureaucrats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will read a third one:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would you believe that Kim Beazley, the aspiring Prime Minister, is supposedly the chief transport minister nationally? It may only be if Bob Brown does the right thing and resigns that Beazley will take any notice of this section of his portfolio which is actually bigger than the telecommunications and media industry that has so distracted his attention.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has no standing on that issue in the industry at all. I go back to my main theme, having demolished the gross misrepresentation that has taken place in this Parliament this week on the issue of petrol prices. We are fighting for the future of our children and our grandchildren. That is what this is all about. </PARA>

We can give them the tax system to back that up so that they can take home more to their families. We can give them a better quality and more reliable health system.

We would return to the high inflation of the bad old days under the economic academic opposite, with all the consequences that high inflation would have for living standards and competitiveness.

The first, of course, is in this area of road user charges; and I do not need to spend a great deal of time on that because in Question Time today I have absolutely demolished the twisting and turning, the regression, of the Leader of the Opposition. The simple fact, as the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) said, is that the Leader of the Opposition made his position quite clear on 31 July this year when he said, `There is no alternative other than, in our view, to implement a user pays principle for roads'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once you have got that point, then you have the Leader of the Opposition nailed. He has twisted and turned since Thursday of last week when he attempted to perpetrate a central fraud on the people of Australia in regard to this question of road user charges. I dealt with that in Question Time today. Let me deal with the Leader of the Opposition, this so-called strong man who is going to undertake the central issue of micro-economic reform head on. As soon as he is confronted with a challenge, as soon as the National Party has said, `Listen, Leader of the Opposition, you are proving Hawke right. Hawke got up and told the people of Australia in this House that we would run away from you. I tell you what, we are going to start running now if you do not change your position on road user charges', and as soon as the National Party said he had to go to water, he has gone to water. As well as being a fraud, you are a weak fraud. That is in the area of road user charges.</PARA>

We should always remember this fact: Australia is one of the lowest taxed countries in the OECD, and that is in part because we already have achieved one of the leanest and most efficient government sectors. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you want to question that, just see what Professor Head has to say about it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia, as most economists well know but occasionally seem to forget, stands out clearly among industrialised countries for its relatively low share of taxation and government expenditure as a proportion of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed spending cuts would fall on essential government services and they would be a terrible blow to the least well off in the Australian community. These computer driven men opposite, these men of compassion, propose an incredible $2.4 billion cut in social welfare spending, treating human beings as no more than items on a balance sheet and looking to force economic outcomes with no more regard for people than as just one-dimensional economic indicators. They would slash essential spending and they would hit and they would hurt hardest those in the Australian community least able to bear the pain&mdash;the sole parents, the unemployed, the disabled, the aged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These spending cuts have been used to finance income tax cuts which the Leader of the Opposition claims are targeted to the workers of Australia. Let me illustrate Dr Hewson's idea of who he thinks the workers of Australia really are. On his figuring, those earning up to $20,000 would receive a gain in after tax income of 4.8 per cent. For those on $30,000, or those earning around about the average weekly rate, the gain is supposed to be 6.8 per cent. But for those on $50,000 the gain is 12.4 per cent, and for those on $75,000, which is 2.5 times average earnings, the gain peaks at a massive 14.7 per cent. In 1991 less than 2 per cent earned $75,000 or more. That 2 per cent of Australians is the Leader of the Opposition's idea of the workers of Australia. That is his idea of lower middle income earners. That is his idea of targeting&mdash;give the 2 per cent the massive increase and do not give a damn about those at the bottom. In Dr Hewson's distributional analysis no allowance at all is made for the impact of the $10 billion spending cuts upon those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you remember that great Australian book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Magic Pudding</EMPHASIS>. Its motto was `cut and come again'. That is how Dr Hewson regards lower middle income Australia, as a magic pudding. He thinks he can slash them, cut them and come again, and come again. That is his view&mdash;$10 billion in cuts and living standards for those who can least afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now turn to industrial relations. What Dr Hewson is promising is a return to the confrontation and the divisiveness of the past. Forget about the great contribution that working Australians have made to the historic fight against inflation. Australia today would not now have an inflation rate comparable with those of its major trading partners if it had not been for the working men and women of this country. But forget about that. And forget about the great contribution that they have made to responsible economic management. Throw that all out the window. Forget that, because of their contribution, we had a 25 per cent increase in the exports of manufactured goods last year and that we have got a better performance in manufacturing exports than the rest of the OECD&mdash;made possible only because of the combination of the entrepreneurship of enterprise and the great constructive cooperation of the workers of this country. Forget that. Do not give them any reward for what they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under these divisive ideologues there would be no more national wage cases, and that would have devastating consequences for the lower paid people in this country. Incredibly, the Opposition is going to the people with a platform of lower real wages. In his speech here today the Leader of the Opposition talked about lower real wages, and yet in his own document he is saying that by the end of the decade, if he was in government, real wages would be 0.3 per cent lower than when he came to office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what they promise. Forget about the rhetoric from the Leader of the Opposition about higher real wages under the policies of those opposite. As I say, their own document refutes it. The Leader of the Opposition's proposals are fundamentally inequitable. No more national wage cases means that the living standards of ordinary workers would inexorably decline through the rest of this decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How are they going to achieve lower real wages in a deregulated labour market? It can only be, as my Ministers have said, through tighter monetary policy. You have got no wages policy. You have got fixed fiscal policy. In those circumstances, the only answer is tighter monetary policy and higher interest rates. There is only one thing that the Australian people would be certain about at the time of the next election&mdash;which will not be tomorrow but will be in 1993&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS>  The only thing that the Australian electorate can be certain of in regard to the Opposition when they go to the election in 1993 is that the Leader of the Opposition would impose a massive 15 per cent tax on everything that they buy, which would raise&mdash;remember this; do not forget it&mdash;a massive $27 billion. That is the measure. As individuals in Australia think with great apprehension, `What does it mean for me? It means that massive increase on everything I buy for myself and the kids', they may to some extent be comforted by the fact that it is not only they but also their neighbours, all Australians together, who are going to be slugged for a massive $27 billion. That is what this man is going to impose on them. That is the one thing they can be certain of: a 15 per cent tax on food, a 15 per cent tax on bus fares, a 15 per cent tax on clothing and a 15 per cent tax on all the necessities of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it is all stripped away, that is the poison pill that the Leader of the Opposition is asking the people of Australia to swallow. Everything else is speculation. It is not just a goods and services hoax; it is not just a consumption tax. It is an assumption tax. It assumes that all the numbers add up; that everything will be all right; that no-one will notice that it is based on speculation and conjecture and crazily optimistic modelling. It is a hoax. As the Australian people come to penetrate, as they will with our assistance, all the thickets of those 600 pages, they will see the cold and nakedly opportunistic threat of it all. The Australian people will be facing the fact that as the Leader of the Opposition stands before them, like the emperor with no clothes&mdash;surrounded by statistics and rhetoric that add up to precisely nothing&mdash;his package is, indeed, a massive fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition goes to the question of vision. I will deal with that issue in conclusion. Some of the very real benefits of this Government's reform program are already in evidence, as acknowledged, as I said yesterday, by the Liberal Party's own leader in New South Wales. He has paid tribute to the impact on ordinary Australians now of the programs, the policy and the vision of this Federal Labor Government. He spelt it out. I know what the people of Australia would rather have. Would they rather have the Leader of the Opposition writing down their country, pulling it down, or would they rather have the honesty in this regard of Mr Greiner, who pays tribute to the impact on Australia now of the vision that we brought to government and have been translating through relevant, decent policies so that they are now reflected in the realities of this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no problem in addressing the question of my vision. Let me say that my vision, which is embraced in the Government's reform program, encompasses these things. I proudly stand up and say: this is not only my vision; it is the vision of my Ministers; it is the vision of all the members of this Government; and it is the vision of my Party. I will describe that vision. It is a vision of a tolerant, multicultural society of equal opportunity in which the disadvantaged and the underprivileged receive genuine government assistance. That is at the heart of our vision. Our vision is of a low inflation economy with sustained job growth. Our vision is of the courage to continue to deliver sustained structural adjustment through the sheer hard yakka of negotiation and not through confrontation &mdash;through talking with workers on the waterfront and through talking with employers on the waterfront; not by putting troops on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My vision also encompasses an environmentally sensitive and more competitive country enmeshed firmly in the Asia-Pacific region. Above all, my vision, and the vision of my Government and of my Party, is one founded on confidence in this nation's future and in its richest resource&mdash;that is, the Australian people. We have confidence in those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In implementing our vision, this side of politics believes in the active and the constructive involvement of government; not the cop-out of government. That is what we believe in. Let me say this&mdash;and I wish that those honourable members opposite would understand the truth of this&mdash;government is not an experiment in Darwinian theory where only the fittest survive. That is not what government is about. Government is not about an exercise in Darwinian theory where only the fittest survive. The Leader of the Opposition's consumption package is not a vision, but it is a cold, calculated, ideological approach which would see a return to divisiveness, a return to confrontation and a return to polarisation in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's 15 per cent consumption tax will hit hardest the most vulnerable, weakest people in the Australian community, such as parents, pensioners and low to middle income earners. Whatever the Leader of the Opposition's vision is, one thing we can be sure of is that it does not include those groups. It does not include the poor and the underprivileged&mdash;those people who need the help of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying this to the Leader of the Opposition: he is talking about an election&mdash;not an election tomorrow, but an election in 1993. Between now and 1993, not only will he have me, my Ministers, my members and my Party out there explaining and exploding this hoax, but also, increasingly, will great numbers of important and significant interest groups be out there. In 1993 he will suffer the fate that he has suffered in every election since 1983. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity that is afforded me by the amendment moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to respond to some of the unbelievably wild accusations and statements made by the Prime Minister in this debate. I will work from the words of the Prime Minister's amendment. The first point that the Prime Minister makes is that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document is supposed to a massive fraud on the people of Australia. This is from the man who has perpetrated more massive frauds on the people of Australia and on his colleagues than any other single individual in the history of this country. Was it not a massive fraud when you, Prime Minister, went all over the country saying that there would be no recession? Was that not a massive fraud, when you knew that in the run-up to the last election the probability was very high that there would be recession? You denied it and denied it and denied it. That was a massive fraud on the people of Australia. I notice that the Prime Minister is scurrying out with his tail between his legs at this particular time&mdash;another massive fraud. He has no genuine interest in what is in the best interests of the people of Australia. He worries only about himself&mdash;always has; always will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, of course, was the statement we heard to the effect that there would be no child living in poverty. Was that not a massive fraud, when the Prime Minister went ahead with an interest rate policy which one of our church leaders had to point out to him was actually putting more and more Australians in poverty? Was that not a massive fraud on the people of Australia? There are a host of frauds right through his eight years of government. But perhaps the biggest fraud of all was the deal done at Kirribilli House&mdash;the Kirribilli House conspiracy&mdash;with the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), to pass over the prime ministership of this country, the single most important office in this land, to the then Treasurer after the next election. Who was there to witness that deal, but big business and big unions. Bill Kelty from the union movement and Sir Peter Abeles from the business community were the two people chosen as witnesses to the greatest fraud perpetrated on the people of Australia, in that the Prime Minister and the then Treasurer</PARA>
<PARA>went out and argued the case for Bob Hawke as Prime Minister. That was a massive fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The character of the man is revealed by what happened after the agreement. He welshed on the deal. That is what has precipitated the deepest and most protracted leadership challenge that this country has seen in the last few months. It is a poisonous leadership challenge which has divided and paralysed this Government to the point where the challenge is totally fatal. So, in regard to the Prime Minister's first point about frauds, he is the fraud; his Government is the fraud. There are dozens and dozens of examples to demonstrate that case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister then went on to argue that the Fightback program would do three things: it would polarise the people of Australia; it would re-entrench privilege in Australia; and it would lead to confrontation in Australia. What is more polarising than what has happened in the last 18 months to two years as the recession which the Government said we had to have has been thrust on average Australians and average Australian families? That has fundamentally divided people in this country as they have been forced into the worst financial circumstances since the 1930s. That will polarise this country more than anything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, most importantly, let us look at the entrenchment of privilege. What could be a bigger position of privilege than that enjoyed by Bill Kelty and Martin Ferguson as they sit in the echelons of government, unelected, and determine the outcome of policy in this country? What could be more privileged than the two people who sat there at Kirribilli House&mdash;Sir Peter Abeles and Bill Kelty? What could be more privileged than that, at the expense of the people of Australia? What could be more privileged than the deals that have been done over the years that have cost the livelihood of the average Australian? The deals that were done on Coronation Hill, for example, and on Wesley Vale with the Green movement&mdash;that is privilege. That is real privilege. That was a couple of Labor mates who led the Green movement getting a deal out of the Government to block major development projects that cost Australians jobs. That is real privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What could be more privileged than a waterside worker today? We saw the example of $107,000 for 27 hours of work. What could be more privileged when nearly one million Australians have been thrown on the unemployment scrap heap? What could be more privileged than those examples? This Prime Minister is continuing to deliberately mislead the people of Australia about what he is on about and what his Government is on about. We talk about confrontation! Gee whiz! We see the confrontation that is now inherent in our system&mdash;for which those opposite set the example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the best example of confrontation in Australia? It is Hawke versus Keating. That is the great example of confrontation in Australia. That is the example those opposite set for the people of Australia. They are so fundamentally divided that they cannot govern themselves and, as the Prime Minister correctly said in the last election campaign, `If you can't govern yourselves you can't govern the country'. So the Prime Minister has deliberately and knowingly again misled this Parliament and the people of Australia by the claims about fraud, by the claims about polarisation, by the claims about privilege and by the claims about confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the specific points that he made. He focused on our expenditure cuts and said that we were just going to drop all these people onto the scrap heap. He obviously has not read the document to see how we actually target that expenditure and how we do try to identify the genuinely needy, yet at the same time helping those who are desperate to get back into the work force, desperate to get a job, and desperate to be able to look after their own families rather than putting out their hand in the queue. He did not go into any of the processes that we have put in place: the training programs, Austrain, the work for the dole scheme&mdash;the phenomenal, innovative changes that are there to help people to help themselves to get back into the workplace. That is what we mean by compassion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will look after the genuinely needy, and indeed we do look after them in this package. We will give the genuinely needy a significantly bigger increase in their pensions and other benefits than is warranted by the price effects of the goods and services tax. Disabled pensions, carers pensions, widows pensions and age pensions will receive an 8 per cent basic increase against a 4.4 per cent CPI increase, and a host of other benefits is targeted into those groups. It is again a gross misrepresentation of the facts to say that we are cutting these people and do not care about them. We care about them. We have genuine compassion and we back it up with genuine dollars to those who are in genuine need. People will be helped back into the work force by the most innovative set of training programs and other things that this country has ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the Prime Minister focused on industrial relations. He said that the workers of Australia had made a great contribution to this country. By that he meant that he had cut their standards of living and they had not yet voted him out; that is what he meant. He cut their standard of living like you have never seen over the course of this Government. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document shows the fate of the average single income and double income family with kids under the administration of Bob Hawke. They know what has happened. They have been sold down the river. They were sold down the river by this document and this industrial relations system built around the accord. What a funny document. It makes us internationally uncompetitive because our nominal unit labour costs&mdash;the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) should look it up&mdash;have gone about double those of our trading partners over the life of this Government and we have become increasingly uncompetitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, those opposite were supposed to have looked after the interests of the workers. What have they done? They have cut real wages and real living standards of workers. What a perverted sense of success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, they elevate Bill Kelty to that privileged position&mdash;the third failing of the accord&mdash;so that he can block all the reforms. That document, their industrial relations policy, is a sham. There is only one way to develop an effective system of industrial relations in a country such as Australia. To do that we have to jettison the ideas and the values and the attitudes that have been built up over the last 90 or 100 years under the centralised process of wage determination. We have to break away from the centralised wage determination process and put the decision on wages and conditions back at the workplace level. That is where we will get wages related to performance. That is where we will get workers lifting their game. They will not raise their productivity under you. Why should they? Every time they turn up&mdash;that is, if they manage to keep their job&mdash;they get 5, 6 or 7 per cent a year without doing any more. You will never get productivity and this country will never become internationally competitive under that system. There is only one way to do it. It is to get the Government out of the way and to get the workers and the employers to sit down together at the workplace to negotiate the terms and conditions&mdash;a common shared sense of direction for their company, just as we all have to have a common shared sense of direction for this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area the Prime Minister picked on was tighter monetary policy. How on earth are we going to have a tighter monetary policy when we are running surpluses year after year in fiscal policy? We are not like you, starting off with a fictional surplus a couple of years ago at $9 billion, and turning that to a deficit this year of about $5 billion, on your numbers. That is a massive stimulus. That is going to keep our real interest rates where they are, which is 3 or 4 per cent above those in the rest of the world. That is why Australians are still suffering, business is still suffering and house buyers are still suffering under the legacies of your policies. You are the high priests of high interest rates&mdash;and you have got the hide to say that we are going to put them up. Have a look at the program. Look at the first year where we concentrate on cuts in government expenditure  and building the fiscal surplus relative to our 1990-91 figuring. We take pressure off interest rates. We can get interest rates down. We can move the exchange rate more in the direction of its long term competitive level. That was another gross misrepresentation of the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the Prime Minister argues about the 15 per cent that is going to be added to everything under the goods and services tax and makes two gross misrepresentations in doing that. Firstly, the average price effect is 4.4 per cent. We are abolishing payroll tax. We are abolishing sales tax, and we are abolishing petrol excise. That will cascade through the system. I believe the inflation effect will not be anywhere near 4.4 per cent because of the extent to which those sorts of costs and taxes are built into the business infrastructure. When we get them off we both create jobs and start to get inflation down. When we get inflation down we get interest rates down. When we get them down we can run an easier, not a tighter, monetary policy. You have got it dead wrong again on points three and four. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing you did wrong about the 15 per cent is that you forgot to mention that people are compensated and that we have gone out of our way with the most innovative set of proposals to compensate people for the impact of the introduction of the goods and services tax. Average Australian families will be significantly better off. We are not claiming&mdash;as the Prime Minister said we had&mdash;that nobody will be worse off and that everybody will be better off. We do not claim that because some people in Australia will be visibly worse off. Those in the black economy who do not pay tax are going to be worse off. Tourists are going to start to pay a bit of the costs of using our infrastructure. Those who will not pull their weight and get out to look for a job and who fail the work test will be worse off under our policy. But, for the great bulk of Australians, the group those opposite have forgotten, those in the $20,000 to $50,000 income group, one should look at the total benefits, not just at the tax cuts as the Prime Minister did. The tax cuts, the family benefits and the health insurance rebates are targeted in at the bottom. As we go up the income scale the benefits are taken off people and people start to pick up the cost of their health insurance and to lose their family assistance. That is why the system not only compensates people but overcompensates people. It significantly overcompensates the people who matter in Australia, the average working Australians trying to raise their families and to give their kids a decent standard of education and a decent standard of living. We unashamedly looked after them and overcompensated them. In that sense that is a fourth gross misrepresentation by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Prime Minister went on to talk about the benefits of his Government&mdash;I must admit that it was a very brief discussion&mdash;and his vision. He had to stand there and read it. He said, `My vision is that the disadvantaged and underprivileged&mdash;I have not met one, as I haven't been to my electorate in years&mdash;will be looked after. We have environmentally sensitive policies', and so on. Why should we believe him? He has had eight years. If that is his vision, he has not got anywhere near it. In fact, in almost every one of the areas he listed, he has gone the other way. He has no sense of vision and no capacity to deliver what is required in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We unashamedly have taken on this package. Sure, it is full of some tough decisions, some benefits and some costs; but we have to make fundamental change in Australia. We have to break the mould, change attitudes, change values and change policies. We have to bring about a generational change, a change to the generation that has given us people such as the Minister who has just walked in, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe). He is a Whitlam product of extraordinary proportions who has no understanding of what has to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not say to people, `Don't ask what the Government can do for you; ask what you can do for your government'. Rather, we say to them, `Think about what you can do for yourselves and what you can do for your children'. That is what <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> is all about. That is the sense of vision that this Prime Minister cannot even go close to understanding. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's `Frightpack' document is an attempt to con the ordinary people of Australia into thinking that this package provides a viable alternative policy to the comprehensive reforms which this Government has put in place over the past nine years and is continuing to put in place at a pace unprecedented in Australia's history. It will not con anybody. By the time I and this Government have finished taking it apart argument by argument, paragraph by paragraph, in its entirety, there will be nothing left except a heap of ruined political aspirations on the Opposition's side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has been arguing for the past week that the package must be considered in its entirety, so let us do that. In its entirety it is nothing more than a monumental hoax. It has nothing other than tried, tested and failed monetarist prescriptions dressed up with a package of illusory tax cuts. These monetarist policies were implemented by Reagan and Thatcher. They resulted in a fiscal blow-out and poor trading performance, which, in Reagan's case, continued to beset the American economy. The same extremist policies also led to the severe de-industrialisation and poor trading performance in the British economy, together with the polarisation of British society into the haves and have-nots. We do not want that kind of society in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the package all about?  Let us get into the demolition of it. The package purports to spell out in minute detail, firstly, what is wrong with the Australian economy and, secondly, how the coalition will go about fixing it. It does not do either of these things. Nowhere in the entire 655 pages does the Opposition even attempt to seriously diagnose the problems which face the Australian economy. Nowhere in the document does it attempt to describe how its policy package will achieve its wish list of promised outcomes. It might seem that this is a mammoth oversight on the part of the Leader of the Opposition and his shoulder hugging bunch of free market cronies, but that is a trap into which I, this Government and the people of Australia will not fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's Fightback, or `Frightpack', document is not just a monumental hoax; it is also a cynical attempt to undermine just about everything that this Labor Government has worked for and achieved over the best part of the last decade. This Government has recognised that the key ingredient of the generation of long term sustainable growth in jobs in Australia is the achievement of low inflation and strong net export growth. To this end, the Government has stopped at nothing to secure the appropriate set of macro-economic, micro-economic, industry policy and industrial relations reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net results of our endeavours are only now beginning to be realised. Let me spell them out. The Government has succeeded in reducing our inflation rate to its lowest level for 20 years. Australia's manufacturing export growth performance has been the best in the entire OECD area over the past five years. This is not by a small margin. Our growth rate of real exports of manufactures has averaged 15 per cent over the last five years, compared with an OECD average of 6 per cent. Let me repeat that:  Australia's manufacturing export performance has been the best in the entire OECD area over the past five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are proud of these achievements which the Australian business community has delivered in response to our policies. The Government has done this by recognising that economies consist of people. It has done it by reducing industrial disputation during 1990, to the second lowest level since figures began in 1967. The coalition's Fightback package will undermine all these achievements. Let me spell out how this will happen, and let me turn to fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The leaders of the Opposition have committed themselves to extremely tight fiscal policies. They have accompanied this with a so-called guarantee. This is worthless. Who cares whether the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) resigns?  Once the GST was legislated in place, others could, and would easily, raise the rate. In the interim, with less direct tax revenues, tied expenditure plans and the removable so-called GST rates, the scope and power of fiscal policy will be totally evaporated. All macro-economic management, therefore, will be forced permanently onto tied monetary policy and high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to monetary policy. The document points to inflation as being the economy's greatest fault, but nowhere does it even attempt to grapple with the underlying causes of inflation. Nowhere does it recognise that a proportion of Australia's inflation is imported due to the openness of the economy. Rather, its solution is to commit monetary policy to a target inflation rate of zero to 2 per cent. This is done without any recognition of what world inflation may do. The only way this could be achieved is by severe monetary contraction together with unprecedented high real interest rates. This would cause investment to collapse, GDP growth to halt and unemployment to rise further, and it would worsen Australia's ability to compete in foreign markets in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any possible gains to families due to promised tax cuts would be wiped out by a multiple factor. This is an enormous hole in the package. Let me illustrate. The size of the average mortgage in Australia is about $40,000. The average size of new mortgages now being taken out is about $75,000. As I pointed out today, the average monthly repayment in these cases is about $420 and $850 respectively. Just say, conservatively, there is a 2-point increase in the interest rate on these mortgages, which amounts to an increase in payments of $60 per month and $113 per month. These increases would just about wipe out all the tax cuts. This is a conservative example. As I have said, with no other policy to fall back on the Opposition's package would most likely result in interest rate hikes much larger than this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to trade performance. One of the fundamental arguments in the document is that the move to a consumption tax will improve the international competitiveness of the Australian economy and improve trading performance. This is wrong. Professors Martin Feldstein and Paul Krugman, the former a past President of the US Council of Economic Advisers and the latter one of the foremost authorities on modern trade theory, have formally demonstrated that a consumption tax in a floating exchange rate economy like Australia's will not improve trade performance&mdash;and will probably worsen it in the medium to long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the structural adjustment processes. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback! </EMPHASIS>document shows a complete absence of any awareness of economic, social and political processes. Many of the policies would result in severe industrial disruption which would negate and prevent any positive outcome. It is simply wrong to advance naive policies without any consideration of the political process through which they may be implemented. </PARA>

Let there be no doubt that this whole magic pudding, all the recipes, all the elements, must give Australia a much higher inflation result and a much higher interest rate result.

Let us go to an individual person, one of the grassroots people out there at the coalface dealing with people who are in hardship, dealing with people who are in economic misery in parts of Queensland. This was brought to my attention by the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay). I could do no better than quote this one individual&mdash;not an organisation; someone right out there battling to make ends meet as part of their operation. This is what the Reverend Owen Davies, an associate priest with the Maroochydore Anglican Church, had to say this week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Give GST a fair go . . . We need radical reform of some sort to meet the needs of hurting Australia. We must restore incentive to business.

I am honest enough to say in this House that we have not convinced every organisation, but we have time on our side to do that. One organisation's release which I have seen says that it is not all that happy. That is because the Opposition has had the courage to make a major health policy decision, which many Government members have spoken about but have never had the courage to do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues which has surfaced&mdash;I am delighted that it has, because our approach is comprehensive on this issue&mdash;is the absolute commitment to abolish Federal fuel excise. I have a bar graph which honourable members and members of the gallery, many of whom are motorists, can see from a distance and which shows the huge increase, by stealth, in petroleum products excise or Federal fuel excise by this Government. In 1982-83 this tax was a little over $1 billion; in the eight years of a Labor government it has risen to around $7 billion, a seven-fold increase in a tax grab through every petrol bowser around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a long memory and I remember the former Treasurer, prior to becoming the Treasurer of this country and proceeding to wreck the economy of this country, saying that the Fraser Government was making every petrol bowser a branch office of the Australian Taxation Office.

We will be abolishing the automatic indexation associated with Federal fuel excise, alcohol excise and even tobacco excise, in what is a very fair treatment of the respective industries I have mentioned. We will be doing better than that. We will be totally abolishing the Federal fuel excise, which will provide every motorist across Australia with a 19c a litre reduction in their petrol charges. A great benefit will flow from that across the outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne and across country and coastal Australia. It will cost the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) his electorate when Mount Isa, Charters Towers and the Atherton Tablelands realise that he has put up his hand for a 19c a litre impost on all the motorists in the electorate of Kennedy and we have put up our hands for a 19c reduction in the motoring costs of all those in the electorate of Kennedy. </PARA>

It plonks a new tax on every living breathing Australian, regardless of age. Whenever ordinary Australians make any transaction involving expenditure, they are the ones from cradle to the grave who are going to be taxed&mdash;and taxed within an inch of their life.

No. What I said at the time of its introduction was that it would succeed when we collected zero as a result of the imposition of the training guarantee. What are we collecting at the moment?  Something like $2 1/2m, and going down. The impact of the training guarantee, contrary to the deception within the Liberal Party document, has meant that companies and employers in Australia have responded, and those who were spending nothing on the training of Australian workers are now spending at least one per cent, and next year 1 1/2 per cent, of their payroll on ordinary Australians.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As each day goes by, we have another revelation about the essential deception involved in this set of proposals. The Leader of the National Party said that this morning the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) did me like a dinner. I do not know whether he did me like a dinner, but he did himself like a dinner and he did the Opposition like a dinner. In the text of what he had to say this morning he revealed a basic weakness in the calculation, a weakness to which I referred yesterday, a weakness he has now confirmed from his own mouth. Let me briefly take honourable members through it, because it relates to the coalition's approach to assistance for the unemployed&mdash;I might advisedly put the word `assistance' in inverted commas. The Opposition says that it intends to save $745m as a result of not paying benefits to those who are now receiving benefits by virtue of their lack of work, by virtue of their eligibility for the Job Search allowance or the Newstart allowance. You do not save $745m unless you take it from something like 90,000 Australians who are currently receiving it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong says that 20 per cent of those now receiving the benefit will no longer receive the benefit. That is what he says. He says 80 per cent would go onto special benefit and the other 20 per cent would lose the benefit and go onto Austrain or go onto the work for the dole scheme. If people go onto work for the dole the coalition does not save anything, because it will still be paying the dole to those who are having to work for it. If people go onto special benefit, the Opposition is still paying it, because the amount of special benefit equals the amount of the unemployment benefit, although the conditions for receiving it are far more stringent and you need a huge army of bureaucrats to try to enforce the provisions of the special benefit compared with the other arrangements as they exist. The honourable member for Bennelong said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other 20 per cent, some of them will go into the Austrain scheme&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is what I call Aus-slave&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">some of them will go into work for the dole scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>Where then do the savings come from?  The savings come from this illusory scheme of Aus-slave, which assumes that for every person who manages to get a position under this so-called Austrain there would have to be a one for one reduction in the number of people receiving unemployment benefit or the Newstart allowance. That is simply impossible, because the Hewson hurdy-gurdy, churning away, will ensure that there is a huge displacement effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we introduce schemes like Jobstart, which is a properly funded wage subsidy scheme, we acknowledge the fact that for every three people who go onto Jobstart there is a net reduction of only one in the number of people who come off the benefit. The Opposition cannot legitimately claim any more than that in their Austrain scheme, and that would be the maximum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the honourable member for Bennelong says that those opposite cannot guarantee people places; employers will not provide them. Therefore the savings they have calculated are wildly in excess of what they could possibly expect to save as a result of these measures&mdash;unless they have as a fundamental objective actually sending people into abject poverty and starvation as a result of denying them the benefit. The coalition cannot have it both ways. Either 20 per cent of people will be denied the benefit and denied any income support or, alternatively, the coalition will not make its savings. That will drive a hole of probably a few hundred million dollars into its savings and therefore into the reliance anyone can have on the funding of the proposed income tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same can be said of the abolition of the self-employment assistance program. That program provides an alternative to the Newstart allowance to people who are establishing themselves in small business. If you rip away the props from them as they are struggling to get their small businesses under way, all that happens is that they come off the self-employment program and go back onto the unemployment benefit or Newstart allowance. The $22m that you are proposing to spend there is entirely illusory or, if I can be more direct, fraudulent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, as every day goes by, another chink, another hole, is driven into this package.

I think Mrs Thatcher&mdash;dear old Margaret, one of the parents of your program &mdash;would be very proud of your ambition to re-establish real unemployment in this country, as you reveal, perhaps accidentally, in a rare display of honesty, on page 209 of your program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion of censure. I do so because although last week the coalition's Fightback program was presented to the Australian electorate, in response we have had from the Government nothing but misrepresentation and lies. The contribution just made by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) was typical of all the presentations and speeches made by Government members today. I timed him, and the first seven minutes of his 15 minutes was nothing but personal abuse; he totally failed to address the issues. In the second half of his speech, as he started to address some issues, he moved onto gross misrepresentation of what is being proposed and misrepresentation of the benefits that would flow to the Australian public. He talked about the tourist operators and said, `You are just taking a tax off business and placing it upon the sweated backs of hardworking Australians'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that as we abolish taxes on business and give business the opportunity to create employment we impose a tax generally on expenditure. But it is not true to suggest that it is a 15 per cent increase in the price of things that people buy, because we will abolish many hidden consumption taxes. It was very surprising, even to me&mdash;and I have been closely associated with this for some time&mdash;to see the extent by which Labor has increased its hidden consumption taxes in the time that it has been in office. The average family on about $28,000, a man and his wife and two kids, is today paying between $45 and $50 a week in hidden consumption taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government loves hidden consumption taxes because it reckons it can put them up, tax people by stealth and get away with it. That is a policy of deception and deliberate misrepresentation. The Government believes that it can continue that policy. The tourist operator example that the Minister gave was misleading, because many of the people who will travel in tourist buses will be foreign tourists. We say that foreign tourists ought to make a contribution to the infrastructure paid for by Australians. That is one of the benefits of the Fightback policy. It will be no great shock to the foreign tourists. Virtually all the leading industrialised nations already have such a tax system. The coalition's proposed tax system is a much fairer tax system, and I am sure most Australians will agree with it. </PARA>

It does not do any of these things, on the face of the Opposition's own calculations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that those opposite rely for their claims about employment on a calculation that does not include their principal reform, that is, the goods and services tax. They run a scenario that shows that there will be growth in employment of 1.8 million, not two million, by the year 2000, and they do this on a basis which does not include their principal reform, the goods and services tax. So one can take no notice of that. In other words, it is just a bogus claim and one which is put at the forefront of the package to try to make it look attractive to Australians as something which would provide lots of jobs. There is no reason to believe that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The abolition of payroll tax, which is part and parcel of what is put forward, is supplanted by a tax on employment through the consumption tax, which is a 15 per cent tax on value added. Value added is employment and the return to capital. It is a 15 per cent tax on employment replacing the payroll tax, which is generally around 5 per cent. Half a million out of 750,000 employers in Australia do not pay payroll tax. They will all pay the consumption tax. Those who export will get rebates for the export, but the vast majority of employers in Australia will pay the consumption tax. So they will pay out tax on their employment. There is no reason whatever to see this as a tax change which is going to miraculously provide 100,000 jobs, or whatever number the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), was claiming in his comments a few moments ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that this program will increase productivity, but on the face of the scenario of those opposite it does not do so. Their scenario, which they say represents their path to the future, shows a growth in productivity of 0.8 per cent, against 0.9 per cent for the period during which this Government has been in office. So there is no increase in the growth of productivity at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They say that it will reduce inflation, and yet for the period up to the year 2000 there will not be a level of inflation at the level at which they commit themselves, which is a rate of 0 to 2 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They say that they will increase people's living standards, but in fact the scenario shows that real wages will fall. We will have no increase in real wages and therefore no capacity for people's real incomes to be increased.

However, their favoured scenario shows that net debt increases from 35 per cent of GDP in 1990-91 to 54 per cent in the year 2000. They have an incredible increase in foreign debt in that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, on the face of this document, the miraculous cures for the Australian economy which it claims it will provide do not occur. We simply would not get them. Those opposite have no basis for the employment claim. Their productivity is less than has been achieved in the past. They do not get inflation down to the level which they claim they would. Real wages fall and foreign debt spectacularly increases.

What kind of society is it? The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) claims it is a society that provides genuine assistance with genuine dollars for those in genuine need. I think those were his words in his contribution this afternoon. But in fact one can certainly query whether that would be the likely outcome from the proposals of the Opposition, because what those opposite propose is a very severe tightening of eligibility requirements. Indeed, one could say that it is a virtual persecution of some elements of the welfare group at the present time, namely, people on social security, in a system which is already one of the most tightly means tested systems in the world and a system which has been dramatically tightened by this Government, whilst bearing in mind all the time the need to ensure that the genuinely needy were assisted, but not tightened to the point where it would cause real pain and not provide genuine assistance to people who are really in need. </PARA>

It will eradicate that safety net and will cause real distress to hundreds of thousands of people. As part of this package there is compensation of $2.6 billion for the goods and services tax to the welfare group on social security. At the same time there is a tightening of and cuts in expenditure on welfare of $2.4 billion. In other words, virtually all the compensation that is given to social security recipients is paid for by other social security recipients&mdash;$2.4 billion out of the $2.6 billion. That involves taking about $1.5 billion off the unemployed by such means as making them wait an extra two weeks for receipt of their first unemployment benefit cheque. There is already a three week wait and what those opposite propose would mean a five week wait. It would mean an enormous profusion of claims for special benefits, which are not allowed for in the calculations. If that was not able to be paid, it would mean enormous distress for many people who lose their jobs and have no income at all for five weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are various other examples of tightening which I do not have time to go into.

If they do not get that, they cannot get unemployment benefits. There are something like 345,000 people on Job Search allowance beyond the six months at this stage, or on Newstart. That works out to something like 18 million pieces of paper that have to be obtained from employers in this country in the course of a year. </PARA>

There are many other examples one could go to. I think it is important to note, in looking at the assistance that is given to groups in the Opposition's package, that it shows in various income deciles what the level of assistance would be, and purports to show what real gains would be achieved in various income deciles. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, as I mentioned in Question Time today, theirs is a vision of a society of the future in which not only are people on welfare persecuted but also people in poor bargaining positions in employment have many of their conditions of employment put at great risk. This is an Opposition which in government would seek to strip away the safety net of an award array of conditions and open up people in poor bargaining positions to the exploitation of employers who sought to strip away things such as the entitlement to four weeks annual leave; a 38-hour week, with overtime after that; long service leave; lunch breaks; sick leave; or whatever&mdash;the whole panoply of assistance which is there as a minimum requirement in awards. All of those things would be put at great risk because there would be no protection for people under the industrial relations system proposed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposed industrial relations system which, like the goods and services tax, seems to have been learned substantially from New Zealand would, I believe, cause great hardships to many people in poor bargaining positions, particularly those who are not union members or who belong to unions which have little in the way of substantial bargaining power with employers. Those people would be put in great difficulty in terms of maintaining anything like their living standards. Despite that approach to industrial relations, the Opposition does not see in its scenarios great improvements to productivity or to real wages. In fact, the Opposition sees real wages going backwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The society of the future envisaged by honourable members opposite not only deals harshly with people who need safety nets but also gives maximum assistance to people on the highest incomes. It provides income tax cuts at 4.8 per cent on incomes up to $20,000. Probably most of that tax cut&mdash;indeed, probably more than that&mdash;would disappear in what those people would pay for the goods and services tax. However, for people on $75,000 a year, the income tax cuts would give an after tax benefit of 14.7 per cent. That is about 10 per cent more than people on $20,000. For people on average weekly earnings&mdash;some 66 per cent of wage and salary earners are below average weekly earnings&mdash;the after tax income gain is 6 1/2 per cent. Therefore, for people on higher incomes, the tax is infinitely better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To bias the income tax cuts in that way quite clearly shows the predilections of the Opposition&mdash;the kind of society that honourable members opposite see for the future. This is a society in which more assistance is given to people on the highest incomes and in which people who are genuinely in need are persecuted. That is the kind of society which they would produce. They would prejudice the positions of people with poor bargaining positions while benefiting people with substantial incomes. Honourable members opposite also would benefit higher income people by giving various concessions on the capital gains tax, giving price cuts on the goods that the wealthy buy&mdash;goods such as luxury cars, furs, jewellery and things of that kind, the prices of which would all come down under the tax plans of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the Opposition about one thing: this country needs to go through substantial structural change. Of course, the great lie which comes from the Opposition is that this is not in fact happening, that no structural change of any worthwhile nature is going on&mdash;as though we are living in a society which has been frozen in time, which is as it was when we came into office, in which there has been no effective structural change and which is not undergoing a radical economic change in terms of its structure and its attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, what is happening is that there is the greatest array of structural change that this country has ever seen. I refer to the 60 per cent reduction in protection which has been brought about by Labor governments&mdash;the Whitlam Government cuts and the cuts under this Government. I refer also to the very substantial array of changes to various service industries, making them more competitive. I refer to the telecommunications and aviation industries and the breaking down of highly inefficient arrangements in other areas, such as the waterfront and shipping, where dramatic changes have been taking place. The average crew of an Australian ship has dropped from 33 to 21 in the period that we have been in office. It is still falling. We are seeing increases in productivity on the waterfront of up to 80 per cent to 100 per cent as a result of the introduction of the enterprise employment approach which we have put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing a very substantial change in the nature of the Australian economy. This is supported by a vastly increased array of training measures such as the training levy&mdash;which the Opposition would abolish. We have seen greatly improved education which has meant that the retention rate for school leavers has increased from a bit over 30 per cent to 70 per cent in our period in office, and it is still going up. We are seeing a much better educated and better trained work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly of all, we are seeing a change to a really productive culture, with changes in the workplace such as award restructuring and the adoption of the structural efficiency principle, which has been put in place by the Industrial Relations Commission, and the move to enterprise bargaining, which is a further substantial push in that direction for workplace productivity improvement. These things are actually happening. They are not things that might happen if the Opposition got into office. In fact, those things would probably go backwards at a rate of knots, given the policies that the Opposition pursues. These things are happening very effectively right now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great lie that the Opposition has put to the Australian people is that none of these things is happening. In fact, the record shows that in industry after industry and in case after case we are seeing dramatic change in terms of productivity improvement and the basis on which this country can become internationally competitive once again. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be following the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) in this debate because I suppose that if there has been one person on the Government front bench who, since the departure of the previous Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), has shown himself to be in command of the present Government's agenda&mdash;to the extent that the present Government has an agenda&mdash;that would be the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) who has just resumed his seat. I think that the honourable member has been able to present better than anyone else on the front bench what the Government is supposed to be about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But having just listened to that speech from the Minister, I have to say that it demonstrates the lack of connection with the real Australia that is, I think, a function of this Government. In the speech that we have just heard from the Minister for Finance there was no sense of the pain, anger and urgency which is so evident throughout the Australian community. There are very few honourable members in the House at the moment, but I see that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) is here. I suspect that he, like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, would have had plenty of personal experience of the sort of anger and hurt, the genuine hardship, that is being suffered by so many Australians and the deep sense of frustration at the apparent inability of the Government to give any sense of direction to this country that might see us heading for better times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the last speech indicated, as has every speech from Government speakers in this debate, a government which is out of touch with the real Australia. I would like to take issue with the Minister's description of every change that we have made to social security as some form of persecution of elements of welfare groups. It is amazing, is it not, that the many measures that have been introduced by the Minister for Finance, who is at the table, to target and to tighten welfare are never described by Labor in the same terms? When Labor does it&mdash;when the Government makes it more difficult for the young to obtain benefits, when Labor changes the qualifications for benefits&mdash;it is done in the national interest, to restrain abuse of the system and to make necessary reductions in expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to remind the House that over recent weeks it has been the Opposition that has had to negotiate with the Government for an easing of the assets test arrangements which have been applied to hard-pressed rural families. I welcome the fact that the Government was prepared to make some concessions in an area of its tightening up in order to meet an area of real need. But I will deal later with the approach of the Opposition to these matters. I just want to contrast the sort of attack which is made on the Opposition by the Minister for Finance and his colleagues in this debate and elsewhere with the attitude that they themselves have adopted in regard to structural reforms within the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Minister for Finance said that we do not acknowledge that structural reform is going on&mdash;the reform that is necessary to give this country a chance to compete in a very competitive world which is changing very rapidly and changing far more rapidly than Australia is. I can only say in response to the Minister for Finance that it is summed up in the words of one of Australia's very distinguished economists, Professor Helen Hughes, who wrote an essay that described the changes which were occurring in Australia and put them under the heading `Too little, too late'. That, unfortunately, is the story of Australia over the 1980s. It is not a story of no change. It is true that manning levels on coastal ships have been reduced. It is true that there are some changes on the waterfront. But contrast those changes to the efficiencies which are obtaining elsewhere and we understand why our country is going down the drain. It is not good enough to say we have changed. The only relevant question is: are we as good as the competition which we have to meet?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to be speaking in support of a motion which seeks to censure the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I am pleased because I think the Prime Minister has demonstrated utterly now that he is not living up to the responsibilities of his office. Many years ago when I was a very young lawyer, I went to a service opening the legal year. I remember a quotation that was read in the course of that service and was from the late Dag Hammarskjold, a very distinguished international politician, a statesman really, a man who played a very distinguished role in the United Nations. I think it was taken from his diaries. He said, `If you take a position or accept a position of power and influence, and you are afraid to use your power for fear of losing the position, then you have accepted shadow for substance'. Is not that what we see in the Prime Minister? He is a man who holds the highest political office that can be attained, a man who, I am sure, feels intense pride in having attained that office after a long career of public service in the trade union movement and in politics, yet time and again we see him unwilling to act in the way that he knows is in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why he is unwilling to act is that he must preserve his own position. We have seen it as long ago as 1985 with the casting aside, in the face of trade union opposition, of the Government's own tax reform package which included a broad based consumption tax. We have seen it in so many ways, but look at the dramatic and simple example of uranium policy. It was described by the Prime Minister as illogical, yet he is not game to raise the matter in his own Party's forums, where that illogicality against the Australian national interest could be removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the debate in this place is off-putting to the people of Australia because it does not seem to be connected to their reality. Let me try, therefore, to connect this censure to their reality. I do not think that there is even a small minority of Australians who would oppose the proposition that this country is in serious difficulty. I doubt whether within this chamber there would be a single member of any party who would deny that Australia is in trouble. But the great prevailing feeling in the Australian community is not only that we are in trouble but that our direction is downwards; that there are worse troubles ahead, and we drastically need a change of direction. There is a very strong feeling in the community that Australia cannot afford to go on in the way that it is at present. There is a strong feeling in the Australian community that we have to make real changes, and there is certainly a strong feeling in the Australian community that those changes need to be fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find again that much of the debate that comes from the Government side is a joke. We keep hearing talk of fairness, but the overwhelming reality that is disclosed in this Fightback program is that the people who have borne the burden of this Government's mistakes are not the rich, and they are not in fact the very poor. I publicly acknowledge that there have been useful measures from this Government with respect to those on very low incomes in this country. I acknowledge that it has picked up the family income supplement, which we introduced in 1982, and expanded it greatly. It remains a centrepiece of the Government's assistance to families. We have never opposed it or done other than acknowledge that that is a genuine measure which assists those working families on very low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures, however, are clear and reflect the prevailing feeling in the community that it is the middle income earner, the person trying to meet the normal responsibilities of Australian life, who has borne the brunt. While the very rich have prospered under this Government and made the most enormous gains, the people in the middle&mdash;the man and woman on average weekly earnings with a couple of kids&mdash;have seen a substantial reduction in family living standards, as is recorded in these documents. That is the reality that we face. We bring forward this program on the basis that there is a need for a fundamental change of direction in this country in a whole series of areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Great attention is focused on the tax system and on our proposal to introduce a broad based goods and services tax which will enable massive changes to be made to the taxation system and the lifting of business taxes, which will change the business environment of this country. But there are also changes in other key areas of Australian life. There are changes to the health system, to the education system, and to the welfare system. In each case those changes are tailored to an Australian view&mdash;not just an Opposition view&mdash;that a fundamental change of direction is required. We will have endless debate and the endless raising of a hard case here and a hard case there. And there are always hard cases. There are hard cases when the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Affairs (Mr Howe) makes his changes to social security arrangements. As an ex-Minister in that portfolio, I know that change is impossible without there being hard cases. That is why we put an additional $50m into welfare agencies which will face part of the challenge of meeting those points of difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me quickly look at the health system. There may be satisfaction with the universal coverage of Medicare, but there is great dissatisfaction with the difficulties of access to hospitals. Only recently the aged father of friends of mine in a major public hospital in Western Australia was receiving far less attention than they thought was required. When they raised the matter they were asked, `Couldn't you hire a nurse?'. Hire a nurse in a major public teaching hospital to supplement the deficiencies of that hospital? That is the sort of point we are at. The delays and the problems of those who need medical attention in the public hospitals are manifest, and the parlous condition of the States financially is leading to very stringent measures being imposed upon State hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are trying to do is to change the drift away from private access, which has put unnecessary pressure on the public system, and to restore a situation in which a substantial proportion of Australians can afford private health care. That is a matter worthy of debate from the Prime Minister. But what we get is abuse and evasion and an escape from that debate. I think that the people of Australia universally will welcome a return to providing assistance to those people who self-insure, and for the wealthy who are healthy and who freeload on the Medicare system there will be a penalty, so they will pay more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who would dispute that giving base rate pensioners sufficient financial assistance to enable them to buy access to private health insurance and, hence, access to private hospitals and choice of doctor is a major step forward which will enable a redressing of the imbalance between public and private medicine? This is a major reform aimed at those who need it most. It is a fundamental change in direction in this vital area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now refer to education. We do not have to spend very much time in the community to find the vast dissatisfaction of parents, employers and students with the quality and state of our education system, and so we have a series of reforms being put in place here which go to excellence, to the quality of teachers and which provide a new hope for a much improved education system. Some $3 billion worth of expenditure is committed, a net $2 billion of addition to education. That is partly why we are cutting expenditure in other areas, to provide Australian children with the opportunity to have the sort of quality education that the children of Japan and Germany get, which enables them to participate in economies that really work in this modern competitive world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to welfare. I have at times publicly praised the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, I think once in his presence, and sometimes when he has not been there, for some of the efforts he has made to bring about some necessary reforms in the welfare area. But look at the reforms which we are seeking to undertake and which go to the simple reality that this country had about one million people dependent upon social security in 1971, about 2.2 million in 1982 and about 3.1 million this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other statistics that we can produce. We can produce the fact that social security costs about $5,000 per household. We can produce figures on the disability pension, which show a 66 per cent rise over the period that Labor has been in government&mdash;way out of line with the population rise. We can produce endless statistics that show a drift that most Australians would say is in the wrong direction. We must encourage a move towards greater independence and greater self-reliance whilst maintaining a universal safety net for those in need. This country is not a country which needs to leave any person without support. None of our changes would leave people without the means or the capacity to help themselves without access to benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are saying, with programs such as Job Search, that people ought to be able to plan during their working lives so that if they lose their job they are able to sustain themselves for a few weeks while they look for another job. If people lose their job after having had a lot of bad luck&mdash;they have no savings and cannot look after themselves&mdash;of course they should have access to special benefit. Why not say to the Australian people that in all of these areas we simply wish to turn the system towards a little more independence rather than more dependence?  One has to look at those changes in that broad framework because the people of Australia understand that in this area, as in so many areas of Australian life, something is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gravamen of this censure motion is that we believe these are matters which should have been debated face to face by the Prime Minister, not in the captured time of Question Time where he can simply say anything he likes and get away with it, but in the honest debate that can occur in this chamber. This evasion of debate by the Prime Minister is yet another example of his unfitness to govern this great country. </PARA>

We have just heard a somewhat pompous, even pious, contribution from the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), who wanted to defend the fairness or equity of what it is the Opposition proposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of what the Opposition is about is simply reflected in its summary of the three-year expenditure program in relation to savings as well as increases in outlays. I am particularly interested in the area of social security. Social security is concerned with fairness and equity. It is part of the income transfer system that involves revenue and how fair the revenue system is. Measures such as capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax on that side of the equation have been effectively watered down and made less effective to reduce the burden on wealthier Australians with resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the equation, in social security, where we are protecting those people who are arguably the poorest within our community, we find savings of $2 1/2 billion. If the honourable member for Pearce can find a Labor Budget in which there have been savings of that order, or where that kind of target has been set by the Government, I would like to hear about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the equation and the cruel calculus of what is involved in what the Opposition is putting up, it is essentially asking those people who are the very poorest&mdash;those people who may be on Job Search allowance, the unemployed, those people on sickness benefit, those people who are sole parents with dependent teenage children, those older women who are approaching retirement age and who are now to have their retirement age deferred&mdash;to pay the compensation that would be occasioned by the introduction of a 15 per cent consumption tax. Rather than that compensation effectively coming out of the revenue side of the equation, the Opposition is proposing to dig into social security&mdash;to dig great holes in the safety net&mdash;for the purpose of ensuring that its numbers in relation to compensation can look respectable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see that as fairness. I do not see that in terms of equity. We have already heard in this debate how the changes to be made with respect to the Job Search allowance are essentially designed to achieve savings of $750m. Those savings include, for example, extensions of waiting periods. I do not know whether the honourable member for Pearce knows what a waiting period means from his own experience. Our Government has considered that proposition involving longer waiting periods, but has rejected it. We have rejected it particularly in regard to waiting periods for sickness benefit. That is linked into the notion that people ought to make more use of their disposable savings. Again, the Government has looked at that kind of proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should look at the scale of what the Opposition is really proposing in that area&mdash;savings of $150m, to be achieved by forcing people to dig into their own pockets. Welfare agencies tell us that long term unemployed people, or people who slip between employment and unemployment, simply run down their savings. Not in policy terms, but so that the calculus adds up, the Opposition is saying that those people who are sick ought to run down their savings. It is saying that that is what those people who are unemployed ought to do. That is the imperative that the Opposition is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the question of sole parents, which I raised earlier in the week, and I come back to it for a very serious reason. We made major policy changes in that area. We moved effectively to tighten up the criteria for the receipt of sole parent pension. On the other hand, we made a major reform with the introduction of the jobs, education and training scheme. The Opposition is asking us to restrict the eligibility of women with children in early adolescence, at the stage of puberty, though it will give consideration to extreme cases. Let us look at the difficulty of making that judgment. Who ought to make that judgment about a woman who is caring for a child alone? That is the crucial point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for the Opposition to get sensitive about this matter. Senator Alston, the shadow spokesman for social security, went to his own family and talked about his five children and the fact that his wife had made a decision to go out to work. No-one would criticise that decision. To impose those values on someone else who does not have that degree of freedom of choice, someone who is desperately trying to care for teenage children through a very difficult period, is to make a very insensitive judgment. It is a judgment which, in my view, does not reflect a serious policy basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not that one cannot look critically, as one ought to look critically, at every program. We should not make savings of this order on the basis of a critical, careful look. The Opposition has not been careful because it says that it is all about vision. It is about the big picture. In that big picture that it is trying to paint, it is being absolutely insensitive. It is being careless about the lives of people. That is why one talks about fairness and equity. When governments make decisions they ought to be the opposite; they ought to be careful about the judgments they make on what the impacts of their policy might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) has come into the chamber, let me move to an area of policy outside of social security.

We will no longer be able to talk about 8 per cent of GDP and make a comparison with the United States' 12 per cent of GDP, because our GDP is going to go up. Why? Because the doctors are going to get their way&mdash;they are going to get control of the system, they will be just like Dracula in charge of the blood bank. They are going to be in charge of the system, together with the health insurance industry&mdash;in cohorts with one another&mdash;and the victims are going to be the ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not have any illusions about this package in regard to health.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) leaves the chamber, if he has a real concern for the people he claims to represent in his portfolios, including health, I ask him to consider a couple of matters which are relevant to his own remarks. Firstly, he boasts so proudly about containing health costs, but he does not tell you that he achieves it by amputating old ladies' legs, that he achieves it by denying people access to hospitals. That is true and I can give the Deputy Prime Minister the evidence. It happened recently in my electorate. The Minister skulks out of the chamber, as he should. What is so special about saving money if that is the way you are going to achieve it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Prime Minister talks about saving money. He quoted his expenditures as a percentage of GDP&mdash;not as a percentage of taxes collected by his Government. Of course, we can keep numbers down as a percentage of GDP. This Government has grossly inflated GDP in this country, not as a result of the productivity of our factories and our workers, but by borrowing money from the rest of the world. The evidence is there to be seen. That is what this Government has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up until 1989 there has been an 89 per cent growth in GDP and an 8.9 per cent growth in productivity. In other words, we have a debt led recovery which has caught up with us, as all debt funded programs do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get down to the reality of the Deputy Prime Minister's comments about saving money on health. When Medicare was introduced, the Federal Government was spending approximately 9 per cent of all tax collected on health. At that time it was also spending about 9 per cent of all tax collected on education. Today it still spends 9 per cent on education and there is evidence of what is happening to our education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We boast that things are as good as they were in 1971&mdash;but the world has run away from us in that time in the skills and training it is providing. Expenditure was 9 per cent in 1983 and it is 9 per cent today, but the 9 per cent of health expenditure has grown to 15 per cent of the tax dollar today. People pay dearly for that in not being able to get their kids into university and not getting the proper services that might be available in other areas. If the Government believes that expenditure is evidence of success, it might be able to argue that it has had a wonderful success; but as the expenditure has grown, so have the waiting lists in our hospitals. The Minister says, `That's a good thing. Everything is okay. Your policies'&mdash;which set out to redress some of these aspects, which set out to let pensioners, when their feet are going gangrenous, actually go to private hospitals with empty beds&mdash;`are wrong'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating a motion to censure the Prime Minister; we should talk about that, not the silly amendments brought forward so the Government can deliver on its numbers in this place. I remember the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) once complaining that justice resides in the numbers in this place. He will get many lessons about that sort of justice within the next 18 or 20 months. We are debating a motion to censure a Prime Minister who is practically the ultimate example of today's union bureaucracy: `It is my job that matters, mate, not yours'. That is happening throughout the union bureaucracy today. We have a new union bureaucracy that is all about its importance and keeping its influence and its jobs, with not much care for the workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this very moment in my electorate&mdash;and I have been dealing with it on the phone, and I am pleased to say that there will be some writs out today&mdash;the Transport Workers Union, which could not get its own members to strike, had the AWU impose a secondary boycott. The boycott is still going on because some little bloke has paid his air fare up to Geraldton and believes that before he leaves he should prove he is worth his wages. That is what the union bureaucracy stands for today. It runs this Labor Government, with 64 per cent voting on preselection. No wonder that when the unions tell the Government to jump, the Government asks, `How high?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Prime Minister's concern is no longer about his union job or his union importance; he puts his own job ahead of the one million unemployed as he stumbles around. He is now a tired old man. When I called on you yesterday, Mr Speaker, to put him out of his misery, I did it with some sympathy, because he certainly needs to be removed from this place, and the sooner the better, because Australia in the next 18 months cannot afford him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has released its Fightback policy. That policy has the support of the business community, the media, most of the general public and, I understand from questions asked here today, the Government's own Public Service. Minister after Minister stood up today and said, `I haven't seen it. What are you talking about?'. I know why they have not seen it. They have shot the messenger. They do not want to see it. They do not want to be told the truth. They are happy and they do not want to be confused by the facts. So what have they done?  They have gone back to good old-fashioned rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take honourable members' minds back into the history of trade union bureaucracy. Burnt on my mind until the day I die is Bill Kelty's speech after the Industrial Relations Commission rejected accord mark VI.

He did not say, `If we let them get away with it, the conditions of our members will be eroded' or `Our members need more money'. No, he said, `We will lose all our power'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Power hungry&mdash;and do they not have some power? The Government does not want to know what its public servants are telling it and has slipped back to rhetoric. Government members keep coming out with the nice one-liner&mdash;and we will hear plenty of them&mdash;that the Fightback policy is a policy for the rich and not the poor. I have read the policy, and I have in front of me a summary of it. On two pages I have identified 15 separate examples of where the Opposition imposes assets tests, means tests and other income caps on many of the measures it provides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, quite properly, will give people tax breaks on interest earned on money they save, but only married couples who earn less than $50,000 or individuals on $25,000. The family allowance is doubled for families with combined incomes below $30,000. That is hardly catering for the rich. There is an increase of 50 per cent on the family allowance for people earning from $30,000 to $40,000. The family allowance supplement is increased by 6 per cent, with all the normal means tests applicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dependent spouse rebate is increased by $300, limited to people on incomes up to $75,000. That is generous, I admit. The dependent spouse rebate is increased, but only for families on incomes up to $50,000. There is funding of $50m to welfare agencies. Are welfare agencies going to give that to the rich? Of course not. The first home owners scheme gives $2,000 to young families with an annual household income of up to $40,000. Are they rich? The Opposition's package gives tax rebates of up to $800 for people over 65 if they receive an income of less than $14,500. They are hardly wealthy elderly people. There are other tax rebates for middle aged people, but only low to middle income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other side of the equation is: who gets the tax penalty? It is the high income earners who will not take out private health insurance. I cannot speak for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) or the Minister for  Science and Technology (Mr Free), who are in the Parliament at the moment, but I know two losers on that arrangement. One is the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) and the other is the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh), because they do not have private health insurance. The family income of the honourable member for Phillip is about $300,000 a year, and she proudly stands up in this place and says, `I bludge on Medicare because I am philosophically aligned with it'. She rushes down to the public hospital and keeps more needy people back in the queue. She says, `I take my turn'. High ranking public servants or politicians never take their turn. They do not even have to lift the phone because other people make the arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a new elite under a socialist system. I have seen it in Russia. I can identify a couple of losers: people who get the best hospital treatment under Medicare because they are very important persons and they do not pay the extra for it. To the credit of the Prime Minister, whom we censure today, Hazel keeps him in private insurance, as he admits, and they go to a private hospital. On their salary, so they should. The Government should not tell me about looking after the poor when its own members in this place shoulder the poor out of the queues at public hospitals. I hope the two Ministers here will speak. They might tell us whether they are in the same situation&mdash;philosophically committed to bludging on Medicare. That is what we are on about, and we will change things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course we had the other bit of rhetoric today. I am glad that I do not suffer from hay fever because today I got a whipping with a feather from that lot opposite and it would have been only the dust that would have done me any harm. I do not know what the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) was on about when he was reading comparisons between New Zealand pages and our pages. We say in the front of our policy document that we have copied a lot of the detail from the New Zealand practice&mdash;and I can tell those opposite that, if they went to Italy or to Germany, they would find most of those words written in Italian or German. They are words used internationally where VAT operates. But the Government members thought they were on a big deal, laughing and joking at this, when all they were telling us was that some of the actual operating procedures of a GST as we propose it are written in the same words as in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just been talking about some of the philosophical steps that we have taken. In the last couple of minutes, let us talk about labour. Let us talk about people out of jobs. Let us talk about working for the dole. There are 125,000 old people in nursing homes. Those opposite would think it an outrage to send 125,000 unemployed people to pay a visit to those old people one afternoon. I think both might benefit: it would be wonderful for the old people and it might be salutary for the young; they might just learn something from those old people; they might learn something from giving some community service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) was carrying on today about the tragedy of someone getting a job back at 80 per cent of the wages. I remember a time in the hotel industry when we had a thing called green labour. People got three-quarters of the wages if they had had no experience in the bar. I can tell those opposite that we could not put those people on full wages quickly enough if they were any good; we did not want the bloke down the road to pinch them. But the unions killed that. What was the result? Young people wanting to learn the bar trade had to go and pay money to be taught because they could not get jobs without experience. Big deal! Those opposite really put them in front! They took three-quarters of a weekly wage from them and made them pay cash to learn. I have apprentices in my electorate who cannot finish their time and become tradesmen. They are willing to work for nothing just to finish their time, but the unions will not let them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). In doing so, I simply want to say at the outset that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>launched by the coalition parties is not a vision; it is an illusion. What the package proposes is simply to change the tax mix and to do that regressively, to involve itself in huge cuts in programs and therefore services&mdash;in particular services to those most in need in the community&mdash;and to ensure that as a consequence of the package we end up as a high inflation economy. We would end up as a high inflation economy specifically because the goods and services tax would directly add to our rate of inflation and because the policy proposals of the coalition contain no mechanism for dealing with wages. If there is no capacity to deal with wages policy in an inflating economy, we will simply perpetuate the inflationary spiral because wage claims will be made on future expectations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policy document is put together based on dry economics. It lacks compassion and it certainly will not solve the problems that it says it will. The document is also a dishonest one because in its presentation it simply does not tell the full story. I take the example that this Government has been pursuing this week with the issue of road user charges. I simply want to repeat in this House these circumstances. We have in the document, as well as in statements preceding it, a commitment from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to recover through road user charges the costs of repair and maintenance of our roads system. The contents of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document are quite clear in that regard. But what we saw yesterday was the change to it by press release because the National Party put pressure on the Liberal Party to ensure that there was a clear statement that  no fuel tax would be imposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that, if one looks at the Leader of the Opposition's press release yesterday, whilst ruling out any increase in fuel taxes&mdash;I hope that when he makes those statements in future he is prepared to say, `Read my lips: no new taxes'&mdash;he says that there are other ways to raise the road user charges. He instances two examples in that press release. One is a charge on heavy duty vehicles, which Senator Boswell in another place has already ruled out from a coalition perspective. The other is the so-called hubbing option, which the Prime Minister referred to in Question Time today and which has also in fact been ruled out by one of the coalition front bench. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), in an address to the National Transport Federation in Adelaide in August of this year, clearly indicated that mass distance charges based on hub meters would not be used to achieve the funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a circumstance of the coalition saying that it is committed to user pays in terms of road user charges, identifying three options by which those charges can be raised and, when under pressure, ruling out every one of them. The question has to be asked: if those options have been ruled out, how will the Opposition raise the revenue to fund Australia's roads, particularly against the background of the massive cuts it will make to the Budget according to its document?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one example of where those opposite have not told the full story. The other is in the area of compensation. I refer particularly to this in relation to farm families in this country because the document purports that all people except the rorters of the system will be better off. But, on page 155 of the document, where it refers to the price impact of the goods and services tax by community group deciles, we see tucked away in some of the notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The price effects of the Goods and Services Tax have been estimated using the HES survey . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is the household expenditure survey. It then goes on to explain the technical details of this. In the next note it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of the criterion for inclusion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is for inclusion as a compensation measure&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are insufficient farmers to draw meaningful conclusions about that group.</PARA>
<PARA>So where is the compensation package for farm families in this country, who at the moment are particularly suffering from low incomes? They are suffering from low incomes for a number of reasons&mdash;not just the domestic recession, but world commodity prices at an all-time low, unfair trading practices and drought. Those are the reasons that farm incomes are low. But where is the compensation package in the coalition's document? Do the members of the National Party not really care about a compensation package? There is nothing in the documentation that indicates how farm families, particularly low income farm families, will be better off. Let us remember: under the proposals contained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document, everything those families purchase that is not involved as a business input will be taxed at 15 per cent. Where is the compensation package for farm families?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I want to make relates to the inflationary impact. The document effectively gives up any hope of the continuance of an effective wages policy in this country. I have heard the Leader of the Opposition wax lyrical in this place about dishonesty and asking why we do not tell the truth. We know his own difficulty in reading a competitiveness index, having made the fatal mistake of confusing a plus with a minus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition asserted earlier today in this Parliament that unit labour costs have not fallen under Labor. Let me just remind the House of the change in unit labour costs between 1982-83, when this Government came to power, and 1990-91, the year for which the most recent figures are available. Unit labour costs, if we take the private non-farm corporate sector index, have gone down from an index of 106.6 to 100.7. If we take the non-farm sector index, there has been a fall of almost 10 per cent&mdash;110.1 down to 100.9. On the measures of competitiveness, if we take the CPI based index, there has been an improvement in competitiveness down from 108.7 to 93.7; on the GDP deflated base, down from 106.1 to 89.5; and on the unit labour cost base, down from 110.1 to 91.1. In other words, by any measure of competitiveness, and because of the significant contribution to this country's competitiveness by wages policy and the reduction in unit labour costs, this country is a far more competitive country today than it was when we inherited office from that mob on the other side. That point, if we are talking about honesty and facts, needs to be drummed home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the simple facts of the matter are that wages policy has also been the significant contributor to a lower inflation outcome in this country. By moving the wages system away from building in inflationary expectations, by using the accord processes to distribute outcomes other than through wages&mdash;in other words, the social wage&mdash;we have produced a flexibility that has added not only to our competitiveness but also to a much lower inflation environment. The inflation environment is very important because this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document is predicated on the fact that it will only add to inflation by 4.4 per cent. We dispute that figure. We dispute it because we believe that it is fundamentally flawed in the content of the document, and that flaw will be exacerbated by the lack of a wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is interesting to reflect that in today's edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, an article by Kenneth Davidson pointed out that in the UK and New Zealand, where goods and services taxes were introduced, the consequent inflationary impact was higher than the calculated expectations. That, indeed, was a concern that the Government in 1985 had when, amongst other things, it determined to abandon a goods and services tax or a broad based consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I highlight this is that the inflation figure is fundamental. It is fundamental for two reasons: because of what it does to our competitive position under this Government, which, as I have just indicated, has improved significantly from where it was when we inherited it; and because it goes to the question of the compensation package, as it is against the inflation measure that one has to make the judgment as to whether people are better or worse off as a consequence of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an illusion to say the figure will be 4.4 per cent, because it will not be realised, and then to calculate one's adjustments, one's compensating mechanisms, based on a false figure. It is also dishonest for the Leader of the Opposition to assert that under this Government real wages have been cut, because the measure is not, in the end, real wages. What matters to people is the take home package, which is a combination, as a consequence of the accord mechanisms, not just of wage movements but of social wage movements, of taxation cuts and of superannuation improvements. It is that package of measures, living standard improvements, against which the real measure has to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document would throw all that out the door. It would demonstrate an incapacity to deliver wages policy, because members opposite simply cannot talk to the trade union movement. They have almost a pathological hatred for the trade union movement and, therefore, are incapable of developing a sensible wages strategy with it. But, in addition to that, even if they were capable of doing it, where is the capacity for the social wage trade-off in circumstances in which they are going to cut massively into Budget outlays and, in particular, into those areas that deliver the social wage outcomes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has embarked on a radical program of structural reform and we will continue to develop it. In the micro-economic reform area, there have been significant improvements in competitiveness and productivity in the stevedoring and shipping industries. Just as an example of that, particularly as it relates to my sector&mdash;and I have not heard anyone on the Opposition side talk to us recently about productivity improvements &mdash;the Chief Executive of the Wheat Board issued a press release back on 6 November saying that Australian ports, as a result of the reforms that have been undertaken, are now amongst the most efficient grain loading ports in the world. The average time taken to turn a vessel round has gone down from 4 1/2 days to 2.4 days. The estimated savings to the wheat industry will amount to $10m a year. That is micro-economic reform in action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet members opposite are blinkered and blinded to the perception or the understanding of the improvements that are taking place. They should get out and speak to some of the managers of grain terminals, and also coal loaders up in Newcastle, to see the significant reforms that have been brought about because of sensible industrial relations practices, driven by wages policies and commitments to undertake improvements in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vision of this Government is one that is built around improvements in living standards for this country based on economic growth&mdash;economic growth that will be delivered as a consequence of sensible macro-economic policies, continuing improvement in micro-economic policies, and also the development of pro-active industry development strategies. The benefits of those outcomes, the benefits of those reforms, will be equitably distributed. The fundamental difference between us and the other side is that we understand the need to distribute the benefits with compassion rather than just in terms of those who happen to have the biggest snout in the trough. </PARA>

Supposedly, it gave them detailed estimates of what would be in the coalition's final GST package. If the Government, as now appears certain, was relying on this document to build upon its strategy to attack the coalition, it is no wonder that we felt compelled to move a censure motion that the Government has failed to respond to the Fightback program in any detailed fashion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let me turn to other pages of the Government's document to show how ridiculous it was in preparing for the Fightback package. The Government says on one page that the GST will affect a whole range of business. It gives us the example of licensed clubs. It says that there will be a gambling tax. The Government is wrong. Gambling is exempt from the GST. It goes on to list where the GST will apply on medical services. It says that there will be a tax on doctors' visits, a tax on pharmaceuticals, a tax on diagnostic services and a tax on pathology. It is wrong. Medical services and health generally are zero rated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But really the distortions of the whole GST debate are nowhere more amplified than in the section headed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Effect of a GST on Regional Australia</EMPHASIS>. It says this:</PARA>

<PARA>We are abolishing the wholesale sales tax system. That represents 20 per cent off the cost of a rig, the cost of tyres, the cost of batteries, the cost of lubricants and the cost of repairs. Moreover, we are abolishing fuel excise. Because fuel for a truckie and the freight industry at large is a business input, the whole 26c will be rebatable. The Government's document goes on under the same heading to state:</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A GST regime will not allow the advantages of tax averaging.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>That is wrong. The GST package of the Opposition allows for the continuation of tax averaging. This document is ridiculous, I will read out a few more examples to show just how wrong the Government has got it, how hopelessly prepared it is for any sensible debate on the GST or tax reform more generally. The paper goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Hewson has said private school fees will be exempt but everything bought by schools (which costs more in remote areas) will be taxed&mdash;currently they are not taxed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is wrong. Education is zero rated. All inputs for schools will be rebatable. It goes on and on, and the inaccuracies totally and utterly discredit this long, and presumably carefully prepared, working document for each and every member of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have now got to the stage where the Opposition has had leaked to it a document of over 60 pages analysing the Fightback package. Quite frankly, it is necessary reading for anybody who wants to assess the value and worth of the Fightback package. In it, by and large, the Government's advisers support the Fightback package. They say, for instance, that things such as the 8 per cent compensation for pensioners appear to be adequate. Remember that that backs up our claim that we have been overcompensating social security beneficiaries. It goes on to say in this leaked document, which was prepared by highly paid public servants, who have no doubt enriched themselves by working the amount of overtime required of them, that under the new superannuation policy contributors will be better off, particularly low income earners. Again, this Fightback package is directed towards low and middle income earners and families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the Government analysis finds that the new superannuation arrangements involve possibly a lower revenue cost on health. It states that the reduction of the Medicare rebate to 75 per cent will have a similar impact on the Government to the Government's $5 benefit reductions from 1 November 1992. The hypocrisy of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) is revealed, because under our package people will be in the same position as they will with the Government's imposition of the $5 benefit reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the Government analysis predicts that the package may benefit State governments because of the anticipated reduction in the pressure on public hospitals which will follow the introduction of our health policy. Of course, the public servants really have no choice but to concede that equalising the top marginal rate and the corporate rate will cut tax avoidance, as we have claimed. The Government's document goes on and on giving a remarkable endorsement to the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Government said last Thursday when the package was released that it would not make wild accusations, that it would resist the temptation to shoot from the hip. Yet in the time since then we have had nothing but gross generalisations without any reference to fact or accuracy. Now we find, firstly, that the Government's preparation was utterly inaccurate and, secondly, that the Government's own public servant advisers are tendering advice that the Fightback package by and large is of benefit to the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That should come as no surprise to Australians who have made the effort to understand it&mdash;and, quite frankly, how could anyone not understand it given the blanket media coverage of the particulars of the tax and economic reform package entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>. It is true that the Government was stunningly ill-prepared for the release of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>, and I have no doubt it will continue to fail to make any serious and sustained criticism of either the calculations or the philosophical content of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there has also been another major reaction, and that is the acceptance by the community at large. That should not surprise anybody, on reflection, because Australians have been crying out for leadership, for the outlining of a vision, for a very long time now. There would hardly be a member in this Parliament who is unaware of the cynicism and distrust with which politicians generally and political parties particularly are treated. People feel that this country lacks a future, that those of the emerging generation will certainly inherit a lower standard of living than their parents. Consequently people turn to political leaders to provide just that&mdash;leadership&mdash;and they do not get that from the Prime Minister. They now have it from the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compare the Prime Minister to the Leader of the Opposition. Who is more in charge of his political party? Who has a definite view of the direction in which he wishes to lead Australia to the year 2000? Who is prepared to do the hard work and make the hard decisions so as to lay down in black and white the particulars of that vision? One has to conclude that the Prime Minister is tired and worn out and well past his prime and that the Leader of the Opposition is now coming onto centre stage as the hope of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How this must enrage the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), the prime ministerial aspirant, as he sits there on the back benches watching people he knows, as I suspect all of us know, who cannot hold a candle to him in parliamentary debate. If he were totally honest he would have to concede the worthiness of the Fightback package, for it was he who said on 14 June 1985:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we don't as a nation adopt this proposal then you won't see significant reforms in this country in taxation for the balance of this century.</PARA>
<PARA>What do we think he was talking about when he spoke of `this proposal'? He was talking about the broad-based consumption tax he proposed during the tax debate of 1985. He further went on to reflect on the importance of the broad-based consumption tax proposal in these terms on 9 June 1985:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this sort of proposal doesn't get up, one has to decide if there's much point in someone like me worrying about the Australian institutional process, and in Australian institutions, very much longer.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Blaxland understands the critical importance of major government and tax reform as outlined by the coalition. It is just a tragedy, both personal and for the nation, that he will not now, openly and publicly and honestly, congratulate the coalition for doing what he would have wished to have done years ago and which he predicted, if not done, would doom this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, Australia is in political and economic decline and the people in the electorate know that. They are prepared for change; they are willing to shoulder their share of the burden so long as they know that it is equally distributed amongst all sectors and that there are not special mates in government, that there are not special mates in trade unions and that there are not special mates in big business. If this nation is to regain the greatness for which it was once known throughout the world, it must adopt the substantial and fundamental change that the coalition has outlined in the Fightback program. </PARA>

I suspect it will not even get near it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to go back briefly to those Fraser years, we have to remember that nothing took place: the tariff regime remained, no national productivity case took place, there was no wages policy, the third runway did not get built and there was no award restructuring. None of those things happened. But next time around honourable members opposite want to make it happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Okay, so what do they present to us? A beaut package which gets a terrific run, and now we will begin to take it apart. The Opposition thinks it is on a winner here, but it has to defend this package for 15 months and once it is all torn apart it will be left with no clothes on and no hope of winning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three essential propositions in the package, mainly to do with taxation matters. Firstly, the Opposition wants to lower the overall tax burden by cutting government expenditure. The trouble is that government expenditure and the level of taxation in this country is not high by comparison with comparable OECD countries. So this is the great demand for reform from the bloke who sat there for seven years yet could not do it under the Fraser Government.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the key point: `We will cut government expenditure because having money in the hands of the government is useless'. Right? It does not work. The trouble is that by comparison with any other comparable country we are not overly taxed and we do not have an overly large public sector. So what a great reform it is&mdash;it is absolutely useless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is a straw man: `We will get taxes off your back; we will get the Government off your back'. It has not been on the people's back for seven or eight years. It has provided a decent guide, and that is about all. So the first straw man is that the Opposition sets up its scheme and says, `We will look after you, we will get the Government off your back'. But it has not been on the taxpayer's back for eight years; it has not needed to have that kind of impact on the running of this economy because it has introduced all the tax reform that is essential. That is straw man number one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing the Opposition wants to do is broaden the indirect tax base to encompass most services and the rest of the goods not covered by the present wholesale sales tax on goods. If we just had a debate about the comparative merits of a GST and a wholesale sales tax, it would be a decent debate; it really would. It would be a useful debate to have here. We would debate the manner in which we have broadened the impact of the current wholesale sales tax, and the Opposition would be able to say that with the GST it would go further and apply it to services. That is all well and good. The trouble is that it went over the top; it had to try to buy off the small business sector and State governments who for years have been bleating about payroll taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite went a little too far when they introduced their GST: they want to wipe out wholesale sales taxes, but at the same time they want to wipe out payroll tax. The equivalence between a payroll tax and a consumption tax in terms of management of the economy is zilch&mdash;there is absolutely no difference whatsoever in its impact on either the consumer or labour. The whole point of it is that, with straw man No. 2, they want to introduce a new form of indirect taxation&mdash;and it might have been a half decent reform if they had talked only about reforming the wholesale sales tax by means of a GST&mdash;but they want to go right over the top and knock off the payroll tax as well, to no benefit whatsoever other than to appease the view of 10 or 15 years time. Their point was that every State in Australia has payroll taxes and that they are anti-small business. Well, they are not. What is more, they do not apply to more than a moderate percentage of small business in Australia. That is a little bit of politics there that the Leader of the Opposition has attempted to cast upon his own package, and it does not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No. 3 straw man is to shift the tax mix so that a greater proportion of revenue is raised from expenditure rather than from income. We are told that the purpose of that is, firstly, to lift the level of savings in Australia and, secondly, to overcome the black economy. The black economy is a beauty. If a bloke who came into my place to mow the lawn demanded cash for that&mdash;of course, I would not go along with that; I would pay him by cheque&mdash;and if he did not want that income to be known, taxed and tested, under a GST there is no way that that income would be known, taxed and tested. When he spends it he pays tax. So what is the degree by which one can lower the black economy?  By very little indeed. A GST would have a moderate, modest, very small impact on the black economy. I think the Opposition shadow Treasurer said that the black economy runs to about $4 billion a year. We have better estimates to suggest that it runs at about $500m, or half a billion dollars, a year. It is not an inconsiderable amount of money and it should be picked up, but the trouble is that the GST picks up only a minor amount of it. Straw man No. 3 is that the GST does not do a great deal to fix up the black economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the matter of savings, we already know from experience in other countries that have introduced a value added tax that there has been a negligible shift in the degree of savings. These blokes in the Opposition are the radicals and want to set out to save the Australian economy, but on all three counts they do nothing for the Australian economy. They do nothing by these tax changes to assist the Australian economy. They do nothing for savings. They do very little for the black economy. The swap between a consumption tax and payroll taxes does almost nothing for small business. Then in the first instance they come back with the old shibboleth that we are overtaxed, when in fact we already know that that is untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, of course, they seek to cut the public sector by many billions of dollars&mdash;estimates vary between $4 billion and $10 billion&mdash;when in fact I can assure them, and our front bench can assure them, that we have been doing a pretty decent job of that ourselves in the last seven or eight years. We are at a point now where most analysts would say we are at a bare minimum. We have been able to do it so far because we have means tested the welfare system, and it is a very fair system whereby we distribute moneys to those who need them on the basis of income and assets. There is not a lot more that can be done on top of our welfare base means tested system. We have done it all. So the three straw men add up to a useless policy&mdash;not a radical policy, but a policy that just will not stand up to 15 months of scrutiny. When the time comes and the policy no longer exists because it has been torn apart, we will see that it really is nothing more than a chimera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand and we are terribly unhappy about the level of unemployment in Australia, but at least we can say that for that amount of pain there has been an enormous amount of reform in the Australian economy. Out of the 800,000 or more Australians unemployed at the moment, we know that at least 200,000 are unemployed as a direct result of industry restructuring and of government business enterprises and private business redirecting their efforts into more productive enterprises so that they do not require the same work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a consequence of reforming industry. There is pain. What we must have in place, of course, is a decent training and retraining scheme so that anyone who falls into the pool of the unemployed at least gets out after a decent period; and we have ensured that we do that. But what the Leader of the Opposition claims he wants to do is to continue to reform the Australian economy, but with no pain and with no losers and with an enormous increase in the number of jobs generated in the Australian community. It is not on. It cannot be done. We can openly and readily admit that; we have argued the case that currently a substantial proportion of the unemployed in Australia are a direct result of getting on with the business of making the Australian economy more competitive and more internationally based. Pain is generated when things are changed. We understand that. But those opposite will not admit it. They will not say that to the Australian community. They are not honest enough to suggest that. They say, `Here is a reforming package, but it will cost nothing; it is radical, but no-one will lose. Everyone is a winner. It is win, win, win'. That is a nonsense. We have proved that it is a nonsense. We have to take the political pain of that, but we will take it. We have proved it for seven or eight years as a government and we have made the sorts of reforms that even the Opposition would acknowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that unemployment is so high is a cause for great regret. There are all sorts of reasons for that, of course. Some of them are ours and some of them are caused by other actors in the economy. No-one is happy with the performance of the banks. Their prudential supervision has been pathetic. No-one has been happy with our entrepreneurs. We could not even sell the State governments because their performance has been pathetic&mdash;other than in Queensland, of course. They have not been good. The performance of State governments and State banks has not been good at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In industrial relations, in which the honourable member opposite seems to have a particular interest, ACTU and Government relations cannot be scored at less than eight out of 10. They have been excellent. We may have been slow in the process of award restructuring, if we go back four or five years, but those processes are well under way now. What are these blokes going to offer? Nothing but the sort of Robe River example of industrial relations. That is all they will give us. It will be pathetic. There will not be a dialogue between the ACTU and any future coalition government because the big hairy-chested men of the coalition will fail to provide a decent means of dialogue with the ACTU. Believe me, the ACTU is a considerable power in this economy and those opposite must bring it on side and deal with it. If they want to deal against the ACTU, then their package of straw men will not even get off the ground. It will be battered around the ears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have learned to work with significant other actors in the Australian economy and they have learnt to work with us over seven or eight years. That is why we have got the amount of change in the Australian economy that we can patently prove. That change has brought some pain but the pain will have been worth it&mdash;but only if we are left in government, which the Australian people will do. To change horses now will produce this sort of nonsense package. There is no win, win, win. There is just a chimera that those opposite would really like to be radical and would really like to change the Australian economy. But they do not have it in them. They will not be able to do it.

The Prime Minister today was asked for a vision&mdash;his vision to match the vision of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I can tell honourable members that as he talked to us and the Australian people about his vision, if one looked at the faces beyond the front bench, at any row of the Government back bench, one saw only sombre expressions. Many of those honourable members had their eyes cast to the floor&mdash;some to the side&mdash;but certainly none was interested in the shrill, harsh and uncompromising voice of an irrational Prime Minister who is so consumed by the challenge of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), the ex-Treasurer, that he can no longer govern this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting tonight to hear an interview on the ABC&mdash;the Government's platform for communications. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> tonight, Paul Lyneham had a little chat with our Treasurer (Mr Kerin). Do honourable members remember the Treasurer&mdash;the one who says, `Oh, yes, that's me. I am the Treasurer.'? He is the one who went overseas recently and told the rest of the world that Australia was in the midst of the worst recession for 60 years. He came back to this House and told the members of this House and the Speaker of this House that he had made a mistake. He said that he was wrong and that we were not in the worst recession for 60 years; it was only the worst recession for 30 or 40 years. He said that he was not really sure because the numbers were confusing, but that he had made a mistake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He should not have done that. He should not have confirmed what we have been telling the Australian people now for months on end&mdash;that we are in the worst recession for 60 years. That is the Treasurer who says, `That's me'. That is the bloke. He was on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> tonight. Paul Lyneham welcomed the Treasurer and said, `Good evening, Treasurer, how are you?'. The Treasurer said, `Good evening, Paul'. Paul Lyneham said, `When are you going to resign?'. That set the Treasurer back a bit. He did not have much of an answer for a few seconds. Then he said, `Oh, I don't think I will'. Paul Lyneham said, `You're hopeless, hopeless, hopeless'. Not once did he say it; but he said it three times&mdash;`You're hopeless'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are hopeless, are they not? They are absolutely hopeless. This week has seen the most disgusting performance by a government of this great nation in living recall. Hopeless, hopeless, hopeless! The Treasurer then, under questioning from Mr Lyneham regarding how he was going to respond to the shadow Treasurer (Mr Reith) and his claims for the many benefits that the tax reform package offers to the Australian people, said, `Well, really, Paul, the package is so big it's like trying to discuss the Australian economy'. Is that not a joke&mdash;the Treasurer of Australia saying that the tax reform package, some 600-odd pages put out by the coalition and announced last week by the Leader of the Opposition, is so big that it is like trying to discuss the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer was right; that is what it is all about. It is about the Australian economy. It is about the Australian people. It is about a vision for the future&mdash;not the kind of squeaky hyperbole that we get from an absolutely distraught and discredited Prime Minister. It is about a real vision&mdash;a vision for the future of the Australian people. It is about a vision for families, a vision of hope for individuals, for children, for our elderly, for those who are disadvantaged, and for those who are not. It is about a vision for all Australians that perhaps we can get our act together again and that perhaps we can become more productive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about a package that will assist us along the way, because it might give us a bit of hope. We need a bit of hope.

No, there is not much hope out there today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this debate we heard from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). The Minister said, `I have developed a bit of a thick skin'. I would think so. Considering his record in this place, considering his performance and considering the amount that he cops, I would think that his hide would be a bit thick. We would all think that. He is one of those opposite who are sort of sitting in the wings&mdash;challenging the Prime Minister? If the honourable member for Blaxland does not get up, perhaps the Minister for Employment, Education and Training will, because it is for sure that the former chook farmer, the now Treasurer, ain't going to make it. That is obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard tonight on the ABC that the Prime Minister is considering changing the Treasurer. That is not like changing one's underwear. We just did that, did we not? We shifted the honourable member for Blaxland from the front bench to the back bench. And he is supposed to be the Government's best performer! That makes a lot of sense, does it not&mdash;front bench to back bench? We took the chook farmer and we made him Treasurer. He is the one who says, `That's me; I'm the Treasurer'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand that the Prime Minister is not very happy with the Treasurer.

The Minister for Employment, Education and Training will have the job, if anybody will let him have it. I think he is running down the middle now. He is trying anyway. He said that the Government had 15 months to take apart the coalition's policy bit by bit. I tell the Minister for Employment, Education and Training that it will take all of that&mdash;every little bit of it&mdash;and you will not get there. Do you know why? Because it is a comprehensive package. It is designed to assist Australians. It is designed to give them hope and vision for the future. That is what the people out there want. That is what the people on the street want. They want a bit of encouragement. People are sick to death of doom and gloom. All we get from the Treasury side of this House is doom and gloom. I ask the Government not to blame us for talking down this economy. Goodness gracious, it is the Government that has talked down the economy&mdash;constantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister talked about a new tax&mdash;a goods and services tax&mdash;to be put on the sweated backs of ordinary Australians. What a remarkable statement for a Minister of the Crown to make&mdash;a Minister who admits that he has a bit of a thick skin! It is more like a buffalo hide. It would want to be too because the goods and services tax is designed to get rid of seven taxes that are impeding industry, that are holding back jobs, that are iniquitous and that hurt the Australian people. Of course, we are going to introduce a goods and services tax, because it is fair, sensible and will introduce major reform to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take a couple of minutes to give a cheerio to Dominic Romano, a constituent of mine in the electorate of La Trobe. He lives in Kalorama, which is at the top of Mount Dandenong. He came to see me a couple of weeks ago. He is in the textile, clothing and footwear industry, and he has a few problems. Dominic is about 34 years old and has been in the TCF industry all his life. He has just gone through one company because it has gone bye-byes. He is with a second company and he reckons it is not going to last very long. He said to me, `Mr Charles, since the Government brought down the March economic statement the banks will not even talk to us. We might as well be dead. We can't borrow money. We can't get any credit. We are in real trouble. Why is the Government trying to destroy the textile, clothing and footwear industry?'. I told him that I could not answer that because I did not know why the Government was trying to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dominic said, `Your side, the Opposition, wants to get rid of tariffs too. You said you are going to reduce tariffs to negligible levels by the year 2000'. I told him that was right but that there was a difference between the Government policy of simply getting rid of the tariffs with a scorched earth policy and a level playing field, and our policy that offers some hope for the future. I told him that the hope we offer him is a real change in the industrial relations climate that will allow him to reduce his costs and will allow his performance to increase. I said the second thing we would do would be to reduce input costs in communications, in transport and in shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dominic then asked how we were going to help him when he is not able to compete with South East Asia because of labour costs. He said that his equipment is modern&mdash;the best there is; his people are well trained; and his firm spends a lot of money on training&mdash;but it still cannot compete. The problem he faces is that his company has to run 24 hours a day in order to be competitive with a like mill in South East Asia weaving the same cloth. In order to be competitive he needs to be able to run three shifts over the 24 hours but the unions will not allow him to run more than two shifts over the 24 hours. This means that he has to pay eight hours overtime per day in order to get the cloth woven. He cannot run three shifts, with three lots of people, at reasonable wages. Why not? Because the unions say so, and the unions control the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to reduce tariffs to negligible levels because we know that tariffs are distorting and create inefficiencies. Goodness knows we have enough inefficiency in our industries in this great nation. But we will offer Dominic some hope because we will make real changes to the industrial relations system, not Claytons changes. With the recent national wage case decision on enterprise bargaining, everybody has picked up the coalition's rhetoric. In 1986, after decades and decades of talking about change, the Liberal and National parties finally reached a decision to change their industrial relations policy by proposing to deregulate the labour market with voluntary employment agreements, introduce voluntary union membership and so bring about the end of the closed shop, and initiate the vote before people strike and secret ballots. That was a succinct policy change. Now listen to the rhetoric. The ACTU talks about voluntary employment agreements. Even the Labor Party talks about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 30 April the Industrial Relations Commission said that nobody was mature enough to make voluntary agreements, but on 30 October it said, `Okay, away you go, boys'. But it has brought down a Claytons enterprise bargaining system&mdash;people are not able to negotiate their own wages, their hours of work, long service leave, superannuation entitlements, Workcare or any other matter. All people can do is add to wages. Maybe a deal can be done to pay workers more, but they cannot get rid of any of the conditions that exist today because there are awards. The great union movement in this country fought for decades for the rights of their members to get those awards. Even though the unions represent only 30 per cent of the labour force in the private labour market, nonetheless the unions control the agenda. There is no enterprise bargaining. The Opposition will give people enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to close my brief remarks by saying that I condemn the Prime Minister because he is weak. The Treasurer is weak. The whole blessed front bench is weak, and the back bench knows it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after `That' be deleted and the following inserted: `this House censures the Leader of the Opposition for perpetrating a massive fraud on the people of Australia with the launch of his Fightback document which will increase unemployment, increase inflation, wreck economic recovery and shift the burden of taxation from the very rich to middle and low income Australians'.</PARA>
<PARA>The snake oil salesmen of the Opposition are at it again, promising Australians that a consumption tax is a panacea for Australia's economic problems. We are told it will reduce unemployment, encourage savings and reduce our foreign debt. If applied correctly, it will even cure baldness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In what has been a massive confidence trick, we have seen the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) traversing the countryside, preaching the benefits of his goods and services tax. While some honourable members in the Opposition see him as a messiah, the truth is that he is a false prophet. He was even seen having lunch at McDonald's in Parramatta. It is a good thing he has a Commonwealth car driver because it is very unlikely that he would know where Parramatta is. It is this very hypocrisy which permeates the Opposition's economic policy. It does not care about low to middle income earners. Indeed, the GST does very little to assist low and middle income earners, while people in receipt of social security benefits or superannuation funds will be crushed. A GST will do nothing to help achieve social justice and equity. It is a recipe for disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the Leader of the Opposition and the rump that is the National Party have gone out to the Australian people and told them half-truths. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) should well remember the fate that befell his predecessor. Once rural electors realise the full impact of a GST, the same fate will await many members of the National Party. The Leader of the National Party has sold out his constituency. His performance has earned him the name `Opium', because opium is a slow-working dope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GST will, however, be a bonus for those on high incomes. These people will pay significantly less as the cost of luxury items will fall. A luxury car will be thousands of dollars cheaper, but bread will cost more. In other words, the Opposition is saying, `Let them eat cake'. A consumption tax is regressive. Its impact is greater on those on fixed and low incomes. It does nothing to promote equity and fairness. The cost of everyday items will increase. Bread, milk, fruit and vegetables will all increase in price. These are not what one would consider to be luxury items but rather necessities of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any successful tax system must be progressive, not regressive. The greatest burden of tax should fall upon those who can most afford it, not those who are the most disadvantaged. A consumption tax will greatly benefit the rich constituents of the Opposition but will do little to benefit the McDonald's family restaurant customer at Parramatta. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The falseness of the Opposition's package is best highlighted by its claim to compensate pensioners by increasing pensions by 8 per cent to 28 per cent of average weekly earnings. The simple fact is that pensions are already 26.4 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic gurus of the Opposition will have us believe that a GST will encourage savings. The fact is that people will have less money to save because they are spending more on the necessities of life. Perhaps the Opposition believes that people will be saving more because they will be eating less. It should try telling those who are unemployed that they will be able to save more when, in reality, they will be forced to pay more for everyday goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GST is an octopus that will spread its tentacles into the pockets of all Australians. It will not differentiate between rich and poor, unemployed or retired. It will serve only to widen the gap between rich and poor and create a new class of poor. Indeed, many Australians will be treated as second class citizens. The Opposition's package gives with one hand but takes with the other. It resembles the iron fist hidden within the velvet glove. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once the shallow rhetoric of the Opposition has been exposed, people will realise the inherent dangers associated with the GST. If the tax cuts promised by the Opposition are real, where will the Government find the money to meet its ongoing commitments? The answer is obvious. The Opposition has made it perfectly clear that those in receipt of welfare benefits will be its main target. Unemployment benefits will be cut off after nine months and the supporting mother's benefit will be cut off after children reach 12 years of age. We will see the gradual phasing out of Medicare and full fees for tertiary students. The list goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, members of the Opposition would severely cut back the role of government. The services provided by the Government would be abolished or privatised, given to their mates, as is the case in New South Wales. The Government's role would be that of economic manager. We all know what a disaster New South Wales Incorporated has been. The people of New South Wales deservedly showed their displeasure at the last State election. That is the model that the people of Australia need to look at&mdash;the conservative Greiner Government. That is what this Opposition holds for the future of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A GST will cause more problems than it will solve. We should just look at New Zealand where the ranks of the unemployed have increased dramatically. The black economy would flourish as a GST will give more people incentive to find ways of avoiding paying tax. Why should a motor mechanic charge a customer 15 per cent tax for repairing his car if the person is willing to pay in cash? It is mutually beneficial for both parties to deal in cash. The mechanic does not have to declare his income, while the customer does not have to pay tax. So much for stamping out tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GST will impact on all services. It will, therefore, impact on inflation. The cost of electricity, water, rates and gas will all increase, while the consumer will receive no extra service. Local councils will be forced to either cut back or abolish services. The grand vision for Australia suddenly turns sour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's manifesto is not a fight back; it is a slide back.

Let the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party come clean with the electorate and tell them of their true intentions. </PARA>

For the last eight years people have wondered where this country was going. For the last two years they have known where it is going&mdash;nowhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years ago the Opposition commenced the most far-reaching analysis of public opinion ever conducted by any party in the history of this Federation. After the last election we knew that the time had come when men and women in this Parliament, representing the Australian people, including their children, had to be seen to be concerned about the realities of their lifestyle and their future. During the past eight years Labor has allowed these arrogant men and women to believe that the interests of the ordinary workers of Australia are no longer relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went out to those people&mdash;a quarter of a million Australians&mdash;and we asked them what they wanted. They told us that above all they wanted a new sense of purpose, a new sense of direction, a sense of leadership and pride in their country. They wanted a belief in the future for their children. These were concepts which for far too long we have tended to take for granted. One of those people said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present Australia's international reputation is at an all time low. Our economy is weak, our trade position is weak, our people seem without direction, with no goals and no real urge to concern themselves for the future.</PARA>
<PARA>It was on the basis of that advice that the Opposition parties and particularly the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) were determined to give the Australian people a sense of direction, a sense of leadership, a belief in themselves and in the future of this great country of ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over that period we have developed the most consistent and detailed analysis that has ever been put before the Australian people in the form of the well-known Fightback program. One may well ask: why do we use the word `Fightback'? One does not need to be a genius to see why. It is a word which has emotive appeal and the ability to say to people, `Let us get together and work this country so that once again we can achieve the greatness we know we are capable of'. We want the capacity to change the direction of Australia so that we do not talk about one million people unemployed and hundreds of thousands of wives and children whose daily economic lifestyle has been so severely affected. It means that once again we can say to all the people of Australia, `Here are the opportunities. Here is the chance to make a real contribution to this nation and to yourselves. Here is an opportunity to turn around lowering living standards which you have seen over the last eight years. And here is the opportunity to create two million new jobs by the year 2000 for Australia's unemployed'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This program is for the 30 per cent of young Australians who believe they have no future, who cannot understand what it is that they have done wrong. The only mistake they made was to be born Australians. What an incredible indictment upon any government&mdash;that above all else it failed the youth of this country. When the Government is supposed to be creating a future, for the last two days we have seen the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) do nothing but mewl about the past and about the achievements of his Government, which is now on the ropes. He has no sense of direction, no sense of purpose, no goals and no future. And Government members wonder why the Australian people seek change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most important statistic that has appeared in the press in the past two weeks has been the one setting out public opinion in relation to the Fightback package. Whereas less than 50 per cent of people often said, `Maybe there is not a direct benefit for me', some 56 per cent of the people said, `We believe it is good for Australia'. They were saying to this Government, `We are no longer satisfied with a group of people who cling to power for no other purpose than to look after the interests of themselves and their mates. We want a sense of direction for this nation. We are prepared to make sacrifices, provided we know where we are going and provided we can see at the end of the road a future for ourselves and our children'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback package was announced in an environment where there is a desperate need for change. We have given the people a program more detailed than ever before in the history of this Federation. We are talking about regenerating the economy to increase national productivity and to reduce foreign debt. We are talking about creating more jobs, particularly for young Australians, about improving living standards and restoring financial security for all, about promoting international competitiveness for our industries so that our country can once again match the best that the world has to offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the need to improve incentives to individuals and to business by lightening the tax burden. We have heard tonight from members of the Government that Australia's tax system is low in comparison with those in other countries. How is it that nobody believes them? I will tell them why. Because there is no incentive to work hard in this country, when people on average weekly earnings do a few hours overtime and find themselves rocketing into the maximum marginal rate of tax. We are offering exactly the opposite. We are saying to the workers of Australia, to those millions and millions of people who want to get up and build this nation, `Under our program, 95 per cent of all Australians will pay less income tax and the vast majority will pay less than 30c in the dollar'. That is what we are saying, in direct contrast to the Government. We are also saying to people on average income, `You can double your income and you will not increase your direct income tax'. That is the model we are offering the Australian people. All the evidence is clear&mdash;the Australian people will see the virtue of those fundamental changes.</PARA>

Is that asking too much of the descendants of people who in the past have fought against fire and flood and drought and all the other difficulties of nature, and have won? Of course not. We are going to lead Australia forward, based upon one simple principle, that this nation can survive only if it is prepared to work its way out. For far too long, under all governments, we have encouraged the belief in this nation that we can have one of the highest standards of living in the world, provided somebody else pays for it.

It is a war where it must be absolutely clear to the Australian nation that we know what victory will bring us, we know what the task is that has to be done, and we know how we are going to achieve that objective. That is why this document of over 600 pages sets out in the most detailed manner, step by step, the decision making process, the outcome of those decisions, the role of every individual in our society to fit in, and the role of businesses especially&mdash;for them we offer no less than $20 billion less taxation&mdash;because we know that if we are going to create jobs for Australian workers, fundamentally they must come from the private sector. We are talking about streamlining the public sector in such a way that the people in the sector will be involved in doing a worthwhile job and will be proud of what they do, while ensuring that those areas of the public sector which could best be handled in the private sector should be there in a competitive environment. </PARA>

But the Government cannot even get its industrial relations policy right, because this Government is, as it has always been, a creature of the trade union movement, particularly the ACTU. Employers and employees in this country must be able to negotiate, face to face, in the interests of the business which employs those people, in such a way that they will benefit from that employment. </PARA>

It is very sad, but there are still large segments of the trade union movement which will say to their workers that this class war must be the very basis of Australian society. If we are not prepared to stand together and face the massive economic and social problems before us, we must surely perish as a nation, and we will go into history as the people who had so much and failed when the ultimate test came before them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that taxation is such an important part of this total package.

Why? For two obvious reasons.

With a lack of understanding so typical of the Opposition, this package proposes to halt the sole parent pension when the youngest child in such a family turns 12 years of age. The sole parent could be male or female. As many members of the Opposition should realise, the child was not formed through immaculate conception, but the sole parent would then be forced to go onto the Job Search allowance and made to find work. Until they can find a job, these parents' incomes would decrease dramatically, at a time when their children would require more money than when they were under the age of 12. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twelve-year-old children are still not old enough to cope with being left at home while their parent goes out to work. The years between 12 and 16 are some of the most formative of a child's life; years when they require not only large amounts of love and understanding but also clothing and essentials. From the age of 12, children can grow anything from an inch to 1 1/2 inches in six months. How could sole parents possibly be expected to keep up with the requirements of their children at this age without financial help?  Page 287 of the Opposition's Fightback package deals with the uniform age pension. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Calculations are based on the assumptions that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;as in 1990-91, around 13,000 women will reach 60 years and will become eligible for the Age Pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;half of these will be women. . . </PARA>
<PARA>What are the other half? When 13,000 women reach the age of 60 and become eligible for the age pension, half of these will be women. I have read the document from front to back and I have not found what happened to the other 6,500&mdash;whether they changed sex or just failed to exist. But this is the type of document that the Opposition is quoting as being so fair and logical to the electorate at large. It is a shallow document. It is a document that has been miscalculated and it is a document, in its presentation, that will be tried for what it really is&mdash;a document of deceit and illogical representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Judging from the Opposition's package, it seems to think that not only these women, but particularly sole parents, are second-class citizens. It probably says, `We don't need them. We don't need to consider them. They probably didn't vote for us; therefore we will not do anything to help them.' Under the coalition's package, sole parents would not be allowed even the opportunity to opt for parenting in a full time capacity. However, the Opposition would increase the dependent spouse rebate so that it would be easier for the dependent spouse to stay at home and look after the children full time. This wonderful Opposition scheme is an obvious case of discrimination against sole parents, who would be forced to work after their children turned 12 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further in this wonderful <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document I have noted the changes to the family allowance supplement. In the event of this package being implemented, 31,000 sole parent incomes would be cut off immediately. Statistics tell us that the average family contains 2.1 children. I have always wondered where the 0.1 is, but that is what statistics tell us. That means that this policy would disadvantage immediately more than 70,000 children just because they have reached that magical age of 12. These children are our country's future. Why should they be disadvantaged purely because they are being brought up by one parent? Nowhere in the document does it refer to whether a sole parent has been widowed, is in ill health, divorced or whatever. The coalition simply would not tolerate a sole parent receiving any type of assistance to bring up children over the age of 12. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this Hawke Government, a sole parent with two children over 12 years&mdash;say 12 and 13 or 12 and 14&mdash;can earn through part time work $250 and receive on average $140 per week as a part pension. However, under the coalition's Fightback package&mdash;should it ever have the opportunity to introduce it&mdash;such a parent with those two children and who continued to do part time work and earn that $250 would get a mere $30 per week in assistance. Such a person would then be faced with a 15 per cent goods and services tax. How would such people survive? Such policies would only promote poverty in the community and would certainly destroy families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fervently believe that the Opposition's total lack of understanding of the problems faced by sole parents was further emphasised recently in a radio interview with Senator Alston. The senator had the gall to say that sole parents should go to work to help them to find a partner. How insulting! Since when has Senator Alston been qualified as the perfect matchmaker? I am truly amazed that policies such as those presented in this package are being seriously supported by those members opposite. Surely they know people within their electorates who unfortunately have become sole parents. Surely they know people in their electorates who would be made destitute by the introduction of the type of package that has been thwarted around Australia at large in the last few days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also truly amazed that policies such as these are even being seriously contemplated. It was pleasing to read in a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Catholic Weekly</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is five years since the consumption tax was introduced in New Zealand. The claim of the advocates of the tax that it is a significant step in overall economic reform are not borne out by the experience across the Tasman.</PARA>
<PARA>We know that a lot of this package has been copied from New Zealand. It was clearly emphasised today that a 1985 statement had been taken verbatim and placed in the Fightback package as launched by the Leader of the Opposition. The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Though we have seen some economic problems, by comparison with New Zealand, the Australian economy is a bonanza.</PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many small business people who are inclined to support the proposal would have second thoughts when they realise that they will become unpaid tax gatherers for the Government. In New Zealand there are 300,000 businesses now involved in that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the population of Australia is more than five times that of New Zealand, that would mean over 1.5 million Australian businesses would become tax gatherers. That is about 20 times the number now involved in the wholesale sales tax system.</PARA>
<PARA>With 1.5 million businesses gathering the tax in a country of 17 million people it would be one of our biggest growth industries&mdash;but the sort of industry that I believe we need like a hole in the head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition also tries to point the finger at our Government for mismanagement. How dare these hypocrites get the words past their mouths? What members opposite have so conveniently forgotten is the vital fact that the economic indicators on which they have so much to say were a lot worse when they were in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The low inflation rate that this Government has achieved through careful planning and economic management would be destroyed by the Opposition's goods and services package. It has been estimated that it could put the inflation rate back up to 10 per cent or even more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the Opposition seriously believe that what it has to offer the people of Australia is fair, just and beneficial to all? It would be disastrous. The Opposition's goods and services package does not provide the solutions to this country's economic woes. It is unfair; it is illogical; it is inflationary; it is regressive; and it is highly unpredictable as it is based on some extremely bold and, dare I say, rash assumptions. Again, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Catholic Weekly</EMPHASIS> report that I mentioned earlier states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reality is that low income people have to spend on goods and services all or most of their income. In the current recession many unemployed people and farmers would be spending more than their income just to exist (with the excess financed by running down their capital or by going into debt). But better off people may spend as little as a fifth or less of their income on essentials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the worst features of this tax is that the burden will be even harder on many middle and low income people. Country people will pay more than their city cousins because goods and services are more expensive in the country because of a large freight component.</PARA>
<PARA>For retired people or those who are about to retire, the increased inflation rate as a result of the goods and services tax would be a savage form of wealth tax. According to the article, those people who have saved a nest egg for their retirement through hard work over many years would be devastated as this money would be slashed by somewhere between 10 per cent and 15 per cent. Where in that scenario is the incentive to work and save that the Opposition has spoken so boldly of lately?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition also talks in this package of a compensation scheme for those who may&mdash;I emphasise the word `may'&mdash;be hurt by a goods and services tax. Although the Opposition says `may', I believe every individual would be hurt in some way by this goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a scheme would, of necessity, be based on an average situation, which would not be adequate for the many people who are not in an average situation. Recently, in bringing an anti-discrimination Bill into this House whilst speaking in a grievance debate, I spoke about the average age of our legislators. But that does not mean to say that everyone in this Parliament is 48.9 years of age. Therefore, when we look at the average situation, we must then estimate the number of people who are going to benefit and weigh that up against the number who will be hurt&mdash;and hurt savagely&mdash;by the introduction of a goods and services tax, as laid down in this `illustrious' document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I return to more serious matters. As we have done a lot of talking in this place about leadership, I turn to that issue and what it is all about. To obtain a bit of an outline of leadership, I quote from a rather obscure source, which I think is of particular interest. It comes from, of all people, Edsel Ford, the son of Henry Ford the car maker. He said that leadership basically consists of three essential qualities: firstly, the capacity to form a vision in one's mind; secondly, the ability to communicate that to others; and, thirdly, the capacity to inspire people to work towards that vision. I add a fourth factor to that: the willingness and capacity to set an example that justifies that inspiration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today in this place, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gave us his vision for Australia today. I found it very interesting. He said that he wanted a tolerant multicultural society in which the disadvantaged and the underprivileged are properly protected by government. He went on to reject what he called experiments in cold Darwinian theory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this project for us in the way of an Australian society in which to live in 1991?  The bare statistics have been pretty well covered in this place today. Nearly one million people are unemployed, getting on for 10 per cent plus, whatever it is; 500,000 to 600,000 people unable to secure full employment or the job of their choice; 30 per cent&mdash;an horrific 30 per cent&mdash;of young people unemployed, unable to find work or begin a career; and a ballooning foreign debt which we are told is now of the order, in net terms, of $130 billion and represents something like $70,000 of extra incremental debt for every job supposedly created by the Government over the last seven years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, worse, there is a crisis of confidence in the community, a feeling that the nation is adrift, rudderless on a sea of insoluble problems. There is no doubt in my mind that that is why people out there have been so quick to adopt and embrace our package. This loss of confidence in the Government and its vision has occurred despite all the rhetoric we hear in this place and outside about social justice, social wages policy and a more caring society. It seems to me that Australians feel deeply and with great conviction that we are off the rails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the idea that the Government should be there to protect people is increasingly cynically dismissed as nothing more than the representation of a desire to enrol individuals as dependants of the state. That is a cruel hoax of an idea that seemed so much a part of the Whitlam approach&mdash;the Whitlam approach that saw people subjected to the idea that their lives could be run better by the state and its instrumentalities than by those individuals themselves. I would just like to look at some specific groups left disadvantaged, underprivileged and anything but properly protected by government, in contravention of the vision the Prime Minister said that he had for Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn firstly to young people. The Prime Minister promised them, of course, that none of them would live in poverty by 1990. That is the first quotation that springs to mind. That was sort of leadership bordering on a standard somewhat less impressive than Churchillian. It certainly failed the test of inspiring people to work towards it, being so patently absurd, because it missed the need to identify the causes of child poverty. It immediately produced cynicism and ridicule across Australia&mdash;and I would suggest quite appropriately so. That did not lessen the pain, of course, for the dispossessed and alienated kids in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder how many people ever stop to consider the significance of the loud calls&mdash;this is just one minor example which I find quite interesting&mdash;for better anti-theft security for Australian made motor cars. Groups like the NRMA especially have been very vocal. As a result, whatever other qualities Australian cars may or may not possess, when compared with those manufactured anywhere else in the world they are amongst the most difficult to steal. And they need to be, with our theft rates. The truly tragic thing is that we know that a great deal of that theft, in fact, arises from young people stealing motorcars for a bit of a spin, a joy ride, for all sorts of purposes. Some of them, unfortunately, steal them to support drug habits and this sort of thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to know a little bit about this, as I once had quite a new motor car stolen in Sydney by three young people. The police seemed to know all about them. I got the motor car back a week later in a very decrepit condition, full of the evidence from the jewellery store that they had knocked off and the drugs that they had been using. The police told me they had a pretty good idea of who had done it, which I took to mean that they knew exactly who had been responsible, but that there was no point in taking the issue up, because those children would get nothing more than, proverbially speaking, a rap over the knuckles and a bit of a message to go home and be good. Those kids out there might be on the fringes. Nobody denies that. Fortunately, not too many children have fallen into that sort of class yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the point remains that there are too many of them and every day there are too many more of them. It really gives the lie to the Prime Minister's claim that no child would live in poverty. The reality, unfortunately, is that we are seeing a continuing drift in exactly the opposite direction. I want to make the point that, if that is the cutting edge, then what stands behind it is also deeply disturbing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I had a lot of children from schools in my electorate through this place, as I am sure other members have had children from theirs. It is the end of the year. I have taken to asking them what worries them most. I used to find a couple of years ago that the biggest single thing, believe it or not, was the environment. But not any more. Now it is jobs, jobs and jobs, no matter how the question is phrased. The things that worry them most relate to the opportunities for training for a job, securing a job and entering some sort of satisfactory career path. The other day I had in here one group of perhaps 30 school children who will all be out in the work force in two or three years time. I asked them the same question and they all, bar one, expressed their concern about jobs. I asked the one remaining individual why he was not concerned, and he replied that his father was going to put him back on the land. I found that a particularly tragic answer because he was probably kidding himself more than anybody else in the group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Prime Minister's vision for children is that they would be better off under the protective mantle of government, I have to disagree with him. If his vision becomes a reality, we will have a real problem out there because we have developed a society which is not able to offer children a secure future. They feel anything but confident. I suggest that real compassion might extend instead to offering those young people better education opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This pack, about which we have just heard such crass and unrealistic criticism from the previous speaker, commits us to an additional $3 billion expenditure on education alone by the year 2000 or the turn of the century. Having done that for young people, the program looks to regenerate the private sector, which is the only legitimate job building sector in the Australian economy, so that those people might have reasonable prospects of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Of course, when we were young we took for granted that there would be a job market out there, that we would be able to find a niche, that we would be able to grow into it and expand into it. It is an appalling thing, and perhaps something that we in this place do not fully understand, to be young and to be faced with the prospect of not quite knowing whether one is going to be able to find meaningful employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second area that I would like to turn to is the farm sector and the pain that those involved in it have endured. I recall another call to arms by the Prime Minister back in the days when the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), the then claimed world's best Treasurer, was talking about banana republics. That particular call ran along the lines of `restraint with equity'&mdash;all Australians must make sacrifices but it will be done with equity. There was not to be much equity for farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government built its economic management, its wages policy and its taxes policy around high inflation. It pretended that we could live with high inflation and that there was nothing to be feared from high inflation. It tried to con us into believing that inflation did not matter as long as wages were adjusted for those who could be adequately protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, was a cruel hoax. In general terms it was a cruel hoax  on the whole of the Australian community. The Prime Minister has become a convert to the need to rein in inflation&mdash;since the Government had the good fortune to stumble across the discovery that if one sends an economy comatose, one can snap the inflation stick, as the honourable member for Blaxland describes it. But it is a little bit too late because a great deal of the damage out there in the community has been done. There has been massive wealth redistribution against the interests of the farmers, the exporters, the old and those on low and fixed incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The evidence abounds; it is quite easy to find. Any number of farmers could tell us that when Hawke came to power&mdash;this is one example that springs to mind&mdash;a person could buy something like a Toyota Land Cruiser, which is every cocky's friend these days, for the equivalent of, say, 30 steers or 100 tonnes of wheat. By 1990, seven years into the Hawke Labor Government, one was looking at 80 steers or 300 tonnes of wheat. Now, of course, with the worst drought for many years stalking the land&mdash;for many people in some parts of the country it is the worst in recorded history&mdash;we find a government caught flat-footed, with no adequate drought policy and with a need to move quickly to preserve an asset that is important, not just to farmers but to the economic well-being of this country, that is, the nation's breeding flocks and herds. There is no adequate policy in place to meet that urgent need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will cite just one other example. In this time of great crisis in the rural community, the basic simple justice of a decent isolated children's allowance to ensure that all children, regardless of where they live, have equal access to schools at school gate level has been allowed to slip away to the point that it is worth only a fraction of its earlier value. That is a massively discriminatory policy which, I suggest, works not just against the interests of affected farmers' children, miners' children and lighthouse keepers' children&mdash;all of those people in isolated areas of Australia who need this sort of help&mdash;but against all our interests. This is a big country. Much of our wealth is produced in remote areas, and we need to do a great deal more about recognising the needs of those brave souls who carry on in often very arduous circumstances to produce this nation's bread and butter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a third group that, with some sensitivity, I want to turn to. Those are the regional inhabitants of this ancient continent. I have a lot of them in my electorate. It very deeply concerns me that they are not being adequately covered by the Prime Minister's vision in which he said he saw a need to ensure that the disadvantaged and underprivileged are properly protected by government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised in this place last week the tragic story of Walgett Aboriginal community in my own electorate. The lack of accountability and the outrageous fashion in which a clique or group of people is able to dominate a local Aboriginal community to its advantage and to the enormous disadvantage of the rest of the community is tragic. At Walgett successive regimes have got away with it and ripped the system off. The message to the people in the community is `You will get away with it so go ahead and do what you like. You will get off scot-free'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an absolute tragedy. It appears that the model is, unfortunately, being adopted. A recent report indicated that Walgett, which is a predominantly Aboriginal community, is the fourth worst community in New South Wales for assault and the sixth worst for robbery.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the Prime Minister's vision of a tolerant, multicultural society in which the disadvantaged and underprivileged are properly protected by government has become a sad experiment in social Darwinism&mdash;not our vision but his vision.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What the Opposition has come out with in the last week or so is, of course, the classic. It is voluminous and it contains the classic carrot and stick approach. It promises much. It says, on face value, `Trust us, take us on faith, we will deliver'. It also contains a hidden message: if it moves, tax it. Most people have tended to neglect the implications of that in their examinations to date. I think even those on the other side would agree that some of the examinations by people who perhaps should know better have been nothing more than superficial. People have tended not to look closely enough at the implications of the view `if it moves, tax it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> People have said, for example, that one of the major issues confronting those less advantaged in our community at the moment is the ability to fend for themselves, that we need to put some incentive back. What the Opposition is promising in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document is a range of options which it considers will meet those very needs. It has suggested, for example, that family allowances should be doubled. That is probably a reasonable suggestion if we are basing all decisions of all people on the classic economic assumption of rational economic man or woman. What I think the Opposition's package fails to do is look at the type of person to whom it believes it is targeting that increased assistance, and promising it; it is saying that each and every one of those people will act in the same way and that, as a class, there is no distinction amongst those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When one looks at to whom family allowance is directed, one very clearly sees that it is not directed to the advantaged in the community. It is directed to those people at the lower socioeconomic end of the spectrum. I want to mention my own experience in my electorate. I represent an area of Australia where unemployment, and youth unemployment, is higher than the national average, but where at least people show a determination to fight back themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who would qualify under the Fightback package for family allowance assistance are simply not going to fall into that model of rational economic people. What are they going to spend that increase on? My guess is that it is going to be on food, clothing, shoes, including school shoes, equipment and so on. What does that imply?  It implies a 15 per cent tax. How then can one say to these people, `We are compensating you. We are going to look after you to raise your children, but at the same time we are saying that when you spend that money it is going to cost you an extra 15 per cent'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that disturbs me greatly is this apparent belief that sole parents in this country again can all fit into the one category.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look beyond that rhetoric, what do we see? We find that there are at least three items left out of the calculation of inflation rates and additions to the CPI. I comment on one only: cigarettes. As I understand it from reading the document, and honourable members opposite might comment otherwise, it is proposed that by levying cigarettes with a 25 per cent impost a behavioural change will be induced which will see a reduction in the sale of those products, which will therefore result in a decrease in their contribution to the CPI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Opposition: if it can do that, it is going against all modern sociology; it is going against all modern promotion. It will certainly have the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and other people on this side of the House jumping up and down. They are proposing that we ban all sponsorship of sport by cigarette companies because if the product is promoted children and many others will it take up. It is just not going to happen. It is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that in the first three years this massive behavioural change in something as fundamental as cigarette smoking will be brought about is an absolute nonsense. To say that change will make a big difference to the CPI measurement again defies logic. I am surprised, to say the least, that the so-called rational economic people on the Opposition benches will live with that particular suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting issue, which has been highlighted in some of the media coverage at least, is the proposed benefit that will come from substituting a wholesale sales tax with this promised goods and services tax. The classic example that is often quoted concerns the family motor car. It is interesting to see the comparison between a Ford Falcon or a Commodore or one of the smaller vehicles so as to see just what the difference is. On the pure list price for a Falcon, the difference is probably no more than $113. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether any honourable members opposite have been out looking for a car recently and seen the sorts of deals that are on offer. Yes, we are in a recession and yes, a number of models have been produced and yes, people are not buying as many cars. Let me say that one can get pretty good deals at the moment by walking down the street and seeing the sort of offer motor traders will make to anyone wanting to purchase a car. In the broad cost of something like a Falcon, with a list price in excess of about $26,000, the classic family sedan, let me say that $136, or $113, whatever the estimate is, does not make a great deal of difference. So in the first instance something like that does not fit the rational economic model upon which most of the package is based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting issue is the cost of petrol. I will not go over all the matters that were mentioned in Question Time, as other speakers have done that. I will raise one thing for those on the other side of the House listening tonight; that is, the effect on pensioners of the promises the Opposition has made on the cutting of the petrol price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has been up to the Gold Coast to talk with pensioners. There must be a different bunch of pensioners on the Gold Coast from the pensioners down in Wollongong, I will give the Opposition the tip now. As luck would have it, the President of the Corrimal Combined Pensioners Association came to see me the other day. He said, `Look, have you got anything you can give me so I can tell my 250 members who will be at the meeting this afternoon about this goods and services tax?'. I said, `Look, obviously we are putting a great deal of thought into this and we will produce something for you in the fullness of time which I am sure you will use'. He said, `I don't really need it because I have enough now'. I said, `Listen, what do you think about this idea of promising petrol reductions?'. He said, `I don't think much of it at all'. I said, `That is a bit strange; 19c a litre is promised and here you are, a pensioner; I would have thought that was pretty good'. He said, `I'll tell you what, mate, over at my pensioners association there are 250 members, and do you know how many have got cars? Ten. Do you know what the other 240 are worried about? They are worried about the 15 per cent increase in the cost of taxi fares, the 15 per cent increase in the cost of bus fares and the 15 per cent increase in the cost of everyday items on which pensioners rely'. </PARA>

They should come down and tell those 240 people out of 250 down there at Corrimal just how the fall in petrol pricing which has been promised&mdash;and which has been shown as an absolute charade by Ministers in this place during the last two days&mdash;will benefit them.

I live in a region of Australia that has the second highest level of unemployment. It has now been returning Liberal candidates for over 15 years. It is one of the most highly unionised areas in Australia with a population of mainly working class people who return people from the Liberal Party. The reason for that is that they see no vision in this Government at all. If they saw any vision from the Labor Party, then I am sure that a Labor Party candidate would have been returned.

What sort of record is that for a Government to leave the Australian people?  We have the deepest recession in 60 years. We have a rapid rise in crime, far faster than the population increase. We have excessive interest rates which have driven businesses out the back door. We have ever increasing hospital queues and a burgeoning welfare problem.

What we find amongst the Australian people is a sense of relief in regard to this package. They have a sense of relief because they now feel that there is some incentive to work. There is a reason to work when one has to pay only 30c in the dollar in tax and can take home 70c on the dollar. People see some hope when they see petrol prices falling by 19c a litre.

They are absolutely frightened. The coalition has argued that there are compensations in the package to recompense people who will be adversely affected by higher costs as a result of the 15 per cent GST.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this package the coalition is also attempting to dupe the Australian people into believing that the Federal Government has a high taxing regime in relation to petrol prices. The fact of the matter is&mdash;I believe the Opposition knows it&mdash;that we as a nation have the second lowest level of taxes on fuel of the 20 International Energy Agency countries. Recent statistics show that the total Federal and State taxes on fuel in Australia account for around 45 per cent of the total petrol price.

So it is a fraud to suggest that petrol taxes in this country are high because the comparisons show that is not the case. It is also a fraud to suggest that there will be huge savings in the bush as a result of the dropping of the fuel excise because when road user charges are factored in there will be no savings at all in the bush. </PARA>

The Opposition, as we know, has publicly committed itself to major reform of the land transport system and yet, as we heard, it did not cost those reforms into its package. The Leader of the Opposition panicked and yesterday issued a media release saying that he will not introduce fuel based road user charges for ordinary motorists. He said that down the track he wants to see a form of road user charge for commercial vehicles, especially heavy transport vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This can only mean that the burden of the road user charges will fall on heavy vehicles, which will further increase transport costs in the north. The Leader of the Opposition singles out fixed registration charges and mass distance charges based on hub meters as possible methods of road charging for heavy vehicles. Clearly, the Leader of the Opposition has not listened to his colleagues in the Queensland National Party on this issue. Fixed charges are one thing but, as we know, mass distance charges are indisputably going to cost transport operators in rural and remote areas more than city transport operators. Of course, as the Prime Minister said today, research has shown that there are still plenty of technical problems with hub meters, including kangaroo interference and cattle interference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, instead of evening up the inequities, the Leader of the Opposition's knee-jerk response will further disadvantage people living in rural and remote areas. The petrol price reduction is a nonsense and a fraud. Talking about nonsense and frauds, all honourable members will remember that, during the last sittings, in answer to a question from me, the Treasurer happened to mention a bloke by the name of Bob Katter Jr who was opposed to a goods and services tax. He said that if it applies to food items, to the essentials of life, he was against it, hard and fast. He is a fine, upstanding man. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Percy Harris, head of the economics department at James Cook University, has said that a GST, even with its proposed compensations, would have an adverse impact on northern Australia. Unfortunately, the National Party has abandoned its traditional base and is ignoring Percy Harris's point that while the abolition of excise duties on petroleum products will mean price reductions much the same everywhere in Australia&mdash;and that will be negligible&mdash;their replacement by a GST will mean a tax addition that will be higher in remote areas where petrol, and all other prices, are already higher because of transport costs. There will be no saving at all in the bush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads us to the fundamental injustice in the coalition's tax package: the less well off in our society pay every cent that they get on the necessities of life and hence will be taxed at 15 per cent on every cent they spend; that is, every cent they have. Rich people spend only a proportion of the money they earn on the necessities of life, therefore, they retain a larger proportion of their income GST free. I suppose it is no surprise when one looks at the pinstriped New Right push behind the coalition's package that the people who will benefit most under this package are those earning $45,000-plus per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It astounds me that in the light of the obvious disadvantages for people in rural and remote areas the Opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), has the audacity to say that Aboriginal communities, the majority of which are in rural and remote parts of Australia, will be the big winners as a result of the GST. To support his proposition, the honourable member for Chisholm quotes from a report to the Central Land Council, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the issue of high cost of living was discussed in any detail, most people stated food, clothing, household appliances, car parts, petrol were all as high as twice the price of supermarket prices in the nearest major service centre. Many of the major service centres for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are located in high cost areas of Australia, residents are saying that because of their geographic location they are doubly disadvantaged and see themselves as doubly poor.</PARA>
<PARA>I could not have selected a better quote to illustrate the devastating effect that a 15 per cent GST is going to have on remote Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal people in my electorate in the remote towns of Doomadgee and Mornington Island are going to have their gross disadvantage further increased by 15 per cent. The Opposition argues mischievously that a 15 per cent tax on all the necessities of life will somehow end this disadvantage by reducing transport costs to remote areas, abolishing wholesale sales tax and abolishing fuel excise. As I said earlier, with the burden of a road user charge system falling on transport operators, to be collected, in all likelihood, by a mass distance charge, transport costs in remote Australia will not be reduced significantly at all. Many Aboriginal families are on low incomes, which, of course, will mean that they are the ones who will be most adversely affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audacity of the statement by the honourable member for Chisholm that Aboriginal people in rural and remote Australia will be the big winners under this package is further illustrated by the Opposition's proposed $66m cut to ATSIC on top of a $20m cut to one of the most successful programs in the Aboriginal affairs portfolio, the CDEP program. I invite the honourable member for Chisholm to visit Normanton to see what a marvellous CDEP program exists there and to tell the people there exactly what effects such a huge reduction in Aboriginal affairs spending will have on that community. </PARA>

But I cannot participate in the debate without first taking issue with the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) over many of the points that he has endeavoured, mischievously, to make. The honourable member for Kennedy came in here and suggested that neither the debate nor the documents being presented to the House by the Opposition, and now in dispute as a result of the Prime Minister's amendment, could be taken seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a 500-page document that has captured the imagination not merely of the people of Australia but of Australia's cynical press, a document that caught the Government because of the broad-based scope of the changes that were being proposed, a document that has been endorsed by key bodies, including&mdash;I remind the honourable member for Kennedy, given his rural base&mdash;the National Farmers Federation. He says it is a document that cannot be taken seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the heart of this debate is the question not of whether we charge a 15 per cent GST but of whether the government of Australia chooses to charge people more or less in total tax take. Fundamentally, the Opposition is saying that we will reduce the total tax take. I repeat this for the advantage of the honourable member for Kennedy:  we will reduce the total tax that the people of Australia have to find, whether they live in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, or in the electorate of Kennedy. Let us have none of this nonsense about how the electors of Kennedy will pay an additional 15 per cent on every item they purchase. Their total tax take will fall. That is the fundamental inescapable fact and that is the key not only to the success of this document but also to the economic success of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could understand it if the people in the press gallery, the people in the public galleries or the other people listening to this debate wondered what the Parliament had been about&mdash;wondered because the Opposition, desperate to debate this package, gave the Government the opportunity to do so on the first sitting day after it was introduced and we were thwarted. It was only when the press picked up the fact that the Government was not prepared to debate this document that the Government was embarrassed into providing an opportunity for debate, partially yesterday and principally today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kennedy and honourable members opposite cannot have it both ways. If the purpose of this document is to take less tax, then the burden that the people of Australia bear will be reduced. The honourable member for Kennedy has chosen to say, `But look at the burden you are putting on rural people because of the transport costs they must bear'. The whole focus of this document is to take away from rural people, particularly transport operators, the wholesale sales tax component which is such a burden on truck operators, not only in the purchase of their rigs but also in the purchase of their spare parts and fuel. Now he will say, as he has in the debate, `But you lot are going to introduce a road user charge'. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we will not need to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should let me finish. Regardless of what the honourable member says about my response, he should bear in mind the fact that wholesale sales taxes generate something like $9.2 billion in income to the Government, which the Opposition is going to do without, and that the present Government only spends something like $1 1/2 billion, if I were to be generous, in its present road program. What is left?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us say that we as the Opposition&mdash;I am not suggesting that this will be policy&mdash;propose only through a road user charge to do what the Government already does. There is already a gross saving, principally for the people in rural Australia who are most affected by transport costs and especially for the people in the largest rural electorate in Queensland. Something like 3c a litre out of all the money that the Government rakes off fuel currently goes to roads. If we could do no better than the Government, we would still provide real savings for the people of rural and regional Australia. That is the object of this document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people listening to this debate might well wonder what the Parliament is about. They may think it is some sort of nonsense if they were to give any credibility to the remarks made by people opposite. I will tell them what it is about from the Opposition's point of view. It is about a document that is not meant to be popular, but is meant to turn around the direction of Australia by taking one million people thrown out of work by this Labor Government and giving them an opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where have the winners from almost nine years of the Hawke Government been? The graph in the coalition's document shows us where they have been. There have been winners&mdash;we are here to debate the question fairly&mdash;under Prime Minister Hawke. We should make no mistake about it. Those winners have been at the bottom end of the income spectrum. I am not blind to that; I do not walk away from that, and neither does our document. Those winners have been at the top end of the income spectrum as well. If we take a quick glance at the graph on page 13&mdash;I am sure everyone opposite has access to it&mdash;we will discover that there have also been losers. Unless one is right down the bottom end depending on social security payments, or right up the top end&mdash;a friend of the Prime Minister&mdash;we will discover that in nine years of the Hawke Labor Government that person has been a loser, according to this graph. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback proposal is meant to take those losers who are currently despondent and dejected and say, `What's the point of putting in an extra effort and giving them a chance to perform?'. When they perform Australia has a chance to perform. Frankly, as a member of the alternative government in Australia, I have no choice but to give every Australian an opportunity to perform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened while the Labor Party has been in government? Australia's net external debt as a percentage of our gross domestic product has soared from something like 6 per cent when we were in government to something like 35 per cent now that the Labor Party is in government. What does that mean? That means that our capacity to pay off our debts has collapsed. I am not an economist; I am a farmer. The capacity of my property to pay its way depends entirely on more going out the front gate and less coming in. While the Labor Party has been in government we have lived comfortably by borrowing and borrowing until our debt has gone from something like $30 billion to $160 billion and our capacity to pay it off has collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package is all about making it possible for Australians to pay off their debts. I am not sure what the figure is and I do not intend to mislead the House. The shadow Minister for housing, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), may well know, but I am told we need to generate other export income something like the income we currently earn from mining or five times the size of the present wool industry to pay off this disgraceful debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document is about is encouraging Australians to generate export income. How? First of all, we encourage them to work. We happen to see the unemployed as human beings who want to work, so we say: here is an opportunity to work. In fact, here is an opportunity for them to work at 80 or 90 per cent of present salaries simply because it is better for them to have a job than not to have a job at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we want to take those small investors in Australia&mdash;this is what this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback! </EMPHASIS>document is about&mdash;and say to them that we would like them not to be discouraged from being successful by being saddled with this Government's capital gains tax. So if they are small investors we will let them have $3,000 a year capital gains tax free, and if they are large investors, choosing to make responsible provision for their retirement, we will allow them at age 60 to take $300,000&mdash;that will be indexed&mdash;capital gains tax free with which to retire. That is an incentive for people to generate a business of their own. In the process we will make Australia more wealthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that was not enough, we take what is the key to this document, and we say: sure, there will be a 15 per cent tax overall, but total tax will fall because we will spend less. I do not give a hoot how many tax channels there are for the Government to call on&mdash;if it is the Government's intention to take less, then as a taxpayer I am bound to be better off. We say: sure, there will be a 15 per cent tax but we will take export goods and exempt them from the tax. What does that do? That says to every Australian: I ought to be in the exporting industry and I ought to be in it by encouraging Australians to work for me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless we do this, we are in diabolical economic trouble. How else do we service this enormous debt that has been run up by those opposite? Frankly, the people who have a great deal to benefit from this package are my constituents&mdash;the farmers of Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When the honourable member for Kennedy comes in here and says that his electorate is disadvantaged, I have to say that he is deceiving the House. That is not the experience in my electorate. It is not the experience of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) in his electorate. My electors, who right now are not generating any income and, therefore, have the least to gain from the generous falls in income tax, are still advantaged because this package makes their export goods exempt; more than that, it makes their petroleum excise exempt and provides them with real cost cuts in transport, which is so specific a burden on rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to be a member of the Liberal and National parties optimistically in opposition. I do not intend to have my electors consigned to poverty forever, so when they do start to generate real income there will be even more advantages for them in this package. I want to attract industries into my area. I want industries to employ the 30 per cent of young people unemployed in my area. My Party proposes to do it by taking away that real disincentive to employment which is called payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So people in regional and rural Australia will not be unhappy about this. If honourable members do not believe that because it is coming from the mouth of someone who is presumably prejudiced about the package, let me cite the Wool Council. It thinks it is a great idea, and its electors are hardly earning big incomes or have much to gain from a change in the present tax regime. The National Farmers Federation thinks it is a great idea because it sees the opportunity it gives for its farmers&mdash;principally exporters&mdash;to get on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our task has been to shape a package that encourages people to generate export income and to service the enormous debt that has been run up by this Government. Compare that with the absurd amendment that the Prime Minister has asked us to debate. The Prime Minister has had the bare-faced audacity to talk about perpetrating a massive fraud. This is a document that the press and the economists have gone through, and very few flaws have been found. Furthermore, he has the audacity to talk about a document that will wreck economic recovery and shift the burden of taxation from the very rich to middle and low income Australians. The very people this document is designed to benefit are ignored not only in the Prime Minister's amendment but also in the way he has gone about governing Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that there are real opportunities for rural Australia with a fall in fuel price, with the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and with the real incentive to be about exporting, because unless rural and urban Australia is about generating export income we are all damned to an economic future that none of us would want. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate in support of the amendment moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to censure the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) for the fraud which he has perpetrated on the people of Australia by virtue of the tax package document released last Thursday. This is a document which is full of rhetoric, although I notice, from observing the debate that has gone on in the chamber for the last six or seven hours, that most of those opposite appear not to have the full document. They have relied extensively on the Executive Summary. I am not sure whether that is because they do not possess a copy or whether it is too bulky to bring in. I have not found too many people on the other side who seem all that familiar with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">War and Peace</EMPHASIS> edition of some 700 pages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Be that as it may, one of the areas in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">War and Peace </EMPHASIS>edition which has been referred to on a number of occasions on this side of the House, but which has avoided any comment from those opposite, relates to the road user charge. The Opposition has skated around the road user charge time and again over the course of this week. The Opposition has said that it will remove the Federal petrol excise, and it has repeated that on a number of occasions. I do not think it is in dispute that that is their intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has supported a large portion of its incentive for the people of Australia by saying that they will benefit from reduced petrol prices as a result of the removal of that excise. That is a dishonest and fraudulent approach to the public, because those opposite know only too well that in place of that excise they intend to see imposed a road user charge which is currently under investigation by the States and the Commonwealth and which is currently assessed at approximately 16c per litre if it is applied on the basis of fuel consumption. In other words, the 19c per litre they purport would be saved by removal of the excise would be replaced by a 16c road user charge. The total net saving which the Opposition can honestly put to the people of Australia in this package is 3c a litre at the most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite claim that that is in fact not the case. I refer them to their own document, at page 82.

I will refer to the detailed explanation of what it is the Opposition proposes to do, because it appears unaware of its own policy. On page 82 the document states:</PARA>

<PARA>It goes on further to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall level of road user charges and road expenditures will be the responsibility of the National Road Transport Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a direct quote from the Opposition's own document. The Opposition is saying quite clearly in the Executive Summary and in the passages I have just read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that there will be a road user charge, as is currently planned, that the level of it will be set not by the Opposition but by the Road Transport Commission, and that it can take whatever form it wishes. The Opposition knows full well that the outcome of that review will be the imposition of either a very substantial increase in registration fees, administered by the States, the level of which was referred to in Question Time today, or the introduction of an additional charge on petrol. They are the most likely alternatives. It knows that is the case and, as an organisation and an Opposition, it is dishonestly withholding that information from the public because it suits its purposes. The net effect of that change, which is clearly stated in its document, will be an evaporation of the savings that it claims exist in its petrol excise policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tax cuts are probably the other big carrot which the Opposition has dangled before the public of Australia in an effort to get people to accept a quite regressive, divisive and unnecessary GST. The tax cuts which are in the documents provided by the Opposition give the lie to its claims that the tax cuts are designed to assist those on low incomes. Under the Opposition's tax scales, projected as they are to 1994, a person on a moderate income of $25,000 per annum, or on the average weekly wage, would receive a reduction in tax of $22.70. A person receiving double that income, $50,000, will receive a benefit not twice that $22 but four times it&mdash;$82.60. You double the level of the income but you quadruple the tax benefit. Your tax scale is designed to assist those not on average weekly earnings or on modest incomes but in the $50,000-plus bracket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other examples of that have been mentioned throughout the debate. One is sales tax as it applies to vehicles. The only people who will not gain from the Opposition's proposals to eliminate wholesale sales tax and replace it with a GST on the purchase of vehicles are those people who purchase second-hand cars, because right now there is no tax on second-hand cars, and you are going to impose one. It is not the people who purchase a brand-new Commodore or Falcon, because at best they will save less than $150 on a $25,000 vehicle. The people who receive the benefit of your proposal when they purchase a vehicle are those who purchase the Mercedes-Benzes, the BMWs, the Porsches and the Ferraris. Earlier today I referred to the details of that, giving examples of savings amounting to $6,000 and $7,000, and even higher for luxury sports cars. That is the sort of saving that you are going to provide to the people who purchase luxury vehicles, and it is consistent with your approach in your tax scales to which I have just referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in the House the other day, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> got it right last Friday in its banner front-page headline that pegged you correctly&mdash;`Bonanza for the Rich'. That is what your proposals provide&mdash;a bonanza for the rich&mdash;in your tax scales and in the implementation of a GST in place of the wholesale tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to refer to the question of Austrain, because there has been some comment in the House today about the Opposition's plan for Austrain. As the Prime Minister's amendment points out, it too is a fraud on the people of this country. You will provide to the unemployed the opportunity, as you put it, to obtain a job, but it is a second-class job with second-class salaries at 20 per cent off the going rate of salary&mdash;whatever that might be. I will come to that in a minute because you are going to change what that salary will be. The people who think it will be 20 per cent off the award rate need to understand that what underpins your entire strategy is a reshaping of the industrial relations scene with a reduction in real wages. I will come to that in a minute too because that is in your own projections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You propose to say to employers, `You can put on one of these people and pay them 20 per cent less than whatever might be the prevailing legal rate'. In that system you encourage employers to dismiss employees who are on full rates of pay so that the employers can get the benefit of employing somebody at a 20 per cent cheaper rate. If you do not think that employers will sack workers on full pay so they can put on someone at 20 per cent less, either you know less about the operations of your colleagues in the business sector than I think you do or you are naive in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what you are going to do with the wages system across the board. Your document proposes that there be a freeze in wages to the year 2000. The people of Australia should have no misunderstanding about that. It will be a freeze with no increase in real terms in salaries in this country until the next century. That is your best scenario, because if you go down one of the other tracks in your document, you do not end up freezing wages until the year 2000; you reduce them by 1.8 per cent in real terms. That is your own projection of what you intend to do to the real wages of Australia's work force. Having done that, you expect them to embrace your goods and services tax, which will increase the cost of those items which are fundamental daily purchases for everybody in this country, such as bread, milk, clothes, meat and vegetables, whilst you reduce the price of expensive items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be understood that when we say `reduce the price of expensive items', that would apply to those items that had a wholesale sales tax of 30 per cent, because it may be&mdash;and often it is the case&mdash;that items with a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax rate will be cheaper than they will be with your 15 per cent GST, because your GST is levelled on the retail price, not the wholesale price. You expect the people of Australia to embrace that when the average working person will not get the benefit of your tax scales and will not get the benefit of job security because the employer will be encouraged to sack that worker and put on somebody for 20 per cent less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three things we can do with our income: spend it, save it or invest it. That is about the start and finish of what we can do with our wages&mdash;when we have them. You intend to reduce the tax on investments and reduce the tax on income from savings, but increase the tax on spending. What do average people&mdash;not people on $50,000-plus but those on $25,000 to $30,000; average weekly earnings&mdash;do with most of their money? They do not have a lot of discretionary expenditure. Most of their $25,000 per annum goes in buying the roof over their head, their clothes, their food and an occasional bit of entertainment. Right now most of that is virtually tax free, but you are going to tax the food they eat, the clothes they wear and the occasional night out at the theatre or the football. The people who are on average weekly earnings do not have the opportunity to put a lot away in savings, and they certainly do not have the opportunity to put a lot into investments. But they are not the people who will gain under your proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who will gain are those who have a lot of discretionary income; the people who, after they have bought the roof over their head, the clothes on their back, their children's clothes and the food for the family, have a bundle of money left over, which they can invest or spend on discretionary activities. They are the people who will benefit from the policies which you enunciated last week. But they are not the majority of Australians. The majority of Australians understand it is not in Australia's interests that that should be so. They are not the majority of the residents of Brisbane, either. I was pleased to note that the Lord Mayor of Brisbane made a statement last week, very clearly saying to the Opposition that he would not have a bar of your work for the dole programs, and that endorsement from the Brisbane City Council reflects the strong view of the people of the Brisbane City Council area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, having decided to increase the tax on ordinary Australians on average weekly earnings, and having increased the cost of their normal purchases, those opposite would then turn around and reduce government outlays by $10 billion. At a time of unemployment, those opposite intend to reduce government outlays by $10 billion. They would reduce that $10 billion off an already lean Government operation. Those opposite will scoff at that suggestion but they know as well as everybody on this side of the chamber that the Federal Government outlays as a proportion of GDP are now at levels of 25 years ago. They are at levels lower than when those opposite were last in government. That is a fact. Off that extremely low base those opposite say that they would cut another $10 billion. The result of that incision that they propose to make with a chainsaw would be to injure ordinary Australians even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the next 18 months unfold, those opposite will rue the day that they decided to pursue this policy. Whilst they may bask in the glory of what they perceive as a good response in the first couple of days, they will come back here next year wondering whether they ever wanted to hear the letters GST. But they will hear them, not so much from inside this chamber as from outside in the electorate where the constituents will be clamouring at their doors and saying, `We will not wear it. We are going to return a Labor government because at least we know that it has some compassion and care for us'. </PARA>

The days we come back will largely depend upon progress in the Senate. There is still a possibility that we might be called back in the week that concludes on Friday, 13 December.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Maribyrnong-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Minister for Resources)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP> (11.25 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Today I am announcing the key elements of a new strategy for the development of the Australian natural gas industry. Over the last 20 years the Australian natural gas industry has grown from a relatively small base to become our third major primary energy source, accounting for 17 per cent of our energy consumption. Our domestic gas markets will continue to grow and there are strong prospects for increased exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Indeed, recent projections suggest LNG could become our second largest export earner by early next century, but if the industry is to achieve its potential, the policy settings must be right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's current proven economic gas reserves represent around 45 years supply at the current rate of production, and it is generally recognised that Australia is under-explored, not unprospective, for gas and oil. However, some 70 per cent of the currently proven economic reserves are located offshore north-west Australia, far from the major demand centres in the south-eastern States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interstate gas pipelines and policy issues relating to transport of gas across State and Territory borders will assume greater importance over the coming years. Against this background I released on 31 July the discussion paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A National Strategy for the Natural Gas Industry</EMPHASIS> to address the issues central to the development of a national gas strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The natural gas discussion paper sought views from the gas industry, State and Territory governments and other interested parties on the key elements which should be included in a national strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Submissions responding to the discussion paper confirmed that all sectors of Australia's gas industry strongly support the initiative I have taken to develop and implement a national gas strategy. Overwhelmingly, respondents were of the view that a national strategy should provide a policy framework to facilitate optimal development of Australia's gas reserves for domestic and export markets. This is fully consistent with the Government's approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now address the key elements of the national gas strategy. Industry perceives interstate trade in gas on a free and fair basis as the key to future development of an efficient and competitive industry. Importantly, the industry argues that this would provide an incentive for future exploration and development, including in areas closer to major markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the exception of gas supplied via the Moomba-Sydney pipeline, there are currently no significant interstate transactions in natural gas and this situation largely reflects government impediments to interstate gas trade. State and Territory energy Ministers have indicated support for the removal of barriers to interstate trade in natural gas. A report to the Australian and New Zealand Minerals and Energy Council (ANZMEC) last September concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Governments can play an important role in the development of future pipeline links by ensuring that there is co-ordination of any regulatory requirements between States, Territories and the Commonwealth to simplify procedures for developers. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contracts freely negotiated between gas producers, transporters and distributors are an appropriate mechanism for dealing with the issue of continuity of gas supply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am therefore hopeful that the States and Territories will voluntarily open their boundaries to interstate gas flows. The issue is one which I shall pursue with vigour. I intend to seek a formal commitment from the States/ Territories to free and fair interstate trade in natural gas through ANZMEC with, if necessary, endorsement at a subsequent Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If substantial agreement is not achieved on this matter at the next meeting of ANZMEC, scheduled for April 1992, I will bring forward alternative proposals to ensure free and fair interstate trade in gas. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Export Approval for LNG</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry groups have indicated that they would view the removal of the LNG export approvals system as a positive step by the Government to complement the development of `free and fair' interstate trade for natural gas, leading to similar benefits in terms of greater exploration and development activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major gas users have a somewhat different perspective. They argue that careful assessment of reserves and all markets, including export markets, is necessary to ensure that future domestic markets are not deprived of gas prematurely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the export approvals system will be a further important element in the development of a national gas strategy. To date, the system has been used to monitor contracted volumes and prices on LNG contracts from the only line project, the North West Shelf project. The Government is keen to remove impediments to the expansion of LNG exports, particularly in view of the major contribution they can make to our balance of payments and community welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has therefore decided that LNG exports will henceforth be administered as a price approval and monitoring system only, with no approvals required for new or incremental contracted volumes. This will ensure that community interests are safeguarded. A similar system is used for other resource exports, including bauxite and alumina, to ensure a fair and reasonable return to the community for the use of its resources. I am confident that over the long term this will work in the best interests of both domestic consumers and our export industry. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Approach to Regulation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the respondents to the discussion paper favour a `light handed' regulatory regime, consistent with the recommendations of a recent Industry Commission report on Energy Generation and Distribution. However, a number of gas industry participants indicated the need for clarification and/or strengthening of Trade Practices Commission powers and possibly the application of Prices Surveillance Authority powers in relation to gas pricing. Discriminatory pricing, pipeline monopoly abuse and third party access were seen as important issues by consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am firmly of the view that resolution of these issues is necessary for the development of an efficient gas industry; they need to be considered by the TPC and the PSA in developing an appropriate regulatory regime for the gas industry, as recommended by the IC report. For the time being the Government has decided to adopt `light handed' regulation of future interstate pipelines, with recourse as necessary to the TPC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My Department has been and will continue to be in close consultation with the TPC on issues relating to gas industry regulation and will report to me on the need for clarification of existing powers under the Trade Practices Act and the need for any additional `industry specific' powers to foster the development of the gas industry. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Development of the National Pipeline  System</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An integrated national pipeline system does not exist, but it is developing. The latest interstate linkage to be announced is that between south-west Queensland and the Moomba system in South Australia. There will be increased interstate gas trade and, at some point in the future, market forces will dictate the development of an integrated national gas pipeline grid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any future transnational gas pipeline would represent a major undertaking for Australia's natural gas industry, involving a 2,500 kilometre linkup costing more than $4 billion. An appropriate national gas strategy now will lay the groundwork, so that should a trans-Australian gas pipeline proceed, there will be no undue impediments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is especially true of the land access question where a multitude of heritage, parks and Aboriginal issues will need to be addressed if Australia's pipeline infrastructure is to develop and mature in an efficient and competitive manner. That is why land access and other issues such as technical uniformity and third party access to pipelines should be addressed now, not in 15-20 years time. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Access to Pipelines</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission has made a number of recommendations relevant to the question of pipeline access, including that the TPC be required by ministerial direction to oversee the development of new operating guidelines and that public utilities' exemption from the Trade Practices Act be removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The endeavours of a working party on development of a national competition policy, established after the July 1991 Special Premiers Conference, is also relevant to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a strong industry view that open access to pipelines on non-discriminating commercial terms is essential for optimal interstate gas competition. The Government agrees with this view. A number of States have `common carrier' provisions in legislation dealing with pipelines. However, The Pipeline Authority does not have any such obligation under the Pipeline Authority Act. The Act will therefore be amended as soon as practicable to allow third party access as the model for future interstate pipelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report to ANZMEC on Regulation of Interstate Pipelines concluded that some form of common carriage is needed on interstate pipelines to allow scope for the further development and use of gas resources in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANZMEC report highlights the differences which are apparent on the questions of common carriage or open access and that they need to be dealt with in a regulatory way. Resolution of these differences is another issue crucial to creating competition and efficiency. The ANZMEC report's conclusion lays the ground for future work on this aspect. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Reform of Public Utilities</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to public utilities, the Industry Commission report provided a comprehensive basis for reform but acknowledged that progress was likely to be uneven between different utilities in the same State and between States. Differences in practices may lead to distortions in production and investment decisions which might favour gas use in particular States, as opposed to interstate movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of current developments will impact on State utility reform and it is not possible at this stage to be precise as to outcomes. It will be necessary to monitor the results of Government consideration of, and State responses to, the IC report and the competition policy review to assess the impact on development of an efficient market driven gas sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, the role of Federal Government agencies in domestic gas operations has been restricted largely to the Pipeline Authority. TPA needs to be reformed to enable it to operate effectively. The Government has agreed, in principle, to the implementation of a reform package for TPA to achieve a more commercial approach to TPA's operations and facilitate its possible future corporatisation. I shall develop the details of this package in consultation with the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) over the next few months. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Consultative mechanisms</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government supports the gas industry's call for greater consultation between industry and governments on a range of pipeline issues. The Government has concluded that ANZMEC would be an appropriate forum in which to pursue these and other issues in the first instance&mdash;a view shared by the States. I shall report back to my Government colleagues&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development, there is no doubt we will continue to see an important role for gas in our future energy mix. It is therefore essential to take steps now to free up markets for natural gas and to ensure that there are no barriers to the use of natural gas in energy markets. Any attempt to deny gas the opportunity to compete with other fuels on anything other than an equal footing would serve to unnecessarily restrict the market options available for this fuel&mdash;to the possible detriment of the environment and the distortion of energy use patterns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Restrictions on the use of natural gas in specific applications, whether for export, power generation or other domestic markets, would add unnecessary uncertainty to the pursuit of market opportunities by explorers and developers. Expanded markets for natural gas, coupled with removal of barriers to interstate trade, are the key to greater exploration and development for this fuel and to giving it the opportunity to play its role in ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial basis for achieving the objective of sound policies for the natural gas sector may be summarised as follows:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, I have the stamina. That is why I am going to proceed. Indeed, I am conscious of the fact that there are thousands of people still at their workplaces tonight trying to eke out a living during this recession we did not have to have. If it is good enough for them to be out there at their workplaces soldiering on, lengthening the hours they spend at work just to survive under the economic regime of this Government, then, indeed, it is good enough for me to proceed with a discussion in respect of the statement by the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The National Gas Strategy.</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context the Minister has cobbled together a strategy which seeks to provide a basis for dealing with gas in the policy arena at the Federal level and in interdiction with the States and with regard to the evolution of a national gas pipeline grid. The coalition supports the broad thrust of the Minister's comments. It seeks to move this policy area along the path that reflects the fundamental direction laid down in coalition policy documents. I welcome that aspect of his ministerial statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are a couple of very relevant points which I choose to make. In the 18 months that the Minister has been in this portfolio he still has not been able to nail down the States to a more definitive accommodation with regard to the strategy which he has unveiled tonight. In fact, he had to threaten that if the States did not come to the party&mdash;the creation of all that should be created in regard to the inter-state gas trade&mdash;he would be taking `additional steps'. The Minister did not choose to elaborate further on that. He was sending some form of veiled threat to our colleagues in the States. That also points to the fact that in many ways this is a strategy statement with a great lack of detail, with a great hole in it, with regard to nailing down the attitude of the States&mdash;18 months after the Minister came to this portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst on the matter of State governments, I want to say that I was very surprised when I visited the AIDEX exhibition here in Canberra yesterday to find a couple of things that are not totally unrelated to this statement. I digress because I want to pay tribute to the Australian Federal Police in the work that they have carried out at AIDEX in very difficult circumstances. They have a right to be proud of that work in maintaining access to and from a legitimate exhibition activity. However, I would say to the demonstrators that I am not quite sure what they were getting greatly excited about because in the context of their concerns, the AIDEX exhibition is entirely unexceptional. I think that some of the biggest displays out there were, in fact, by those non-great war mongerers, those non-great enemies of the people, namely, the State governments. We had a lot of froth and bubble and unnecessary and gratuitous violence of the worst kind by some very ugly demonstrators&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are hypocrites of the first order, as the honourable member for Mayo has pointed out. Again, I reiterate my praise and salute the work of the Federal Police in the context of AIDEX. Having said that, perhaps I should come back fairly and squarely to the statement before the House. I draw the Minister's attention to the annual report of the Pipeline Authority for 1990-91. This report says, amongst other things:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against this background the Authority referred to the Minister for guidance and was advised that the reform package agreed to by the Government in 1989 to streamline the operations of the Authority was on hold until the outcome of the sale process was known; and the Authority should continue to operate on a `business as usual basis' providing consultancy or other new work/ business opportunities did not involve major construction, borrowing arrangements or commitments beyond 30 June 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We in the Parliament have settled that matter, whilst ever the Government will not go out and have fair dinkum negotiations with AGL. We indicated the outcome of that many months ago. The streamlining and reform of the Pipeline Authority in more fundamental terms should have proceeded by now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister spoke of technical uniformity being encouraged under his strategy. That is sensible. There must be technical uniformity. This country does not want to repeat the tragedy of broken gauges in the railways as occurs in my electorate at Albury-Wodonga, at the Queensland border and at the South Australian border. Essentially we have three major railway gauges in Australia. There is the Irish gauge, based in Victoria in the main; there is the New South Wales standard gauge, which has gradually spread to link all capital cities; and there is the narrow gauge in Queensland and sections of South Australia; and then there is the narrower gauge again in Western Australia and other parts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not only the question of technical uniformity, it is also the question of pipe capacity volume which is very significant. It is a related question, and some would argue that it comes within the definition of technical uniformity. I do not think it does. I think adequate capacity is a separate issue from technical uniformity, and it should be addressed fairly and squarely because the real tragedy would be that if any of the key links, including the one that the Minister referred to, which is about to be built between Queensland and South Australia, were to be of an inadequate diameter, they would restrict progress towards a national grid system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are experts in this field, and no doubt the capacity of that pipe has to be counterbalanced against the commercial viability of the pipe and the like. They are restricting factors. But we also have to have some foresight in relation to settling these issues. I expect and hope that the Minister will provide a catalyst to see that the right thing is done with regard to these matters at the early stage of planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I highlight to the House the absolute need to ensure that those volume calculations on pipeline capacity are correct, because already we have in place a very long pipeline from Alice Springs to Darwin, which many would say has a too narrow diameter&mdash;which is a tragedy&mdash;which places a restriction on volume. Although the reasons for building it at that size were proper in the eyes of the Northern Territory Government, at some future date that pipe may have to be expanded at great cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition generally welcomes the principles outlined in this document, but rhetoric has not always matched the track record. We had to remind the Government on the RRT legislation that it had overlooked fully the gas circumstance. At the end of the day, the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), in introducing the Bill in one of his last speeches as Treasurer, produced a $60m top-up for Victoria in respect of a gas equation of the RRT legislation for Bass Strait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also believe that the Minister bungled the attempt&mdash;not so much this Minister as the Government as a whole&mdash;to sell the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline. That has been of great interest to the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) over the years both in the New South Wales State Parliament and in the Federal Parliament&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. It was a contract which had operated for many years. We exposed that. We had the courage to make a stand, which I know that you in your heart, Mr Deputy Speaker, would have been proud of&mdash;although I know you could not speak in that regard from your position on the Government back bench. That Pipeline Authority position still remains our absolute commitment, reaffirmed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document, to proceed with that privatisation and the legitimate privatisation of a large number of Government organisations. We will do it properly, with none of this 49 per cent which the Government tinkers with. It keeps tinkering on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic,</EMPHASIS> and we keep coming up with the full blueprint, the full plans necessary for this country in turning the economy around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the Pipeline Authority still has over 100 staff and that it continues to be in limbo by degrees. This is regrettable, because time marches on. There is no capacity today for largess in government departments, government authorities or government instrumentalities. When we go through the accounts in detail of a number of these authorities, it is very interesting to see what the taxpayers' money is spent on with regard to their operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of my shadow portfolio of energy and resources, I serve notice that, as shadow Minister, I will be maintaining a great deal of vigilance in these recessionary times to see that all the organisations coming under the umbrella of this portfolio draw in their belts on a raft of things in the way that all honourable members have, by degrees, endeavoured to do with regard to their own activities as members of parliament and their entitlement. These are very tough times, whether in the gas industry or in the economy at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition welcomes the Minister's statement on a national gas strategy and notes that it still relies heavily on reaching an accommodation with the States. That is a big question mark. It is still up in the air with regard to free and fair interstate trade in gas. Of course, there must be free and fair interstate trade in gas. Let us hope that the States will see the light and respond further in a positive way. They have had a lot of time to do that. They had been showing some progress by virtue of the Special Premiers Conference apparatus, up till the one which was scheduled for Perth but fell apart and finally took place in Adelaide with the Premiers but no Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I focus on the removal of export approval for LNG. The Minister proposes to amend that. The Government has decided that LNG exports will henceforth be administered as a price approval and monitoring system only, with no approvals required for new or incremental contracted volumes. This seems to be a very cautious approach by the Minister when governments around the world are getting out of the business of price setting. It seems to fall short of what I would have expected of a young junior Minister seeking to carve his robust and radical niche in the history books of time before the collapse of this Government. I thought he would have been out there taking that extra step; but he stopped short of taking it. Nevertheless, he has driven along an agenda to ensure he got down his ministerial statement before the summer recess. We welcome the thrust of that statement. We say there is a great deal more work to be done in relation to national gas, and we note with particular interest the comment of uniformity which the Minister referred to and also his comment that gas should be equally placed with other energy with regard to its treatment&mdash;presumably referring to tax and other matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are about going that extra step, because we are going to totally remove all Federal fuel excise on petrol and diesel fuel as part of the Fightback package, which will ensure the change of government at the next Federal election. Gas will have a very big role to play to the year 2000 and beyond across Australia. It is extremely important that we get it right as we move steadily but surely towards the national grid. In closing, I remind the House that, in that regard, one of the key issues must be a proper approach to the volume, the capacity and the diameter of pipes on key link stages, to ensure that we will have adequate capacity to afford putting in place a viable grid as commercial production and capacity justify it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to this Act provide for the definition of `authorised officer' to limit the number of such officers to only those people appointed by the Secretary. Currently the definition of authorised officer extends to all officers within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in addition to those appointed by the Secretary. Since the formation of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in 1987, such a wide definition has not been altogether necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amended definition will be the same as that which exists for an authorised officer in the Export Control Act 1982. The Secretary will continue to have the power to appoint people outside the Department to be authorised officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Bill makes the Act consistent with current criminal law policy of omitting references to monetary penalties where terms of imprisonment are provided for. The provisions of section 4B of the Crimes Act 1914 will apply. For each 12 months of imprisonment provided for in the Meat Inspection Act 1983 as the maximum penalty, a court may impose a monetary penalty of up to $6,000 instead of or in addition to the imprisonment penalty for individuals, or five times that amount for corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This obviates the need to amend the Meat Inspection Act 1983 when policy as to the relativity between imprisonment penalties and monetary penalties changes.

The first amendment transfers responsibility for determining the form of audited financial statements required under the Act, from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.

The levy ceased in 1987 but the legislation continues to operate to enable the recovery of outstanding debts, the payment of debts recovered into the Fund and to permit disbursement of moneys in the Fund.

<PARA>The purpose of the Primary Industry Councils Bill is to provide for the establishment of industry councils for certain primary industries.

The Bill which I am introducing today differs from the earlier Bill in that individual industry councils and their membership will only be established by the inclusion of specific provisions in this legislation. The usual processes for amending an Act will need to be undertaken to amend the schedule to establish a new council and specify its membership.

<PARA>This legislation fulfils an undertaking made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the March statement to introduce forest conservation and development legislation to better protect Australia's native forests and concurrently facilitate much needed value adding investment and jobs in Australia's forest industries. The legislation will do so in a transparent and predictable way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, this policy initiative is a major reform. This Government is deeply committed to reforms that will produce secure, long term jobs for the people of Australia. It is always possible for governments to grasp short term expedients in the quest for creating jobs. But these almost always mean the jettisoning of longer term and often critical objectives, such as protecting Australia's environmental and cultural heritage. This is not the way for this Government&mdash;it never has been and never will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is the result of long, careful and hard analysis; of careful consideration of the views of the ACTU and timber unions, environmental and industry groups; and of much consultation with the States and Territories including at the Special Premiers Conference in July 1991. It has been constructed with our sights firmly set on the imperative of ecologically sustainable development&mdash;the proposition that we can and must reconcile legitimate concerns to preserve the values of our forests for current and future generations of Australians, and the equally legitimate concerns to use those same resources to advance other community objectives through the development of value adding forest industries. </PARA>

<PARA>.To provide security and certainty to the Australian community that all of its interests, whether they be for values that are environmental, cultural, heritage, social or economic&mdash;both for the current and future generations&mdash;are adequately and comprehensively safeguarded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill does not attempt to confer any new powers on the Commonwealth or on any Minister; rather, it establishes a method of integrating a broad range of processes under existing Commonwealth laws and regulations.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Enterprise</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, the proponent must satisfy the Commonwealth that it has a legal standing as an enterprise in the meaning of the terms of this Bill; that is, the enterprise is a duly constituted company, partnership or joint venture. We have recognised in the legislation that, in particular with large scale investments of the kind envisaged here, it often may not be possible or practicable for a single company to undertake a project. But this should not be interpreted to mean that a mere collection of sawmills could club together for the purposes of qualifying for resource security. Because the Government desires to promote valueadding industries, its approach to legislative resource security is based on a project rather than a region. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Dominant Purpose</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wood processing project's dominant purpose must be to make a new investment of at least $100m to produce goods for export and/or import replacement. This legislation is not designed to protect the industrial status quo by providing security to any use of wood for any purpose from any region. It is designed to shift the industry towards export oriented, value adding activities and to facilitate large projects of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World scale pulp mills are, of course, the paradigm case and we want to see such developments at the earliest opportunity. But again the Government has recognised and acknowledged in this legislation the commercial reality that investments of this size may also be made up of a set of integrated activities. This does not mean we would countenance a mere collection of sawmills as being eligible for resource security; we will only consider a proposal if it emanates from a company or a group of companies whose activities are genuinely integrated. For example, such a proposal might involve, but not be limited to, a large scale sawmill, a veneer plant, a flitch mill, a woodchip plant to process the residues, and the establishment of plantations as a further resource base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also recognised that significant large scale investments of the type we are endeavouring to encourage can and do arise when companies expand or extend their existing facilities perhaps through modernising or upgrading. The legislation enables this type of expansion to be eligible for resource security, provided it involves a substantial increase in the amount or the value of goods produced. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">One Hundred Million Dollar Threshold</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many detractors of the Bill criticise it for the requirement that a project must cross the $100m threshold before we will consider its eligibility. Let me remind honourable members that it was industry that initially sought resource security for major investments&mdash;and investments which at the time were referred to as being in the hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are determined to focus on investments of this size in the context of this legislation, because what the Government is offering to industry is not being done lightly. We are saying to industry, `We the Government of Australia, after conducting a comprehensive integrated assessment, and satisfying ourselves that certain obligations have been entered into by the enterprise and the relevant State Government, tie ourselves by legislation not to use our statutory powers, except in exceptional circumstances'. This, for any government, is an enormously important decision. We are willing to take it to facilitate investments of high value in the national interest. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill gives force to the Government's clear and unambiguous policy of excluding from eligibility for resource security any project whose dominant purpose is the export of logs or woodchips from native forests. As a further concrete way of underpinning this objective, the Commonwealth considers it necessary for industry proponents seeking resource security, as well as the governments involved, to give appropriate consideration to the establishment, maintenance and use of forestry plantations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a further boost to this policy, we have recognised the need to encourage investment in commercial plantations. Such investment&mdash;for export of woodchips, or to provide resource for downstream processing, or both&mdash;will be eligible for consideration for resource security under this legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consideration of resource security for this proposal would not include any woodchip from native hardwood forests. And, of course, the other criteria&mdash;including the $100m threshold&mdash;must be met. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real antecedents of this legislation can be found in industry's feelings of uncertainty, engendered by fear of the Commonwealth using its powers to remove significant tracts of forest from productive investments. We do not accept the validity of that perception, but we do accept that it exists and influences investment decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hugely important point for industry that the Government acknowledges in this legislation is that once a company has taken a major investment decision, following government giving the green light, it should not be for the Government to intervene later to thwart the product of that investment in anything other than the most exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way any government can have the confidence to renounce using its undoubted and legitimate powers is if it has first conducted a thorough and comprehensive integrated assessment of the project; and in conducting such an assessment, to have assured itself that all matters that fall within its responsibility have been addressed and, where appropriate and necessary, decisions considered and responsibly made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation carefully spells out the nature of that assessment. It after all is the basis on which the Government's guarantee not to use its powers stands or falls. In this regard the Bill:</PARA>

<PARA>-says that the Australian Heritage Commission must have a reasonable opportunity to consider and comment on matters that are within its ambit; and</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make this very clear: we will conduct assessments as fast as possible consistent with the thoroughness needed to provide the very certainty that industry and unions want. There will be no undue duplication either of efforts or assessments between the Commonwealth and the States. It is the Government's intention&mdash;indeed it will be the legal requirement under clause 12(4) of the Bill&mdash;that the Commonwealth assessment process must as far as practicable be integrated and coordinated with that of the relevant State. As an example of cooperative federalism I am sure this legislation will be outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth accepts that, provided all its assessment requirements are met before final approval is given and legislative resource security is provided, the assessment process can take place in two steps if a State so wishes. </PARA>

Just how `secure' is resource security?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been repeatedly stated, this Government is not in the business of abrogating its environmental, or for that matter, any other responsibilities. Of course we recognise&mdash;as do the States with which we have discussed this issue at length, and as do industry and unions&mdash;that things can change, that events can occur that are totally unforeseen, that exceptional situations can arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recognising these realities of life, we have stated unequivocally and clearly in the Bill what those circumstances have to be before the Commonwealth will wish to take a second look at the way a project with legislated resource security is being conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members should be aware that this Bill does not make it easy either for the Commonwealth to remove resource security or for a Minister to exercise a power that has been made dormant by the granting of resource security. The circumstances involved are remote and they are unexpected. And there is nothing automatic about these processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the Government's intention that before any Minister can consider whether or not to take any action, consultation will take place not only between Government Ministers, but also with the parties to the agreements in accordance with procedures laid down in those agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are five potential circumstances set out in the Bill under which Ministers might need to reactivate their dormant powers. These are all exceptional circumstances and the Government would not contemplate invoking dormant powers other than for those exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The five exceptions are, firstly, in order to prevent a `major physical impact' on the natural environment or Australia's cultural heritage, or to prevent a species of flora or fauna becoming threatened, or more threatened, or to prevent a substantial adverse effect on a `physical feature or thing' that is part of the cultural or natural heritage or national estate, or on a significant Aboriginal area or object, but only where these circumstances were not foreseen and had not been assessed up-front. A species will be declared as threatened only after Ministers are satisfied that an adequate scientific basis exists and only after there has been appropriate consultation with the States and their views taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second exception concerns the use of Commonwealth powers during the construction or commissioning stages, simply where it was not practicable to do so during the assessment stage&mdash;for example, to test some part of the plant that by definition cannot be done earlier. This section only relates to powers relevant to the construction or operation of the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third exception relates to matters quite extraneous to the up-front environmental, cultural, heritage, social and economic issues assessment, simply to cover such matters as acquiring land for defence purposes or blocking exports under United Nations sanctions. The fourth matter which obviously must be covered is a material breach of an agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth matter covers failure to comply with conditions or requirements imposed as a result of, during or after, the assessment process. The Government believes that it is better to spell out with precision what these highly restricted circumstances will be, rather than to leave industry in the dark by the use of a general statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two final matters to bring to honourable members' attention are that this Bill will not affect taxation or foreign investment review powers, and that this Bill will involve the exercise of responsibilities of several portfolios. Overall responsibility for the legislation will be with the Prime Minister and responsibility for particular sections will be designated to other relevant Ministers as appropriate. The division of portfolio responsibilities is set out in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned before that this Government did not intend to ignore the position of the bulk of the industry's hardwood sawmilling sector. Because of the enormous significance of the Government tying its hands in legislation not to use its powers, Government will only apply the Bill to very large investments of amounts exceeding $100m. Of course, the bulk of forest industry cannot be comprehended by the legislation. The Government has approved a non-legislative form of resource security that will go a long way to providing the type of security this part of the industry is seeking and, at the same time, encourage restructuring towards a more competitive industry for the future providing more and better jobs for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangements to be offered by the Commonwealth&mdash;through formal Commonwealth-State agreements&mdash;are similar to the provisions in the Bill in that they include a comprehensive up-front assessment covering all Commonwealth responsibilities for environmental, cultural, heritage, social and economic matters; intergovernmental agreements between the Commonwealth and State; State enterprise contracts; as well as provisions to accommodate changing circumstances of an exceptional nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The type of project we envisage could well use these arrangements is, for example, a sawmilling enterprise within a prescribed area such as the New South Wales south-east forests. The Commonwealth would require a number of provisions: that the enterprise must be willing to commit either to the value adding investment or to industry restructuring; the relevant State government must be prepared to offer a longer term, contractually based supply licence for sawlogs to enable the investment to proceed, such as has been the case in Victoria and in Western Australia; the woodchip export company must have invested, or be prepared to invest, in other value adding activities in Australia, either in sawmilling enterprises or commercial plantations and agree that domestic value adding of the woodchips has priority over their use for export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that the Commonwealth is involved in export licensing in the region concerned, it will offer a longer term export licence up to the year 2000 and thereafter on a case by case basis, on the understanding that if the woodchips are required for domestic use then, subject to market consideration, they should be directed to that end. This should not detract from the Commonwealth's firm desire to achieve maximum domestic processing of woodchips by the year 2000 or soon thereafter. The Government intends to discuss this proposal now with both the States and industry. We are confident, as I said before, that it will meet many if not all of this sector of the industry's concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the combination of the legislated resource security for large projects and the framework of enhanced intergovernmental agreements for others in the industry, the Government is offering a powerful and, I might say, an unprecedented package which delivers security and an incentive for restructuring in an environmentally responsible framework. I believe industry will accept the offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before commending this Bill to the consideration of honourable members, might I remind the House that the Bill and the non-legislated policy initiative for the hardwood sawmilling sector are concerned with achieving the following key objectives: ensuring the forest environment, heritage and cultural values are adequately considered in a transparent and predictable framework prior to development proceeding; facilitating much needed value adding investments in the forests sector, including commercial plantations; and creating more and better jobs for Australians who earn an honest living from this industry. Provided the forest industries hold to their commitment to invest&mdash;as the public is entitled to expect&mdash;Australia will benefit from world scale value adding investments before the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has the capacity to pave the way for a pulp mill proposal in northern Tasmania and an expansion of the existing mill at Maryvale in Victoria. Other major investments are envisaged for later in the decade in Western Australia and East Gippsland in Victoria. Of particular importance is the role of commercial plantations in providing the necessary feedstock to sustain these developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes it is steering a path, consistent with its environmental objectives, to create a better and more productive industry; an industry which can become the base for a sophisticated papermaking industry in the future, providing more jobs for Australians and more prosperity for our nation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the Act applies when a Commonwealth offence&mdash;created by an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament&mdash;is being investigated and when an `applied' Commonwealth offence is being investigated. An `applied' Commonwealth offence is created when an offence&mdash;that would normally be a State offence such as armed robbery or assault&mdash;occurs on a Commonwealth place. To overcome an unintended consequence of the Constitution, which did not allow State law to apply in those situations, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970 which deems such offences to be Commonwealth offences. State police can then investigate and prosecute these `applied' Commonwealth offences, and they are treated as if they were State offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Act 1991 has inserted part 1C into the Crimes Act 1914.

In particular, they will be required to electronically recall all police interviews with suspects because failure to do so renders any evidence obtained during such interviews prima facie inadmissible. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `applied' provisions are essentially State offences that have been artificially federalised for constitutional reasons. They are part of the States' criminal calendar not the Commonwealth's; they are normally prosecuted by State, as opposed to Commonwealth, Directors of Prosecution. Sentenced accused are State prisoners, and any fines realised go to State revenue. Part 1C of the Crimes Act 1914 in its initial stages will cause some operational difficulties to the States and Territories. The impact of part 1C on the States would be considerably lessened if this amendment were effected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment will in no way lessen the integrity of the provisions of the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Act 1991 in relation to true Commonwealth offences nor as a code of conduct for officers of the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Family Law Council has recommended that the Family Law Act should allow the Family Court to determine custody, guardianship, maintenance and access disputes where this would not interfere with the protection of the child by child welfare authorities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments as a package reflect a basic set of amendments that the Government introduced into the Senate subsequent to this legislation being passed through the House. Essentially, it was to meet the particular needs of the farm sector in certain circumstances. What we have done is to devise a package to assist a category of farmer who at present cannot benefit from either part C under the rural adjustment scheme or the Job Search allowance. Part C of the rural adjustment scheme assistance is not available to these farmers because their farms are considered profitable in the long term. The Job Search allowance is not available because their commitment to work on the farm means that they are not unemployed, so they do not qualify for an allowance. Even if they did qualify for Job Search allowance, the rate paid would be little or nothing in many cases because of the benefit assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the Government considers that immediate financial assistance should be available to farmers in severe financial hardship whose farms, whilst not profitable at present, are potentially profitable. The amendments before the Committee today provide for this Government package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package and the legislation have the following features. First, the rural adjustment scheme authority in a State will receive applications from farmers who consider that they fall within the terms of these arrangements. The RAS authority will certify that the farmer qualifies where he or she, or the farmer's spouse, normally contributes a significant part of his or her capital and labour to the farm and the farm normally provides the person's principal source of income and the farmer is in severe financial hardship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also requires that commercial finance to support the farm is not available, that part C under the rural adjustment scheme is not available for the farm either, that the farm is likely to be profitable in the long term and that the farmer is available for and willing to do full time work. When such a certificate is issued from the RAS authority the farmer can be regarded as unemployed for the purposes of qualifying for the Job Search allowance. In virtually all other respects the usual rules applicable to a person on Job Search allowance will apply to a Job Search allowee farmer, although he or she will not be subjected to a waiting period in respect of the liquid assets. Nor will he or she have to search for work off the farm although, if work is offered and the farmer is available, he or she will be expected to work. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Lloyd" NAMEID="2E4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr Lloyd</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I just interrupt here. Does that mean that the ordinary work test would apply? In other words, you won't have to search for work but, if work is offered, the farmer must accept?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct. Although we have indicated that, if there was the particular circumstance of the job being available when the farmer found himself in circumstances of having to plant the crop that day, then special leniency would be provided. In essence, the farmer does not have to search for the work but, if it is offered, then he must take it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major aspect of this scheme of assistance is a modification of the benefit assets test hardship rules as they relate to farmers whom a RAS authority has certified to be within the scheme. The RAS authority will certify which farm assets, including machinery, livestock and the farm itself, are essential to the farm's long term profitability. These and the farmer's life insurance policies will be regarded as unrealisable assets. They will be ignored for the purposes of the assets test. Additionally, in the vast bulk of cases they will be regarded as generating no income, so they will not adversely affect the farmer's rate of Job Search allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefit assets test hardship concessions are generally available only where the value of the person's liquid or readily available assets is less than $6,000 for a single person or $10,000 for a married couple. In calculating these amounts, no notice will be taken of amounts held in business accounts as working capital where the funds are required for essential and usual farm operating costs. The concession is the same as that which applies for family allowance and for the family allowance supplement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide for the conclusion of a protocol between the two departments charged with the administration of this package&mdash;the Department of Social Security and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. This is to facilitate the smooth and cooperative running of the scheme. The Social Security Appeals Tribunal will be able to review farmers' Job Search allowance decisions, including decisions to reject claims or to pay at a set rate. These amendments do not at the moment permit a tribunal to review the RAS authority's decision to certify that a farmer should not come within the scheme or that certain farm assets are not essential for the farm's long term profitability. Should monitoring of the operation of the scheme show that such review rights are required, consultation with the States and the Northern Territory will be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I should indicate that the amendments provide for the scheme to operate for two years from 1 December 1991. I think in response to a question&mdash;it may have been an interjection&mdash;from the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Lloyd) as to why when we initially announced this scheme we said that it could not operate before 1 January, I indicated at that time that it was our assessment that that was the time it would take to get through this Parliament. I said that I would undertake to expedite that and that, if we had the cooperation of the coalition parties, I would do what I could to have the date brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have succeeded in that. We have pulled all stops out to get this legislation through in recognition of the severe hardship that is out there. That is why it is important for this chamber to be meeting at this late stage tonight. I gather that was the purport of the accompanying message that came from the Senate. It is, therefore, important for this legislation to go through tonight so that people who are deserving can take advantage of these important new provisions. Obviously, in 1993 the need for the scheme to continue will be assessed, and legislation will be presented if necessary. But at this stage it has a two-year sunset provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I say to the House that this is a well-targeted scheme. It is a scheme that will provide real assistance to farmers most in need. Most importantly, it will underpin that important aspect of our farm restructuring strategy which has been built around the rural adjustment scheme and into which a lot of additional money has been put&mdash;an additional $140m over the next two years as a result of our most recent announcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of this package, together with the money provided through the rural adjustment scheme, is to ensure that we protect our asset base. I happen to believe that there is a strong and healthy future for agriculture in this country, despite the difficulties that it is going through. However, there is not much point in getting more market access or encouraging value adding if we do not protect the base. What this package of measures is about is complementary to many other aspects that I have developed in the last few months, which is about protecting the base and ensuring that good farmers can stay on the land through difficult circumstances. I commend the amendments to the House and urge that they be passed expeditiously so that this money can be paid as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has indicated that the amendments which we are debating now have been hurriedly attached to a Bill that originally went through the House without any reference to the possibility of farmers obtaining Job Search or Newstart allowance or, if one likes, the old unemployment benefit allowance where they are in a very difficult financial position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Minister for taking this action to bring the legislation here and to have the scheme starting from 1 December. The farmers of Australia face a devastating situation. For the first time ever in our history, the average farm income will be a negative income. They are the projections for this financial year. We have still over six months of the financial year to go, and the situation continues to deteriorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is caused by a combination of factors: a drop in commodity prices as a result, partly, of the export subsidies of the European Community; the grain war between the Europeans and the Americans; the problems with wool; the drought, which is a most severe one in much of New South Wales and Queensland; the high internal cost structure that farmers have to face in this country; and the taxes on inputs which they have to face, and which the coalition, with its Fightback package, will remove. The Fightback package will immediately make an impact on the ability of farmers to survive and to be profitable irrespective of the level of their net income because costs will be removed on the production side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many farmers are in a very bad situation because there is no welfare net available to them. Some of them do not have enough cash flow to put groceries on the table. They are in a situation that no other person in Australia faces because the welfare net is there for other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers are in this situation because this Government removed two basic welfare nets that we had in place to meet these situations. The first was the natural disaster arrangements for drought. If the Government does not like the way the ordinary drought provisions were applied then there is the question of severe drought. That is what is being urged by the States and by the farmer organisations at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second change was that this Government altered the basis and payment arrangements for household support from those that we had in place, where household support was there as an alternative&mdash;and sensible alternative&mdash;to unemployment benefit for farmers. It was there on a welfare payment basis, income tested to be the farmer equivalent to unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was in this Parliament in the mid-1970s. When we were returned to Government in 1975, it was a very difficult time for farmers. Japan had closed its doors to our beef. There was a range of other problems because Britain had joined the European Community. When we returned to Government we dropped the assets test for welfare assessments that the Labor Government had brought in prior to 1976. We had a flexible approach to the work test. For example, in the winter of 1976 there were 700 dairy farmers in my electorate alone who were receiving a part unemployment benefit. But because of the problems of twisting, fiddling or altering an unemployment benefit criterion which really did not fit the particular problems of farmers, we brought in household support in 1977. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) was the Minister at that time. We brought in household support on the basis of an alternative to the unemployment benefit, without the work test requirement but on an income tested basis. It was available, equivalent to the unemployment benefit, for a 12-month period as a welfare payment. Then after the first 12 months, it was available as a conditional payment dependent upon whether the farmer was making an effort to leave farming. That was subsequently altered to loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing that a farmer who is in that position of having no cash flow wants or is able to handle is any further loans. I know the Minister has slightly eased the loans arrangements and the conditional arrangement for household support, but the whole basis of household support has now changed to what it was when we brought it in in 1977. If it had been left in place in the way it was then, we would not be here at this hour, months beyond the time when something should have been in place for farmers in a financially devastated position, bringing in something that is a second best way of treating the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had to go through some of this with the family allowance in this House and the Senate just recently. Now we are going through it with this. The Minister has announced that some amendments were accepted in the Senate. They were basically to drop the work test. I commend what I understand were some sensible negotiations and discussions between both sides of Parliament&mdash;the Minister on the one hand and the shadow Minister on the other, and a range of other people as well&mdash;with regard to that work test. I believe that is a valuable alteration to the present legislation. There have been some other improvements made to make the legislation applicable, because we have quite a number of them here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that prior to these amendments about 4,000 farmers would have been technically eligible for some part payment or full payment of Job Search allowance and Newstart, and that this will make about another 2,000 farmers eligible. That gives a maximum potential of 6,000 farmers or about 4 per cent of the total number of farmers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the figures concerning farm incomes and farmers at risk, it is still a very small percentage of those that we understand &mdash;and farmer organisations are saying&mdash;are in this very difficult financial position where they cannot properly pay for support for their family. That goes beyond items of food and everyday living; it goes to education as well. The Government should look very hard and very quickly at Austudy, because in many country areas there are more expenses in relation to education. Yet these people, who are in the worst of all financial positions, are still not eligible for Austudy in spite of the changes the Government has made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only one sensible hardship provision for all of these categories of welfare payments to farmers and for Austudy in these circumstances of extreme economic difficulty. We should use the income test only. It is the only fair and equitable method. That is the policy of the coalition parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that, whether it is for education or for welfare assistance arrangements in these times of extreme economic difficulty, the only sensible, fair, equitable and easily applied form of assistance is the income test, which is applied to most other Australians, because when we go through the pages and pages of hardship provisions and the checking and the cross-checking, other tests do not meet many of the problem situations. It is difficult. It is so much better to have the income test. When it comes to this particular problem, it is the policy of the coalition parties to reinstate household support as a welfare income tested payment for the first nine months and then, beyond that, the usual conditional arrangements of loan or continued welfare payment, dependent upon whether the farmer is making attempts to leave agriculture. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a couple of comments about this particular matter, which comes to us in the early hours of the morning. We are looking at the prospect of Job Search allowance being made available to disaster stricken farmers. The Government announced its intention to act in this regard some months ago and then commendably, after everyone asked the very obvious question as to why the introduction of this measure was announced and then delayed so long, brought the starting date forward to 1 December. Even that starting date allowed the Government plenty of time to get this particular Bill prepared and for the necessary changes to be put in place. Sadly, it all has to be put through the Parliament in a few hours very early in the morning, two days before the Bill is scheduled to come into effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of particular concern to people in country areas that even though these new arrangements are supposed to apply so soon, no-one within the social security system or within the rural adjustment system has any idea how they are going to work. One of my local newspapers published information in that regard in its latest edition, pointing out that none of the local social security offices had any idea how they were going to apply. The local farm councillors did not know how they were going to apply. The Commonwealth Employment Service did not know how they were going to apply. No details have been provided to farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very unlikely that there will be any farmers in a position to actually collect the benefit on 1 December, even though that is supposed to be the start-up date. By the time they have gone through all the involved procedures that are required under these amendments, by the time they have made all the necessary applications, filled out all of the detailed forms, have all the necessary financial information prepared and dealt with the long processing time that is associated with the Department's bureaucratic processes, we are looking at many weeks, perhaps months, before this relief will be available to any farmers at all. It is most disappointing that this lack of notice has been available to anyone associated with administering the arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing with a major crisis in the rural sector of Australia. Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> had a front page article relating to the $2 billion catastrophe for Queensland alone. It went on to refer to the losses in the sugar industry, the fact that the grain harvest will be very small, perhaps $300m below expectations. What is worse, the summer planting season is now almost past and little or no crop has been planted. Dry-land cotton plantings have been devastated and there is very little irrigation water left for the irrigated crops. Peanut growers need rain to plant. The $600m horticulture industry is also looking at massive losses. Wool producers have plunged into crisis and have no idea where their next dollar is coming from. There are many worthless sheep being shot all over the countryside. Water supplies are desperately low, and clearly that is already affecting many urban areas, cities and country towns. We have a major crisis. If ever there has needed to be any illustration of that factor, it has certainly been recent figures which suggest that the average income for farmers this year will be minus $20,000 or more. What an appalling state of affairs!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reached a stage where proud farmers, people who have been proud of their achievements and who have worked hard all of their days&mdash;farming families that have worked perhaps for three or four generations &mdash;now have to look at some kind of welfare measures just to exist. That will mean that many people are looking forward with some degree of hope and expectation to the measures announced by the Government which may enable them to survive until the next crop comes in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures do not tell it all. It is the personal crises that worry me most&mdash;the people who are involved in this tragedy and the families who are going without. Associated with this same article on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> was a tiny paragraph which said that rural women were being given contraceptive pills free of charge because they could not afford to buy them. That indication of the personal tragedy&mdash;the absolute destitution of many of the people who are affected by this crisis&mdash;ought to be filling all honourable members with a degree of shame; shame that one of our country's major national industries has reached this state of crisis. The Government offers the possibility of unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to be realistic and know that most farmers will be very disappointed with the end result of the legislation that is before us this evening. The shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), has recently put the figures before the Committee. The facts are that despite the hopelessly inadequate current circumstances, which are designed not to make Jobstart allowances available to farmers because of their need to care for their properties, around 4,000 farmers are already getting Jobstart, either themselves or by way of an application made by their spouse. The farmers are being treated as dependants of their spouse. That is a very humiliating situation for people who work long and hard on their properties for such a long period. Nonetheless, 4,000 people around Australia have had to resort to this welfare measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These new provisions were announced with great fanfare and many farmers had been led to believe that they would provide hope and opportunity for them. Now we are told the provisions will provide benefits for perhaps another 2,000. As the honourable member for Murray mentioned, that is a total of 4 per cent of all of the Australian farmers who may happen to qualify for these benefits. This comes at a time when virtually all are destitute and when the average income is in the minus category. Clearly, this will go only a very small way towards helping the many people who are in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If all that was not bad enough&mdash;only 2,000 or so can expect to qualify out of the tens of thousands who are likely to want to qualify&mdash;the Government has placed this discount provision in these new measures, which means that there will be a reduction of $1 for every $250 worth of liquid assets that are actually held by the farmer. Even if he does qualify for the Jobstart allowance&mdash;and even if he does manage to find his way through these more generous assets test arrangements&mdash;he will not get the same Jobstart allowance that other people get; his will be specially discounted to take into account the essential assets that he may be holding so that he can be a viable farmer for the future and plant the crop when the day of rainfall finally arrives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is particularly disappointing, and it is especially disappointing that the Government has chosen not to take on board the amendments when they were moved in the Senate and then not to take any opportunity that might have been available to it to accept the amendments in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I welcome the fact that the Government has at last recognised the catastrophe in the bush, the crisis has become so monumental that even this Government has noticed it and is expressing a real desire to assist the people in need; but sadly these measures fall a long way short of what is required and they will leave most farmers disappointed. The small number who actually do qualify will get far less than they need and far less than other people in similar circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to respond to a couple of points. At the outset, I understand the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Lloyd) is talking about the concept of reintroducing household support under the coalition's policy. I simply remind the Committee that I introduced the flexibility through part C of the rural adjustment scheme which provides household support. I provided it in circumstances before any of these amendments came through, whereby we gave a six month breathing space for people to be able to access household support if they were judged to be long term not viable but did not have to make the decision to exit the land. That six months has been extended by another six months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those honourable members who want to make an issue of the fact that what we are doing is giving access to Job Search and not to household support are wrong. They should understand not so much the complex nature of this issue as the different avenues of opportunity that are available through the combination of the rural adjustment scheme and the social security provisions. Household support does exist and it exists under part C. I have extended leniency for another six months as a result of the last set of negotiations I had with the State governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I make concerning the Austudy allowance is this: those opposite should look at what we did in the last Budget. We increased the entitlement to Austudy to two categories of people on the farm: a person who was a recipient under part C, that is, household support; and a recipient of any social security pension. So any person qualifying under this new provision can also qualify for the Austudy entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I simply urge the National Party, when it is considering this matter and trying to find fault with this strategy, that it actually understand the detail. I understand the point that the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) makes, that this information has not been out in the complexity of its detail. Certainly, the information is known, because we have had enormous responses. I think this initiative that we have introduced has been extremely well received by the farm sector, because it does see it as a fundamentally separate concept from household support, which requires people to leave the land. </PARA>

What we have determined to do in this situation is recognise the particular circumstance of a person who falls between parts A and B under RAS and part C, because under parts A and B assistance essentially requires people to incur further debt, albeit interest subsidised. But there is the category of person, particularly the person I have come across in the Darling Downs area and northern New South Wales&mdash;the drought affected area&mdash;who is long term viable because that is some of the most fertile ground in the country. There is no question about the long term viability, but persons in that category cannot incur any further debt. Why? Because they have not had a cash flow for four years. They are the sort of people we should be trying to keep on the land, recognising that the scheme as it is currently structured cannot look after them, because they cannot incur debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why this scheme has been introduced and that is why it will be welcomed.

Firstly, in relation to Austudy, the Minister mentioned that the criteria in the Budget were made easier for those farmers who are on part C of the rural adjustment scheme and that those who are welfare recipients would now be eligible for Austudy. That is a very small percentage of farmers and it comes at a time&mdash;and I repeat again&mdash;when the average farm income this year will be a minus figure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recognise that there are compelling reasons for resuming this debate at 1.53 this morning, but I regret that we do not have the audience that perhaps is deserved. Many questions demand answers after the massacre at the Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili on 12 November 1991. How many people were killed? Was the order to kill a mere local military aberration, or did it represent a calculated expression of a national policy? Were extra judicial executions of between 60 and 80 people carried out on 15 November? What are the prospects for democracy in Indonesia? Should self-determination for East Timor be placed on the political agenda of Indonesia and the United Nations? Why does the Indonesian Government still refuse Amnesty International and the International Red Cross access to East Timor? Does the size of Indonesia's population, its proximity to Australia and the significance of oilfields in the Timor region cause us to adopt a double standard in responding to the Dili massacre?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I express concern at the tepid amendment moved on behalf of the Opposition by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). The House either indicates its outrage or it does not. A halfway position of qualified outrage cannot be maintained. I hope that the Opposition will not press its amendment to a division. The very cautious language used by the honourable member was in sharp contrast to what he said here in September and October about the Baltic states and the Ukraine. He did not explain the double standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also troubled by the despairing pessimism of some honourable members. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) said of East Timor:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an opportunity for independence or for some other option to become incorporated is no longer available . . . As of the end of the 1970's that option was lost.</PARA>
<PARA>The dramatic international changes of the past two years have shown that what used to be blindingly obvious in realpolitik terms can rapidly become irrelevant. Incorporation of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in the Soviet Union seemed to be absolutely final in 1945. Nobody would put that view now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret never having visited East Timor. It would be absurd for me to pontificate about whether it could constitute a viable independent state. The term `self-determination' is extremely vague and can take many different forms. The motion before the House asks the Government to explore all possible constructive avenues for meeting the longer term need and aspirations of the East Timorese people. This may be coded language to cover possible self-determination; it is certainly not explicit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, is viability a necessary precondition for self-determination, and does its lack prohibit the development of democracy? Scores of UN members have smaller populations and fewer natural resources, not to mention the offshore oil which could make East Timor relatively rich. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am even more troubled by the apparent willingness of some honourable members to give away other people's right to democracy and free expression. It may be seen as hard-nosed realism to say in effect, `Well, democracy works in affluent educated societies with a long tradition of pluralism, open debate and political constraint, but we cannot expect it to work in Asia or Africa'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One-party rule has certainly been the norm in Asia and Africa, with a variety of authoritarian regimes resisting political change. But even here the winds of change are now sweeping through. Witness recent dramatic changes in the political scene in South Africa and in Zambia where Kenneth Kaunda's gracious acceptance of defeat has added greatly to his stature. That lesson has not yet been learnt in Myanmar. But we ought not be saying that while we support democratic processes in Myanmar, Zambia or Croatia it would be unrealistic for East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under President Sukarno's regime, Indonesia experimented with a variety of political forms. A federation of 16 states was established in 1949, then replaced by a unitary state in 1950. There was a democratic period between 1950 and 1959, marked by extreme political fragmentation and the organisation of parties along regional or sectional lines. Twenty-eight parties contested the 1955 elections, most seats being won by four irreconcilable groups. There were seven different Cabinets between 1949 and 1957 and guided democracy was imposed from 1959. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spectre of national disintegration which haunts Indonesia's rulers in Jakarta makes claims for self-determination in East Timor seem so threatening. After all, how can there be self-determination in East Timor if there is no process for self-determination in Java, Sumatra, or Kalimantan?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesian Government has adopted several techniques for signalling its determination to crush political dissent. The attack in East Timor is probably one of them. Another, less open to ambiguity, has been the execution of political prisoners for offences committed many years earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 October 1965 there was an abortive coup against the army's political power by the PKI, the Indonesian communist party, with the tacit support of President Sukarno. The army struck back, took Sukarno into protective custody and put General Suharto into effective control. He has remained in power for 26 years. The October 1965 coup was followed by a wave of killings which appear to have been unexpected and without central direction, the greatest number proportionally being in the tourist paradise of Bali. The PKI was smashed; its leaders were killed or gaoled. It has been credibly estimated that 500,000 PKI members were killed and about one million arrested. Many were tried and sentenced to death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Left is no longer a threat to the Indonesian political system. Nevertheless, in February 1990, after more than 24 years in custody, four political prisoners were executed for their involvement in the attempted coup of 1 October 1965, despite strong appeals for clemency from the European Parliament. Leaving aside the general question of the appropriateness of the death penalty for any offence, there is something particularly chilling about leaving political or, indeed, any prisoners on death row for nearly a quarter of a century and telling them, `We don't propose to execute you now for your 1965 offences, but we'll get round to it in a few years'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sounds like pathological behaviour. Let us charitably seek an alternative explanation &mdash;the aim is to deter not the ageing survivors of 1 October 1965 but those perceived as a current threat in 1990 itself, and in the hope that execution would be seen as a salutary warning of the regime's determination to crush dissent: not with the loss of thousands of lives, just the handful taken out, blindfolded and shot by firing squad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixteen more prisoners were executed between 1985 and 1989 for offences relating to the 1965 coup, and at least nine more remain under sentence of death. These executions are even odder when we recall that Indonesia executes far fewer prisoners than Malaysia which has only one-tenth of Indonesia's population. The greatest perceived threat to Indonesia's political system and the Pancasila is not, of course, East Timor but Islamic fundamentalism and regional factionalism. The rise of militant Islam, so powerful in Asia where sharia has now been adopted not only in Iran but in modified form in Pakistan, is strongly opposed by the Indonesian army. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September 1984, there was a clash between Muslims and troops at Tanjung Priok in central Jakarta when soldiers opened fire, killing at least 30 people. This was followed by the arrest of Muslim preachers and students for opposing the forced adoption of the Pancasila and distributing pamphlets critical of the Government. Amnesty International protested in support of the arrested Muslims. Remarks attributed to General Try Sutriano, Commander of the Armed Forces, on the day after the Santa Cruz massacre, have caused great anger and distress. He said: `These ill-bred people have to be shot. . . and we will shoot them' and that `Disruptors . . . had to be shot'. It is clear that, after more than 15 years of occupation, local feeling for self-determination in East Timor remains strong. If talks are organised through the good offices of the United Nations Secretary-General, a place must be found for Fretilin and its leader Xanana Gusmao. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ending of the Cold War has led to the explosive release of new political forces&mdash;some democratic, some nationalist and some authoritarian. The break up of Yugoslavia and the proclamation of independence by Croatia and Slovenia with much bloodshed and destruction are very fresh in our minds. Yugoslavia's civil war will have been followed even more closely in Jakarta, and probably contributed to a determination that provincial separatism had to be crushed. This tragedy should be investigated by the United Nations, UNESCO and the International Red Cross. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that Australia can take a leading role in encouraging full and frank discussion between contending parties, just as it has in Cambodia. Senator Gareth Evans will no doubt raise these issues when he visits Indonesia next month to explore the prospects for a longer term resolution of the East Timor issue. It is tragic to read the lists provided by Amnesty International of the names and details of occupations and ages of the people who were killed in the incident on 12 November&mdash;within this very month&mdash;some of them mere children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a particular tragedy for us because of our heavy involvement in the area and perhaps, no doubt, a degree of complicity as a result of our acceptance in 1979 of de jure recognition of the incorporation of East Timor. We were certainly among the first nations, if not the first, to do so. We have been followed by the ASEAN nations. No doubt there has been de facto recognition by a large number of other countries, including the United States. The issue has very rarely been considered seriously by the United Nations since the resolution was put up in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, will be as successful in Indonesia next month as he has been in his repeated discussions about Cambodia. Let us hope that we are able to report in the Parliament in the next few months and years that the situation has been relieved and that there are prospects for a greater degree of freedom and perhaps even self-determination in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred earlier to the problem of Moslem fundamentalism in Indonesia. The people of East Timor are not of that persuasion. There is no doubt that within its political system Indonesia has yet to evolve the means of coping with dissent. There is very little ability to distinguish between an attack on a government which threatens the whole regime and quite mild criticism. For example, the incident in 1984 when Moslems were arrested for distributing leaflets simply saying that the Pancasila had been imposed on their schools was regarded with the utmost seriousness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, there has been a very marked concern in the region about newspaper criticism. Where articles appear in Australian journals, it is taken for granted that it is inspired by the Government. It is taken almost as axiomatic that the Government will control all media outlets and it will be impossible for an independent view to be put, unless it is actually inspired by the Government. I know that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), with his passionate views on the liberty of the press and his desire to have the widest possible ownership of the press and diversity of sources, would resist that view. Indeed, he might even give his life for it. </PARA>
