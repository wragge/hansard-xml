<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, I am not aware of the evidence that has been given by Mr Connell this morning. At the outset, in answering that question, I would like to take the opportunity to go to issues that the Leader of the Opposition has raised and with respect to which he has said that there are questions that need answering.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would hope that those opposite would expect that I would take this first opportunity, within the framework of this question, to answer those questions. I would like, at the outset, to go to the circumstances of this lunch, to what happened at that time and to all of the relevant circumstances leading up to it in relation to all the questions which, last Friday, the Leader of the Opposition said publicly needed to be answered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A program had been prepared in advance for the 1987 election campaign, including visits to Perth. A private lunch was organised for 15 June by Mr Burke, who had told me that he intended to seek financial support for the Australian Labor Party. Of course, it is perfectly normal and proper for a political leader to attend and speak at such a function. At the luncheon, as I have said, I spoke informally, but in some detail, on the record and achievements of my Government to that time. I spoke not only about the positive reasons why this Government should be supported and re-elected, but also, as I have said, about the hopeless inadequacy of the Opposition in terms of forming an alternative government. Also, at that lunch, I spoke of the Government's plans for the future.</PARA>
<PARA> It is entirely possible that at the luncheon the issue of a gold tax was discussed. It was, as will be recollected, a major issue in Western Australia at that time and it would have been surprising if it had not been raised. If it was, I would have talked in terms of the Government's policy. That policy should have been well known, but it was continually being queried by the Australian Gold Mining Industry Council and the Opposition. I do not think anyone will be surprised when I say that I cannot be dogmatic about every detail of that luncheon; but I assert this fundamental point, which I have from the beginning-I do now, and I will at all times: I gave no private commitment on this matter and could not have given any such private commitment. I would not have said anything beyond what I had already said publicly only a few hours earlier: no gold tax if re-elected.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to the details of what I had said so there can be no doubt in anyone's mind on that point. I refer to the reference to the interview on 6WF with Diana Warnock. I was asked, `If you are re-elected will there be a gold tax?' I replied, `No'. This was on the morning of 15 June. The observation-not a question-by Warnock was:</PARA>
<PARA> Categoric assurance, no gold tax.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Financial Review of the following day, 16 June, had no doubt at all as to what I had said. It reported that statement of the morning of 15 June in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, gave an unequivocal guarantee yesterday that his Government would not introduce either a gold tax or a broadly-based consumption tax if elected for a third term.</PARA>
<PARA>What I had said that morning was interpreted in that way, as it should have been-the only way it could have been interpreted. I have no recollection of being involved in any discussions about specific donations at the lunch, and nor is there any suggestion that I was. That is quite clear from the evidence. There was no suggestion that I was engaged in any discussions about specific donations at the lunch.</PARA>
<PARA> I can, however, say that there was no need for any donation to the Labor cause to establish this policy. It was already set in place and had been for some time. The record shows that the Treasurer had stated that there would be no gold tax at least twice between the election being called and 15 June. That policy was public knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to a sequence of matters which is relevant to that point. On 23 April 1987, in a speech in Sydney launching the Australian nugget bullion coin, I referred to the Government's decision not to remove the tax exempt status of the goldmining industry. It was a theme to which I returned a fortnight later on 7 May at the annual dinner of the Australian Mining Industry Council. There was no ambiguity about my words. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>Let me add that after a review of the taxation arrangements for the gold mining industry, we decided not to remove its current income tax exemption . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Less than three weeks later, on 27 May, I announced that a general election would be held on 11 June 1987. The Treasurer, Mr Keating, also made it plain on 30 May that the Government was not considering a gold tax. He was reported in the Canberra Times as saying that a gold tax had been considered, the decision had been made and that `it's off the agenda'. This was reiterated on 4 June in a media statement from the Treasurer's office which said that the Government had rejected outright the Gutman recommendation for the imposition of a gold tax. That statement from the Treasurer's office continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Having made that decision, the Government has before it no proposals to change the tax treatment of the goldmining industry, nor does it have any intention of considering any proposals.</PARA>
<PARA>From that chronology it should be plain that, with an election at most only months away, the Government's policy against the introduction of a gold tax was firmly established and it was widely publicised. It was inevitable in the circumstances that the `no tax' December decision of Cabinet would not only stand but also have to apply to Labor's next term of office. In political terms, it was meaningless otherwise. As 1987 wore on it became increasingly relevant to relate that decision to post-election matters, as the Treasurer did on 30 May, as I have said, in reference to our intentions, if re-elected, for Labor's 1987 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, in May 1987 I addressed the Australian Mining Industry Council's annual dinner. As I have said, at that speech I referred to the December Cabinet decision. On the eve of an election campaign the reference only made sense as applied to the next term of a re-elected Labor government. As I have said, the question was put to me explicitly when I was interviewed on radio in Perth on the morning of 15 June. I have referred to the unequivocal answer that I gave, the way it was immediately accepted by the interviewer and the proper interpretation that was made by the Australian Financial Review the following day. I also seek to repeat this: whether a policy is public or not, I do not trade off the policies of this Party for campaign donations.</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members-Ha, ha!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those opposite can laugh. I have not done it and I will not do it. Let me say-and I say it with full respect to the honourable member for Bennelong-that the Australian Financial Review of 22 June reported a meeting between the Leader of the Opposition, as he then was, Mr Howard, and Mr Bond. It is entirely possible that the issue of gold tax was raised at that meeting but, if it was, I am sure that the honourable member for Bennelong, as Leader of the Opposition, would have provided the same assurance as the one that I have publicly alluded to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say in regard to the questions that were raised and said by the Leader of the Opposition needed to be publicly answered: we came to the decision of 7 July to put our election commitment in writing to the Gold Mining Industry Council. As I have said, this was something we had resisted because we were keen to avoid being deluged with similar demands by other lobby groups. But, as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has proudly proclaimed, the strategy of those in the goldmining industry was ultimately successful because they forced the Liberals to cave in. With the Liberal commitment in the bag, the gold lobby threatened--</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a matter of record. As a matter of record, the Leader of the Opposition gave that commitment in writing. I am indebted to the honourable member for Bennelong: he acknowledges that he did. With that commitment in the bag, the gold lobby threatened that, unless there was a written commitment from us, Labor would face a massive campaign in the last days of the election. Given that at least four seats were vulnerable to such a campaign, I agreed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer was consulted. While, for reasons that I have stated, neither the Treasurer nor I liked the idea of putting the matter in writing, we both recognised the inevitability of doing so. It was evidence of what could be achieved by an influential third party lobby group and it is relevant to our proposals on political advertising and public disclosure of donations.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of record that it was this Government that bit the bullet in 1988, taking a decision to introduce a gold tax from January 1991, as it is equally a matter of record that in, I think, October of 1989 the Opposition, in its Economic Action Plan, also came out and said that, if it was elected at the next election, it would not change the decision that we had announced in May of 1988 for the tax to come into effect in January 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> I seek to make the point as strongly as I possibly can that, as far as I am concerned, at no stage either on 15 June or at any other point did I give any private commitment to Mr Connell or anyone else. The position that I had arrived at on this matter was that, in the electoral situation with which the Government was faced, the decision that we had taken in December in regard to a gold tax was one that had to apply for the whole period of the next Labor government. But clearly it would have made no political sense if we had had a position that we would not do it for one month or two months or three months; it was politically meaningless. I had come to the position-and clearly had made it abundantly publicly clear that morning-that that was the position that the Labor Party would have to adopt. I repeat: I have been in public life for 33 years now and I assert--</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members-Ah!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those opposite do not like it. I am entitled, in the context of the questions that are asked and the innuendo that is put, to make the point that in 33 years of public life in the industrial wing of the trade union movement and in the political wing of the Labor movement, my integrity has not been for sale; it is not there for someone to buy for any amount of money, and it was not on this occasion. What happened was clearly that I, on behalf of this Government, had arrived at a position where the Labor Party, if re-elected to government, would not impose a tax on gold in the next term of that government. I made that perfectly clear that morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not, on any occasion, in any circumstance, on 15 June or on any other occasion, given a private commitment on this matter. All I have done at all points is state what the position of the Party would be if re-elected. We adhere to that. I repeat: in the end we were the only side of politics which then had the guts to make the decision but while adhering to that commitment not to introduce the tax in the lifetime of that next government. I am pleased to say not only that we did it but also that the Opposition, finally in 1989, as distinct from the difficulties those opposite quoted beforehand, acknowledged the correctness of the decision we have taken.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2548" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That statement was very significant in the history of the Australian taxation system. I remind the House of some of the things that were done: the cutting of the company tax rate to 39 per cent; the introduction of the abolition of 5-year/3-year depreciation; the introduction of foreign source income legislation; research and development incentives; the abolition of private company dividends, dividends paid by tax exempt entities; the abolition of the exemption on goldmining income; pre-paid expenses; the prescribed payment system; expanded audit programs; and, of course, a radical change to the tax treatment of superannuation. It was one of a succession of landmark changes to the tax system, the first being in the tax statement of 1985.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the tax statement of 1985, which dealt with the absolute haemorrhaging of the Australian taxation system through capital gains taxation, through fringe benefits taxation, through dealing with all of the loopholes which existed at that time, was of course under attack by the then Opposition. It remained under attack and was voted against by the then Opposition when all of the measures came to the Parliament. But we remember the desperate campaign of the then Opposition in 1987, which was referred to in the previous question in this House. We then heard the Leader of the Opposition, a questioner on this issue. `How goes vote buying', says the Australian Financial Review, `with $7.3 billion in tax cuts?'. Honourable members should listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA>Capital gains tax goes. Fringe benefits tax goes, deductions restored for entertainment expenses. The assets test goes. Changed treatment of lump sum superannuation pay outs, which underpins the whole reform of tax superannuation, goes.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the policy of credit. And here is the tax policy statement by the honourable member for Bennelong. It states that a Liberal Government would also abolish Labor's capital gains tax, assets test, fringe benefits tax, et cetera. In addition to that, in the course of that shabby campaign with those shabby policies, the Leader of the Opposition made a commitment that he would not introduce a gold tax over the three year term of the next Liberal Government. That is what he said. But on 12 April-that was last week-he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister does have to explain an apparent embellishment of the Government's public position seen as different to give a timeless nonspecific promise not to introduce something and then say you won't introduce it for the lifetime of the upcoming Parliament. It is different and the Government does have and the Prime Minister does have explaining to do.</PARA>
<PARA>All that the Prime Minister did was write in exactly the same terms as those used by the Leader of the Opposition, which were:</PARA>
<PARA>We will not introduce a gold tax over the three year term of the next Liberal Government.</PARA>
<PARA>He did exactly the same as the Leader of the Opposition did.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 June a report in the Australian Financial Review stated, and this is worth mentioning:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>According to a spokesman for Mr Bond the question of fundraising-</PARA>
<PARA>this is at the famous lunch-</PARA>
<PARA>did not arise during discussions.</PARA>
<PARA>That is corroborating what the Prime Minister said last week. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . although before the lunch Mr Bond was under the impression that it might be.</PARA>
<PARA> The spokesman added that John Howard had seen Mr Bond when he was campaigning in Perth, although that meeting had been in Mr Bond's office.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that we are entitled to hear from the honourable member for Bennelong about what conversations he had about gold mining with Mr Bond, what commitments he made and what funds he sought or received from Mr Bond. The honourable member is too clever by half. The honourable member for Pearce can answer this point because there was some conjecture that he saw Mr Bond first and then accompanied the honourable member for Bennelong to see Mr Bond. I would be interested in the honourable member's response. However, one thing is certain: the honourable member for Bennelong saw Mr Bond in his office. Honourable members might recall that Mr Bond was then about to try to float his gold mining operations and was seeking to have his securities listed in Europe. The honourable member for Bennelong rolled into his office in the middle of an election campaign. What happened? Was gold not discussed? Were commitments not discussed? Did the honourable member never ask for a donation? If the Australian Labor Party seeks corporate funding, it is a crime; if the Liberal Party seeks it, it is okay.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the quotes from the spurious spokespersons for the Liberal Party. On 10 October 1986, Senator Chaney stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Hawke Government would be lunatic to consider changing the historic taxation status of gold at this time.</PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal-National Parties will repeal the tax when we return to office at the next election.</PARA>
<PARA>Lunatic, why? Iron ore and nickel are taxed and every other mineral commodity is taxed. Why would it be lunatic to remove the income tax exemption on gold? Why would the Opposition seek to repeal it? This is a funny turn to the political debate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Party, this Prime Minister and this Treasurer have removed the exemption for the taxation of gold; the Opposition has opposed it and kept it, yet it is asking the pointed questions. We should ask the questions: why is the Opposition so committed? Why was the Opposition so committed to keep it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Bills were introduced on 10 November 1988, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, said:</PARA>
<PARA>We will be moving Committee stage amendments to oppose the removal of the tax exemption for gold mining.</PARA>
<PARA>He then talked about his firm commitment. We then had comments from various honourable members. The honourable member for Gippsland stated:</PARA>
<PARA>I am amused when people argue that there has to be equity in the tax system and for that reason the gold industry should be paying the same tax.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very Whitlamesque statement worthy of a Jim Cairns or a Rex Connor because it means that everyone is dragged down to the same level. The tax regime for the gold industry should stand as a model, not the anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that it is untaxed. How would we go if all commerce in the economy were untaxed? This is the absolutely unprincipled basis upon which the Liberal Party seeks to argue this case.</PARA>
<PARA> Then we have Sir Arvi Parbo in the course of 1987 saying that, on the question of gold tax, he expected the Federal Opposition to support the industry in its campaign against the introduction of the tax. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I understand Mr Howard will be writing a letter saying so, but I have not seen it yet.</PARA>
<PARA>That was two weeks before the honourable member wrote it. The fact is the honourable member for Bennelong was working red hot in that campaign to knock over every bit of decent tax law this Government ever put up. He was in there trying to up the ante on gold by writing letters like this dealing with his friends in business, including Alan Bond, and going to see him privately. It is only because the spokesman put the honourable member's weights up and referred to it in the Financial Review that we know he went there or know what commitments he sought, or that Senator Chaney or Senator Durack-who has issued 13 of the 15 press statements condemning this; the famous Senator Durack of bottom of the harbour fame, who had vehemently opposed the gold industry, and is it not funny that we have Durack, Chaney, Howard--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a shabby twist to our national politics that the Government which has taken these abuses out of the tax system should be impugned by an Opposition which voted against the measures. The fact is, when we look at the votes on 10 November-and they are recorded in Hansard-we see the names there, J. W. Hewson, J. W. Howard, A. S. Peacock; they are all there. In the Senate, we see listed the then Senator Chaney. They are all there. But according to the honourable member Bennelong last week, the Prime Minister has got some explaining to do; that is, the Government which has cleaned up the Australian tax system is under attack and has some explaining to do, but the rorters who left it all there, who put it there and who left it there, are apparently not to be impugned about their motives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps we might hear from Mr John Winston Howard what he had to say. We have to go over his record to remember how bad he has been, because he has this knack of getting around the place creating a sort of a renaissance for himself as a good guy, but those who were around when it mattered, who saw the passing away of honest John, ask why our national politics has got to stoop to these levels. Perhaps he might tell us what he said to Alan Bond; what commitments Mr Bond sought from the honourable member; and what funds, if any, the honourable member asked for and what he received. Or, better, tell the Western Australian royal commission so at least now we understand that the party which actually knocked this rort off is the party which stands on the high moral ground, and he stands where he has always stood-in the sludge of sectionalism and partisanship.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, it is a fact that the Treasurer and I were in constant communication about this and I have already, in my answer to the first question, made it clear that, as 1987 unfolded, the position required a decision by me, in consultation with the Treasurer, to ensure that in the electoral situation that we were leading up to the position of the Government was quite clear. I had come to that view, in the terms that I have said already, before the 15th. It is the case that on the morning of the 15th it was stated unequivocally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the obvious question, Mr Speaker: as we went into an electoral situation, how could we make a politically meaningful statement about our intentions in regard to not having a gold tax, unless it was for the period for which we were seeking re-election? The question only has to be asked to know what the answer is and, as I have said and as the Treasurer has said-and the Treasurer was at one with me in the decision-the position was quite clearly that, unless we made it for the period for which we were going to be re-elected, it had no meaning at all. I have spelt that out.</PARA>
<PARA> It was exactly the same situation, Mr Speaker, if you like, in regard to the capital gains tax. I had made it clear in the period of our first term in office that we would not have a capital gains tax in our first period of office. We did not. It was important and we had to say that in 1983. We adhered to that commitment that I had given on behalf of the Party in the election campaign. But then, in the next period of office, we introduced a capital gains tax. May I remind the House once again that, in terms of what I have said and what my friend and colleague the Treasurer has said, whenever in this whole period of eight years in government we have attempted to reform the tax system, we have been faced with the absolute opposition of those opposite-on every occasion. With capital gains tax, we had a situation where the Opposition wanted to adhere to a position where billions of dollars more were being paid by ordinary pay as you earn taxpayers-more and more being paid by them because the Opposition was going to make sure that the most privileged people in the community were not going to pay the tax on capital gains that they should. We had to fight the Opposition. It tried to terrorise us electorally.</PARA>
<PARA> But fortunately, because of the commitment that this Party and this Government had to bringing about a fair taxation system, its attempts in that regard were frustrated, the same as they were in regard to the assets test. Again, it tried to terrorise us electorally in regard to the assets test, but we stood up to it. It does not matter where one looks, either at the whole area of equitable taxation or at equitable targeting of social welfare; it has been this Party and this Government which have taken the high ground of principle, and on every occasion the Opposition has sought to terrorise us electorally into not doing it.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, in the situation of 1987-and particularly in the period leading up to the election-I had the responsibility, as Prime Minister, of making the decision. I have noticed that there has been some mistaken view on the part of some writers in the past few days that, in that actual election campaign period, it was not right for me as Prime Minister to make the commitment on behalf of an incoming Labor government and that it required a Cabinet decision. That position that has been put, of course, betrays a total ignorance of the conventions and the practices of what happens in the period of an election campaign. The Cabinet is not operating in that period. It is the responsibility of the Prime Minister to make a decision in accordance with those in authority with whom he seeks to have any discussion and to make a decision which he believes is necessary in terms of the interests of the party and the government.</PARA>
<PARA> I did that with total authority according to the conventions, and in full discussion with the Treasurer, as he has acknowledged. This was a joint decision that we took. So there is the answer to the honourable member's question. Of course, where those opposite founder, as I have said and as the Treasurer has said, is on the rock of their own monumental hypocrisy, and at all points it is they, over the years, who have had the support of the business community, which brought about in this country a position where the right tax decisions had not been imposed and where, as a result of that, the burden was unnecessarily increased upon the ordinary men and women of this country.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite may try to divert attention from that difference between us, but they can go as long as they like, because in every election from 1983 to 1990 the difference has been there, just as it will be in 1993. I remind honourable members opposite that they will be true to their tradition, they will be true to their hypocrisy, because it will be they who will be seeking to impose upon the ordinary wage and salary earner a broad-based consumption tax. They will be giving back capital gains to the rich and the privileged, taking that off, and rebalancing once again, as they have always sought to do, this taxation system so that the burden falls on those with the least ability to pay and does not fall where it ought to, on those with the greatest capacity to pay.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Could the Minister inform the House of the Government's efforts to develop a training culture in Australia? How important is the development of such a culture to Australia's future productivity and development?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2553" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question. It is a fact that, at the time of this Government's election, Australia had a very complacent attitude towards the question of skills in the workplace, believing that it could rely entirely on the abundant natural resources of this country. Hence the idea of the lucky country being Australia, an Australia in which we could just dig up our mineral wealth, grow our agricultural products, and expect that to be the way in which we paid our way in the world. Of course, this Government has an entirely different conception of the way in which Australia will succeed internationally, and has set about emphasising the importance of training in the workplace and expanding participation within the education and training system itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might just say that one of the most recent initiatives the Government has taken is within the context of the training guarantee scheme, where it has introduced legislation to provide an exemption from the reporting requirements of the training guarantee scheme for those employers who might be described as exemplary in the way in which they go about providing training plans for their firms and training opportunities for their work force. I think this is the kind of initiative Australia needs if we are to get the idea of Australia becoming a clever country, one which can rely on the latent ability of our people, not just of our internationally renowned scientists, but also of every worker in the work force who has his or her own responsibilities in relation to the way in which our economy operates.</PARA>
<PARA> This approach is in sharp distinction from that being promoted by the Opposition. The honourable member for Bennelong has the responsibility for the development on the part of the Opposition of a policy in this training area and in skills development generally, and it is interesting to see in the context of his recent antics just how barren he has been in terms of trying to develop policy in an area which is so crucial to Australia's development. He continues to be locked in some time warp where one approaches no manufacturing industry in this country on the basis of expecting workers to leave their intellect and brains at the gate and simply rely, as if they were some kind of automatons, on the instructions of their supervisors in terms of what they should do in the workplace. All the pontification and all the shallow thinking of the honourable member for Bennelong simply reveal an incapacity on his part to develop sensible policies which are appropriate for Australia's contemporary circumstances. Try as one might to find any comprehensive approach from him, one finds that it really has only two strands to it. In the whole area of how Australia should become more productive, it is on the basis that the Australian work force should work longer hours and receive less pay for them. That is, longer hours and less pay is the one and only prescription which the honourable member for Bennelong has for this country.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this is the man who is always caught between the rivalries of his own party. On the one hand, he has to strut the stage trying to appear thoughtful and as if he were some kind of statesman in the Liberal Party of Australia but, on the other hand, because he came from the wrong side of the tracks, he always has to appeal to the rednecks and to the new rightists in his own party. Of course, he is really revealing himself to be totally shallow and barren in terms of how we develop a productive Australia. His is a prescription to take Australia down the road of a Third World economy, not recognising that one of the great advantages Australia has is a high quality education and training system, and actually a highly skilled work force, if only it were given the opportunity to exercise its skills and to continue to keep its skills contemporary and appropriate to Australia's circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> Time and time again we have seen the Opposition always keen to make the sleazy points in politics, never prepared to do the hard yakka in terms of developing policy which might lead to some hope for this country and some future for it. On this side we have spent all our waking hours in the past eight years trying to develop policies and programs which are right for this country--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I say, I would want to see how Mr Connell would describe what happened on 15 June.

I assert that matter. I have asserted it from the beginning and I assert it right through, for the two simple reasons that I have put: firstly, that the position of the Government has been made perfectly clear.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is $70m in 1991-92 and $300m per year thereafter. I remind the House that a large proportion of the gold industry is foreign owned. Former Senator Chaney, in his long-winded speech in the Senate, tried to concoct a case in favour of the maintenance of the exemption, quoting Sir Arvi Parbo, and references to dividend imputation have no bearing whatsoever. If there is no corporation tax paid, the only tax on the income is the withholding tax and most of the industry is foreign owned. So that is $300m per year, which otherwise would not have come to the people of this country, from a legitimate taxation of a commercial area of enterprise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, this is just one of a number of measures that the Government has taken to make the tax system decent and fair again. There have been various protestations. Senator Chaney said:</PARA>
<PARA>The growth and vigour of the gold mining industry should be a lesson for the Hawke Government. It demonstrates that new investment, new jobs and new export income can be achieved when tax does not deter business incentives.</PARA>
<PARA>That is zero tax. We would go well as a nation if we said that all commercial activity ought to be zero taxed because it will produce more. But what about the ongoing costs of the business of the Commonwealth of Australia? What happens there? In the various documentation we have seen many references by Senator Durack. On 15 June 1985 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government should abandon the White Paper proposal to tax gold.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition consistently refused it. On 20 September 1985 he was at it again. He was at it again on 25 September 1985, on 21 November 1985, on 13 December 1985 and on 19 December 1985. On 26 January 1986 he said that the Opposition would vote against any gold tax. Again, it was said on 12 May 1986. On 6 June 1986 Senator Durack said:</PARA>
<PARA>A Liberal-National Party Government will repeal any gold tax imposed by the Hawke Government.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on and on. Of the 15 public statements from the Opposition, 13 have come from Senator Durack. I mentioned in passing in my previous answer the references which the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bowen, made to the joint management review of the Crown Solicitor's Division which was referred to by the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser. The review was commenced about three years ago-at that time-and the report was handed to the then Attorney-General, Senator Durack, in July 1980. This debate was had in September 1982, and Mr Bowen said:</PARA>
<PARA>This was known to the Attorney-General over two years ago.</PARA>
<PARA>The joint management review of this report-which has not been tabled in the Parliament-under the heading `Taxation Appeals' stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Tax avoidance schemes have proliferated. Central office has been unable to make any great contribution to these cases. The officers conducting these cases are relatively inexperienced in taxation law. It was recommended that the central office should develop tax expertise. The report was given to the Attorney-General over two years ago.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the famous two-year lapse of Senator Durack, who watched all of the bottom of the harbour schemes go on against the plaintive pleas of the Commissioner of Taxation-appeals not only to the then Treasurer, but to him. This is the same Senator Durack who was scurrying around the portals of corporate Perth trying to curry favour for the maintenance of the exemption of taxation on gold income. The party which has taxed this income is subject to these attacks by the Opposition while the Opposition votes against the removal of the exemption, so that all of this foreign ownership can go untaxed and so that, essentially, the wealth of the public of Australia is diminished by the ongoing loss of $300m a year. Yet we are asked to believe that, in all of this close proximity which Senator Durack and Western Australian Liberal and National Party members of parliament had to the then gold industry and the discussions which the honourable member for Bennelong had with Mr Bond, when the honourable member for Bennelong in his letter says, `No, I will not have a bar of it for the three years of a Liberal government', that is a policy matter which is not connected to any commitments sought by the gold mining industry, any commitments given on behalf of the Liberal Party, and any commitments that may have been given in response to funds.</PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters-I say this advisedly-should call Senator Durack, the honourable member for Bennelong, our former senatorial friend, now the honourable member for Pearce, and representatives of the Liberal Party secretariat and ask them: why did the Liberal Party make its commitment on the non-taxation of gold? Which goldmining companies or other interested parties did the honourable member for Bennelong speak to? What commitments were sought by these interests and what funds did these interests provide, either directly or indirectly, to the Liberal Party campaign to secure the Liberal Party's early and definitive opposition to the taxation of goldmining income? If we can get a few of those questions answered, maybe we will not have this dishonest humbug which is being proffered by the front bench of the Opposition. Maybe we could hear what did happen when the honourable member for Bennelong went to see Mr Bond, why he wrote this letter in the middle of the election campaign and why Sir Arvi Parbo was able to know two weeks before that he was going to write the letter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that a lot of members in this House are very interested in the state of the Gulf. When I answered a question in this House on another occasion I said that when I received further information I would report that to the House. Members of the House will be aware that the Australian Government has sent two marine biologists and two oil spill experts and supplied and transported oil spill equipment to Saudi Arabia. I have received recent information on the environmental aspects of the spill from one of the experts who was sent from Australia. I am informed that the oil spills commenced on 19 January this year and at least seven sources are known, including tankers, terminals and refineries. The total spill has not been fully determined but it is likely to be in the order of six million barrels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The spills have resulted in two types of slicks-very thin slicks located in the centre of the Gulf, and very thick slicks which have impacted on the coast of Saudi Arabia. By far the majority of the spilt oil has moved south along the Saudi coast, eventually impacting all the shoreline to a coastline distance of 460 kilometres from the source.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reality of it is that one cannot read this sort of thing in the newspaper; this comes from advisers that this Government has taken the trouble to send to the area; and they are making a very important contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason I am giving this answer is so that I can provide more detailed information to the House. Along the sandy beaches the oil occurs in a band of between 10 and 100 metres wide. Surface coverage within the band is about 100 per cent. On the beach slope the oil has been worked into the sediment to a depth of two to 30 centimetres. At the base of the beach slope, the oil has often been pooled to depths of several centimetres. The intertidal zone in this area has been very heavily affected. Within the impacted area, most of the salt marsh and all of the mangroves have been oiled. It is likely then that all the mangroves and virtually all the salt marshes will die. The oil does not appear to have settled in subtidal areas and there have been no apparent short term lethal impacts on the seagrass beds or the reefs. The intertidal shores of some offshore coral islands have been heavily impacted, but the reefs appear to be unaffected.</PARA>
<PARA> The slick has killed an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 seabirds; marine mammals do not appear to be significantly affected. Small numbers of turtles and some sea snakes seem to have died from being smothered by the oil. Fish mortalities have been fairly localised to shrimps, crabs and molluscs that have died in very large numbers. The destruction of the intertidal habitats is expected to have a very major impact on populations of birds which migrate through the Gulf area.</PARA>
<PARA> This needs to be put in some perspective. The Exxon Valdez spill was 224,000 barrels of oil. So far, over 600,000 barrels of oil have been recovered from the Gulf war spills. This quantity is insignificant compared with what is still in the environment. Due to the magnitude of the spill, the types of habitats impacted and the extreme inaccessibility of some areas, it is unrealistic to expect that much of the coast will be cleaned. I am informed that the Saudi authorities are now identifying the most important sites which, upon recovery, may act as sources for recolonisation of some other sites. Clean-up of selected habitats is also about to begin. Oil is to be flushed from some mangrove areas and some salt marshes.</PARA>
<PARA> A final concern worthy of note is the oil fires in Kuwait. A huge volume of oil is not burning and is forming into huge lakes. It is feared that these may eventually flood into the Gulf, potentially creating a spill of even greater magnitude. I think it is important that we pay tribute to those Australians who are working there and to the others who are part of the international clean-up effort.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, despite his selective answers in the House today, so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Prime Minister from giving forthwith to this House a full account of the processes involved in the Government's decision in the 1987 election campaign not to impose a gold tax during the term of the next government, including what undertakings were given by the Prime Minister to Mr Connell and others. </PARA>
<PARA>We have had several attempts by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in this Parliament to provide selective details of what actually transpired in the lead-up to the 1987 election. On each occasion he has tended, as he did again today, to raise more questions than he answers in respect of what actually transpired in the settling of the final commitment, a three-year commitment not to introduce a gold tax. Of course, the allegations continue to be made in the Western Australia corruption royal commission and each of those is going to continue to call for the Prime Minister to give a complete answer. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Prime Minister has almost done a full circle in his argument. He started out by arguing that the Cabinet decision always related to three years. Indeed, he made a mockery of suggestions that it could have related to any period less than three years. Yet he simultaneously went on to argue that Labor members were intent on being the genuinely reforming government which was going to clean up totally the tax system. That does not imply to me that, at the time the decision was taken in December 1986, he had any intention of its being a three-year commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at those two arguments and go back over the history of this issue and some of the evidence that the Prime Minister cited today in defence of his position, we see the extent to which he has selectively represented the position. Let us begin with the first issue: what the December 1986 Cabinet decision actually meant when it was brought down. The most telling feature of that decision is that in the press release there is no reference at all to three years; it simply states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer, Mr Paul Keating, and the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Gareth Evans, announced today that the Government had decided not to remove the income tax exemption available to the gold mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA>This decision was taken at a time when it was publicly known that Senator Gareth Evans, Senator Walsh and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) did not want to take that decision. After all, there had been an outside inquiry-the Gutman inquiry-that had recommended the abolition of the exemption on the goldmining industry. They had been led to believe that there were substantial revenue benefits from an early decision about this. So it is not surprising, against the background of the known views of those three gentlemen, that there was no explicit commitment about three years in that initial decision. </PARA>
<PARA> As we then go through some of the events that the Prime Minister drew attention to today we again find no evidence of a three-year commitment. For example, at the launch of the Australian nugget bullion coin on 23 April in Sydney, to which the Prime Minister referred, he simply referred to that December 1986 decision. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>My Government recently decided not to remove the tax exempt status of the gold mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA>There was nothing about a forward looking three-year commitment in relation to that exemption. Similarly, at the Australian Mining Industry Council annual dinner speech, to which he referred, there was no explicit recognition of a three year commitment; again the Prime Minister simply referred to the December 1986 decision. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>Let me add that after a review of the taxation arrangements for the gold mining industry, we decided not to remove its current income tax exemption so as to encourage exploration and development and to maximise production and export income. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, there is no explicit commitment to three years. As we proceed through the other occasions on which Government Ministers and the Prime Minister made statements about this matter we see that the three-year commitment never emerged until 7 July 1987-some three weeks after this now infamous lunch that took place in Premier Burke's offices in Western Australia. That was the first time when that three-year commitment emerged. Indeed, there is a fair bit of evidence to suggest that the view was to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA> In early June, when the Treasurer was making statements about the first post-election Budget, he said that there would be no new taxes in that Budget, including no gold tax. This was not a three-year commitment but a one-year commitment in the first post-election Budget. The Treasurer was still playing the game on behalf of Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Walsh to contain that decision. They still fully intended to implement that decision at the earliest opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess the Prime Minister has hung most of his case on what transpired in an interview on an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program in Perth on the morning of that infamous lunch. The interviewer asked the following question:</PARA>
<PARA>If you are re-elected and this is an issue that of course comes up in Western Australia, because, there have been ads in the paper, there has been concern expressed locally, if you are re-elected will there be a gold tax?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke answered:</PARA>
<PARA>No. </PARA>
<PARA>The interviewer asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Categoric assurance, no gold tax?</PARA>
<PARA>It is crucial how we read that. The Prime Minister's statement today was that that was an observation. What if it were a rhetorical question? The interviewer asks, `Categoric assurance, no gold tax?'. The Prime Minister does not say, `No, categorically there won't be a gold tax', he repeats the same sort of argument that was used on earlier occasions by himself and the Treasurer in explaining the December 1986 decision. He did not give a categorical no when he was asked that question by the interviewer at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> People do not need to take our view as the basis for that judgment. The Australian Mining Industry Council certainly did not believe that there was a firm three-year commitment because it was imposing considerable pressure on the Government and others to explain their position, irrespective of the fact that the Prime Minister had made that statement on the morning of 15 June. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want further evidence that there was no decision at that time to make a three-year commitment in relation to the gold tax we can look at two speeches subsequent to the 15 June lunch made by the Treasurer and the former Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Gareth Evans. I think the Treasurer spoke in Perth on 19 June. He simply referred back to the statement made a few days earlier by the Prime Minister. But, again, there was no specific reference to a three-year commitment in relation to that gold tax decision. Senator Gareth Evans actually referred all the way back to December 1987 when, on 18 June in Kalgoorlie, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's decision not to remove the income tax exemption available to the gold mining industry, announced on 16 December 1986, has obviously also been an important contributor to the climate of confidence which the industry now enjoys. </PARA>
<PARA>All the way through, whether it was before or after the lunch, there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that the Government had a three-year commitment in mind. Indeed, the evidence given by Laurie Connell under oath in the corruption inquiry begs the question that he was given a commitment, whether the Prime Minister at that lunch on 15 June gave the commitment that was sought by Mr Connell and others at that time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is yet to explain whether that commitment was made at that lunch. Today I asked the Prime Minister whether he had a prior meeting in the anteroom to the luncheon room with Mr Burke and Mr Connell. He failed to answer a very specific question of fact as to whether he attended that meeting, so the onus of proof is still with him, despite a couple of attempts on his part to explain the situation away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put it to the House that up until 7 May there was no specific intention declared publicly by the Government to restrict the application of its decision to the gold mining industry for a period of three years. That letter emerged, surprisingly, on 7 May, just a few days before the election campaign ended on 11 July, but three weeks after the decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said 7 July, some three weeks after this now notorious lunch at which the matter was clearly discussed, as revealed by the evidence of Laurie Connell under oath. There is a very clear-cut case for the Prime Minister to answer. He needs to give us full details of the meeting prior to the lunch with Laurie Connell and Brian Burke. He needs to give us full details of the meeting prior to the lunch, and whether in fact gold and the gold industry concession were discussed at that lunch. He is yet to answer Mr Connell's specific allegations that a commitment was given to him at that lunch in relation to the application of the gold tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the argument that the Prime Minister put today, which more likely confirms the view that the Government never had an intention to restrict the application of that decision to three years, was the time he and the Treasurer spent today putting the case for tax reform and the role that they have played in relation to tax reform. </PARA>
<PARA> I was left in no doubt, as I listened to the Treasurer speak today, that he had always intended to remove that gold tax exemption as a matter of urgency. If honourable members go back and read the text of his answers today, they will draw the same conclusion: he cannot have it both ways. If he has always wanted to introduce that decision and to remove the gold tax exemption, that is entirely consistent with the view that the Treasurer maintained all the way through to the July 1987 election when he did not refer at any time to the decision relating to three years. Only when the Prime Minister's letter was released on 7 July did anybody know that that sort of commitment had been made. </PARA>
<PARA> That raises a second question for the Prime Minister. The other day, when the Treasurer was asked what his recollections of that decision were and whether he had been consulted and so on, he said in this House that whether or not he was aware of the decision was insignificant. Insignificant! He only runs, after all, tax policy in this country. He said it was insignificant, but Senator Walsh left no doubt about it on Friday when he went public and said it was a complete surprise and, I think to quote him accurately, he said both he and the Treasurer were `bloody angry' that that decision had been taken by the Prime Minister. Obviously they had a suspicion as to who had got at Hawke in order to lead him to make that statement on the eve of the election campaign. So we need to have a complete explanation of the precise decision making processes that were entered into in order to arrive at that decision on 7 July. In particular, we need to know what transpired between the lunch on 15 June and that decision on 7 May, particularly when two of the senior relevant Ministers--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Hawke" NAMEID="YD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr Hawke</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;July 7; sorry. There was a gap between 15 June and 7 July, a gap in which the two relevant senior Ministers-Senator Evans and the Treasurer-made speeches not alluding to a three-year commitment. So how was it that the Prime Minister in the end came to the decision that there would be a three-year commitment? When did he consult Senator Walsh? When did he consult the Treasurer? Precisely what other Cabinet processes were adhered to, if any, in order to make that decision? Or was it simply, as the allegations would lead one to believe, the outcome of a deal he had done at the lunch of 15 June or in the meeting prior to the lunch on 15 June, and he had just hung on and finally released the letter publicly, and it came as a complete surprise to his colleagues that that commitment had been made?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As long as those questions remain unanswered, as long as there is not a complete statement of the processes from December 1986 right through to 7 July and that final decision and, in particular, the decision making processes that took place after the lunch on 15 June, the suggestion that donations were given at that lunch in return for political commitments in relation to that gold tax exemption will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Many Australians believe that those are very reasonable questions, given the record of this Government in deal-doing and its attempt to hang on to power by doing deals rather than governing in the best interests of the people of Australia. It has a sustained history-it is now nearly nine years-of doing deals in the best interests of some sectional or vested interest group and not doing deals in the best interests of the people of Australia. A lot of Australians would take some convincing that yet another of those deals was not done in the course of that 15 June lunch about which the Prime Minister's memory has been so mysteriously impeded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not matter what I can remember. I am not on the block. The Prime Minister is on the block and he is the one who has to answer the questions. We are giving him every opportunity to answer the questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, the fact remains that the Prime Minister has to provide a complete explanation of exactly what transpired over the period from December 1986 to 7 July at which time he made that announcement, and he needs to tie up the various elements of his explanation to give a consistent story over that period, not the very selective quoting of events either in the House the other evening when he came in to admit that he had misled the House or again in Question Time today when he read selectively from those events of that period to try to make his case look as defensible as he could. </PARA>
<PARA> Even in the Parliament last week, for example-just to take one specific example of how he turned around his position-on 10 April he went out of his way to say that he had not decided until 7 July that that decision was to be taken. Then, of course, when confronted with the fact that there were statements on the record about the gold tax that went back to December 1986 and, in particular, when confronted with the fact that the allegation would stand unless he could find some evidence of a three-year commitment prior to that lunch, he came back into the House and manufactured a second explanation, at which time he tried to pin the whole lot on that Australian Broadcasting Corporation morning interview. He had every opportunity in that interview to state quite clearly that it was a three-year commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> If he had been keen to put the matter beyond doubt at that time-the questioner in fact gave him the opportunity-he had every opportunity to do so. She asked him what was an important question to Western Australians-that is, whether there would be a gold tax when he was re-elected. He simply said no; he did not go on to give the categorical assurance that was sought. The Prime Minister cannot hang his case on her term `re-elected', particularly in the circumstances where the Treasurer back on 9 June had made it quite clear that if he were re-elected, he would not have it in the first Budget but there was no commitment beyond the first Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> So there is a glaring inconsistency in the interpretation of what it meant to be re-elected in terms of that decision, and it is a quite reasonable explanation of what happened on 15 June that the Prime Minister knew that on 9 June the Treasurer had made that statement and the Prime Minister was simply reiterating that statement rather than going on and taking the opportunity to state clearly that it was a three-year commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the same question applies all the time after December 1986: if it was a three-year commitment, why did the original Cabinet decision not say it was; why did his statement launching the gold nugget coin not say it was; why did his statement to the Australian Mining Industry Council dinner not say it was a three-year commitment; why did he not make it clear in that radio interview; why did he not make it clear again when he came back to Perth on 19 or 20 June that it was a three-year commitment? Why did it take all the way up to 7 May-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me get straight into this pathetic address by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and deal immediately with the points that he has made.

It was reported that the Opposition Leader in Western Australia, Mr MacKinnon, had warned that the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, `could not be trusted not to impose a gold tax'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is what he was saying at that time-on 13 June.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know the dates. It is the Leader of the Opposition who has the problem. He cannot even get his months straight. This is the report of 19 June 1987, and this is what the Treasurer said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There have, of course, been many other success stories in Western Australia -Argyle Diamonds and of course gold mining to name two. </PARA>
<PARA>This is what the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>In this respect, I know a lot of you would welcome the Prime Minister's statement in Perth the other day when he unequivocally ruled out any gold tax.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet here we have the Leader of the Opposition getting up and attempting to say that on 19 June the Treasurer was not supporting what I had said in respect of the term of the next Labor Government. One could not have a more unequivocal statement by the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier today, there is no doubt what the interpretation was, and the proper interpretation, by the media. I refer to the Australian Financial Review of the next day, 16 June. I repeat the heading:</PARA>
<PARA>No gold or consumption tax: Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA>It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, gave an unequivocal guarantee yesterday that his Government would not introduce either a gold tax or a broadly-based consumption tax if elected for a third term. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the correct interpretation:</PARA>
<PARA> He pledged that there would be no gold tax under a Hawke Government. But this was not good enough for the Australian Goldmining Industry Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course it was not. That was the initiation of the sequence of events which led on 7 July to the statement that we gave. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition also sought to draw comfort from Senator Walsh. In fact, if he is going to rely on Senator Walsh, I wish he would rely entirely on Senator Walsh. I refer the Leader of the Opposition to what is attributed to Senator Walsh in the Canberra Times of 13 April. He said this:</PARA>
<PARA>But when Mr Hawke finally remembered the facts and gave them to the House, he completely--</PARA>
<PARA>This is Senator Walsh. The Leader of the Opposition is invoking Senate Walsh against me on this matter. Here is Senator Walsh's statement:</PARA>
<PARA>But when Mr Hawke finally remembered the facts and gave them to the House, he completely cleared himself of any suggestion that some sort of a deal was done on the question of gold-tax policy at that lunch unless you believe in the theory of retrospective causation. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Leader of the Opposition wishes to invoke Senator Walsh, okay invoke Senator Walsh. There is Senator Walsh's specific repudiation of what he is alleging. </PARA>
<PARA> I will come to the question of Cabinet processes in a moment, but before I do that let me again give a comprehensive response on this matter. I go to this snide observation by the Leader of the Opposition that this Government has been about deal-doing generally in its time in office. Those opposite keep referring to the deals that we do with the trade union movement in the accord. I have had cause to say before on a number of occasions in this House that not only are we not ashamed of the dealing that we do with the trade union movement under the accord, but we assert with great pride that, as a result of the fact that we have the capacity to negotiate with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, we have brought about enormous benefits for the people of this country. This is not something that has been done surreptitiously; it is something that we have trumpeted, and properly trumpeted, from the roof tops. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that we have been able to shift the share of national income from wages to profit, the fact that we have been able to get a 1.4 million increase in jobs, the fact that we have a 10 per cent reduction in real non-farm unit labour costs-all of these have come out of what the Opposition is pleased to call dealing with the trade union movement, but they in fact represent the massive change from the contempt with which the Opposition held the organised working men and women of this country. Where the Opposition wanted confrontation, yes, we did want to deal with them, and we have done so in a way which has brought enduring benefits to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time which remains I will again put in total context the issues that have been raised so inadequately by the Leader of the Opposition. I want in particular to provide the full context in which the Government made its decision not to remove the tax exemption from the goldmining industry. This detailed sequence will prove two points of fundamental importance: first, the decision to retain the exemption on gold was not made as a result of or to attract any political donation from Mr Connell or anyone else, as I have said. There is no evidence whatsoever to support any contention that it was so made. Any claim that Mr Connell influenced the decision with a political donation made at the luncheon I attended is wrong for the manifestly persuasive reason that the decision had been made and announced before that luncheon was held. As I have consistently stated, there was no private commitment by me or by the Government to Mr Connell or to anyone else on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The second fundamental fact to emerge from the detailed sequence of events is that it presents neither side of politics in a particularly flattering light. The truth is that both the Government and the Opposition decided, despite rational economic arguments to the contrary, to maintain the gold tax exemption. The Opposition today voicing its criticisms is the same Opposition that in 1986-87 was not only in the same policy boat as the Government but also had led the way there in a headlong rush. It was the then Opposition, led by its leading Western Australians, as my friend the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has pointed out-Senator Durack and Senator Chaney-who conducted a relentless campaign against the gold tax. It was the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who first succumbed to the pressure from the goldmining industry to provide a written guarantee that he would not introduce such a tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that significant gold interests were making financial contributions to the coalition. By his own testimony, Mr Connell had been an undisclosed donor to the Liberal Party of Australia. My point is to highlight the enormous capacity of a well-funded single issue group such as the goldmining industry to exert political pressure on politicians and parties. It gives me no great joy to reflect on the way in which the goldmining industry ruthlessly conducted a campaign of self-interest and on the way in which the Opposition, exploiting that campaign, adopted a no-tax policy purely in order to create for the Government a political problem that impelled us to match that policy. It is my fervent belief that the publicity now being given to these events strongly underlines the need for full public disclosure of public donations in the future and for an end to the crazy spiral of television advertising costs. This Parliament will shortly have the opportunity to consider those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1985 the draft White Paper on tax reform proposed that the income tax exemption on the goldmining industry be removed. On 19 September, the Treasurer announced the establishment of the independent inquiry to examine the issue and to be conducted by Mr Gutman. That independent inquiry, the Inquiry into the Taxation of Gold Mining, reported to the Government on 29 August 1986, recommending that the exemption be removed. On 16 December 1986 Cabinet decided not to accept this recommendation and the decision was announced by the Treasurer and the then Minister for Resources, Senator Gareth Evans, later that day. As I have said, on 23 April 1987, in a speech in Sydney at the launch of the Australian nugget bullion coin, I referred to the Government's decision not to remove the tax exempt status of the goldmining industry. It is a theme to which I returned a fortnight later on 7 May at the annual dinner of the Australian Mining Industry Council (AMIC). As I have said, there was no ambiguity about my words, which were:</PARA>
<PARA>Let me add that after a review of the taxation arrangements for the gold mining industry we decided not to remove its current income tax exemption. </PARA>
<PARA>Less than three weeks later, on 27 May, I announced that a general election would be held on 11 July 1987. The Treasurer, Mr Keating, also made it plain on 30 May that the Government was not considering a gold tax. He was reported in the Canberra Times as saying that a gold tax had been considered, that the decision had been made and that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it's off the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>That was reiterated on 4 June in the media statement to which I earlier referred in my answers in this place, but in this context it should be put down again. He said that the Government had rejected outright the Gutman recommendation. The statement from his office continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Having made that decision, the Government has before it no proposals to change the tax treatment of the gold mining industry, nor does it have any intention of considering any proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>That was from the Treasurer's office on 4 June. As I said earlier, from that chronology it should be quite plain that-with an election at most only months away, I remind honourable members-the Government's policy against the introduction of a gold tax was firmly established and was widely publicised. The viewpoint of the Opposition was clear: right from the start the coalition was adamant that there would be no gold tax. Senator Durack, then the coalition spokesman, issued a press release on 15 June 1985, in which he called on the Government:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to abandon the White Paper proposal to tax gold. </PARA>
<PARA>Between then and the 1987 election, Senator Durack issued no less than 12 press releases arguing various aspects of the anti-gold tax case. Senator Chaney, his colleague from Western Australia, also chimed in. On 10 October 1986 the Treasurer said that the Government would be lunatic to consider changing the tax exemption of gold, and he pledged in that statement the repeal of any Labor decision to impose a tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In political terms it was very much in the Opposition's interests to run this campaign. In so doing, the coalition parties were joined by the Western Australian State Government and other State governments. There was also a strident, energetic and tireless campaign by the goldmining industry itself. While the Government was considering the Gutman inquiry, for example, Mr Duncan Bell, the Executive Director of the Australian Mining Industry Council, made public an estimate of a $500m loss of investment throughout Australia and a further $100m reduction in exploration expenditure if a gold tax were introduced. In other words, it is quite clear that the issue of a gold tax was a highly political issue. Notwithstanding Cabinet's no-tax decision of December 1986 and the subsequent statement by me and other Government spokesmen, the crescendo of the anti-tax campaign continued to increase. For example, on 8 June 1987, four days after the release from the Treasurer's office, the Australian goldmining industry called for a written commitment from political parties not to introduce the gold tax during the next Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Thursday I apologised-as I should have-to the House for the inaccuracy of my initial recollections as to the sequence of events surrounding this decision; but since that matter first came to my attention last week I have thoroughly examined the circumstances in the public record. It is clear that by the first part of 1987-certainly by May 1987-I had formulated in my mind the decision, if re-elected, not to impose a gold tax for the entirety of my next term of office. The reasons for this can be easily deduced. As the pressures normally associated with a pre-election period began to build, the decision had to be made on whether to let the Government's electoral position be eroded by the campaign of the Opposition and the goldmining industry or whether, by applying the December Cabinet decision to Labor's next term, we could neutralise that vociferous campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, in those circumstances it was inevitable that the no-tax decision of the Cabinet in December would not only stand but would have to apply to Labor's next term in office. As I said before-and it only has to be said to be abundantly clear-in political terms it was meaningless unless it applied to the three years of our re-elected government period. As 1987 wore on, it became increasingly relevant to relate that decision to post-election matters, as the Treasurer did on 30 May in reference to our intentions if re-elected for Labor's 1987 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred to my address in May 1987 to the Mining Industry Council. In that speech, as I have said, I referred to the December Cabinet decision. On the eve of an election campaign, the reference only made sense as applied to the next term of a re-elected Labor government. What sense would it make if I were to say, `We won't do it in the first month, but you had better watch out in the second month or the third month because then we will do it'. (Extension of time granted)</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, in that pre-election situation, the reference to not imposing the tax only made sense. It was politically irrelevant if it was not made for the period of the next Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the question was put to me explicitly when I was interviewed on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio in Perth on the morning of 15 June. The answer I gave then was an unequivocal statement that a re-elected Labor government would not introduce a gold tax. The answer was obviously intended to apply to the whole of Labor's term. As I have already said-I pointed this out in referring to the Australian Financial Review of 16 June-there is no doubt what the interpretation was. I will repeat it. Under the headline `No gold or consumption tax: Hawke', the article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, gave an unequivocal guarantee yesterday . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> He pledged that there would be no gold tax under a Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA>There you have it. I made it clear. The media understood exactly what was involved because they knew. I knew that one could not make such a statement with any political content or meaning unless it applied to the three years. It is against this background that the luncheon of 15 June 1987 must be seen. As I said, by the time the luncheon was held the decision not to introduce a gold tax had already been made and had already been announced. </PARA>
<PARA> The burden of my comments at the lunch dealt with the general record and achievements of my Government and, as I put it, the hopeless inadequacy of the alternative. As I told the Parliament last week, and as I have said again today, Mr Burke told me that he intended at the luncheon to seek financial support for the Federal ALP. But, as I have said, to the best of my recollection, there was no discussion of political donations while I was present-and, indeed, so the evidence confirms. </PARA>
<PARA> I have made the point that there is every possibility that the gold tax issue was discussed at the luncheon. It would have been surprising, given its prominence as an issue, had it not been discussed. As I have said, I cannot be dogmatic about every detail of that luncheon. I just make the point in regard to things going back some time that it is rather interesting to note that it was Malcolm Fraser who said in this House on 22 September 1981:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that any honourable member of this House would want to be condemned . . . wholly and solely on the basis of one person's recollections of a conversation five years ago, especially when those recollections are unconfirmed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not in that regard, I did not. The honourable member knows very well what that was about. I repeat, because it is appropriate that I should, and reassert fundamentally this important point: I gave no private commitment on this matter and I could not have given any such private commitment. I would not have said anything beyond what I had already said publicly. In his testimony to the Royal Commission, Mr Connell said at one point:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I would have felt that a contribution-</PARA>
<PARA>that is a donation to the ALP-</PARA>
<PARA>should have been made regardless of the gold tax issue. </PARA>
<PARA>At another point he said that his contribution was:</PARA>
<PARA>certainly influencing the decision that a gold tax wouldn't be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> But, whatever he believed to be the case, the public record makes clear that no private commitment was made to him. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it this way: Mr Connell may have spent $250,000 in the belief that he would hear new policy commitments from the Government. But it cost listeners to the ABC radio that morning only their 8c a day to hear me articulate my Government's policy on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the question of the written guarantee provided to the goldmining industry-first by the Opposition on 20 June and then by the Government on 7 July-outlining both parties' commitment not to introduce a gold tax in their next term of office. I note that the Opposition's letter followed by four days a report in the Australian Financial Review of a meeting between the then Leader of the Opposition and Mr Alan Bond. Whatever the upshot of that meeting, my office was in no doubt that, in the absence of a similar written commitment from the Government, a campaign would be waged against us in the last days of the election. We were left with little choice but to match the Opposition's written commitment. The Government had resisted putting the undertaking in writing for the very obvious reason, as I have said, that it would have encouraged every pressure group to seek similar written guarantees in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to write the letter was taken by me, in consultation with the Treasurer, on 7 July 1987, the day the written commitment was made. In my letter addressed to Mr Duncan Bell I said that there appeared `to be an element of uncertainty' among members of his Council concerning the tax exemption `despite my public statements on the matter'. That is what I wrote to him. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Saturday several newspapers suggested that that decision was made without regard to proper process. Let me make it clear that there was no question of Cabinet or senior Ministers as such being involved in the 7 July decision. The caretaker convention in this country is that no major decisions are taken by a Federal government between the dissolution of Parliament and the time the election result becomes clear. Of course, exceptions clearly apply in the case of a national disaster. But, during an election campaign, a Prime Minister normally speaks on behalf of his party as he is not in a position to commit the incoming government. </PARA>
<PARA> Hence my letter of 7 July gave an undertaking not to introduce a gold tax `during the next three year term of the Labor Government'; likewise, the Opposition Leader's letter of 26 June 1987 specifically related to `the next Liberal government'-such undertakings, under the Constitution, relating to three-year terms. Such undertakings are party commitments. During election campaigns they can be made by the leader alone or in consultation with whoever he considers appropriate. Cabinet as an organ of government simply does not enter the equation during an election campaign period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision on 16 May 1988 to introduce a gold tax from 1 January 1991 was taken in full knowledge that, had we left the issue until after the following election, we would have faced a rerun of 1987. As it was, this Government once again demonstrated its capacity to bite the bullet and to introduce a gold tax-something which no Australian government from 1924 had had the courage to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I have sought to outline in close detail today all the matters relevant to this issue. The information I have provided fully answers the allegations made in Perth and in this House regarding the Government's decision on the gold tax. Only this remains to be said: much of what has been insinuated by the Opposition has sought to question my personal integrity and reputation and to impugn my conduct as the Prime Minister of this nation. If the Opposition wishes to go further down that path and to suggest seriously that I corrupted myself to acquire party political donations, the onus is on it now to say so clearly. But it will not do so because it cannot. That is because nothing has emerged to erode or diminish the fundamental point that I have made throughout: the Government's policies are not for sale. No-one has bought Government policy through providing donations to the ALP. As I have stated to this House consistently throughout recent days, the fact is that no-one buys favours from this Government. The critically important standard that I have asserted for myself and for my Government-that our policies cannot be secured by the provision of financial support-remains inviolate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We all know that we have a populist and scheming Prime Minister. The question is: how populist and how scheming? I support and second this motion. It is the Opposition's contention today that we have not had a clear and precise explanation from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) as to his involvement in the change in the Australian Labor Party's gold tax policy in the 1987 election. Today in Question Time we had a mere four questions able to be put to the Government from the Opposition and, I must say, a failure on the Prime Minister's part to answer many of the propositions put to him. I simply say that there is a cloud hanging over this Prime Minister and he has a duty to come into this Parliament and to answer all of the questions, all of the issues, which have been raised by the Opposition about his conduct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even last weekend the Prime Minister acknowledged that he was prepared to answer questions on this issue in front of the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters. Why is he not prepared to come in and answer the questions that the Opposition has put to him? The Prime Minister's principal argument, as it appears to have been put to us today, is that his Government's policy on the gold tax was consistent the whole way through. He started back in December 1986 with a press release by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the then Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Gareth Evans. It is instructive to go back to December 1986 to see the Government's policy position at that time. I say that because it is of the essence of our proposition that basically this position did not change until 7 July, which then itself raises the question as to why the change was made in the first place. But back on 16 December 1986 we had this short two-paragraph press statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer, Mr Paul Keating, and the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Gareth Evans, announced today that the Government had decided not to remove the income tax exemption available to the gold mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA> After considering the report of the ``Inquiry into the Taxation of Gold Mining'' conducted by Mr G O Gutman, and other relevant submissions, the Government had concluded that the importance of encouraging active exploration and development, and of maximising production and the consequent export income generated by the gold mining industry, outweighed the arguments in favour of removing the industry's long-standing tax exemption. </PARA>
<PARA>I read it all so that no-one can be in any doubt about a simple fact. Nowhere in that two-paragraph statement is there a commitment for the full three-year term of any preceding Labor government. To advance his argument the Prime Minister relies upon, firstly, his own statement in April 1987 at the launch of the Australian nugget bullion coin in Sydney. Very simply, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>My Government recently decided not to remove the tax exempt status of the gold mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the statement. Where was the claim that that would run for a three-year period under an incoming government? Secondly, he relies upon a statement he gave on 7 May to the Australian Mining Industry Council. Again, it is instructive to see what the Prime Minister actually said-not for the content of it, but for its omission on the critical point as to Labor's intentions to introduce a gold tax. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Let me add that after a review of the taxation arrangements for the gold mining industry, we decided not to remove its current income tax exemption so as to encourage exploration and development and to maximise production and export income. </PARA>
<PARA>In a radio interview in June, the critical radio interview that the Prime Minister rests his case upon, he was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . if you are re-elected will there be a gold tax?</PARA>
<PARA>His answer was no. The interviewer said:</PARA>
<PARA>Categoric assurance, no gold tax?</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister then proceeded to debate the point. Very simply, there was no clear unequivocal statement from the Prime Minister as to the Government's longer term intentions. Finally, he relies on a speech from the Treasurer on 19 June and attempts to ascribe to that speech exactly the same interpretation, that is, that there was a consistent position not to introduce a gold tax for a period of three years. If we read the speech we see there was no mention again of any three-year blanket intention not to introduce a gold tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, the Prime Minister says that his policy was a status quo policy; in other words, that it was always open to an interpretation which he now seeks to place upon it, which is that Labor would not, during a three-year term, introduce a gold tax. I find that argument very unconvincing. In my remarks today I simply want to state why I believe those remarks are unconvincing. Essentially, my argument comes down to seven fairly simple points. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has the Prime Minister changed policy? Was it for the political pressure which he claims or was it for other reasons for which he has a responsibility to now dispel doubts which are raised by his conduct? First of all, I thought it was very revealing that the Government's organised defence for Question Time today was that it had fewer hands on the gold tax issue and the only reason it did not change its policy was that it was being terrorised by the Opposition. That reveals that the Government has always wanted to introduce a gold tax. It was publicly touted that this Government had taken a political decision before the election because it was worried about the votes, and that it would introduce such a tax after the election. The Treasurer's remarks today absolutely confirm that. Of course, as we all know now, eventually Labor did introduce a gold tax. This is further confirmation of its true position. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we have the evidence of the then Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh. His evidence, I believe, is damning evidence about the Government's real intentions and motives on this issue. His essential allegation has not been refuted by his subsequent remarks. Let me read it to the Treasurer and hear his refutation when he stands. The Australian of 12 April stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Walsh said he and Mr Keating had expected to introduce a tax in the following term . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is what they were up to: `Tell them we're not going to introduce it; keep mum about the tax policy and we'll introduce it in the next term'. The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>While Mr Keating said publicly in May 1987 he did not plan to introduce a gold tax in his next Budget, he made no commitments covering the full term, according to newspaper files. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me read what Senator Walsh actually said. He is quoted as having said:</PARA>
<PARA>The first thing I remember, which was a complete surprise to me, was when those advertisements were published. </PARA>
<PARA>It was a complete surprise to him. He was second after the Treasurer responsible for revenue for the Commonwealth and he knew nothing about it. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will hear the Treasurer tip a bucket on him when I sit down. Senator Walsh said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It was news to me-I certainly hadn't been consulted about it or even told and I believe the same was true of Paul Keating. </PARA>
<PARA>They had had a chat about it. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> We'd made no decision to do it (introduce a tax) so I guess you could argue Hawke wasn't obliged to get any Cabinet agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the rationalisation for the subsequent position. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there was certainly an intention to introduce it, certainly as far as I was concerned and I believe the same is true for Keating. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the final quote:</PARA>
<PARA> We (he and the Treasurer) were pretty bloody angry when that (the advertisements) appeared. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the second reason why I believe there was a change in government policy. It is another significant fact. Thirdly, let me refer to the Treasurer's remarks. Only a week before the relevant lunch, on 9 June, the Sydney Morning Herald contained a quote from a spokesman for the Treasurer. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> ``We've already looked at gold tax and said there won't be one,'' he said. ``We'll wait until we receive the request and look at it, but if we made any written undertaking there would be 500 on our doorstep-it's an impractical request because they would never end.''</PARA>
<PARA>Just a week before the relevant lunch the Treasurer's office was simply dismissing out of hand any proposition that there might be a written guarantee given to the goldmining industry as a response to its requests. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said, when the Treasurer was asked last week what he knew about the 7 July statement, he said it was insignificant. Why did he say that? He said it because he was going on the attack, which is his best form of defence. I question whether he was ever consulted. If he was consulted, we have also been told that members of his staff at officer level were involved. That is another question yet to be answered. </PARA>
<PARA> As a fourth basis for my proposition, I go to the remarks of Mr Gutman, whose views on this matter were sought back in 1987, during the election, and which were probably significant in promoting the public debate about whether or not there would be a gold tax. He said a lot when he was quoted as follows in the Age of 29 May 1987:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The reason that the Government turned down the recommendations of my report was presumably because they were not the sort of things that could be introduced before an election''. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this was a clear statement that Labor's real intent was to keep mum on this issue until after the election and then go for the gold tax. Furthermore, Gutman's point made over the weekend was also very damning about the processes involved in Labor's decision. In his original report to the Government, Gutman said, `If you go ahead with it the one thing you don't do is give people two or three years notice of the intention to change'. The figure he has quoted in the weekend press as to revenue forgone is something like $1 billion. If it were the case, as the Treasurer alleges, that he had a consistent position all along, why is it that Gutman was able to say that, and the Government acted so as to provide a windfall benefit to the goldmining industry?</PARA>
<PARA> My fifth point is one that Senator Walsh made when he said that there was no political pressure on the Government to give this undertaking-a point acknowledged by the Treasurer when he dismissed that request earlier in June. A few days before the 7 July undertaking by the Prime Minister-people forget history, but if they want to know whether or not the Government was under a lot of pressure in the July 1987 election they should look at the polls in the Australian of 4 July-we were behind in the Newspoll, the McNair poll, the Saulwick poll, the Morgan Gallup poll, another Newspoll and the Reark poll. Unfortunately, we were not ahead in one poll. Where was the political pressure if that political pressure is the explanation for Labor's change of mind on the gold tax policy?</PARA>
<PARA> My sixth point-and I challenge the Treasurer to answer this when he stands-is to ask where it is stated on the public record that anybody in his Government, either he or the Prime Minister, had given a commitment for the full three-year period of an incoming Labor government. He should tell us where it is. It is not in his speech of 19 June, it is not in the Prime Minister's interview on the radio in June, it is not in the Prime Minister's speech at the launch of the Australian nugget bullion coin on 23 April, and it is certainly not in the Prime Minister's speech of 7 May 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I say that the Prime Minister's recollections of these matters are unsatisfactory because I find all his responses very selective. He says that he remembers that he gave no commitment as to Labor's gold tax policy-in fact, he is not even sure whether they discussed the gold tax policy, so he is very doubtful there-but when it comes to his actual position he is as clear as a bell. He cannot even remember whether he met Laurie Connell before lunch or not. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth of the matter is that we raised this matter because there are many questions still to be answered. What were the consultations with the Treasurer on 7 July? Who else was involved? Who else did the Prime Minister meet before lunch on 15 June? What were the discussions at that lunch in regard to politics? Did the Treasurer or the Prime Minister consult with the then Deputy Prime Minister, Bowen?</PARA>

During the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), I started to take notes; I got down to about two points on the first page, and that was the end of the substance of his speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the Opposition has gone nowhere on this matter. Today those opposite have completely run out of puff and have been shown for what they are. They are trying to besmirch the integrity of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on this issue when he has been prepared to tax the income from goldmining companies. The only problem the Prime Minister has had was his faulty recollection last week and the fact that he had to change a statement in Parliament. The allegations have been shown to have no substance at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Hewson-`the Professor'-said today that the Prime Minister had selectively misrepresented the Cabinet decisions of 1986. He said that there was no reference to `three years' and that Keating and Evans did not want to take part in that position. In fact, Evans and I announced it. He went on to talk about the radio interview in Perth and said that there was no categoric reference. The question by Diana Warnock was:</PARA>
<PARA>If you are re-elected will there be a gold tax?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer from Hawke was no. The claim is that he should then have said, `Oh, not for the next three years'. What a lot of codswallop! At that stage the Howard letter had not appeared; the Howard letter appeared 11 days after that. The Prime Minister was not responding to any written commitment from the Opposition at that time. He was not responding to the specific three-year commitment by Mr Howard at that time. The notion that, because he did not refer to it, in some way he is being tricky is simply dishonesty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition said that until 7 July there had been no public intention to restrict it to three years. Then he said, `Then it surprisingly emerged on 7 July'. In terms of any written commitments, the three-year issue has been a formula used by both parties on a number of occasions. We used it in 1983-and kept to it-in relation to the capital gains tax. After that, we could have been defeated at a poll. Honourable members should remember that there was a 1990 election. If the public did not like the 1988 gold taxing arrangements, they could have turfed us out in 1990-remember? But they did not. That was the point of three years, which those opposite dishonestly know. Then we have the other dishonest claim by the Leader of the Opposition that I said last week that the issue was insignificant. I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Whether . . . the letter was written or not is insignificant, because the point was made by the Prime Minister and by me that we would not be legislating in the course of that Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I said:</PARA>
<PARA>The letter would have given only written confirmation of things that the Prime Minister had said orally to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>There was another attempt to take that word `insignificant' out of context. </PARA>
<PARA> But the real questions are: why did those opposite vote against the Bills in 1988? Why did Mr Howard write the letter in the first place? What did Mr Howard want from Mr Bond when he saw him? And what did Mr Bond want from Mr Howard in the course of that exchange? The Leader of the Opposition said, `I am not on the block'. He said to the Prime Minister, `You are on the block'. An article written by Peter Rees in the West Australian on 14 October 1989 makes interesting reading. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>When the Hawke Government announced its plan in May last year to tax gold from January 1, 1991, Mr Howard told his shadow cabinet there was no alternative but to go along with the policy. </PARA>
<PARA> That night Andrew Peacock, then shadow treasurer, took the same line on television. </PARA>
<PARA> But by October last year-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in 1988-</PARA>
<PARA>new factors were at work and a process to reverse this commitment had begun with the WA Liberal Party leading the way. </PARA>
<PARA> In hindsight, it coincided with the emergence of the campaign against Mr Howard. </PARA>
<PARA> In a speech in New York in early October last year, Mr Howard made it clear he supported the tax. </PARA>
<PARA> A month later, as the internal pressure against the tax mounted, he became more equivocal, saying he did not have a closed mind on the matter.  The strongly held views of the WA Liberals on the issue played a part in influencing Mr Peacock to reverse his position. </PARA>
<PARA> His submission opposing it was ultimately supported by shadow cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> It left the coalition parties in the questionable position of opposing the Government's tax while not having a policy of their own. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Among the shadow ministers backing Andrew Peacock were Fred Chaney, Wilson Tuckey and Peter Shack-all of whom were to play crucial roles in organising the coup against John Howard in May . . .</PARA>
<PARA> There are conflicting versions about the shadow cabinet debate on the gold tax which ensued but one Liberal who was present says Senator Chaney made the point that everyone around the table had a `distortion' which suited them politically and this was his. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney denied this yesterday but agreed he would have said something about how `everyone has items which are important to his constituency' and this was important to his. </PARA>
<PARA>This is little goody two-shoes Fred Chaney; this is little unctuous Fred. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Another Liberal said yesterday, `If Chaney and Peacock had taken the position last year that they have now ultimately taken, it would have made things a lot easier for Mr Howard'. </PARA>
<PARA>I daresay it would have. One does not have to be Sherlock Holmes to understand that all of Durack's statements were as a result of his visits up and down St Georges Terrace and around the goldmining companies. The same would go for Shack and for Tuckey. The same would go also for Chaney, who has always presented himself as an upright, decent citizen after truth, justice and the Australian way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member does not want me to use these people's names; he wants them dismissed by naming their electorates. The fact is that it is these people moving around the Western Australian goldmining industry who have produced this policy. But when apparently the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong, wanted to agree with the Government and impose a tax on gold, he was up-ended by these Western Australians and by the then Senator Chaney, who as I said always masquerades as someone after truth, justice and the Australian way but is actually in there supporting all this tax rorting, which any other decent upstanding person would, with the Government, not be supporting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said earlier in the House-and it is worth repeating-there is no place for humbug in these debates. The honourable member for Bennelong got on the Pru Goward show and said that the Government and the Prime Minister had an explanation to make about this three year business. That was an indecent piece of humbug. On the same program Ms Goward asked:</PARA>
<PARA>How well funded was your Party in Western Australia by the gold industry?</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member said:</PARA>
<PARA>I wouldn't have a clue. </PARA>
<PARA>Silly and civil; what you do not know will not hurt you. We would like to know what went on during this lunch with Bond. The fact is that the Government has now taxed this industry. The Liberal Party opposed it. The honourable member for Bennelong wrote the letter saying that he would not do it for the three years of a Liberal government. His Party then knocked him over and opposed the taxation of goldmining income. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, it is important that the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters ask Senator Durack, the honourable member for Pearce, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the honourable member for Bennelong and representatives of the Liberal secretariat: why did the Liberal Party make its commitment on the non-taxation of gold? Why did it finally vote against the Bills when they came to the House of Representatives? Which goldmining companies that were interested did Mr Howard and the other parties in 1987 speak to? What commitments were sought by these interests? What funds did these interests provide either directly or indirectly to the Liberal Party campaign to secure the Liberal Party's early and definitive opposition to the taxation of goldmining income? They are the issues. What is good for the goose is good for the gander, and if those opposite want to get up and make these cheap points--</PARA>

But all that time we had these vociferous statements by Senator Durack. Of course, he has never run into a gold miner on St George's Terrace; he does not know any of the goldmining companies; he has never had any conversations with them; the Liberal Party has never asked the goldmining industry for funds.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The scatter-gun attack of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was a very weak form of defence. Today the Treasurer has come in here and said that the coalition has made Government members' lives a misery because of a number of reforms. The Treasurer is wrong. Let me give one example, namely, deeming in respect of the very controversial and delicate area of pensioner income and interest rate accounts between 3 3/4 and 10 per cent. If the Opposition had wanted to be irresponsible on that issue, it could have had 5,000 pensioners outside this Parliament every sitting day of this week. We chose not to do that; we chose to take a very responsible action with regard to deeming. That is the complete opposite to what this Treasurer did many years ago when the then Senator Chaney drew up the original proposal on pensioner deeming. It ill becomes the Treasurer to come into this House and say that we have constantly been irresponsible when he has brought forward reforms. The Treasurer made a shabby speech here this afternoon. The fundamental mistake that he makes is to think that the acceptable standard of living and code of conduct on his side of the House are automatically the same as those on our side of the House. I have news for the Treasurer: that is not so. It ill becomes him to judge us by his criteria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion before the House is simple enough; it is to call upon the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to come back into the Parliament and give a dispassionate, constructive, comprehensive and accurate account of all that happened in relation to the gold tax and the lifting of the gold tax exemption, in relation to all of the meetings and the evidence so far given in the Western Australian Royal Commission, and in relation to his credibility with the Australian people. It is now or never as far as the Prime Minister's credibility and integrity are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> We have afforded the Prime Minister the opportunity to come back to the dispatch box, not in the context of an emotional debate-he tried to rip through his speech this afternoon as more evidence was coming out of Perth-but rather in a very direct way, in a more proper response to what we quite rightly put to him. It is in this context that I draw the attention of the House to evidence given later this day to the inquiry. Mr Connell was asked-and I quote in part:</PARA>
<PARA>I put it to you there was no mention at the lunch of the gold tax?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Connell replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I would reject it completely. </PARA>
<PARA>The evidence continued:</PARA>
<PARA>You say it was discussed at the lunch?</PARA>
<PARA>Connell: Yes. </PARA>
<PARA>Who raised it?</PARA>
<PARA>Connell: I don't recall. </PARA>
<PARA>Did you speak about it at the lunch?</PARA>
<PARA>Connell: I am sure that I did, yes. </PARA>
<PARA>Did the Premier raise it?</PARA>
<PARA>Connell: I don't recall. </PARA>
<PARA>Did the Prime Minister?</PARA>
<PARA>Connell: Yes, I believe he did. He was able to confirm that the gold tax would not be introduced and that was of considerable interest to me, my company Paragon Resources, and the companies of Alan Bond. </PARA>
<PARA>There is more to come. Perhaps now we should draw back and look at the background to the Royal Commission. We should look at why it took the Western Australian State Government so many months even to decide on proceeding with the Royal Commission when that much was an open and shut case. It took the Premier's own brother to bring a lot of pressure to bear and a major campaign around the State of Western Australia and the city of Perth just to convince the West Australian Labor Government to have the Royal Commission so that this evidence could be brought out. Now we know why there was so much reluctance, hesitation and delay. I say again: there is more to come. What we want, what we need and what this Parliament and the nation are entitled to is a comprehensive response from the Prime Minister-not the response we had here this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> I now to turn to the National Times on Sunday newspaper. The Prime Minister is fond of quoting from it in his Question Time answers. I refer to an editorial of 12 October 1986 by Robert Haupt. Under the heading, `Tell us how many pieces of gold, Bob', the article states:</PARA>
<PARA>Today's industry, therefore, has been reborn, often on the sites of defunct mines. It is an industry of venture capital, a small work force, new technology and high returns-get-rich-quick in the best traditions of the Gold Rush. </PARA>
<PARA>as it did from 1986 to the 1st January 1991. No other Labor politician . . . better understands the needs of these operators than West Australian Premier Brian Burke. After all, what is the point in being in a get-rich-quick industry if you don't get rich? Rich people support Burke's John Curtin Foundation (a fund that bears more than a passing resemblance . . .</PARA>
<PARA>to other foundations-</PARA>
<PARA>Rich people supported Burke's re-election campaign this year, modestly estimated to have cost $4m. </PARA>
<PARA> None of this shows up on the replay. Nor will you find there an answer to the question first raised after Burke persuaded Hawke to back off on Aboriginal control over mining: just how much will Brian Burke contribute to Bob Hawke's re-election campaign? But it is worth asking now, and it will be asked often if gold mining remains tax free. </PARA>
<PARA>Goldmining remained tax free from 1986 to 1 January 1991. There is another dimension by way of background to this whole issue which, as shadow Minister for energy and resources, I focus on strongly; that is, the Gutman report. This report went to the Treasurer and gave him a warning many years ago, back in 1986-87, that if he were going to proceed down the track of removing the exemption from gold tax then he should do so with no phase-in and a relative degree of speed between the announcement and the cut-in to avoid the high grading mining operation being conducted by mining companies. This is not necessarily in the best interests of the longer term life of the mine or in the best national interest, but one that is difficult to assess and which had to be done on a mine by mine basis. </PARA>
<PARA> To date in this debate the Gutman report has not been mentioned. I inject a mention of that report into these proceedings because it was a very significant report. It pointed to the correct strategy should the Government be of a mind to introduce a gold tax or remove the exemption from tax on gold. It gave the Treasurer the correct blueprint by which to proceed. What happened? The Treasurer privately accepted the thrust of the Gutman report. The Treasurer and Senator Walsh-in his confirmed comments last week-said, `Yes, we have two agendas operating-the public agenda for the immediate election campaign, which, simply stated, is that there will be no gold tax, and the private agenda'. What was in the private agenda? To pick up the Gutman report and in the early phase of the next parliamentary term, after the 1987 elections, to remove the gold tax exemption in the first Budget by 1 January 1988 or 1 July 1989 in the middle of the bicentennial year, an early date-not on 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The two agendas were there. Senator Walsh has confirmed that there were two agendas. The Government has failed to conclusively prove that there were not two agendas. What happened? To quote Senator Walsh, `Somebody was got at'. Suddenly, we had the upgrading of that simple statement, `No gold tax', to the following statement of the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>You have my undertaking we will not introduce a gold tax during the next three-year term of the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>That represented a totally different dimension; a much more serious, significant and precise commitment in relation to the timing of the gold tax. It is this twist which has caused concern. This substantial upgrading of the commitment has meant millions of dollars to goldmining company after goldmining company. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have not addressed this aspect in debate this afternoon. They should come back and do so in the context of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> The sooner they come back and clear the air in a far more fundamental way and open up their files and diary notes to the Parliament-it is the Prime Minister's first responsibility to do that-the sooner the Parliament can focus on the other critical issues of hurt affecting the rural economy, youth unemployment, transitions in key industries and the overall economic recession as we approach an economic winter of absolute discontent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time for the Prime Minister to come forward and give comprehensive answers before the stench envelopes him, the New South Wales parliamentary Labor Party, the New South Wales State division of the Labor Party, the South Australian division of the Labor Party, the Western Australian division of the Labor Party and, indeed, the Federal parliamentary Labor Party-in respect of information on where the money flowed across Australia from the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow in Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in this context that I focus briefly on Brian Burke. He is a key player in the whole equation. He was the host at the famous luncheon. He was present, seemingly, at the special troika meeting between the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, Laurie Connell and the Premier Brian Burke prior to the luncheon. In fact, there was only one reason why Brian Burke was sent off to Ireland. It was because the Labor Party knew that the material now coming out would surface. It wanted Brian Burke as far away as possible from Perth. The Labor Party hoped it would wriggle through without a royal commission and that, therefore, Burke would be bypassed by the media and all the others involved. The people who saw to it were his mates. </PARA>
<PARA> That might be fine for the Labor Party but for the Australian people it means that, even as I speak, our formal representative to Ireland and the Holy See cannot give those demanding positions his full attention. That seems okay with the relevant Minister and the Prime Minister. I say that it is not okay by me; it is not okay by the shadow Minister for foreign affairs; it is not okay by the Liberal-National Party Opposition; and it is not okay by the vast majority of Australians, that Brian Burke has not been stood aside. </PARA>
<PARA> Many senior diplomats representing Australia will feel acutely embarrassed by this decision. However, at the end of the day it comes back to the Prime Minister. It is the Prime Minister who, by his own conduct and the standards he sets within the Government, determines wider standards of conduct throughout the nation. The Labor Party has to come to grips with the fact that it is no longer just dealing with matters concerning its own Party, the factions within its own Party and all the other elements that might be involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Deals which constantly pass for informed debate within the Labor Party are totally inadequate in terms of the proper decision making of this Government and the decision to greatly upgrade the no gold tax promise to no gold tax within three specific years, which meant millions of dollars for so many gold companies. I remind the Government that it is here to govern the country; it is here to look after the national interest in a proper way. It needs to lift itself out of this backroom politicking which has too often been a feature of the parliamentary Labor Party way of government. It is for that reason that the Prime Minister should be back at the dispatch box, and that Senator Walsh and the Treasurer should sort out their alibis because there is still a massive conflict between what each of them is saying. The truth must out on that, and I serve a warning to the Government: the truth will out at the expense of one or the other, and hopefully sooner rather than later, as I said before, so that Parliament can get on with other business with which it must deal as a matter of priority. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an extraordinarily serious affair, made slightly lighter by the famous fishing trip to Geraldton and the fact that when a television crew lobbed up there-it is now a matter of record-so concerned were certain Ministers and others with the prime ministerial party that they went around to the operator of the only other charter boat in town. He was charging about $1,000 a day. An approach was made late at night to the family concerned, the only other boat operator, to stay off the water for the fee for a three-day charter-$3,000. They are the words of the journalist who took the trip up there to check on the fishing trip and to attend the Norcape Lodge and proceed with the business. He arrived at a time which was clearly very awkward for those involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister does have a case to answer. It is in the interests of the nation and in his own interests that he comprehensively clarify the situation, the saga, and all aspects relating to that saga. The sooner he does it-because he failed to do it this afternoon-the better for the Government and the nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has managed to reduce this debate to complete tedium. That was not to be unexpected, but it certainly was out of sorts with what it promised us over the weekend. We even had the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) going into a radio station earlier this morning and saying that he would be coming in here to tear the guts out of the Government; that the Opposition would be up here to tear the guts out of the Government. We had one question from the honourable member for O'Connor and all it did, as is usual with regard to the honourable member for O'Connor and as was amply pointed out by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), was simply peddle lies in this place, and the question was dealt with as containing peddled lies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the Opposition comes to one central point in this, and it has been amply answered by the Prime Minister. As far as policy making is concerned, the Opposition, to rest its case, has to sustain an absurd position. The position is this: when an election campaign is under way and the Opposition says something, what it is in fact saying goes for about the first two or three months after the election campaign or perhaps the first Budget, but has no meaning in the subsequent years. Does the Opposition seriously mean to say that if we stood up in an election campaign and said that we will introduce no capital gains tax or we will introduce no gold tax, irrespective of whether or not we say it is going to be for three years or whatever, and it is not challenged, and then we subsequently go to the election and a year or two down the line we put up a gold tax, the Opposition would come into this place and say, `The Government is absolved from lying to the electorate.'?</PARA>
<PARA> Does the Opposition seriously mean to say that it would come into this place and say, `Look, you did say in the election campaign that you would introduce no gold tax. You did say that, but it is now 18 months on from the election campaign. So now that you have introduced the gold tax, we do not think you are liars; we do not think you lack credibility; we do not think you have gone to the people on a false premise or false promise. Oh, no. We the Opposition accept absolutely your bona fides. We accept absolutely that if you wish to do that, you may, without criticism from us, because as far as we are concerned, promises in election campaigns last six months after the election campaign.'?</PARA>
<PARA> This is an interesting element of psychological projection on the part of the Opposition. We now have a fairly clear idea of what it thinks about promises it gives in undertakings when it goes to the electorate. As far as it is concerned, when it goes to the electorate, whatever it says lasts somewhere around six months after that election and from that point on its interpretation of democracy is that it has nothing more to say to the population. What an absolute nonsense proposition it is that is put forward by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> If we were here, as I said, in another context, a context of having reversed the policy that we announced during the course of the election campaign and re-announced during the course of the election campaign, the situation might be different. The Prime Minister was in the course of the election campaign when he was being questioned by Diana Warnock, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was in the course of the campaign when he was quizzed a couple of weeks before that, and in fact the Prime Minister was, in effect, in the course of the election campaign back on 7 May when he made the statement about gold taxes. We were not making statements about the next Budget, the next six months or whatever; we were making a simple statement about what our intentions were, were we to be re-elected to government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has gone around and around the garden like a teddy bear on this blinking subject, but as far as it is concerned it cannot establish a single sensible point about it. On that hook swings all its arguments and on that hook swings the entire Opposition. Its position in this matter, from that point of view, is totally discredited. There is only one question for the Prime Minister to answer as far as that particular lunch is concerned, and he answered it. The question is this-and it has been raised by the Opposition-were any private undertakings given to Connell in return for cash? At any meetings that he had with Connell, in any circumstances, were private undertakings given to Connell in return for cash? Nothing else matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Leaders of governments and leaders of oppositions meet with business all the time and discuss policy issues or whatever; that is a perfectly legitimate part of the process. But if we are now going to go through this line of questioning which the Opposition has put up in the course of this debate, it is also perfectly legitimate for us to go down a similar line of questioning with it about the meetings with Bond, about the discussions Senator Durack and others may have had with people up and down St George's Terrace. We are entitled to ask the same questions of the Opposition because there is a vast gap between its declared donations in the course of those last two election campaigns and its actual expenditure. We are entitled to argue under what particular artifice was concealed any donations from the goldminers. There are some donations from the goldminers to the Opposition on the public record. The question is: is that in return for policy? If the Opposition wants to put the same question to us, we will put the question back to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition put the question to us on the subject of Laurie Connell-`Did you, Prime Minister, exchange a private undertaking with Laurie Connell in return for cash?'. The answer of the Prime Minister to those two questions was, `No, no'. Absolute nonsense. </PARA>

His answer to that was, `No.' Not that I suggest that the Opposition necessarily relies on the recollection of Laurie Connell when it comes to dealing with these matters. Just remember that all the things that he has put forward so far to this Royal Commission go unanswered because nobody else has yet appeared to answer them. But one of the points he made, going round to why he might have made the contribution, is this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Because I considered that it was a real benefit to Paragon if Labor were returned and I saw it a real detriment to Paragon if the Liberal Party were to gain office and for their policy of introducing a gold tax to be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>Laurie had so firmly in his mind an understanding of what the policies were of the various political parties at the time that he was actually capable of coming out in the Royal Commission and saying that his recollection of the time was that the Liberal Party position was that it was going to introduce a gold tax. So there we are. We now know how deeply Laurie has cast his mind back to the events of those days and what sort of conclusions he has managed to reach on these matters, because of course the Liberal Party was not in a situation where it was going to introduce a gold tax after the election. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party was very firmly on the record as saying that there would be no gold tax-at undeniably boring and huge length from Senator Durack and from others at less length, although it was just as emphatic. The only little glitch in that particular scenario that one can find-and perhaps it is why it had to go on about it at such boring length-is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in those days, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), did make one effort to do something back in August 1985, and that was when he said he could not guarantee that a future Liberal government would not tax gold. The honourable member for Bennelong, who to some considerable extent was one of the more credible leaders of the Liberal Party over this period, lacks credit entirely in one area-that is, he could never deliver his Party. When he failed to deliver his Party, he did not stand back in semi-embarrassment; he did not walk back in semi-embarrassment for the fact that he had failed to deliver his Party. He embraced the repudiation of his position and rushed to the barrier clutching under his arms the characters who had tormented him in policy debate. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want an example of a fellow who was clutching with his arms the people who tormented him in policy debate, we can go no further than to his statement to the goldmining industry incorporated in his letter, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>We are totally opposed to the introduction of a gold tax. </PARA>
<PARA>This was Howard 1987 as opposed to Howard 1985:</PARA>
<PARA>As my colleague Senator Peter Durack, shadow Minister for Trade and Resources, stated in June last year, a Liberal government would repeal any gold tax introduced by the Labor Government. A gold tax would jeopardise the future of many existing mines and prevent the opening of new ones. </PARA>
<PARA>It is passing strange that nobody, evidently, drew Laurie Connell's attention to this at the time. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Exploration and the level of investment in this important sector would also decline rapidly. We have a particular concern about the effects a gold tax would have on our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA>This was not a rejection by the Prime Minister. This was a detailed argument against his own convictions obliged on him by Senators Durack and Chaney. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal Party has a firm commitment on this matter. We are opposed to the introduction of a gold tax. Recognising the need to provide a climate of certainty for investment . . . I trust that this clear and unequivocal undertaking is of assistance to your industry. </PARA>
<PARA>So that is where the letter from the honourable member for Bennelong left us as far as the Liberal Party was concerned on the issue of gold tax in that campaign. One could not be clearer than that in a statement and one could not be clearer in the sorts of statements that have been brought out. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting back to the nub of what the Opposition seems to think, far from being an announcement by the Prime Minister about our intentions for the next three years, the advertisement which appeared on 10 July, being a letter of 7 July, reads:</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that there appears to be an element of uncertainty among members of the Australian Goldmining Industry Council about the Government's intention concerning the tax exemption for goldmining issues, despite my public statements on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister in that letter clearly referred back to previous public statements that he had made. There are quite a lot of them and they have been detailed in this House in the course of these exchanges. At that point the Prime Minister went on to reiterate those public statements: `No, when we get into office after this election, we will not be implementing a gold tax'. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Prime Minister's statement in that letter clearly referred back to the fact that it was not a new commitment. It referred back to commitments that he had made. The Opposition has to suspend its total understanding of politics. A statement made in the course of an election campaign that unequivocally one will not introduce a gold tax means what it says: unequivocally one will not introduce a gold tax. In so far as there was any doubt about that, it was not a doubt being created by Labor Party spokesmen at the time; it was a doubt being created by Senator Durack. Others in the Liberal Party were wandering around saying, `Even though the Labor Party says it, it does not mean it'. This was the position being adopted by Senator Durack and the others at the time: `Even though the Labor Party says it, it does not really mean it'. Therefore, we had to have yet another commitment from the Prime Minister that he had made a decision not to go ahead with a goldmining tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons that the Government made that decision not to go ahead with a goldmining tax were many and varied at the time, and none of them went to the question of political donations. They were the sorts of things that influenced many other people doing their analysis of this tax. I go to an Australian editorial written in September 1986 which advised us that it was a `bad time for a gold tax'. The editorial went on to point out:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Mining Industry Council has reminded the Government that there are nine House of Representatives electorates that have gold mines and gold miners within their boundaries, and four of them, Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, Leichhardt in Queensland, Ballarat and Bendigo in Victoria, return Labor members and have a substantial gold mining component. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian editorial said, `This is not the time for a tax on goldmining'. There was a wonderful little editorial in the Australian about a week ago which read:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke succumbed, in the process producing a very poor policy decision. He decided, against sound advice, not to introduce a gold tax during the life of the next Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>We are all good at twenty-twenty vision whether we happen to be in the media or in politics. The advice of the Australian at the time to the Government was: introduce no gold tax, firstly because it would be bad in principle and, secondly, because we would cut our own throat politically. That was fair enough. That is why in the end we arrived at that position. And that was, I suspect, to a degree why in the end the Opposition did too. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has already made reference to a particularly informative article. I will go on to make one or two more points about it. It quoted the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), and stated:</PARA>
<PARA>After the WA election there was a feeling in the leadership group that much of the heat had gone out of the gold tax debate. Senator Chaney is understood to have made the observation to colleagues that there were now no votes in it. </PARA>
<PARA>That is real principle! The Opposition comes into this place criticising us on the ground of principles. We are the ones who turn on the spit trying to get decent tax into this country. In the end we get thoroughly and completely ambushed and have to give the undertakings that we do on these sorts of matters. I might say that there were some reasonable arguments at the time as to why we should do so. </PARA>
<PARA> But there we have the totality of the Opposition's approach. Blow any notion of decent policy: `Boys, we can now pronounce ecstatically to you all that you are now freed from all your protestations on the gold tax because we have now defined there are no votes in it any more, so you can come over and support the Labor Party on this'. Members of the Opposition are a mob of shonks on this issue. A fraudulent proposition has been put in this chamber by the Opposition on these matters and it comes from its total unreliability on tax matters and total lack of understanding on the question of how politics should proceed. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the question be now put. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the course of Question Time the Treasurer (Mr Keating) referred to press reports about a meeting I had with Mr Alan Bond in Western Australia during the course of the 1987 election campaign and then went on to make some incorrect remarks about the context of that meeting. I am quite happy to confirm to the House that I did have a meeting with Mr Bond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Government members -Ah!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ah, indeed. Big deal. For the record I might say that there is nothing extraordinary about party leaders of either political persuasion having meetings with businessmen, and there is nothing wrong with commitments being made; it is a question of whether they are corruptly procured.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I come to the point made by the Treasurer: the circumstances are that I was in Western Australia and I was in then Senator Chaney's office. Mr Bond occupied an office in the same building and at Senator Chaney's suggestion, to which I readily agreed, we saw Mr Bond. I cannot honestly recall everything that took place in the discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Government members -Oh!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, that meeting took place almost four years ago. I can say honestly that I gave absolutely no commitment in return for any offers of political donations. I can also state categorically that I did not ask Mr Bond for money to support the Federal campaign. It was not my custom then nor ever during the time I was Leader of the Opposition to seek personally donations from individuals. I strictly observed the fundraising code of the Liberal Party of Australia. I had no Leader's account and I continue to counsel my Party, in both its Federal and State manifestations, against ever sanctioning leaders' accounts. I can certainly recall our discussing media policy, because, as honourable members will recollect, the gentleman in question had invested a few bob in a media asset only a few months earlier. I simply say to the House that the clear implication in the remarks of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that there was something sinister, corrupt and needing to be explained about my meeting with Mr Bond is absolute nonsense. As the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) put it so beautifully, the position of the Opposition on the gold tax had been made clear in undeniably boring length well before the meeting took place between myself and Mr Bond, and in those circumstances I reject the attempt by the Treasurer to draw some crummy political capital out of that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is not opposed to this important legislation which goes to the core of providing adequate benefits for the armed forces-Navy, Army and Air Force-personnel upon retirement as part of the total approach to military superannuation and benefits. My colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) will be giving a more historical background in relation to this important measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) is present, I want to take this opportunity to say that it was a rare privilege yesterday to go to Darwin to visit HMAS Sydney and HMAS Brisbane as they were on their final leg home from the Gulf to Darwin, their first port of call on mainland Australia. They returned from a tough job well done. I salute the Australian contingent in all its component parts, including the ships, the medical teams, the Naval diving team-as we speak here today it is still in the Gulf carrying out some very dangerous work near Kuwait-the exchange officers, liaison officers and others who were part of that contingent. I especially salute those who served on HMAS Sydney and HMAS Brisbane. They were in good spirits yesterday as they saw Australia for the first time in many months. I passed on the best wishes of the Minister, the Opposition and others. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) went to the other ship, the HMAS Brisbane, and did likewise. We swapped over when we got into the wharf. </PARA>
<PARA> I add in passing that there is one item of concern which I have discussed directly with the Minister-I know that he is looking at possible ways and means of responding adequately on this matter between now and Friday-that is, striking the right balance and cut-off points of recognition of their service. As things stand, it could be that the sailors who served on our supply ships HMAS Success and HMAS Westralia, and did it well, will receive two medals, the Australian Active Service Medal and the Australian Service Medal, associated with the Persian Gulf. Those who served on HMAS Sydney and HMAS Brisbane might only be eligible, due to a very complex formula and difficulties associated with that, for just one medal, which would be the Active Service Medal, but not the Australian Service Medal. If we go to the regulations covering this we find a very adequate discretion available to the Minister and to the Chief of the Defence Force to exercise a leeway, especially as the total number of days involved were reached in a combination of both regular service and active duty service. I hope that the Minister will be successful in reviewing this matter. I know that there will be a popular homecoming for these personnel in Brisbane. I do not want to lock the Minister in because I know that these things have to be worked through very carefully, but it would go down very well if there could be a breakthrough on this matter between now and Friday, when the ships arrive in Brisbane for a formal welcome by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), because they deserve appropriate recognition. They have served Australia well, and the legislation before the House will help to look after their superannuation interests when they eventually retire. </PARA>
<PARA> On 11 May 1989 the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel announced that there would be a complete review of the existing defence force retirement and death benefits (DFRDB) scheme, which would result in the development of a new superannuation and death benefits scheme for Defence Force members. This legislation brings into force a new scheme, called the military superannuation and benefits scheme (MSBS), to be implemented from 1 October 1991. In this regard the shadow Minister for veterans' affairs and defence personnel, Senator Jocelyn Newman, will have more specific detail to give in the Senate. On her behalf I signify, once again, that the Opposition is not opposed to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill and the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The military service benefits scheme is set up by a trust deed, administered by trustees in accordance with the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987. The trust deed sets out the powers and functions of the board of trustees. The rules contained in the schedule to the trust deed specify details of the contribution to be paid and benefits to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the following: a trust deed, which is to be executed by the Minister on behalf of the Commonwealth, the form of which is set out in the schedule of the Bill; Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd to manage the moneys in the fund until such time as other arrangements are made, if desired, by the trustees; the appointment of a board of trustees to manage the fund; the Commissioner of Superannuation to be responsible for the provision of administrative services to the board; contributions to be made by members and the Commonwealth and benefits to be paid to members; financial arrangements between the fund set up under the trust deed and the Commonwealth; members of the Defence Force to be members of the scheme and other members to be eligible to join the scheme; transfer arrangements to be created to allow existing members to transfer from the DFRDB to the MSBS; and the payment of a retention benefit to certain members who undertake to complete 20 years service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 to give members of that scheme, under the Act, 13 months from 1 September 1991 in which to decide to transfer to the new scheme or to remain with the DFRDB. The Opposition supports the passage of this legislation, which is almost entirely based on the recommendations of the report by Sir William Coles of June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a significant financial impact on the Australian Government-from approximately $152m in this financial year to $209m in 1994-95. In the longer term, however, there are expected to be budgetary savings. It is my firm view that this is a correct priority because for too long governments, and in particular the Hawke Labor Government, have taken a short-sighted approach to the conditions of service of our service personnel. The result has been very high resignation rates which, in turn, create a massive cost burden on defence, especially when experienced personnel are resigning and we then have to recruit. The cost of recruitment and training is very significant. Any perceived saving by cutting back on conditions of service is, therefore, often a mirage. What happens is that high resignation rates mean very significantly higher training costs. </PARA>
<PARA> In the end, the Navy, Army and Air Force can be gutted of their most experienced personnel. This Parliament supplied the members of the Manfred Cross inquiry, which was an attempt to turn this around over a period, but much more needs to be done. I add that the Government has really dawdled since 1983- perhaps, to some extent, the previous Government did as well-in attaining a DFRDB scheme throughout the 1980s which did not keep pace with superannuation benefits offered to most other private and public sector employees. The military was left, in a sense, in a cocoon and this cost dearly. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that I am pleased to see that at last the Government has seen the sense of adopting elements of the coalition's defence science and personnel policy. It states that the coalition will-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . ensure that service personnel are not disadvantaged relative to the civilian community in relation to superannuation benefits. Anomalies which also will be examined include-the lack of interest on personal contributions, the effect of nominal retirement ages for officers, and the lack of employer contributions below 20 years of service. </PARA>
<PARA>The second related measure is the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. This makes amendment to the parent Act of 1973 and, where appropriate, to the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Act 1948. As I have already mentioned, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill 1991 seeks to establish a new superannuation scheme. The MSBS makes consequential amendments to the DFRDB, which have the effect of rendering the DFRDB a closed scheme; that is, the only persons who will be in the DFRDB scheme are those who opt not to transfer to the MSBS. The only persons permitted to join the scheme will be pensioner re-entrants who also opt not to join the MSBS. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in this Bill will improve the administration of the DFRDB Act, taking into account that new dimension. The amendments, in brief, are as follows: changes to the constitution and manner of appointment of the DFRDB Authority which administers the scheme under the DFRDB Act, to reflect its more limited role by transferring the power from the Governor-General to the Minister, and compulsory cessation of contributions by members who have reached 40 years effective service. I am not sure that there will be very many of those; but it was interesting to find that the chief engineman on HMAS Sydney, who was a Vietnam veteran, is getting on to 30 years of service. Likewise, at the weekend, on HMAS Brisbane I found that some people have given many decades of service. Forty years is a very long period of service in the armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill will also provide for specific power for the Authority to classify and reclassify members for invalidity purposes in certain cases of death. It will provide for continuation of payment to a spouse of a deceased pensioner, for a period immediately after the death of the pensioner, of a pension at the rate previously payable to the deceased pensioner. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes in the nature of benefits payable to members who retire a second time are catered for, and the amendments are consequent on the Superannuation Act 1990 coming into operation. This is a cognate debate and, therefore, I will not dwell on it greatly, other than to say that the Opposition does not oppose either the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill or the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I issue one final note of warning in respect of this legislation: it is a very sensitive area; it goes to the morale of our hardworking members in the Navy, the Army and the Air Force, many of whom are still overseas. For example, HMAS Westralia is still in the Gulf; there are still United Nations peacekeeping forces in reduced numbers in the Middle East and, as I mentioned, a clearance diving team is also still in the Gulf. Of course, many back here in Australia have plenty on their hands and are quite often involved in dangerous exercise situations and the like. This is a very important matter to them, to their security and to the well-being of their families in the event of an accident or death or upon retirement from the armed forces. The new scheme is not well understood amongst members of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not dwell unduly on the reasons for this, but I take the point of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) that one aspect of that is a lack of consultation. The second aspect is that the extent of complexity of the Bill is such that, no matter who the government of the day is, it will require a massive educational effort to bring everyone up to speed with this new comprehensive scheme. The Government should proceed with that task; otherwise it will create difficulty if there is an inadequate understanding of the complex changes involved-changes which, by and large, we support but, nevertheless, changes which are not yet familiar to so many in the Navy, the Army and the Air Force, particularly to the younger elements who, in their first couple of years in the armed forces, think very little about their superannuation arrangements, a defence service home loan or housing arrangements more generally. Therefore, I ask that the Minister take note of the fact that there is still a need for a continuing educative process in relation to these complex schemes. The Opposition is not opposed to the legislation before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill and the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill, which are before us today, follow on from Government announcements last August to introduce a new superannuation scheme for all Defence Force personnel. In September, I had the pleasure of congratulating the Government and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) for the preparation of the legislation and for the contents of the report of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme Review Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a pity that in his speech today the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), in acknowledging the good points of this legislation, sought to score the odd cheap political point by telling us that it was National Party policy first. In his own speech, he addressed the fact that it had been the subject of recommendations from various committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, I cannot let pass the comment from the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who clearly has not been involved in this debate in the past and has not followed it. If he had been involved, he would be aware of the extensive communications last year to all serving personnel providing details of the program, not only in a comprehensive way but in a very clear and readable manner, to try to translate what is a complex matter of law into a readable fashion for those who are affected by it. The interjection from the honourable member for Bendigo clearly indicates his ignorance of the subject and lack of involvement in it. </PARA>
<PARA> This scheme was recommended in the report of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme Review Committee, which was tabled in June of last year. I am also pleased to say that it followed a report of a subcommittee-chaired by my predecessor in the electorate of Brisbane, Mr Manfred Cross-of the Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in 1988. I take this opportunity to again acknowledge on the record the very extensive and fine work conducted by that Committee and, in particular, the many long years of work put into Defence Force matters by my predecessor, Manfred Cross, in his excellent report Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force. I am pleased that the Leader of the National Party had the good faith to acknowledge the importance of that report and, in spite of the interjection from the honourable member for Bendigo, to acknowledge that the difficulties confronting this question have as much to do with the complexity of the issue as they do with any question of a lack of consultation. `Lack of consultation' are the precise words that the honourable member for Bendigo used. That is not the case and he should go back and do his homework. </PARA>
<PARA> This new scheme updates what is in many ways an outdated scheme which does not reflect the current superannuation provisions in private industry nor the provisions in State and Commonwealth public services generally. The new scheme is designed to comply with the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act of 1987, thereby bringing it into line with the normal provisions pertaining to employees in the work force generally. It provides Defence Force personnel the same degree of protection and access to benefits that they could rightly expect to obtain in other places of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the superannuation industry there have been dramatic changes in the last decade. These changes have more accurately reflected individual career paths. The changes have sought to ensure that benefits provided to contributors take account of the movements throughout their career lives and ensure that at the end of their working lives they have access through an accumulated fund to sizeable superannuation payments that will assist them in their later years. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to benefits, a major shift has occurred in the last decade concerning the vesting entitlements of superannuation funds. The changes have improved to a marked degree the vesting entitlements of contributors throughout the superannuation industry. By and large, those changes have sought to provide benefits for all employees preserved to the age of 55. The previous industry standards, which were largely reflected in the old Defence Force retirement and death benefits (DFRDB) scheme, provided for no access or little access to employer contributions prior to retirement or prior to attaining the age of 55. That was a characteristic of the old DFRDB, and it was a characteristic of insurance throughout the last 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not necessarily a reflection on former governments, and it is not an effort to score cheap political points as we have seen, unfortunately, earlier in this debate. It is a fact that throughout the period of life of the Opposition in government it took no steps to correct this. That was the prevailing standard throughout the superannuation industry at that time. That has changed, and this Government has properly recognised that, acting on the recommendations of those two committees to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes introduced by the Hawke Government generally in superannuation encourage funds and contributors to preserve their entitlements until age 55. That has been done by the introduction of approved deposit funds, and similar organisations and funds, in conjunction with tax incentives. Those tax incentives have rewarded employee contributors and fund managers for structuring funds in a way that preserves superannuation entitlements to age 55. </PARA>
<PARA> Some specifics of the legislation before us that I think are worthy of mention in this new military superannuation and benefits fund pick up on the earlier comments I have made. At present, service personnel must complete 20 years of service in order to get more than just their own contributions back. That is clearly out of kilter with prevailing standards in superannuation. The new scheme, introduced by way of this legislation, provides for these people to receive interest on their contributions and an entitlement to part of their employer contributions. The employer contribution is preserved to age 55, again in accordance with industry standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The employer's contribution will be based on the final annual salary of the member, averaged over the previous three years. This will be multiplied by a factor for each year of service, with the factor depending on the length of service. For one to seven years of service that factor will be 18 per cent; for eight to 20 years, 23 per cent; and 28 per cent for longer service. It should be noted that these are not cumulative. No matter what the length of service, the first seven years will have a factor of 18 per cent for each year of service during this period. </PARA>
<PARA> The employer contribution will not fully vest with the members until after seven years service and, prior to that, will vest at the rate of 10 per cent per year for the first five years and 25 per cent for the next two years. Providing full vesting after seven years compares quite favourably with many industry standards. From my own investigations into different superannuation schemes and my own experience as a former union official, I know that many industry standards now hinge around the 10-year mark. A seven-year full vesting payment is a quite proper payment and certainly at the forefront of what would be the case outside in other employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Part or all of the lump sum may be commuted into a pension at rates more favourable than current commercial rates. The Government has recognised the likely effect on some service personnel who may currently be enticed to serve 20 years, primarily to receive their superannuation entitlements. It is a fact that a scheme which provides reward for staying for 20 years, but nothing other than one's own contributions if one leaves beforehand, inevitably will entice people to stay those extra few years to get the financial security that the 20-year service provided. Under the new legislation, those people will be able to leave with less than 20 years service and obtain substantial payments and a preserved entitlement for their retirement at age 55. These are significant improvements for current serving personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has recognised the likely effects on retention rates that such a proposal creates and accordingly the Government is introducing a retention payment for selected personnel. Those eligible to receive the retention payment are personnel with 15 years of continuous service under various categories: an officer who holds a rank not lower than major or equivalent, or was previously an enlisted member; an enlisted member who holds the rank of sergeant or equivalent; or, thirdly, a member declared by the Minister to be an eligible member. It is expected that this will be necessary to declare members who meet certain requirements in an employment category where the normal opportunities for promotion do not exist. They are quite appropriate categories in which to provide that retention payment incentive. </PARA>
<PARA> The retention payment incentive is a significant one. It represents an annual salary payment as a one-off payment to the serving personnel-male or female-to re-enlist for a further five years, with appropriate safeguards in the event that they decide to leave prior to that five-year period concluding. It is a significant financial payment which is estimated to cost $96m in the first year, with an ongoing annual cost of approximately $55m. The Government is clearly setting aside substantial amounts of money by way of a retention bonus to encourage selected personnel to maintain their period of service in the Defence Force. It is a far preferable scheme to the inducement of the current 20-year arrangement which, inevitably, wherever it is applied, leads to people being retained in service without genuine or strong motivation. </PARA>
<PARA> The contributions under the new scheme will earn interest through investments in a fund. At present the DFRDB contributions are paid into Consolidated Revenue and no interest is paid to members. It therefore provides a substantial improvement to service men and women. The contributions will be at a variable rate. Service personnel can choose to contribute between 5 per cent and 10 per cent. At present, the DFRDB provides for a fixed payment of 5.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, there is no notional retiring age penalty in the military superannuation and benefits scheme (MSBS). At present, officers who contribute to the DFRDB scheme and retire before reaching the notional age have their pension reduced by 3 per cent for each year that age on retirement is below the notional retiring age. This initiative achieves equity between other ranks and officers and removes a source of justifiable contention held by ADF officers. </PARA>
<PARA> The MSBS dependant benefits will be automatically updated annually in line with the consumer price index (CPI). This is a major improvement guaranteeing maintenance of real value of benefits. It corrects the situation which led to DFRDB orphan benefits remaining at a figure of $702 for nearly 20 years. That benefit is now $5,000. I might add that again in terms of what is standard throughout the superannuation industry, indexation of those benefits is now a standard feature. It was not 20 years ago but it is now and is quite properly a benefit that should be paid. It provides to the contributor the peace of mind of knowing that in the event of dependant payments being required there is a realistic payment that their dependants will receive. It is linked to the CPI, not to average wage movements or any other indicator. It is linked to the most useful indicator that is available and will provide a significant benefit to serving personnel and, of course, to those dependants who will one day draw upon it. </PARA>
<PARA> The MSBS members have the option to continue contributions and accrue employer benefits during periods of leave without pay in some circumstances. This will be of particular benefit for women taking leave for childbirth. This is a new provision and it compares very favourably with other schemes. It demonstrates the Government's clear commitment to equal employment opportunities. In many respects, we are at the cutting edge of the industry here because it is not a widely held provision to enable people on unpaid leave to accrue employer benefits as well. It is not uncommon for people on unpaid leave to be able to contribute themselves and to earn whatever interest may accrue to their funds and whatever benefit they may derive from that. It is, however, not usual for people in that unpaid situation to gain the benefit of employer contributions at that time. I commend the Government for its initiative in this respect and its clear demonstration of a commitment to equal opportunities by its inclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> Persons joining the regular Defence Force on or after 1 October this year will automatically be able to avail themselves of those new features in the MSBS. Those members who are currently contributing to the DFRDB scheme will have the option of remaining in that scheme or joining the new MSBS. They will have until 30 September to decide whether to join the new MSBS or stay in the current DFRDB scheme. Of course, those retiring or resigning before the end of September 1991 will have to make their choice before they leave. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to conclude by referring to some of the matters that I raised at the outset. In doing so, I commend the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and the Department for what I regard as the excellent work they have done in preparing information to send to service personnel. The kits, the brochures and the material distributed last year and widely publicised in all service magazines and newspapers provided comprehensive information for all personnel upon which they can base their decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly in matters of this sort it is difficult for people to arrive at a conclusion. Anybody who has been involved in a scheme introducing new superannuation benefits-even modifications to existing schemes-particularly if they have been involved in going to the contributors, the employees, and explaining to them the differences between the two systems, will know the complexities and the difficulties confronted in conveying to people the necessary detail upon which they can base their important decision. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the day, the contributions made to superannuation funds become critical. We in this place all know the importance which superannuation will play in the early part of the next century, when the population skew within Australia will result in more people being in the age group over 60 than in the working age group of 15 to 60. That will place enormous strains on government's capacity to provide pension benefits and the like. It therefore becomes imperative that we ensure that superannuation funds throughout the land provide equitable and complete cover for wage and salary earners and self-employed people in all walks of life. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government initiative goes a long way down that track in ensuring that our Defence Force personnel are able to access the very best of services through an updated fund that accurately reflects current industry standards and, in some respects, is at the cutting edge of those industry standards. I again congratulate the Minister on the legislation, on accepting the advice of the two committees that have reported on this matter and on the professional way in which the Department and the Minister have gone about explaining these issues to defence men and women. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) said earlier, the Opposition supports both the broad thrust and the specifics of both pieces of legislation before us this evening-the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill, covering the military superannuation benefits system, the so-called MSBS, and, secondly, the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill, covering amendments to the Defence Force and Retirement Death Benefits, or DFRDB, Act-about which we have heard so much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) that I too do not want to indulge in cheap party politics on this legislation, but it is not before time that this legislation is before us; and I point out that the Opposition, in developing its existing policy, as early as 1987 was making these points. They continue to be reflected in our current policy, which of course will have to be amended as a result of this legislation. In particular, we emphasise at this point the need for that consultation process, moving towards the prolonged implementation of MSBS. </PARA>
<PARA> Both of these Bills are very important for the Australian Defence Force, albeit of necessity being very technical in nature. I would like to reiterate a couple of points made by the honourable member for Farrer. I agree entirely with what he had to say in two points that he made. They were, firstly, that this legislation goes to the core of the Australian Defence Force financial conditions of service and, secondly, that, as a result of that, it goes very much to the heart of morale in that force. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic question is: why change? Before I go on to that, perhaps I should spell out some of the comments that were made by a number of commentators across the country when the ministerial announcements were made on the subject. Firstly, I refer to what the National President of the Returned Services League (RSL) of Australia, Alf Garland, said on 8 August last year:</PARA>
<PARA>It has been clear for some time that the old DFRDB scheme has a number of deficiencies. It does not encourage retention in the ADF. For those that resign before the 20 year point there is no employer benefit payable and no return of members' contributions. </PARA>
<PARA>These points were made quite clearly by the honourable member for Brisbane. Mr Garland went on:</PARA>
<PARA>There are also deficiencies in the cover offered for widows and orphans. These will be overcome in the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>While recognising that the scheme was required to comply with the Occupational Superannuation Standards we welcome the main features of the MSBS. </PARA>
<PARA>He set these out:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . availability of benefits for those who serve less than 20 years; the flexibility offered by either the lump sum or pensions; the retention incentive payable at 15 years point for senior NCOs and officers; and the flexibility for additional members' contributions. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said-and there was a little concern implicit in his comments:</PARA>
<PARA>The RSL is concerned about the vesting provisions which are more stringent than in other public sector superannuation funds. There is less flexibility available for members of the ADF to fund their retirement benefits. This puts members of the ADF at a disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to those points at the end of what I have to say. Secondly, I want to refer the House to what Pat Jones, the Executive Officer of the Armed Forces Federation of Australia, said on the subject. Firstly, he said that the MSBS `provides significant improvements for most Service personnel' and `the ADF employment conditions package is the better for it'. That said, he highlighted one or two points that I hope the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is at the table, will convey to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney). Pat Jones said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federation is not entirely confident that the retention benefit in the new scheme will achieve its aim. We suspect many people will transfer to the new scheme and resign soon after. Those who seek to remain to 55 have the potential to choke the promotion system. There is also a problem with members subject to management initiated early retirement. The Government will therefore need to look to more than MSBS to attract and retain Service personnel. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that comment in particular, and again I will have some comments to make on that. Turning to why we need change, I think it is important that we look at the historical origins of the need for change. For the information of the House, the first retirement benefits scheme specifically designed for members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF), the old Defence Force retirement benefits scheme, was introduced in 1948 and ran until September 1972. From that time on, entitlements were calculated under the existing Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the introduction of that scheme there have been substantial changes in the laws and rules governing superannuation-most importantly, the introduction of occupational superannuation standards (OSS), a national wage case decision to require employers to contribute 3 per cent of salary to superannuation. The OSS must be complied with for a superannuation fund to receive concessional tax treatment. The honourable member for Farrer and the honourable member for Brisbane both made the point that the DFRDB scheme is unfunded so that members' contributions are paid into the Consolidated Revenue fund and entitlements are met from the same source as they become due. There is no investment fund to invest the members' contributions as in other Commonwealth superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The DFRDB scheme was briefly reviewed by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the findings published in 1988 as the so-called Cross report, entitled Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force. Like the honourable member for Brisbane, I once again congratulate Manfred Cross and his cross-party team on an excellent report which highlighted some of the deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The report found that while benefits were greater than the community norm in some areas, in some cases, particularly for people retiring before 20 years of service, to whom only a refund of contributions is made, the benefit was behind the community norm. It also noted that the current scheme does not encourage people to serve past their initial engagement term and called for a review of the scheme. In the response to the report on 11 May 1989 the Minister announced that a review of the DFRDB scheme would be conducted. The terms of reference of the review included the examination of the suitability of the DFRDB scheme and any possible changes to that scheme or the creation of a new scheme for members of the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> As previous speakers have said, the review team delivered its report in June last year and recommended the establishment of a new scheme rather than amendments to the DFRDB scheme. Reasons for this included that it would be very difficult to adapt the current scheme to conform to the OSS, there would be substantial cost increases, and the current scheme drives rather than assists Defence Force personnel policy. It was recommended that the DFRDB scheme remain for current members, that new members join and that those currently members of the DFRDB scheme have the option of joining the new scheme, which, as previous speakers have said, will be known as the military superannuation and benefits scheme, or MSBS. In many aspects, it is similar to the new public sector superannuation scheme for other Commonwealth employees. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to highlight the new scheme rather than a variation of the old scheme. I point out to the House that the review committee's findings said that it was not possible to build a superannuation scheme which would serve the needs of both ADF members and management on the foundations of the existing DFRDB scheme. The committee said that one of the most noticeable deficiencies is that members who serve for less than 20 years receive no contribution towards their superannuation. In part, it said:</PARA>
<PARA>This grossly affronts the spirit of the OSS . . . and the intention that employer benefits be both vested in the member and preserved. Thus the status quo is not an option . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The lack of any investment return on members' contributions also has been widely criticised. </PARA>
<PARA> To provide both full employer vesting and earnings on members' contributions would have added about 15% to the annual cost of the DFRDB Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The OSS also require that the employer benefit be preserved in new schemes until the member retires from the workforce at or after age 55. The DFRDB Scheme pays a pension from ages as young as 36 and allows, at the present time, for 4.35 . . . times one year's pension to be commuted to a lump sum. </PARA>
<PARA> To bring these arrangements into line with the OSS clearly would have meant abrogating the Government's iron clad guarantee that `. . . the benefits for which members are currently contributing will continue to be available when they leave the Defence Force'. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus any proposal to overcome these obvious deficiencies of the DFRDB Scheme would have involved substantial additional cost without the possibility of any offsetting savings. </PARA>
<PARA> This would be contrary to the Terms of Reference and the Minister's requirement that any new scheme should not be more expensive than the present scheme in budgetary terms. </PARA>
<PARA>There were numerous commentaries on the changes. I have looked at many of them. One that struck me was an article by Daryl Dixon, a financial commentator, in the Canberra Times on Sunday, 9 September of last year. He said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> After 20 years' membership, the DFRDB provides excellent Tattslotto type benefits-a partly commutable generous indexed pension usually payable at a relatively early age. Before that period of membership-except in some situations such as death, disability or retrenchment-the DFRDB is one of the most ungenerous schemes to be found in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The DFRDB does not even comply with government guidelines to pay interest on members' contributions to the fund, let alone provide any vested employer benefits to departing employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The MSBS, by contrast, has been devised to comply with the Government's rules and provide benefits to all employees, including those with short stays in the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> The MSBS will also, as with all the new schemes, save the Government money in the long run . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> However, departing employees will also be able to take a refund of their own contributions plus accrued fund earnings when they leave. Under the DFRDB, the only pay-out on resignation is a return of the employee's contribution with no interest at all. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not surprising that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel made some announcements on this subject in August. He said that the major features of the scheme were:</PARA>
<PARA>* It will offer a full range of options for retiring members including lump sums, pensions or a combination;</PARA>
<PARA>* A selective retention benefit of one year's salary after fifteen years service for members who commit themselves to serve for a further five years;</PARA>
<PARA>* Employer benefits which must be preserved until age 55; and</PARA>
<PARA>* Variable rates of contributions between five and ten per cent of salary. </PARA>
<PARA>On the specifics, the Government has accepted amendments to the DFRDB legislation which aim at remedying perceived deficiencies. These amendments are more in the nature of tightening up the existing provisions rather than entailing changes to the general structure of the scheme, although some of the proposed changes are significant for those affected. For example, there is the very welcome indexation of the $5,000 per annum payable to orphans and the $312 per annum children's benefit; there is provision for widows of DFRDB contributors to commute up to two years worth of the former spouse's salary, with commensurate reduction in the widow's pension; there is the $160,000 per annum, or thereabouts, for the six pay periods after a death which will be paid to the spouse of the deceased pensioner; there is the adjustment of the re-entered DFRDB recipient member's final pension to match, as nearly as possible, the benefit provided to a continuously serving member with the same length of service, together with further commutation at the second exit; and, finally, there is the cessation of contribution after 40 years, as benefits cease to accrue at 40= years service. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be reasonable to say that the proposed MSBS meets the occupational superannuation standards and resolves some anomalies in the present DFRDB scheme. It is a vast improvement on the DFRDB scheme for short term employees and does not disadvantage service personnel when compared with the civilian community, although some would argue that that point is debatable. However, most DFRDB scheme members intending to serve to the 20-year mark would be financially advantaged by remaining in the DFRDB scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> One disparity between the MSBS and the new Commonwealth superannuation scheme-or the PSS-is with vesting. The PSS allows for the employer benefit to be fully vested at four years, whereas the MSBS does not allow full vesting until year seven. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish by posing a number of questions to the Minister about retention benefits. I go back to the questions that Pat Jones and the Armed Forces Federation asked. Does the Minister agree that there will be a problem with retention? Earlier in my speech I also referred to a number of other questions about management initiated early retirement, promotion choking, et cetera. The second question is about funding. As the honourable member for Farrer has pointed out, very substantial costs from about $151m in 1991-92 to $209m in 1994-95 are involved here. My question to the Minister is: who will bear the cost of that expenditure? Will other elements within the Defence budgetary outlays go towards influencing the Minister's view? About vesting, I ask the Minister whether he agrees with the Returned Services League about seven years as distinct from four years?</PARA>
<PARA> One last point-a very important point-which I do not think has been referred to by either of the previous speakers, is the so-called 3 per cent penalty. I understand that the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) will say a little more about this matter, so I will leave the bulk of it with him, but I point out that in the Cross report some very persuasive comments were made about the 3 per cent penalty applied short of notional retiring age, particularly as it affects officers being removed. In fact, in the findings of the review and the Government's decisions, that matter has not even been commented on. I ask the Minister whether something is going to be done in relation to that 3 per cent penalty within the DFRDB area. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I do not think it is cheap politics for the honourable member for Farrer to raise the question of the high rate of resignations and discharges from the Defence Force over the last four years. These two Bills are very important pieces of legislation and they need to be understood more fully. As I said at the outset, they are very technical. I ask the Minister to recognise that whilst this legislation goes to the core of conditions of service it is not a total solution. I ask him to give some assurance that other initiatives will be taken in the conditions of service area as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to rise tonight to speak on the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill and the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill, particularly as they relate to superannuation and how it affects our defence personnel. I am particularly pleased that we have a bipartisan approach to these Bills, although the Opposition has made its comments. That is fair enough because the Opposition is always entitled to make its views known. I think it is good that both the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) and the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) have indicated the Opposition's support for these Bills now before the Parliament. As we saw recently in regard to our participation in the Gulf, a bipartisan approach in this place certainly goes a long way to improving debate-particularly when we look at the conflict we have had over the last few days and earlier today in the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased that a lot of these initiatives were recommended by the Cross report entitled Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force. I would like to endorse the earlier remarks of the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) about Mr Cross, who was a longstanding member of this place and well-respected not only in his local community but also amongst defence people. Mr Cross was always very aware of the needs of defence people as he had a large military base in his electorate of Brisbane. It is good that those recommendations have been recognised here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Superannuation is certainly a complex area. Those of us who have had experience in that field before certainly treat it as a complex area. Planning for people's retirement is not an area that should be taken lightly. Superannuation is a subject that we really need to think about in terms of how it will place us in our retirement years. Defence personnel, of course, need to have that information as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill does much to increase the benefits in pay and conditions for the men and women of our defence forces. In the superannuation area it is only right that our defence personnel are given the same flexibility and ability to save for a diverse range of retirement alternatives as their counterparts in civilian life. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only last week that we saw evidence in the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill 1991 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991 of the Government's intention to make superannuation a means whereby all Australians have independence with dignity in retirement. This will be achieved for defence personnel through the military superannuation and benefits scheme. Having the country's largest operational Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base in my electorate at Amberley, I am patently aware of the demands placed on defence members and their families. I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on legislation which further improves the benefits they rightfully deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is timely to put on record my appreciation for the 70 years of service the Royal Australian Air Force has given to Australia-service which was commemorated recently by way of several ceremonies around Australia, in particular in my electorate on the weekend. On a local level, I pay tribute to the administration and personnel of the Amberley RAAF Base in my electorate of Oxley-which celebrated 50 years of operations last year-who have played their part in this 70-year history of the RAAF. </PARA>
<PARA> As most honourable members would be aware, Amberley is home to two squadrons, Squadron No. 1 and Squadron No. 6, of F111 strike aircraft. Since the introduction of the F111 to the RAAF in 1973 it has proven to be a most versatile addition to our defence forces. With its swing wings and terrain hugging radar, the F111 can fly at supersonic speeds over land or sea to strike with great accuracy using the latest high technology weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> Amberley is by far the greatest employer in the electorate of Oxley, having some 2,800 personnel amongst its ranks. Once the immediate families are taken into consideration, this figure swells to about 10,000 people-a significant proportion of the population of the city of Ipswich. This proportion is even greater once the large number of civilians involved in the operations of the air base are taken into account-not to forget the employees of the Australian Construction Services who have a lot to do at the Air Force base as well. </PARA>
<PARA> What this figure tells us is that defence communities across Australia, such as those at Amberley, and the infrastructure in which the personnel at those bases work, need to have strong and committed support from the government of the day. Let us not forget though that behind the spending each year on things such as upgrades of aircraft, ships and munitions it is the defence families that constitute the real heart of our defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills before us build on the Government's recognition that defence families are every bit as much a part of the central community as they are of the defence community. That is something reflected in so many of the defence initiatives that have been implemented since this Government came to office in 1983. While the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill deals specifically with the area of superannuation benefits, it is important that we view this improvement in the context of the broader benefits picture, particularly the commitment of this Government to giving defence personnel just reward for their contribution to our national defence effort. While the Opposition persists in firing sporadic misguided outbursts at Government initiatives, I believe that there remains absent any genuine concern for the overall well-being of our defence personnel. In contrast, the Hawke Government has a record on which it can stand proud. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987, a special portfolio, separate from the main Defence portfolio, was established to look after the unique needs of defence personnel and their families. Since this time a wide range of substantial improvements in defence pay and overall conditions of service have come about. Changes to the taxation system implemented by the Government in this time have helped these initiatives to bring even greater rewards to service personnel in both salary and tax terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Up to 1 February this year, the smallest effective total increase in pay scales between $20,000 and $50,000 per annum, when considering direct wage rises and indirect benefits to the tax system, was just under 22 per cent. This compares with a consumer price index increase of 18.5 per cent for the same period. The Government has also addressed the problems associated with the mobility side of defence life faced by Australian Defence Force (ADF) families. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Housing Authority was established to provide commercial flexibility in managing defence housing, to reduce costs and to improve the maintenance of defence homes. Backing up its commitment, the Government will spend $1 billion on defence housing over the next 10 years. During the 1988-89 financial year alone, the Hawke Government spent $135m on defence housing, including repairs and maintenance. This compares with an average of $35m for the last five years of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The long term planning and consideration for Australia's defence families is evident in the plan of the Defence Housing Authority to take over, on a progressive basis, the leases of private houses which are rented by defence families, thereby alleviating these families' up-front costs such as security bonds. Other steps have been taken to help families. For example, to assist in the frequent transfers which occur in the ADF this Government established the family information network for defence (FIND), an initiative which has proved very popular. It provides a confidential, up to date, plain English version of personnel provisions and issues. In its first month of operation FIND received more than 1,000 calls, clearly reflecting the Government's recognition of the need to provide general information to allow individuals to better pursue their cases or to understand their rights. </PARA>
<PARA> This highlights the fact that, when it comes to having a genuine interest in the future of the ADF and its personnel, there has been a mix of policies implemented by this Government, which has best served and will continue to best serve the interests of our defence forces. It is with this strong background that we come to the extended benefits which will flow from the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill 1991. (Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that my colleagues have come in. We were not talking about the Broncos but about defence personnel. I am a bit disappointed that the Opposition is not adopting a bipartisan approach to this matter. I was very pleasant to Opposition members earlier. Perhaps I have learned a lesson. I was coming to some important points about the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill 1991. I will list some of the particular advantages to defence personnel of the military superannuation and benefits scheme (MSBS) compared with the Defence Force retirement and death benefits (DFRDB) scheme are as follows. A significant benefit is available to those who serve less than 20 years-as has been highlighted here today. Final benefits, for most retirees, can be taken wholly as a lump sum at age 55, while 50 per cent or more of this lump sum can be converted to a pension at favourable rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The retention benefit at the 15-year point provides a significant lump sum when it is needed most, without having to resign to get it, as occurs with DFRDB commutation. Members who leave the ADF and later rejoin are treated favourably, a particular advantage for female members who leave to raise a family-as the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) mentioned earlier. Members' contributions are invested in a fund. Like other superannuation funds, the return will depend on the performance of the fund. Members receive regular advice on the accumulation of their contributions plus interest. Additional contributions can be made if a member thinks fit. It is very important that we have this flexibility of contributions to the new MSBS fund. As with the DFRDB, long-serving members obtain a generous benefit compared with community standards. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's desire that no Defence Force member or their family be left not knowing where they stand with the new scheme, and for that reason has made available a comprehensive kit for Defence Force members. I compliment the Minister and his department on the preparation of that kit. It is certainly a quite intensive kit and I am sure it will be of great assistance to defence personnel in their making up their minds on what they need by way of future superannuation requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a special toll-free telephone number set up to serve as a handy first-up contact point for information members may need, which I am sure will be of a great assistance to our defence personnel as well. Both these measures will also be followed up by an intensive publicity campaign designed to assist members reach an informed decision on whether to transfer to the new scheme or to remain with the DFRDB scheme. Once the MSBS scheme commences, Defence Force members will have a full 12 months in which to decide the scheme that best suits them. </PARA>
<PARA> The MSBS will have two components-superannuation and a retention benefit. The superannuation component will provide a lump sum on leaving the ADF and will give members access to an income stream on retirement from the work force by providing them with a choice of a lump sum or pension at that time. It will also provide them with insurance cover in the event of invalidity, retirement or death. The retention component will provide a lump sum to long-serving members so that the ADF can retain its most experienced personnel. The payment, although part of the MSBS, will be quite separate from the MSBS superannuation benefits. The DFRDB scheme is effective in retaining personnel to the 20-year point and it achieves this by offering a commutation lump sum to those who resign with 20 years of service. However, as Government standards prevent new superannuation schemes paying commutable pensions to anyone under age 55, the MSBS cannot offer a commutable lump sum. </PARA>
<PARA> To counter this, and still make the Defence Force an attractive long term career path, the MSBS will pay a retention benefit and, unlike the DFRDB scheme, it will not be necessary to leave the ADF to receive the lump sum. These benefits will be calculated by offering a lump sum of one year's salary to all members on completion of 15 years continuous effective service. I am sure this particular initiative will be welcomed by all members of the Defence Forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Significantly, reflecting the Defence Force's recognition of the varied circumstances behind the requests for leave without pay, most periods of leave without pay where the member continues to continue to contribute to the MSBS will be counted towards that 15 years. The lump sum will be based on actual salary, including service allowance at the 15-year point. No other allowances will be included. Because the retention benefit is not a superannuation benefit and because it is paid in service, it will be taxed as income in the year received. Members who accept the retention benefit will have to give an undertaking to serve for another five years, at which time a medical certificate of fitness for further service will be required. </PARA>
<PARA> Those members who are within five years of their statutory retiring age at the 15-year point will be offered a retention benefit but it will be reduced in line with the amount of time left to serve. For example, a member who has four years to serve to statutory retirement age at the 15-year point will be offered a lump sum of four-fifths of one year's salary. A member who resigns, or who is discharged for disciplinary reasons, before completing the further service undertaking will have to repay part of the gross retention benefit. The amount to be repaid will be in proportion to the incomplete service undertaking. No repayment will be required if separation from the ADF is beyond the member's control; for example, on invalidity retirement, retrenchment or if the member dies. The MSBS has been designed to provide a more equitable range of benefits for all members of the ADF. Nevertheless, it still provides the greatest rewards for those who choose to make a career out of the Australian Defence Force. At the same time, it is a more flexible scheme for it will give members greater choice in the level of contributions they make, whether their benefits are paid as a lump sum or pension. </PARA>
<PARA> When members of the ADF leave the defence forces, they get paid a benefit from the MSBS and, unlike the DFRDB, this benefit will be paid no matter how long they have served. It is proposed that the benefit will be in two parts. The first comes from the members' own contributions plus the money they have earned in the investment fund. This will be paid as a lump sum when the person leaves the ADF. The second comes from the Government, which makes a contribution to the member's superannuation of three or four times the money contributed. The Government's contribution will not be invested in a fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the legislation, members pay a minimum of 5 per cent of their pay to the MSBS. However, they can pay up to 10 per cent of their salary if they seek a larger return on their contributions. I believe that this will be particularly welcomed by those in their later years who are coming towards the end of their career, as they can better afford to increase their benefits on a higher salary and their family commitments are much more limited. It will assist them greatly, I believe, in preparing for their retirement, giving them greater benefits in their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> As is reflected in all modern superannuation schemes, it is the Government's intention to make superannuation an attractive means of planning for one's retirement, so it is important that mild restrictions be placed on accessibility to contributions before a certain age. It is intended that this also be the case with the MSBS, with the Government's contributions to superannuation not being accessible until the member retires from the work force either at or after age 55. If members do retire before turning 55, the Government's contributions will be preserved until the actual age of 55. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, in line with the benefits offered to civilians taking up superannuation to give themselves greater independence in retirement, instead of taking the Government's share as a lump sum, members can decide to turn half or more into a more generous pension. The same condition applies to the 3 per cent benefit which is also paid by the Government. This benefit has been paid to members of the Defence Force since 1988 and will be invested in the same fund as the member's actual contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> Entitlement to the Government's contribution to superannuation is phased in over seven years. However, entitlement to the full amount of the 3 per cent benefit begins when members actually join the Defence Force. Entitlement to the Government's contribution of superannuation will be phased in over that period and the entitlements have been highlighted again today. </PARA>
<PARA> As my time has almost expired, I would like once again to compliment the Minister, his staff and the Department on the efforts they have put into this. It comes back, again, to the efforts of a whole range of people, including Manfred Cross, who was the chairman of the committee of inquiry. I believe, as I said earlier, that this issue should be considered in a bipartisan manner because our defence people work extremely hard. They put up with a lot of things in their working life and indeed there are many problems in their place of work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill and the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill. I have had some concerns expressed to me over the level of consultation which the Government has carried out in respect of these two pieces of legislation and I will deal with them shortly. What I want to say firstly is how important this legislation is to members of the Australian Defence Force and particularly to the members of the Survey Regiment in Bendigo, which is in the electorate I represent. That regiment has had a very long and colourful history in Australia, and has a very bold and brilliant future ahead of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Survey Regiment in Bendigo is located in the historic Fortuna Villa, which was once the home of George Lansell, the Quartz King of Bendigo, who made his fortune on the Bendigo goldfields last century-and it was not an insignificant sum; in fact, it was #3m during the 1880s. Comparing that with someone's wealth today, it is quite significant. The history of the Army Survey Regiment in Bendigo evolved from the Land Headquarters Cartographic Co., which was established in Melbourne in 1941 to meet World War II mapping requirements and moved to its present location in 1942. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1955 the Cartographic Co. became the Army Headquarters Survey Regiment and subsequently the Army Survey Regiment. The role of the regiment has essentially remained the same since World War II, except that emphasis is now placed on producing a digital topographic database from which topographic by-products are generated, rather than producing individual maps as was the case previously. I had the pleasure of inviting the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Farrer (Tim Fischer), to Bendigo and we visited the Army Survey Regiment recently. He was most impressed with the quality of the work which is being done at the Army Survey Regiment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposal to establish a new superannuation benefits scheme for defence personnel has come about over quite a period, and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) has been responsible for much of this work. My concern and the representations that I have had referred to me are in regard to the military superannuation and benefits scheme (MSBS) and the Defence Force retirement and death benefits (DFRDB) scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) was quite correct when he said that I was not a member of this House when the consultation with Defence Force personnel should have occurred. The seat was then held by an Australian Labor Party member and it is an indictment of him that many members of the Survey Regiment at Bendigo believed that the recommendations contained in this brochure had been passed by the Parliament and that the matter was a fait accompli. No consultation on the content of the package or the proposed legislation has occurred until this day; there has been consultation only on which scheme members of the Defence Force may elect to participate in. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's package added to that perception with all of the brochures contained in it. In fact, the message from the Chief of the Defence Force which was submitted in that package to defence personnel-even in the foreword-reads:</PARA>
<PARA> From 1 October 1991 until 30 September 1992 you will have the choice of remaining as a member of the DFRDB scheme or transferring to the new Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme (MSBS). </PARA>
<PARA>No mention was made of the Parliament having considered it, or members of the defence forces perhaps offering some input into whether the scheme was what they wanted or not, whether it was appropriate and whether they had the opportunity to put up some suggestions for possible amendments to the scheme. There may have been a need to have some input, and I am sure that they would have liked to have had an input into it. In fact, in all the little pamphlets there are questions and answers on the MSBS. One states:</PARA>
<PARA>On 1 October 1991 a new superannuation scheme, the MSBS will start. </PARA>
<PARA>Who said it will? It had not been through this Parliament. What about the members of the defence forces having some input into whether that scheme was what they wanted? Did the Government ever talk to them about it once this range of glossy brochures was sent out? Did it just say, `Well, here it is; here is the package. That is what you are going to get'?</PARA>
<PARA> I am not knocking the work that was done by the committee which was put together by the Minister. But surely the people who are to become the beneficiaries of that scheme and the participants in that scheme should have had some input and discussion when that brochure came out. They should have been able to contribute their ideas and outline what they wanted. I think that all the information that came out was couched in such terms. Is it any wonder that members of the Survey Regiment at Bendigo believed, in fact, that it was a fait accompli and the legislation had already been passed?</PARA>
<PARA> This is typical of the way this Government carries out what it believes to be its consultation processes. There were even people affected who were involved in financial advice areas. I have one advice dated March 1991 which presents a summary so members of the armed forces can compare the various benefits under the scheme and compare one with the other so they can get an idea of exactly what the two schemes entail and make a decision on which way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to another area where lack of consultation occurred and that was the date of commencement of each of the schemes and the date by which members of the DFRDB scheme would have to make a decision either to stay in the scheme they were in or elect to go into the MSBS. Why the hurry, I ask. I trust that the Minister will be able to answer the question. Why the hurry for the closing date for a decision on whether to join the MSBS or not, because both schemes will be running in parallel for as long as there are members remaining in the Force and wishing to remain in the DFRDB scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just prior to the dinner break I was discussing the merits of the legislation before the House and the impact that those two pieces of legislation would have on the Army Survey Regiment personnel in Bendigo. That organisation is at the leading edge of technology in Army terms and is an organisation which comprises 25 officers, 284 other ranks and 20 civilians. It does play an extremely important role in the affairs of the Defence Force, work which I have had the opportunity to witness and which I was most impressed with, as was the Deputy Leader of the coalition, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), on his recent visit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to see this role enhanced in the future with the allocation of the maps storage and distribution centre to the Bendigo area so that not only will those Army maps be produced and printed in Bendigo, but also they will in fact be distributed from there throughout Australia and the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I was indicating to the House that the two schemes-the MSBS scheme and the DFRDB scheme-will both run until every member of the Defence Force retirement and death benefits fund has received his total entitlement. In fact, if any confirmation of that is needed, it will be found in the second reading speech of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel when he indicated that the DFRDB scheme will last for many years as, when all existing contributors have retired, there will still be pensioners under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I question the need for people who have entered the Defence Force under the terms and conditions of that scheme to make a decision on 1 October or before September 1992 either to stay in that scheme or to go into the new scheme. Members of the Defence Force entered under a set of conditions of service which they quite correctly believed at the time would enable them to make a decision at the time of their choosing, not of the Government's choosing. They now find that they are being forced to make a decision in the next 18 months which will in fact affect their lives and the lives of their families-and not only their working lives, but also into their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government has not offered enough consultation to these people. I still have to be convinced of the necessity for them to elect to go, particularly when all the mechanics of that superannuation scheme, or the retirement benefits scheme which is in place, will run for many years, and in fact will apply only to the people who are serving in the defence forces at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone joining the defence forces, upon coming in after 1 October 1991 of course, will automatically go into the new scheme and will be aware that that is the only scheme that they can enter. They will not be able to get into the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme because that will be closed off to them, so they will know the rules of the game right from recruitment and right from induction into the defence forces. They will know what the acceptable superannuation scheme is to them and the terms and conditions of it. But the people who are in the existing scheme at the moment, of course, will have to make that decision now because they are being forced by the Government to make a decision one way or the other before September 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that, when the Government carried out its review of the superannuation schemes that the defence forces were acting under, it would have been an opportune time for it to review the Defence Force retirement and death benefits fund, because the underlying philosophy of the Army and defence forces at the moment is that it should be a young person's Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to highlight an anomaly which I believe exists under the DFRDB. If, for example, one were to enter the defence forces at 17 to 18 years, did 20 years service and retired between 37 and 38 years of age, one would be eligible for 50 per cent of one's funds as a lump sum, and the balance would be available as a fortnightly pension. Let us say that one decided to retire at 38, having attained the rank of major. The nominal retirement age for a major is 42 years and the compulsory retirement age is 45 years. If one retired at 42 years of age, one would be eligible for 35 per cent as a fortnightly pension but, if one retired at 38-four years earlier-one would lose 3 per cent per annum of that benefit, which would mean a loss of 12 per cent, in that instance, of that fortnightly benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are trying to encourage young people into the Defence Force, that is a very heavy penalty to pay should they choose to go out at an earlier age and seek some other form of employment in their career and in their working life. In fact, that condition does not apply to warrant officers. Non-commissioned ranks, in fact, do not have to meet that requirement at all. But a commissioned officer, a major, would suffer the penalty of the reduction of 3 per cent per annum for each year under 42 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, that does have an impact upon the men and women of the defence forces who are serving under the existing scheme, which is the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme. It has an impact upon their families and their children, particularly in these days with the cost of tertiary education. There is an impact upon their spouses and also on their future career prospects. I raise that issue particularly. </PARA>
<PARA> It is regrettable that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel is not at the table, but I am sure that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is at the table, will take up those queries I have raised. A number of the issues have caused me concern and have caused concern to the serving personnel within the Army Survey Regiment in Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> The first issue I raised was that the MSBS scheme was presented to this House and to defence personnel as virtually a fait accompli. Secondly, the dates of election for decision are apparently also a fait accompli. In other words, there is no area to manoeuvre or no opportunity for discussion so that defence personnel may negotiate a position there-either as to the dates of election to decide which scheme they will enter, whether they will remain in the Defence Force retirement and death benefits fund or whether they will in fact enter into the military superannuation and benefits scheme. Thirdly, I raised the anomaly of the 3 per cent penalty for commissioned officers under the DFRDB scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister at the table to bring these matters to the attention of the Minister between now and when this matter will be debated in the Senate. I know that our spokesman for defence personnel, Senator Jocelyn Newman, will be canvassing a number of other issues which quite properly should have been canvassed with the defence personnel before the Bill was presented to this House in the typical style of this Government-a fait accompli: `Here is what you are going to get and you are going to like it'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, wish to speak tonight in this cognate debate dealing with the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Like earlier speakers, and noting particularly the comments of the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) and the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), I am pleased to note a degree of bipartisan support for this legislation. Although both those honourable members sounded very pleased about that, and put it in the context of the bipartisan support for the Australian effort in the Gulf conflict this year, I remind them that we on this side of the House are always prepared to offer that sort of bipartisan support whenever the Government is prepared to accept our point of view. In fact, the Opposition often offers it in this place; yet ultimately it is only on very few occasions that we are able to come together. However, we agree substantially with the Government's treatment of service personnel in this instance, although I can point to many instances over the past 12 months and beyond in which treatment of them has not been as good as it could be. Government members said that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) had done a great job, but in my view there are many deficiencies and lots of ways in which conditions for serving personnel and their families could be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we are dealing here with a new superannuation scheme. The Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill effectively establishes a new, equitable scheme for the contribution of superannuation for Australia's regular defence personnel. The Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill effectively closes off the old scheme and provides for transfer arrangements from it to the new scheme for those personnel who are serving at the moment. As I said, I join with other members on this side of the House who have expressed their concern that the old scheme, with its inequitable provisions for short term members of the service, was able to continue for so long. I had direct experience of it during the time I was in the Army over 20 years ago, and I recall that during the years I served people were constantly pointing to deficiencies in the scheme. Yet here we are down the track-for me at least some 20 years later-finally coming to the point at which some action is being taken to come up with a superannuation scheme that really meets the needs of, and lives up to the standards expected by, the community in respect of superannuation for service personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> In a sense I suppose we are given some insight into the sorts of priorities the Federal Labor Government has in respect of service personnel by the fact that it has taken so long for the Government to rectify an obvious problem. I will put that in some sort of context in a moment. I suppose at this time, Australia just having had personnel serving in an active theatre of war in the Gulf, the spotlight has been placed very firmly on Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel. Honourable members on both sides of the House observed how well Australian service personnel served this country during that conflict, as they have done on so many other occasions. Once again we are extremely proud of them and I do not think we can do too much for them. Therefore I am very pleased to support a Bill which introduces a modern, attractive and, in some respects, generous superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who have been closely involved with the defence forces over the years and those of us who are currently members of the Returned Services League of Australia (RSL) and other groups know, as I have already alluded to, that the Government does not have a particularly good record when it comes to meeting the needs of those who served this country or who are currently members of our armed forces. Hardly a day goes by when most honourable members, whether they have direct service involvement or not, do not have veterans coming to see them in their offices. Those veterans are Defence Force personnel who have done a terrific job of serving Australia in a theatre of war, whether that be the Second World War-although some of them are even older than that and served in earlier conflicts-or the Vietnam War, in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> Visits from Vietnam veterans are very common. Those men have real and justified grievances about the treatment they are continuing to receive. Quite often, as I go in to bat for them-as I am always willing to do because I have great respect for returned service personnel-I find that the Government, notwithstanding all the tribunal mechanisms in place, is nevertheless not as generous as in my view it might be. I go to great pains to point out that I believe we should be bending over backwards to support those who have very often given so much to serve their country. However, as I mentioned earlier, this legislation, although long overdue, comes one step closer to redressing the imbalance between the treatment of Defence personnel in respect of superannuation and the treatment of the general community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill is almost entirely based on the recommendations of a report of June 1990 of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Review Committee, which was chaired by Sir William Cole. I pay tribute to Sir William Cole for the work he and his Committee did in that report. I found that document extremely interesting and very well researched with a significant number of appendices of various sorts. It covered very adequately the needs of service personnel in respect of their superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> The new military superannuation and benefits scheme, which will be in place once this legislation is adopted, has two main components: it has a superannuation component and, very importantly, it has a retention benefits component. Those two aspects of the scheme are extremely desirable. Sir William Cole's report pointed out that the former scheme, the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme (DFRDB) as it was known before, failed to meet either, as the report says, `the letter or the spirit' of the occupational superannuation standards which currently regulate all superannuation schemes in both the public and the private sector. In summary, the previous scheme fell a long way short of community standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference for the review which was carried out by Sir William Cole included:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to recommend changes to the DFRDB scheme or, if applicable, creation of a new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee, as we now see, subsequently decided upon examination of the Defence Force retirement and death benefit scheme that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is not possible to build a superannuation scheme on the foundations of the 1973 scheme which will serve the needs of both the ADF and members into the 21st century. </PARA>
<PARA>The major downfall of the old scheme was that while it provided in some respects generous benefits to those who had served for 20 years, nevertheless for those who resigned before the 20-year point there was no employer benefit payable and there was no return in the sense of interest payments on member contributions. Of course, that turned out in many respects to be completely inadequate, especially when one considers that the majority of serving personnel resigned before they had actually completed that 20 years of service. </PARA>
<PARA> In working in that fashion, the scheme did not provide incentives to personnel to stay on beyond the 20-year minimum required for a commutable pension. Figures I have seen suggest in fact that up to 40 per cent of those in the forces at that time retire upon reaching 20 years of service. If one looks specifically at some groups of service personnel-for example, the male component of non-commissioned ranks and others; that is, the non-officer ranks-one finds that 80 per cent of serving personnel do not go beyond 20 years service. </PARA>
<PARA> That in itself is a concern, but when we look at the new scheme, it is pleasing to note there will be strong incentives to people to serve on. The cost of training service personnel is absolutely enormous, and as personnel who have those years of service up are, in many respects, the most valuable members of the service, there ought to be some very strong in-built encouragement to them to stay on. That would be better than losing those trained and experienced personnel, and having to bear the cost of training new people recruited to fill vacancies. </PARA>
<PARA> As technology moves rapidly-we saw the end result of it in the Gulf war-the training costs will be commensurately higher and it will become more difficult to replace experienced people if they are not encouraged to stay on. So there is every reason why people should be encouraged to stay on in the forces and to serve for as long as they possibly can and as long as they are physically able, which is important as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole context of the review into the Defence Force superannuation scheme was outlined in the terms of reference of the Committee, which required that the Committee was to have particular regard to the nature of Defence Force employment. It was this aspect of the terms of reference that I was most interested to read and then, ultimately, to see the decisions that the Committee had made in the context of those particular terms of reference. As someone who has had the distinct privilege of serving as an Army officer, I am aware-as the report states-that the conditions of service in the ADF are designed to meet the needs of the Force and that these conditions of service differ substantially from those of the broader community. </PARA>
<PARA> All military personnel have vastly different lifestyles. I do not think that anyone who has not actually served, or at least been closely associated with military personnel, would have even the slightest understanding of how different it is from a family perspective and from a personal perspective to actually serve in one of the armed services. Each has its particular exigencies and difficulties. I always thought that at least in the Army one had the chance of being home reasonably often; but when I think of Navy personnel in the Gulf situation, I realise that they are away from home on ships for many months at a time, separated from their families. Some of our Navy personnel serving in the Gulf came home to children whom they had not seen before, born during the months that they were away at sea. </PARA>
<PARA> The report outlined a number of what it termed as the main characteristics of military service, or service in the Defence Force, not the least of which is the liability for combat operations. One does not join the forces without it being paramount in one's mind, or in the minds of one's family, that there is always the very real risk that one can be ripped apart from one's family to serve on active service. That is something that service personnel live with, it is something that they train for and it is something that they see as part of the job, but it makes them very special. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the years that they can be used on active service, and bearing in mind that they are limited, it becomes extremely important that the superannuation scheme or the retirement benefits that they will look forward to having at the relatively young retirement ages in place, which may be as young as 45-and being around that age, I know that one feels reasonably fit and able to go on--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Macquarie agrees that I am fit and well. At 45 years of age military personnel could be facing retirement. It is not easy to start off a new career at 45 years of age if they have been in the Force for 25 years. For that reason, it is important that superannuation benefits are generous. As the report by Sir William Coles notes, these military personnel are subject to a military discipline code which far exceeds anything that the average community would be used to having to contend with or live under. Both literally and metaphorically they have an extremely regimented way of life; they work long and irregular working hours when they are on duty; they have statutory retiring ages well below community norms; and they have a requirement for high standards of physical fitness. I talk to service personnel very often and they complain-I use that word loosely-about the frequent relocation and separation from family, and the fact that they rarely get the opportunity to put their roots down anywhere. They become a part of a community for a year or two and are then posted on to another area. They have to make new friends and, worse in some respects, their children have to make new friends and go to new schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All of these things add up to making service life difficult and sometimes harsh; therefore, there is every reason why we should be taking this particular action in the legislation of adopting a scheme for retirement and superannuation that makes service life bearable and gives service personnel something to look forward to in their retirement. These conditions are taken account of in the formulation of the latest scheme. As I said before, I am very pleased to commend the Committee for the work it does and to note that the drafting of the scheme takes account of the fact of what service life is really like. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the background of the former scheme, it is difficult to understand why it has taken so long for this Government-and, I suppose, implicitly, previous governments-to act earlier in respect of coming up with a scheme that was fair, equitable and attractive. In 1983 the then Minister for Defence announced a review of the DFRDB scheme. Before deciding on the form of a review, the Government commissioned a report by the Australian Government Actuary on the long term costs of the scheme. The Actuary reported in September 1984. But the Government did not proceed with the full scale review that we are dealing with tonight: it waited until 1987 before it announced a `limited examination' of the scheme's invalidity and the dependants' benefits scheme, with a view to obtaining greater equity in that scheme. That examination that was talked about in 1987 was still being carried out when the review committee was appointed in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Four issues prompted the examination that was still unresolved at the time of the review. Firstly, an unacceptable decline in the value of orphans' benefits; secondly, a perception that ADF widows were at a disadvantage compared to widows of members of the Australian Public Service; thirdly, the fact that widows are not entitled to a lump sum benefit; and, finally, the calculation of invalidity benefits on the basis that every member could have achieved 40 years service rather than the industry practice of determining benefits according to a member's actual salary plus the amount of service he or she could actually have completed by normal residence. Four years later these problems have been addressed by the new scheme. Whilst I was prepared to say-I am not holding back; I am being critical-that the Opposition was being bipartisan, it still makes me wonder why it took so long for these obvious inequalities to be fixed up. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the main problems with the introduction of a conventional superannuation scheme, in a non-military sense, was that there was a need to ensure that retention rates-we have already noted that they were extremely poor in many respects in the ADF-were not adversely affected. The Cole Committee found that the provision of a commutable life pension benefit to members in the DFRDB scheme had acted as an effective retention magnet, drawing members to serve from the 12-year point to the 20-year point. The occupational superannuation standards require that employer benefits are not to be paid to members of the scheme until after their retirement age or after the age of 55. This made the pension at 20 years service not permissible under the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The solution that the Committee came up with-in my view it is the correct solution-was the payment of a lump sum retention benefit, equal to one year's salary, offered upon completion of 15 years service. A number of conditions were to apply for the payment of that particular retention benefit. It is anticipated that this will help maintain the numbers serving 20 years. As I said earlier, I believe it is very important that the scheme does that. It will curb the large resignations at 20 years which have resulted under the old scheme, where benefits were available only if one left the Force. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports this legislation. We ask: why has it taken so long? It is widely supported by military personnel, it is supported without very many major reservations by the RSL and, personally, I am sure that it is better now than never. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased that I am able to be here tonight to speak in this debate on the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill and the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill, which are two very important Bills. I am very pleased from the point of view that within my electorate I have a substantial number of military bases, not the least being the largest transport base in Australia-the Richmond Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base, which has about 3,000 members of the forces staffing it. I have the operational headquarters of the RAAF at Glenbrook, just on the boundary of my electorate. I have Nirimba, the Royal Australian Navy apprentice training centre, at one end of my electorate and I also have as part of my electorate the St Marys munitions factory and a number of Army units. Every year in August the largest gathering of Vietnam veterans in their annual parade takes place at Springwood, which is the centre of my electorate. It has become the premier Vietnam veterans get-together occasion in the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just recently, I had the privilege of being part of the group that welcomed home the medical people from the Gulf. I must commend the staff of Richmond RAAF base, particularly Air Commodore Stan Clarke, the officer in charge, and Group Captain Paul Rasmussan who, at very short notice, were able to put together a welcome home that was worthy and fitting for those people who served so well in the Gulf from the medical support point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> It is encouraging to see that the Government has made a major effort to make sure that our forces, from the Navy or wherever, who rendered services in the Gulf, have been given a very fitting return home welcome. The morale of the base at Richmond, which has been a bit low on and off-I have drawn this to the attention of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) who is at the table-because of the lack of Government attention to the very important needs of our defence forces, was given a tremendous boost in the last week by the fact that at least one of the new tankers was able to be commissioned. The 707 tankers that the RAAF has been able to fit out have been resoundingly successful and a great credit to the people who are responsible for converting these aircraft and also to those who fly them. The reports are that they have been 100 per cent successful, so I congratulate all those concerned at the base with that particular project. I hope that all the money that is required for the completion of the other two-there are four altogether-will be forthcoming at an early date so that the whole fleet will be available in the event of emergencies such as confront us from time to time with regard to refuelling our fighters and so on. I hope it will not be long before we are able to equip these tankers with the appropriate booms to refuel our F111s because the current fit-outs only allow the refuelling of the F18s. I hope the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) will make sure that this is done expeditiously. </PARA>
<PARA> A military force has been defined as `a body of men gathered together to correct the mistakes of politicians'. Tonight we are actually seeing the reverse of that. We have a group of politicians together to correct the mistakes done to the military. I am very pleased, as have been all other members who have spoken tonight from both sides of the House, to come in here and support this legislation. I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of what many have said is long overdue legislation related to the improved superannuation benefits of our military defence forces which will be implemented from 1 October this year. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important features of this legislation is that it provides equitable treatment for the members of the Defence Force who have served for less than 20 years. In the past those who have not met the 20-year criterion under the Defence Force retirement and death benefits (DFRDB) scheme have been penalised. Under the present Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme, these members receive only a refund of their contributions when they leave the Defence Force. That has been going on for years and years and it is quite unacceptable. They receive no interest on their contributions and no employer benefits except for the 3 per cent productivity benefit. This is contrary to community standards. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go into all the details of the Bills before us because I know that Minister has provided every member of the Defence Force-and I commend him for this-with a very comprehensive booklet that explains in minute detail the workings of the new superannuation scheme that will be available to them after 1 October. As I will mention a bit later on, I am also glad that the consultation areas have been put into place so that individual members will be able to seek personal help. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the military superannuation and benefits scheme members will have returned to them not just their contributions but also whatever those contributions earn in the MSBS investment fund and they will accrue an entitlement to a substantial employer benefit in addition to the 3 per cent benefit that they are getting. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important feature of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill is that it provides a retention benefit payable to certain members who complete 15 years continuous full time service and undertake to serve for another five years. This benefit is equal to one year's salary and is taxable. It is a very welcome part of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing DFRDB scheme does not comply with occupational superannuation standards at all and is not an acceptable scheme by today's standards. However the MSBS, as has been indicated many times already, meets all the occupational superannuation standards. The new scheme appears to be an excellent scheme, very much on a par with the new public sector scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I applaud any legislation or benefit that will encourage our defence personnel to serve longer terms, given the appalling resignation rate that has been taking place over the past few years and which is currently of great concern to the coalition. I have repeatedly expressed in the House my concern over the number of resignations from our defence forces and the very low morale that has existed on and off over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the figures since this Government came to power in 1983-I do not bring them up in any supercritical way, but it is important to look at them-when the total of separations was 6,485 in that year. That figure rose steadily to a peak of 9,279 in 1989 and dropped to 8,156 in 1990. In situations such as this I believe in the saying that we have to `praise loudly and blame softly'. I think it is important that we remind the Government of these areas of concern and of the fact that there has been a bit of dilatory behaviour on its part in getting this to this very important stage tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Another disturbing set of figures is the total service personnel in the Australian defence forces. In 1979, the total personnel was 70,198 and in 1989 it was 70,582-almost no growth rate in a country with a growing population and whose defence needs are of vital importance. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose it is comforting that the figure has not dropped any further. It is ominous that there is a lot of talk at the moment about the tremendous cutbacks in actual service personnel and the suggestion that these men and women will be replaced by civilians. This is causing defence personnel a lot of worry because they are not convinced that some of the activities proposed to be handed over to civilians will be the right ones to hand over. Certain aspects of security and refuelling and so on need to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the figures for the past 12 years we observe that the only time the rate of separation decreases is at a time of recession. The trend appearing today, where we have a drop from 1989 figures to 1990 figures, would indicate that fact. I believe it is a sad indictment of the Government when our defence personnel choose to remain in the services for job security only and are not encouraged to stay on for the right reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other areas in which I believe there ought to be an inquiry is that of postings. Being in an area which has a large base and a large number of RAAF personnel, I am regularly confronted by people who are having difficulty coping with the postings situation. I am not suggesting that each and every case is a meritorious one in terms of the attention it needs. There are occasions when people just do not want to leave; they have established for themselves a comfortable lifestyle in the district and it is inconvenient for them to do so. I come across, more often than I think I ought, members of the Defence Force who have very legitimate grievances on the way their postings have been handled. I mention that almost in passing. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day I was alarmed when a headline in the Sydney Morning Herald of 21 March read, `Richmond may go in RAAF shake up'. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Richmond RAAF base may be closed and 7,000 jobs cut or given to civilians in a major reorganisation of Australia's air force. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not suggesting that those 7,000 jobs are coming from Richmond, but that was part of the news item on that day. Of course many of those jobs will be lost from the Richmond RAAF base. The report went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>Some service officers are concerned that permanent damage will be done to Australia's military capability by the proposed changes, without any real debate about the alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA>A disturbing aspect of the report was that the Government neglected to consider the effects of its decision on the people. We all know that the human factor cannot be ignored. A number of speakers have mentioned tonight and this afternoon that there has not, it appears, been enough consultation on some of the recent decisions that have been made with regard to the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> People join the Defence Force for a career and job security and they now find that the Government may be about to axe 7,000 of them. Is it any wonder that morale has reached a fairly low level in our defence forces? I know that this is the case from my weekly discussions with many members of the various defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the legislation before us today. As I said earlier, I will support any legislation that will improve the lot of our defence personnel. It is important that, when we consider this legislation, all Defence Force members receive individual consultation on what is best for them for their future regarding the transfer option. I mentioned earlier in my speech that this was one of the commendable aspects of the Minister's implementation of this very important piece of legislation. The Opposition recommends that we support the passage of this legislation, which is based almost entirely on the recommendations of Sir William Cole's report of June 1990. That report and the Minister's implementation of its recommendations is more than welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by commending the Government and the Minister on bringing these Bills before the House and for the fact that this has been done on the basis of the recommendations of the report, almost in their entirety. They have been greeted with a lot of pleasure and acceptance from the defence forces throughout Australia, and particularly by people in my electorate who have mentioned their satisfaction with the superannuation scheme now being offered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-In summing up the debate, perhaps I should begin by thanking those who have contributed to the debate on these very important pieces of legislation-the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill and the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill. While I was not able to be in the House for much of the time, through the marvels of modern communication I was able to follow much of what was said. I agree with a lot of what has been said. I endorse, in particular, the complimentary remarks made by most speakers about the job done by the committee of inquiry, Sir William Cole, John Cardon and a retired major-general, Derek Deighton. They did a wonderful job. The fact that the Opposition is supporting these Bills, and with very little in the way of cavilling about their provisions, is an indication that the job the committee did was very thorough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is in that context that I would like to take up points that were made by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), and perhaps by other speakers in the debate, about the degree of consultation that took place. On behalf of the review committee, and indeed the Government, I say that those criticisms seem to me to be peculiarly ill-founded. There was most extensive consultation with the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and its individual members. As evidence of that, the advertisements which were placed in all major newspapers attracted some 767 written submissions. The review committee toured all major ADF bases and spoke, I understand, to well over 1,000 personnel. It had extensive liaison with the Chiefs of Staff Committee, as I know because I was in on the latter part of that. Of course, it also consulted with the major interest groups, including the Returned Services League, the Regular Defence Force Welfare Association and the Armed Forces Federation of Australia. It seems to me an odd criticism, and an unfounded one to make, that the review committee did not consult extensively and indeed that that process will not continue as we approach the implementation phase. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a provision of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill that a large sum of money-from recollection over $4m-has been set aside for an information effort designed to give real substance to the undertaking by the Government that every member of the ADF will have all the facts at his or her command before he or she is called upon to elect either to stay in the existing scheme or transfer to the new military superannuation and benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps in that context I ought to mention another objection which I heard raised in the debate, namely, the supposed need to have an expiry date for transferees. The Government feels-I do not believe that there is any objection within the ADF to this either-that 12 months is sufficient time to communicate to people the information which is necessary before they decide to make the election either to stay with the Defence Force retirement and death benefits (DFRB) scheme or go into the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that if there were an open-ended transfer arrangement there would also need to be an open-ended communication campaign. It would be expensive. I am certain that within 12 months that information campaign will be effective. It embodies some quite innovative concepts. Every individual member of the ADF will receive a package which will enable him or her to put in information about his or her own particular situation and to work out whether it is best to transfer or not. </PARA>
<PARA> I think those are the main points of criticism which have been raised so far as the Bill is concerned. I guess that I would have more to do with actual members of the ADF than any other member of this House, but I do not hear those criticisms when I go around the bases and I think that those who have raised them do so as much out of ignorance of the Bill and how its proposals are being received than anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not like to conclude without saying a couple of other things. Firstly, some complimentary remarks were made about Manfred Cross, the former member for Brisbane, and his work in relation to this legislation. In that context, I should widen those compliments to embrace the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, a committee for which I still have fond affection and which in many ways was the genesis of at least the need to review the old DFRDB scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> A second and quite personal thing is that Major-General Deighton, a former member of the review committee, is at present seriously ill in Melbourne. I think that all members of this House would want me to pass on their best wishes for a speedy recovery and for fortitude in the difficult times that lie ahead for him. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have much to say in summing up the debate except again to thank those who participated in it and to assure them that the confidence which both the Opposition and the Government have placed in the measures embodied in this Bill is well founded. In that context I want to refer to the remarks of the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), who has just resumed his seat, about morale in the ADF. Morale in the ADF is, I would say, extremely high at the present time and will become higher as a result of the moves towards greater professionalism in the ADF which this Government will be making and announcing in the next couple of months. </PARA>
<PARA> This part of the improvement to conditions of service will be a large element of that. This Government has set itself to improve conditions across the board for serving members of the ADF and retired members of the ADF, and this is very much a part of that effort. From the fact that, over the last decade, our resignation rate from the ADF has been historically low and our recruitment rates have been historically high, I know that people are voting with their feet, and they are voting for beneficial changes of the kind embodied in this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 30, page 11, lines 36 to 38, omit `if the member has become subject to a return of service obligation after the commencement of the first-mentioned period', substitute `if, at the time when, or at any time after, the benefit becomes or became payable, the member is, or was, subject to a return of service obligation. </PARA>
<PARA>I dare say that the Committee would appreciate an explanation of this amendment, which simply puts into the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill a termination date. The period of service for which a member is paid the retention benefit-which applies after 15 years of service, provided the member is prepared to sign up for another five years-is described in the Bill as the `period of prospective service' and that is defined in subclause 30(1), to which I have just referred. Subparagraph (a) (i) of the definition provides a delayed starting date for the commencement of the period of the prospective service in the case of members who at the commencement of this period are already bound under the Defence Act 1903, the Naval Defence Act 1910 or the Air Force Regulations to render a return of service in respect of a particular course that they have undergone, a period of training or whatever. But the definition does not provide a correspondingly delayed finishing date and the proposed amendment rectifies this omission. </PARA>
<PARA> I can put that into English: many serving members of the Australian Defence Force incur what is termed in the ADF a ROSO-a return of service obligation-because they have had a period of overseas service, training or whatever it may be. If they do a training course that lasts three years, they may be required to serve for three years plus one year to return that service obligation. Under this Bill there is a return of service obligation, as it may be called, for signing up for the year's salary at 15 years to serve for another five. We took into account the starting date, but we did not actually say in the Bill that there should be a delayed ending date to take account of that additional return of service obligation. That is what it amounts to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I understand the submission of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) about the return of service obligation, I think one aspect of the changes that concerns us on this side is the suggestion that there will be, as a result of decisions about to be taken within the Australian Defence Force, a number of premature retirements. To what degree the return of service obligation will apply to them in whatever new structure might be adopted within the Reserve forces is, of course, a matter of policy statements yet to be made. But there is a worry. While I would wish that the Minister's comment that the morale of the forces is high were true, sadly the uncertainty that has been engendered by various statements about restructuring and about the present force structure proposal suggests that there are going to be fundamental changes. Without doubt, this very measure, which relates to return of service obligations and the degree to which those who have been in the regular forces are going to have an obligation to return and to serve within whatever new requirement might be given to the Reserve forces, could well be part of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say, therefore, to the Minister that, while we on this side of the House note his observations, our concern would be that those who might be affected by any force structure change are not left in a disadvantageous position because of any new arrangements that might be set in place. The Minister himself would be aware that at this time, with somewhat higher unemployment, recruitment to the services is much higher than it was and retention is higher than it was. I am concerned that, on the basis of an economic goal which might be generally supportable, there will be changes in the structure of the forces. I would hope that the Minister does not believe that, simply because a changed superannuation requirement and entitlement has now been put in place, there will be complete contentment within the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> It is more by way of a cautionary admonition than a necessary objection to this amendment that I raise this point, but there is within the armed forces a genuine concern at the consequences of change that might be envisaged-a worry that, in the nature of obligations of the Reserve force, many might be worse off than they were before. While I know the Minister's good intent, I trust that in the advocacy within Cabinet he has in mind whatever consequences or implications there could be of the force structure review. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I obviously do not need to respond, I would like to because I think the points that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) raises are legitimate ones. There is indeed a certain amount of uncertainty about the prospective changes. The Government has made no secret of the fact that we want to see a more professional, a more efficiently administered, Australian Defence Force (ADF), one which relies, to a considerably greater extent, on civilian support for functions which are presently carried out by the military in a more expensive way. But the objective in doing that is to enhance the capability of the ADF; it is not to make savings. That has been made extremely clear. What has also been made clear is that the intention is to use savings to enhance capability rather than bolster any surplus that we might be aiming at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That having been said, however, the need to treat in a sensitive way people whose career expectations may change will be very much borne in mind in the Government's administration as those changes are made. Bear in mind that these changes have not yet been properly considered and agreed to by the Government and certainly have not been announced. I am certain that against that background it will be our wish to treat sensitively those members. Also bear in mind that these changes will not happen in 10 minutes; they will be phased in over a number of years. I feel confident in saying that. In a service which is, in effect, a young person's service there is now a healthy rate of renewal. Within the context of, say, a 10 per cent resignation rate each year, which is about what I think any sensible administrator would aim for in a body such as the ADF, there is more scope to deal with people as time goes on than there is in a more static force structure. I know that the right honourable member was not addressing himself to this particular amendment, which is rather a technical though straightforward one, but I give him the assurance that the changes that will be made will be administered with sensitivity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition has no objection to the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991 being debated cognately. The changes proposed under the rather innocuous and bland titles of these two Bills essentially represent the end of the old protectionist era in Australia. After years of debate, the arguments against protection of one sector at the expense of another or more efficient sector, and indeed ultimately at the cost of those who are supposed to gain, seem at least to have won the day-at least, this day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last few months we have heard much in this House from various Government members about who has actually brought that about. At this stage it is worth reminding honourable members that this debate has been going on for some years. Certain organisations, including certain farming organisations, have been at the leading edge of that debate. They realised many years ago that if somebody is being protected in this country, then someone else in this country is paying for it. There are now not too many who will argue that protection against imports has served Australia well. These days even the manufacturers concede this. Efficient exporters who have been forced to pay higher costs for inputs and factors of production have been penalised. The manufacturing sector has become fragmented and inward oriented. Nor is it a coincidence that the sector is dominated by foreign interests, which have in the past set up here presumably to help themselves behind the tariff walls. The ultimate cost of this has appeared to be, and probably has been, a great loss of jobs, especially well paying jobs, and ultimately lower living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> As we know, the Industry Commission estimates that the removal of protection will increase national income by about $4 billion a year. I suspect that this is a conservative estimate. The major benefit to producers of lower protection will be the radical change in attitudes as producers are compelled to meet the market requirements. However, whilst the coalition agrees with the general thrust of the Government's proposal in these two Bills-indeed, the coalition set the agenda last year when it called for phased reductions of all industry protection to, at most, negligible levels by the year 2000-it believes that the Government has failed completely to deliver on the other side of the reform ledger. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has broken its commitment to industry to tackle other reform areas which would ensure cost reductions and give industry a chance on world markets. The 12 March statement, for example, effectively ignored waterfront and transport reform. It did not deal with industrial relations reform. It proposed only marginal reductions in the indirect tax burden on business. Stung, I suppose, by industry's outrage at this omission, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has been forced at least to pay lip-service to some areas of reform. The trans-Tasman shipping agreement which stultifies car exports to New Zealand is an example. However, industry has heard all this talk before, and it does not believe many of the Government's promises. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), has actually signalled retrograde action to remove common law and secondary boycott remedies against unjustified industrial action. This is an extraordinarily retrograde step. Clearly, the Government is also becoming nervous about the implications of the recent Troubleshooters judgment and, it seems, is possibly considering action to plug that `loophole' which allows individual choice should the decision be upheld. To the extent that there are any Government initiatives in the industrial relations area, they will be seen to be taking us backwards. </PARA>
<PARA> Rail reform proposals are foundering and waterfront reform is progressing at a snail's pace. This failure to deliver the micro-economic reform which everyone now agrees must take place-one cannot even get an argument about it-coupled with what Senator Button said last week when he described Australia as being in deep recession, will mean that thousands of enterprises faced with lower assistance will not be able to meet the challenge of increased international competition and will simply close their doors, whether they are potentially efficient or not; the reason being, of course, that it seems the Government does not intend to deliver the reforms necessary to keep those doors open. </PARA>
<PARA> Manufacturing has been hit hard by this recession. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that 48,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in the three months since December 1990. The Australian Chamber of Manufactures predicts that this number will at least be doubled by the end of the year. Some 11,000 jobs have been lost in the textile, clothing and footwear sectors alone. I doubt that anyone would claim that all these jobs and all these businesses that are either contracting or closing down are inefficient. Senator Button has acknowledged that many of these businesses are good. How anybody can cope with interest rates that have been running at retail levels of over 20 per cent for most of the last five years, I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it is possible for businesses to be so profitable that they can pay these sorts of retail rates, make a profit, pay tax and still have something left over to repay principal. Of course, what has happened to many of these businesses is that they have been accumulating debt and rolling interest into further debt, until finally the end has come when a recession, such as the one we have now, turns up causing their markets to disappear. These same businesses are expected by the Government to cope with further cuts in assistance, without any guarantee from Government to address the impediments they must confront every day. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia says that we have arrangements in place in Australia today which mean that we pay between 20 per cent and 50 per cent more than our overseas competitors for coastal shipping, construction costs, international shipping, waterfront services, rail transport, international shipping, international aviation, road transport, post and telecommunications, electricity supply and water. One almost runs out of breath reading out the list and that list is not exhaustive. For instance, the list ignores the pervasive cost of centralised industrial relations arrangements which, according to the Business Council, means that productivity in Australian enterprises is, on average, 25 per cent below their overseas counterparts. It ignores high interest rates and the cost of delays and uncertainty in the environmental approval procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> So by taking away protection unilaterally and failing to guarantee to address these other impediments at the same time, the Government has helped in the process of making Australia potentially a less attractive place to do business. Therefore, worthwhile as those protection cuts may be, and are, for the reason that I outlined at the outset, the fact is that if we want a strong manufacturing sector in this country we must do more than simply cut tariffs. Just as we found out that deregulation of the currency in combination with a centralised wages system could spell disaster, so too the introduction of a competitive product market without giving producers the means to compete could be less than successful. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why the coalition is committed absolutely to reducing industry protection, at the same time as implementing those comprehensive micro-economic reforms. Done together, the gains to the community will be maximised. On the other hand, the Government's one-sided approach seems to us unnecessarily to be making the going tougher here than anywhere else. The costs will be very tangible in lost investment, fewer job opportunities and lesser wealth creation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking on the brighter side, the pressure on this Government to tackle these problems will intensify. That has happened since the industry statement. Industry will demand much lower inflation; it will demand genuine competition in the labour market; it will demand more efficient transport and telecommunication services, and so on. Industry knows only too well that the benefits from such reform, on current estimates, are of the order of $40 billion extra dollars of Australian income each year. That would far outweigh any perceived benefits from industry assistance at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, as I have said on a number of occasions, I think that a major unintended consequence of the 12 March statement will be the end of the centralised wage fixing system as we know it; the end of its influence throughout every sector of the economy. The system supported by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is at the table, will go as an unintended consequence of the 12 March statement. The Minister may not agree, but the fact is that in an increased competitive environment we are now getting to the situation where it is illogical for third parties to make decisions which influence the rewards for people in workplaces, which they have never even seen and, in many cases, have no chance of understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, to rely on industry to eke out reforms from an unwilling Government which has lost its nerve or to devote valuable resources to contrive a way through the obstacles seems to me to be an unnecessary, tortuous and costly approach. In any case, it will take too long. Meanwhile the dollars will be flying elsewhere. The longer it takes to extract reform from the Government, the greater the risk that increasingly frustrated manufacturers will demand new forms of assistance. We do not want this; in fact, I do not think any of us in this chamber-there may be one or two-wants that. An increasingly desperate Government might just buckle at the pressure. The proposed citric acid bounty which was debated in this place last week set an unwelcome precedent along these lines. One could not blame the manufacturers if they felt that this was an easier route than getting the Government to agree, for example, to genuine enterprise-based industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> So whilst the two Bills before the House mean the import protection battle for the time being at least has been won, the Government's failure to tackle micro-economic reforms increases the risk that the war on Government assistance will not be. Because of it, the economy could be doubly cursed. I am not saying that the Minister is not attempting to do something, but I am putting it to him that we in Australia, in an international comparative sense, are failing. The Minister, for his part on his side of the House, is in charge of that failure. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with the major provisions of the Bills, first let me turn to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill-which implements, amongst other things, general tariff reductions announced by the Government on 12 March. The coalition supports the proposed general reductions to bring virtually all manufacturing tariffs to 5 per cent by July 1996. This is in line with our announcement last year to reduce all industry protection to, at most, negligible levels by the end of the century. I stress again, however, that our commitment included an equally absolute commitment to tackle micro-economic reforms so that industry would be given the opportunity to meet the challenge of lower industry assistance, and I shall be moving a second reading amendment, which is being circulated, urging the Government to reconsider its unbalanced approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian industry deserves at the very least an even chance. This Bill also implements announced tariff reductions for the automotive and textile, clothing and footwear (TCF) sectors. Broadly speaking, the automotive sector tariff will be phased down from 35 per cent in 1992 to 15 per cent by the year 2000. In the TCF sector, quotas will be abolished two years ahead of schedule and the tariff level applying by the year 2000 will be 25 per cent for most clothing, 15 per cent for footwear and fabrics and 10 per cent for footwear parts and certain non-quota goods. The coalition does not oppose these reductions but, whilst we do not, I wish to make it clear that our preference is to remove all special industry arrangements by the end of the century; in other words, these two sectors should receive the same level of assistance as the rest of manufacturing industry by 2000, given that we will introduce the much needed micro-economic reforms before then. </PARA>
<PARA> I am convinced that participants in the car industry, for example, appreciate that whatever level of tariff protection they receive-and they have told me this many times-their industry will not stand a chance without these reforms. The industry's joint submission to the Industry Commission inquiry made this point very clearly. At the moment Australia is ranked third last as a destination for investment in the car industry. It is just above Brazil and Mexico. Japan, Germany, the United States, Taiwan, Canada, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and Korea score above us. With the 34 per cent or 35 per cent annual turnover in the motor car industry, what could one expect? It is a quite disgraceful set of circumstances. In fact, I am surprised that the industry does as well as it does with that level of turnover. So, if tariffs are to be cut without further comprehensive micro-economic reforms, we will slide further down this list-if there is any further to go. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, if we really were to address these economy-wide impediments, it is estimated Australia could improve its ranking to third place behind Japan and Germany. That must be worth having a go at; it must be worth making an attempt to get ourselves up the ladder into a position as healthy and positive as that would be. The chief executives of two of the major car companies have told me they could fix their labour cost disadvantage problems if they had the means to deal directly with their work forces without outside interference. The Industry Commission tells us that transport reform alone would increase the industry's output by more than 4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I am almost sure that the situation for textiles, clothing and footwear would be similar, although I acknowledge that that sector will require more restructuring than the car industry. I commend the car industry for struggling with its problem over the last few years and, as many people know, it has already undertaken a good part of that task. So in these two sectors the coalition considers that by failing to attack those reforms the Government is badly letting down those sectors and it is also letting down the economy and Australian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> We could have faster reduction in protection; we could have stronger industries and lower prices simultaneously, but it seems this country under this Government has rejected this option. On a brighter note, the Government has adopted the coalition's proposal to freeze the developing country preference rate for the so-called newly industrialised countries-Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Korea. Their preferential rate will be frozen. As the general tariff rate falls, the preference margin will also fall until it reaches zero, and the general tariff rate will then apply to these countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill also implements the proposed TCF import credit scheme, which is a somewhat less generous version of the automotive industry's export facilitation scheme. This Bill establishes the by-law to allow duty free entry of goods under the scheme. It is not the lack of generosity that we are criticising, but we know the distortions that such a scheme creates. We have said before in this place that we support the facilitation arrangements in the car industry only because we know that, as the tariffs come down, so will the benefit of facilitation. The coalition will be moving an amendment to delete this new by-law because we, as a matter of principle, oppose the extension of export credit schemes beyond the car industry. The only reason we accept continuation of export facilitation in that industry is that it is there, as I said just now, and it will come down as tariffs come down; and it would be too disruptive to withdraw it now. </PARA>
<PARA> I will expand on the reasons for our amendment in the committee stage of this Bill but I would point out that many commentators have pointed to the Industry Commission's recommendation for the continuation of export facilitation in the car industry as a general endorsement of the whole concept. In my view, this interpretation is wrong. The Commission was at pains to point out that, in principle, it opposed such schemes because they created distortions between industries and its recommendation was simply based on the fact that to change arrangements at the same time as the tariff was being phased down would be too disruptive-but no doubt I will have an opportunity to explore these arguments further at a later stage in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Other changes in this Bill include expanded duty free provisions for importation of capital equipment, which the coalition supports. We also support a range of other proposed changes for duty free importation of aluminised steel used in the manufacture of automotive muffler exhaust systems, and the duty free entry of wheelchairs, defibrillators and heart pacemakers, printed circuit boards, and machine tools and parts for working advanced materials. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill essentially complements the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, implementing certain proposed reductions in textile bounty rates to zero by 1995. The Bill also extends the metal working machine tools and robots bounty until 1997, with bounty rates progressively phased down to 5 per cent by 1996. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition supports the extension of the bounty at reducing rates, as this is consistent with our policy of gradual, predictable reductions in industry protection. Coverage of the computer bounty is to be extended to incorporate local production of printed circuit boards. We do not oppose this change, firstly, because bounties are less distorting than tariffs and, secondly, because the increased costs of the bounty will be accommodated by a one percentage point reduction in the bounty rate. The Bill also proposes to insert into each of the bounties already mentioned, plus the book bounty, a minimum threshold level under which the bounty will not be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Government will be moving deletion of the proposed increase in the book bounty threshold because this change would result in a major dislocation in the industry. The coalition welcomes this belated recognition of the effect on this industry at least. We will also, however, be moving an amendment to delete insertion of minimum thresholds in each of the five remaining bounties because the coalition does not believe that the size of an operation indicates its efficiency. If we are going to provide a bounty, surely to ex-communicate somebody from the benefit by reasons of his smallness seems quite illogical and not commercial. We have given this matter serious consideration, after discussions with the Minister's office and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. However, we remain of the view that removal of bounty to small operators could reduce the amount of competition in these industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, as I indicated at the outset, the coalition will not oppose these Bills and, indeed, we recognise their significance in bringing to an end the very costly protectionist era in this country. Regrettably, however, the Government is taking a most disruptive and unnecessarily costly approach to achieve this by not tackling the economy-wide reforms. Honourable members will hear those words and sentiments spoken all over this country day by day, hour by hour. It is not merely for us to stand up here and say it without support. It is absolutely universally felt around business as more and more people understand what will happen to them when one side of the ledger only is brought about. Therefore, as I have already outlined, to the motion that the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill be read a second time I will be moving an amendment calling on the Government to change its approach. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating two Bills cognately tonight-the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. There is also an amendment that I oppose totally which was foreshadowed by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), the shadow Minister for industry and commerce. I will speak on that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Basically the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill has four general categories-that is, amendments to the three textiles, clothing and footwear bounties; amendments to the metal working machine tools and robots bounty; amendments to the computer bounty to widen its coverage to include printed circuit boards which will be offset by a slight reduction in bounty rates over the life of the bounty; and amendments to five bounties to introduce minimal annual production threshold levels before bounty may be claimed and an amendment to one bounty to increase the minimum claim level. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the idea is to help create a more internationally competitive textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) sector. The textile yarn bounty will be phased from 30 per cent value-added on 1 July 1992 to zero by 1 July 1995 and replaced by a 5 per cent tariff; the bed sheeting bounty will be extended to 30 June 1995 without review, but will phase down from 16c per square metre on 1 July 1992 to zero by 1 July 1995; and the bounty on textile printing will phase down to zero by 1 July 1995. The amendments to the Bounty (Metal Working Machines and Robots) Act 1985 provide for the continuation of bounty assistance for local production of certain machine tools and robots from 1 July 1991 to 30 June 1997. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there are amendments to the computers bounty. The amendments to the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 provide for the widening of the computer bounty to include local manufacture of printed circuit boards from 1 July 1991 and, at the same time, the tariff on imported printed circuit boards is being made free. There are also amendments to minimum annual thresholds. The total in the bounty Bill in regard to the financial impact is a savings for the period 1992-95. As a result of the accelerated phase-down in bounty rates for the three textile yarn bounties, it is approximately $56m at current prices. The proposed amendments extending the machine tools and robots bounty beyond this financial year are expected to result in an overall cost to 1 July 1997 of $38.6m at current prices, and the bounty is expected to cost $15m in 1991-92 at current prices. This will phase down to around $2m per year by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the computers bounty to widen its coverage to include printed circuit boards as from 1 July 1992 will be accommodated as far as possible within the current Budget forecasts by reducing the schedule bounty rates by one percentage point as from the 1992-93 financial year. Total bounty outlays are therefore forecast to remain at $50.1m in 1991-92, $49.5m in 1992-93 and $48.7m in 1993-94. The threshold amendments have no financial implications as they are directed at creating efficiencies within the various industries, rather than being aimed at specific cost savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill gives effect to the tariff changes that were announced in the industry statement. The idea, of course, is that major tariff changes will fulfil the Government's commitment to continue beyond 1992 the tariff reforms that were originally initiated in 1988. The Bill contains measures relating to general tariff rates and measures for the specific industry sectors of agriculture, passenger motor vehicles and textiles, clothing and footwear. </PARA>
<PARA> Tariff assistance for agricultural industries will phase down after 1992 at the same rate as the general manufacturing sector to 5 per cent by 1 July 1996 with the following exceptions. Vegetable products, which are phasing down to a tariff of 10 per cent by 1 July 1994, will continue to phase down at the same rate as the general manufacturing sector to 5 per cent by 1 January 1998. Post-1992 assistance arrangements for the dairy, sugar and tobacco growing industries will be determined in the context of Industry Commission inquiries. An inquiry into the dairy industry is currently under way; an inquiry into sugar will commence in the near future; and tobacco growing will be reviewed in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interim, assistance for the sugar industry should be brought back within the spirit of the 1998 decision to reduce general tariffs to a maximum of 15 per cent ad valorem equivalent by 1 July 1992. Accordingly, it is proposed to adjust the specific tariff rate for raw and refined sugar to $76 per tonne at 1 July 1991 and to $55 per tonne at 1 July 1992. By maintaining a specific tariff rate, the sugar industry will remain protected in the event of low world prices over this period. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements for passenger motor vehicles maintain the successful policy direction already established by continuing the existing rate of tariff reduction. The new arrangements retain the current schedule for tariff reduction until December 1992 and, from January 1993, tariffs on passenger motor vehicles and original equipment components will continue to be reduced at the current rate of 2.5 per cent per year, reaching 15 per cent by the year 2000. Tariffs on light commercial and four-wheel drive vehicles as well as on components for these vehicles will be reduced from 15 per cent in line with the general tariff reductions. </PARA>
<PARA> Tariffs on replacement components for passenger motor vehicles will be maintained at 15 per cent until 30 December 2000. In line with these objectives all quotas will be terminated on 1 March 1993, and out of quota duty rates currently programmed for 1 March 1992 will be halved. </PARA>
<PARA> Tariff rates will be reduced as follows: apparel and certain finished textiles to phase down by 25 per cent by 1 July 2000; footwear, cotton sheeting and fabrics to phase down to 15 per cent by 1 July 2000; footwear parts and existing non-quota textile, clothing and footwear goods to phase down by 10 per cent by 1 July 2000; and TCF goods already having rates of 15 per cent to phase down in line with general reductions for general manufacturing tariffs. The textile yarn bounty will be phased from 30 per cent value added on 1 July. (Quorum formed). Because my time has been shortened, I will have to reduce the time to go through all the complicated procedures of the two tariff Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like now to get to the point raised by the honourable member for Barker, who demonstrated the difference between our side of the House and the other side. Anyone who thinks there is no difference need only look at these ridiculous amendments. Nothing has changed in 100 years. There is still on the other side of the House a philosophical hatred of organised labour; there is still a view that people should be held down, kept out, and should work for nothing. The squattocracy is still alive and well on the other side of the House. These amendments demonstrate that. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, of course, in the criticism that the honourable member for Barker made in regard to the Government not moving quickly enough, he forgot to mention that for 40 years we had the McEwen and Menzies tariff monkey around our neck and around the farmers' necks. While we have been the only Government that has had the courage to throw that off, he is sitting back saying, `Well, seeing you have climbed Mount Everest, why don't you climb to the moon?'. If we went to the moon those opposite would want us to go to Mars. Quite frankly, they have never had the courage in government to do anything, and they demonstrated today that they do not even have the courage in opposition to back up the claims they have made. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most positive aspects to come out of these tariff reductions is a direct benefit to agriculture of between $350m and $400m in a reduction of import costs. I see on the speakers list the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), an avid protectionist who has run around his whole electorate supporting the cargo cult mentality of his corrupt State colleagues in Queensland. I wonder whether he will have the courage here to support the free market propositions that those in the Liberal Party, his so-called coalition brothers, support and then have the courage to go back to Kingaroy and tell his paper and his editor-who is also a cargo cultist-the real facts and realities of life. What happens is that the story changes as the audience changes. </PARA>
<PARA> We still have the Laurel and Hardy of Queensland politics, little Billy O'Chee and big Ronnie Boswell, running around Queensland, talking about the narrow, tunnel vision backwoods regulators--</PARA>

Of course, the sad thing is their approach when we come to the really tough issues, like reducing the tariff on sugar. As I have said before and will say again, as the only sugar producer in this House, that it gives an opportunity for end users of sugar to actually get on the front foot and become competitive. It also gives us a chance in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). I know that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who is the shadow Minister at the table, and I do agree on free trade and on taking the Europeans to task in the GATT, but we are shackled by this backwoods regulation of the National Party, which has opposed, at every step, an opportunity to reduce that tariff monkey and actually get competitive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time, I am very pleased to be able to read out what the Queensland cane growers have said about our decisions in the industry statement:</PARA>

<PARA>This was out of the industry statement and out of the decisions that this Government made.

<PARA> I would like to get back to some of the criticisms that the honourable member for Barker made about waterfront reform. Let us not forget that for 40 years, again, it was a sacred cow as far as the conservative parties were concerned. </PARA>

<PARA> In regard to coastal shipping, what the honourable member for Barker forgets is that some of the ships we now have in commission have technology which cannot reduce manning levels overnight, unless we want to run them onto the Barrier Reef and crash them. The technology is such that certain manning levels are needed. Even with that, we are reducing manning levels as we can, post the Crawford report. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to Telecom, of course, the honourable member was critical of telecommunications-`Let us not forget that if you are in America you can get a free local call'. The problem is that it is only a couple of miles. There is no free local call like the standard system across Australia-the best system in the world. Along with OTC, we are not only going to show that, but we will also earn a lot of export dollars for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, those opposite have this philosophical view that anything that is owned by Australia-like Telecom, which we are proud of-has to be got rid of.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. We have seen that today. Who was going to get the biggest benefit out of the abolition of the capital gains tax? It was the former president of the Liberal Party. And they have the hide to come in here and talk about accountability!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we get back to centralised wage fixing, it gets back to the old story of capital versus labour, greed versus manhood. That is what it is all about. As I said the other week, in May we will stand under an old tree in Barcaldine and remember the men and women who 100 years ago formed the Australian Labor Party, which actually gave working men and women an opportunity to have a bit of dignity and to get a decent wage. One hundred years ago there were seven-year-old children working in coalmines; I know, because my great-grandfather was one of them. One could not get a job in the sugar industry in Queensland because it was worked by slave labour. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party and organised labour got rid of that. If centralised wage fixing was to go and voluntary agreements were to come in, there would be a return to exactly what existed 100 years ago. Let us not forget that the philosophy of those on the other side of this House is no different now from what it was 100 years or 200 years ago; whether it was in Mississippi in 1855 or in the Queensland sugar industry in 1906, nothing has changed. The members on the Opposition side represent greed; they are nothing more than butlers for the rich and they will never change. When we come to fighting on the issues, we only have to look at these amendments. That is why members opposite will stay on the other side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only do they want to abolish award conditions which have been fought for, but also they have the hide to say that workers do not need a third party. Members opposite should tell a worker on a council or in a sawmill how he can go into an industrial commission with no funds and argue about improving his conditions. Do members opposite have the audacity to tell me that someone out of the goodness of his heart will give that worker the safety conditions, the superannuation or the flow-on conditions which have been gained through the union movement? At the same time as we hear this nonsense about a blow-out in wages, let us not forget that we have had a reduction of 10 per cent in real terms of non-farm unit labour costs under the Federal Labor Government. Under the conservatives we saw the other side of the fence; we saw the big squatter, Malcolm Fraser, come in and blow out wages by 17 per cent in 12 months. That is how much members opposite know about industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The other real beauty is amendment (1) (d), the introduction of a comprehensive goods and services tax; in other words, a tax on false teeth for the aged, a tax on glasses, a tax on bread and a tax on food for kids and for working families. Workers still have to eat the same as millionaires do, but a goods and services tax will not worry someone who has caviar or whisky, because that person can afford the little bit extra. But what about the working men and women of this country? What about the farmers who have to pay a flow-on right across the board, which will escalate?</PARA>
<PARA> On top of that the Opposition would abolish Medicare-a system that every working man and woman, every farmer and every pensioner need today. Members opposite have the hide to come in here to show that policy. Not only that, they also think that the people of Australia will actually accept this as a blueprint for the future. This is just a return to the Dark Ages. That is why members opposite will stay on the other side of the House and that is why I commend these Bills to the House, Bills that show a bit of courage and vision. All these amendments show is a regression to what existed prior to the formation of the Labor Party and the trade union movement. Over the next two years it will be very easy to take on the Opposition and beat it, because the Opposition has not changed and will never change. Opposition members might have better clothes and might be more eloquent than our members, but one thing that does not alter is the gulf between greed on the one hand and manhood and womanhood on the other. It is good to be able to stand on this side of the House and to represent manhood and womanhood and to oppose greed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a fighting speech from the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), who accused members of the Opposition of having better clothes than members of the Australian Labor Party, which boasts the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and his Italian suits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Actually the gist of the argument of the honourable member for Hinkler was that we on this side of the House are the parties of greed and that somehow the party on the other side of the House is not. One really hears this message a lot from the Australian Labor Party. The honourable member for Hinkler then went on to argue that during its term in office the Labor Party has reduced real wages to workers by 10 per cent, whereas under the Fraser Government wages had risen; I think he used the figure of 17 per cent. To accuse the Opposition of being anti-worker on the one hand and on the other to say that Labor, the party of the workers, has slashed workers' wages while the Liberals under Malcolm Fraser increased them, will be very hard for ordinary workers in this country to understand as they see their living standards plunge. Furthermore, the irony of the claim that other parties are the parties of greed when it is the Labor Party itself that has wooed the fast-money entrepreneurs of Western Australia-not the least being Laurie Connell and Alan Bond-will not be lost on the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate this evening is not altogether about those issues; it is about the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, which were both introduced by the Government. As the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) said earlier in the evening, these Bills in general continue the process of reducing levels of protection in Australia. One often hears from honourable members on the other side of the House the argument that the Labor Party reduced protection while our side of politics always favoured high levels of protection in years gone by. I take this opportunity to correct the record; that is not true. At the turn of the century the Labor Party campaigned on four basic policies; I will not go through all of them, although one of them was a White Australia policy, which honourable members opposite might be interested to note, while another was high protection. It was Charles Cameron Kingston, who-although not a member of the Labor Party, stood proudly by Labor-as the first Minister for Trade and Customs in this country, established the regime of high protection. That is what Labor gave Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Fraser Government-and the Treasurer in particular never mentions this-progressively reduced the general rate of tariff protection in this country, the person who squealed the loudest was none other than the then President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and now Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). He squealed about the world of lower protection that the Fraser Government was imposing on Australia and now he boasts that Labor is the party which brings Australia lower protection. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not labour the point except to say that if we are to have a debate about history in this chamber, we need to get the facts right; we need to examine the record of the Labor Party on the issue of protection. If honourable members examine its record, they will find that Labor was the architect of protection in Australia-not Jack McEwen many years later. It was the old Labor regime so soon after its birth 100 years ago that created the whole edifice of protection in Australia. Members of the Labor Party should never forget that; if they are proud of the history of Labor, they ought to know something about that history and not just live in a fairyland world of myths, which seems to be so much of what dominates the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation, which in general reduces protection, is warmly welcomed by members on this side of the House. Certainly I appreciate there is bipartisan support for the process of dismantling Australia's high levels of protection, liberalising our economy and, in the process, internationalising and helping to integrate it within the Asia-Pacific region. Members on this side of the House are very committed to that and to a continuation of that process and, after the next election, to reducing tariffs to negligible levels by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991, which is the first of these two Bills, reduces the general rate of manufacturing protection post-1992 to 5 per cent by July 1996. That is very welcome. It also phases out the developing country preferences for Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea. I could understand that there could be some consternation in those four countries about the decision to phase out the developing country preference; however, I visited two of those four countries in the past couple of months and I was heartened by their acceptance of the decision to phase out the developing country preference. The fact is that all four of those countries now have a relatively high standard of living and it is arguable whether they could seriously be described as developing countries. In any case the Government has done the right thing by phasing down that developing country preference while at the same time reducing general protection. I certainly welcome that. As a South Australian whose State contains a big part of Australia's automotive industry, I note that this legislation reduces protection for the car industry from 35 per cent in 1992 to 15 per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills raise a large number of issues, but I want to address four particular issues briefly. Firstly, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) who claims-I think probably quite rightly-to be the only sugar grower in the House of Representatives, possibly even in the Parliament--</PARA>
<PARA> Government members-Hinkler!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise for the mistake; even I can make mistakes. I think the claim by the honourable member for Hinkler is probably right. The legislation reduces the level of tariff on sugar to $55 per tonne by 1 July 1992. There is a legitimate criticism of this decision in the sense that the Government had made an earlier commitment, which it subsequently decided to change in this legislation. It has to be said that the tariff protection for the sugar industry, which replaced the old quota system, is a system based on dollars per tonne rather than a percentage value. If at a time such as this, when international sugar prices are falling, we were to convert the dollar per tonne level of tariff protection to a percentage rate, we would find that at $55 per tonne the sugar industry would be left with a level of protection of somewhere between 30 and 40 per cent. That still represents a very high level of protection for that industry, particularly as that industry argues-I think with complete justification-that it is the most efficient sugar industry in the world. If it is the most efficient sugar industry in the world, inevitably-I think that anyone could follow the logic of this-it does not need high levels of tariff protection to beat off foreign competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that there is some concern in the industry about dumping from other parts of the world. Sometimes the example of Thailand is used, as is the European Community, which is a sugar beet producer and not a sugar cane producer and so can only compete on the international marketplace with substantial subsidies. The point I make is that if the Europeans, the Thais, or whoever they may be, are selling sugar into the Australian market at dumped prices, then that is an occasion for us to use anti-dumping mechanisms to restrain that unfair trade. It is not an excuse for us to say that we should have higher levels of tariff protection, because even if we did have higher levels of tariff protection than we currently have, they could still be dumping into our market. They could be using more expensive export subsidies than they would need with a lower level of tariff protection, but they could still do it. My argument about using efficient anti-dumping mechanisms would still hold. I think it is important that the sugar industry and the sugar growers have that point properly explained to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I am critical of the Government for not doing enough to gain greater access for Australian sugar exports, in particular, into the European Community and the United States. I think I am right in saying that the level of protection for the United States sugar industry is around 40 per cent, which is similar to what our level of protection will be by 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Price interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have quotas and a tariff system; I think they have both. I am disappointed that the Government, in making this decision to reduce our level of tariff protection, has not also simultaneously made representations in the United States and with the European Community to grant us greater access to those markets. For example, even if access to the European Community were marginal, it would make a very significant impact on the livelihoods of our sugar producers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth recalling that when Britain joined the European Community back in 1973 we had been major sugar suppliers to Britain. Its access to the European Community led almost overnight to our access to the European, and particularly the British, sugar market being cut off altogether. That had a very severe impact on our sugar producers. This is not an excuse for our sugar producers-they tell me, and I believe them, that they are the most efficient in the world-to have higher levels of protection. It is an example of how we must use the process of lowering our own rates of protection in Australia to gain greater market access in other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> My second point is that these reductions in our levels of protection in general-I am not just referring to sugar-are consistent with the commitment that we as a country have made, and both sides of politics have made, to the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. I have been critical in the past that the Government, on the one hand-and quite rightly-has been pounding away at the European Community for not doing enough to liberalise access to the European market for agriculture and to phase out export subsidies. On the other hand, on our side of the equation, it does not seem to me that in the past we have done enough to reduce our levels of tariff protection. The offer we made for reductions in tariff protection in the context of the Uruguay Round struck me as being rather similar to the offer the Europeans made in reducing aggregate support in general for agriculture. In that respect, our offer did not seem to be particularly convincing. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will make it easier for us to argue foursquare within the Uruguay Round for the Europeans to reduce support for agriculture and for other general measures of liberalisation. To many honourable members this is an esoteric point. I assure the House that this is not an esoteric point; this is a point that is absolutely fundamental to the livelihood of this country. Either we get a successful result from the Uruguay Round or the world will descend into trade wars, and we will be pathetic little victims in massive trade wars if that happens. So it is enormously important to the livelihood of all Australians that the Uruguay Round concludes successfully and, therefore, we should ensure that any contributions we make to the debate about reducing protection are consistent with our aspirations in the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA> My third point, regrettably, relates to the import credit scheme that the Government is introducing in this legislation for the textile, clothing and footwear (TCF) industry. I say `regrettably' because that particular measure, even though it is only a small scheme, actually contradicts all that I have said already, and all that the Government is apparently trying to achieve in the area of tariff protection. Let us face it, let us not beat about the bush: the import credit scheme constitutes an export subsidy. For Australia to be going to the Uruguay Round negotiations, to have gone to Brussels last December, and to be conducting subsequent discussions all around the world, in particular in Geneva, calling for countries to phase out their export subsidies, in particular the European Community, and then for us to be introducing an export subsidy to protect and assist an industry which, in a global sense, is a very sensitive industry-TCF is a sensitive industry not just in Australia but in every country of the world-is hypocrisy of the worst kind. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House of what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) continually says and said not that long ago:</PARA>
<PARA>There must be a general willingness to practise at home what we preach abroad.</PARA>
<PARA>During the period of the Fraser Government, I seem to remember that that was quite a common theme from the Labor Party in opposition. Whilst I will not particularly comment on going to a debate about that-and I have spoken earlier about the Fraser Government's real commitment to reducing protection, so some of that criticism was not justified-it is important to note that the Government is not living up to the Prime Minister's rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> This import credit scheme is an export subsidy. It is not quite clear, but it could be contrary to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) rules. That is the advice that the Government received from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; indeed, it was argued by Senator Evans and by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) in the Cabinet discussions on this issue. The disappointing thing is that the Government decided that its GATT commitments-those foreign policy and international trade policy arguments-were apparently less important than trying to curry favour with a few people in the textile, clothing and footwear industry. I think that is very disappointing. As I said, it makes Australia's position in the Uruguay Round a little absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people could say, `Well, this export subsidy is only small beer. It is not going to matter very much'. I remind the House that last year, when the Government introduced its luxury car tax legislation, it could have been argued that that was only small beer, it did not matter very much and, in any case, nobody likes people who drive luxury cars. The philosophy and attitude of the Labor Party is that they are all terrible people. But the interesting thing is that the Europeans, in particular, browbeat us about that luxury car tax throughout the life of the tax. I am glad to say that last week the legislation to repeal that tax passed through this House. We find exactly the same thing with this textile, clothing and footwear import credit scheme. We will be browbeaten on this scheme because we are introducing an export subsidy quite contrary to all we are arguing in the area, in particular, of agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to refer to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barker about what we might generally describe as micro-economic reform. If we just reduce tariffs in this country but do not do anything to assist this country to become internationally competitive and if we say that we will internationalise our economy by reducing tariffs but not do anything to ensure that our shipping, our waterfront, our industrial relations and taxation system are internationalised as well, which means that they are relevant to the competitive pressures of the international marketplace, as a country we will simply not make it. That is a truism. That is not a politician's claim; it is not an Opposition's bleat; it is a truism. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the core problems of this Government, at least of its economic strategy-although I must say that some of the things I have heard and read in the last week make me think that it may have problems way beyond this-is that it finds it impossible to institute the reforms on the waterfront, in shipping, on the railways, in industrial relations and in taxation that this country simply has to make in order to be competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for this was actually outlined, implicitly but not explicitly, by the speech earlier of the honourable member for Hinkler. He made the point that the Australian Labor Party is so closely linked with the trade union movement that it is actually a virtue to do what the trade union movement wants. If a waterside worker is doing a handful of hours work a week and has a job for life-security of tenure-why would he want anything else? That is fine for him. But the fact is that 6,000 waterside workers in Australia are holding to ransom this country's trade, balance of payments and foreign debt. That is also a truism. The Government says that it would like to do something about it. It carries on with its sort of mealy-mouthed hand wringing about how it is going to introduce enterprise based agreements and all of that. But, of course, it will not do it in a way that in any respect would offend the glorious trade union movement, in particular the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the same with shipping. When wheat can be shipped from the west coast of the United States of America to New Zealand more cheaply than from the east coast of Australia to New Zealand, would one not think that we had a bit of a problem, particularly when wheat prices are at a very low level and wheat growers are struggling to make ends meet?</PARA>

<PARA> I support the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill which is designed to phase down general ad valorem tariff rates to 5 per cent, to phase down tariffs for the textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) industries to a maximum of 25 per cent by the year 2000, to phase down tariffs on passenger motor vehicles and original equipment components to 15 per cent by the year 2000 and to reduce the tariff rate on raw and refined sugar. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives effect to those announcements of certain tariff changes in the Government's 12 March statement which was contained in the document Building a Competitive Australia. It really is about competition and making Australia competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bounty Legislation Bill is designed to phase down bounty rates applying to various industries and to widen the scope of certain bounty schemes with the requirement for minimum annual production levels to be met in order to be eligible for certain bounties. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose it would be appropriate in this debate to look at how we got into the position of requiring these Bills-of how Australia became dependent on high levels of tariff protection, subsidies and bounties. It happened over a long period. The honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) was right in saying that the debate has been going on for many years. The honourable member for Mayo was quite wrong in saying that the Australian Labor Party initially supported protectionism. One hundred years ago when the Labor Party was first formed in New South Wales, the Premier of New South Wales at that time was the 76-year-old Sir Henry Parkes. Thirty-five members of the Labor Party were elected to that first Government in New South Wales and they came down on the side of the free traders and supported Sir Henry Parkes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This was before Federation. In the initial stages the Labor Party supported the free traders. In 1975 Whitlam cut tariffs by 25 per cent. We are burying protectionism now. The position that we got into was the result largely of postwar policies of conservative governments; there is no denying that. They came about in the years of Jack McEwen, the former Deputy Prime Minister and the former Leader of the Country Party of Australia. The story goes that in those years if one presented oneself in Jack McEwen's office as a member or a leader of an industry and put forward certain arguments that showed that one needed protection for various reasons, assurances were probably given at those private meetings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noticed that the honourable member for Mayo made certain references to events in Western Australia. If the sorts of tariff protection, subsidies and bounties that were handed out in those years by Jack McEwen were around today, I wonder what sorts of accusations would be going around now. Those measures were not in the interests of country people. Let us remember that Jack McEwen was the Leader of the Country Party. The honourable member for Barker acknowledged that. He said that many years ago farmers realised that they were paying for that protection, so Jack McEwen could not have been unaware that the people he represented were paying the price. Why did he go along with those things? He had private meetings. That scenario was much more damning than are the sorts of things that the Opposition is bringing forward in relation to events in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are aiming for and what we have to look at is who is paying, or who has paid in the past, the price of those tariff barriers that have been produced. Two classes of people are affected. One is the primary producer; there is no doubt about that. The honourable member for Barker said that many years ago farmers realised that they had been paying the price. The other group is the low income earners. The levels of assistance to the TCF industries are the highest for Australian manufacturing. The Industry Commission estimates that the average effective rate of assistance to the textiles, clothing and footwear industries in 1988-89 was close to 150 per cent. The Industry Commission also estimated that the cost to consumers of protection in those industries in 1988-89 totalled about $1.7 billion or about $300 per family. So the costs were borne mainly by the low income families because it cost them the same to buy a pair of shoes as it did wealthy families. </PARA>
<PARA> An examination of the 1986 census information shows that the highest percentage of low income earners is found in seats held by the National Party of Australia-what used to be the Country Party. </PARA>

I am also going back and asking, `Why would a leader of the Country Party, which represented those sorts of electorates, put in policies that cost those constituents more than electorates with wealthy constituents?'.

<PARA> We are aiming for competitive industries in Australia. That will come about by these policies if they are able to be dynamic to change. There are all sorts of costs involved in running a business. I have been in business all my life. Business does not just depend on interest rates, tariff policies or tariff protection. If one has ever looked at a profit and loss account, one will be aware that it depends on a whole list of things. If one is not dynamic and not able to change weekly, daily or yearly to new conditions, one fails at business. Many of the business failures we see now are due to that. They are due to management inability to change. </PARA>
<PARA> As a bookmaker, I know that one's ability as a bookmaker reflects one's capacity to change to new circumstances from race to race.

<PARA> Currently there are a number of bounty arrangements in which individual recipients may qualify for very small annual payments. Such payments are inefficient and do nothing to enhance industry development. They institute minimum annual payment thresholds for bounty eligibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sometimes, yes. More efficient use of resources resulting from cuts in protection will lead to increased output and other beneficial economy-wide effects. The Industry Commission estimates that the measures set out in this statement will produce a further permanent increase in gross domestic product of half a per cent, or some $1.7 billion in 1988-89 prices. This is in addition to increases due to the program put in in May 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reverse of that is true also, but that increase has been paid as a cost for years, mainly by primary industry and low income earners. If we multiplied that cost by 30 or 40 years we would come up with an enormously large figure that has been paid by the ordinary people and primary industry producers of Australia, mainly the country people, the sorts of people that the honourable member for Cowper and I represent. </PARA>
<PARA> Dealing just with country people for a moment, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics estimates that, due to the industry statement, net farm income will increase by $350m to $400m per year, or $2,800 to $3,600 per farm. It can be argued that this is only offsetting some of the drops in farm income, due mainly to commodity prices being low, particularly in wool and wheat as is the case at present. That is true, but commodity prices are not going to stay low forever; there will be better commodity prices in the future. Those increases will not stop when commodity prices come back. They will stay; they are there for farm people for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as with the previous figures I gave, the opposite is true. Because of the policies that the Opposition had for years, those figures were paid by farm producers for years. That was an extra cost-$2,800 to $3,600 per year-going back 30 or 40 years. The enormous costs and burdens that have been put on the ordinary country people and the farmers of country areas by the Opposition, encouraged particularly by the Leader of the Country Party in the 1950s--</PARA>

The honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), who has just spoken, said that under the Labor Government such and such would have happened. Those opposite have been there for a long time now. They are responsible for what has happened in the last number of years. At this stage, they have not been able to address the specific needs of this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would put to honourable members that small businesses now, with the imposts that have been put upon them by this Government-the increases in taxes and the changes they have had to face-have now been brought to the point where in Victoria we have massive job losses in the small business area. These are people in local areas that are directly affected. If people from the other side were the member where I am, they would know the names and addresses of people-and probably their children's names as well-who have lost their jobs in businesses that were proudly local only a short time ago. Because part of my electorate is rural, we are feeling the effects probably more than anybody else. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not often that I can come into this place without a smile on my face but, because of what is happening in Victoria at the moment, I have to say that we have some shame for our particular State. When families are losing their homes because of Government policies, one's heart starts to bleed a bit when one has no answer for their particular needs. These are families who have never needed social security in three generations. But suddenly they find themselves in the `new poor' category because of the policies of this Government. </PARA>

When he was in charge of transport we lost $1.8 billion; every other State in Australia did better than we did. What did the Government do to reward him for that disaster? He was made the Treasurer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to commend Fairfield City Council, the largest local government body within my electorate, for finally coming to the party and introducing recycled paper products into the Council's administration offices. I was pleased to see that $5,000 in extra funding has now been allocated to allow the Council to purchase recycled products such as paper, exercise books, note pads, envelopes and correction fluid. Fairfield Council, in announcing this decision, wrote to me seeking support for the increased use of recycled products in the workplace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I feel that I must remind the Council that my office has been using recycled products since I was a member of the State Parliament. In fact, I condemned Fairfield Council in July 1989 for not taking an active part in recycling. It was then that I informed the Council that an increase in the recycling of paper would contribute significantly to conserving Australia's natural resources and could even help improve our balance of trade. </PARA>
<PARA> A mere 30 per cent of paper consumed by Australians is recovered for recycling-nowhere near enough, when we consider the advantages of recycling. The main benefits that would flow from increased levels of paper recycling in Australia would be a saving of our forest resources, avoidance of water pollution from the processing of wood for paper production and avoidance of the disposal costs of waste paper. Benefits to the balance of trade could also occur as a result of increased paper recycling, in that imports of pulp or paper could be lessened if more raw materials were supplied from Australia, and export earnings could be increased by selling collected waste overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> More and more councils are becoming actively involved in recycling and are also encouraging their communities to recycle products. The New South Wales Local Government Association (LGA) has recently given its support to a proposal for the establishment of a local government recycling cooperative to handle recyclable materials. The recycling centre would initially handle only paper, but eventually other recyclable materials could also be handled. According to the Local Government Association, the cooperative would be established on a non-profit basis and funds generated would be returned to participating councils or put back into improved facilities and operational efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Already, the recovery of waste paper from households is common in urban areas throughout Australia, as many councils have now recognised the overall benefits to the local community through waste paper collections. There is also scope for local councils to encourage the collection of all types of waste paper which are heavily represented in domestic waste, such as newsprint or printing paper in magazines. Surveys and experience indicate that a significant proportion of householders are willing to go to some trouble to cooperate with recycling collection schemes. If this is indeed the case, the LGA's recycling cooperative initiative should be very successful. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Administrative Services produced a recycled paper review in 1990 which identified a number of reasons why the recycling of paper is beneficial to the environment and to the economy. According to this review, the benefits of recycling paper include preserving forests and hence reducing the greenhouse effect; reducing paper imports combined with a possibility of increasing export earnings by selling recycled paper overseas; reducing costs of waste disposal; and other environmental benefits such as reducing energy use, air pollution, water pollution and water use. </PARA>
<PARA> Preserving our forests is perhaps one of the most vital benefits of recycling paper. To a great extent, our forests are being cut down because we consume large quantities of paper. It has been reported that the average Australian uses the equivalent of 50 large telephone books in paper each year. However, if individuals choose to buy only recycled paper and to recycle waste paper, fewer trees would need to be cut down, harmful bleaching chemicals need not be used, and waste disposal could be reduced proportionately. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two types of recycled paper available to consumers. One is made from 100 per cent recycled, consumer used office paper, unbleached and not de-inked, called `ReRight', which is made by Australian Paper Manufacturers. The second type, which is made from 100 per cent unused paper mill off-cuts, is called `Recycle 100' and is made by Associated Pulp and Paper Mills. Recycled paper is suitable for typing, printing, drafting, invoices, envelopes, et cetera. Offices could also conserve paper by using both sides of the paper, making no more copies than are really necessary and using waste paper for notes and scribbler pads. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to see that Fairfield Council is taking positive steps towards the conservation of paper and is now becoming actively involved in the paper recycling movement. Perhaps the last comment on this issue should lie with Fairfield Council, which concluded in its meeting about using recycled products in February:</PARA>
<PARA>Environmental necessity suggests that organisations such as Council should make an effort to introduce recycled products. Not only is this environmentally sound, it will also help raise demand for these products which will help to lower prices. Thus, in the long run, Council will benefit from lower prices as well as a better environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this adjournment debate I would like to read a letter addressed to me dated 20 March 1991:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> Re: my telephone conversation today</PARA>
<PARA> Please find enclosed a Petition from the above association members. </PARA>
<PARA> At our quarterly meeting at the Morwell RSL Hall on Saturday 16th March, our members decided to sign in bulk the Petition printed in ``Mufti'' dated 7th March re the Repatriation Hospital System. Could you kindly present this petition to the Canberra Parliament for the next sitting. </PARA>
<PARA>It was signed by J.L. Evans, the Secretary of the La Trobe Valley Ex-POWs and Relatives Association. Unfortunately the petition was not in a form that could be presented to this House, but its subject matter is important and urgent enough to the 42 members of that Association that it should be reported to this House for consideration by Government members and, in particular, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys). </PARA>
<PARA> The petition in mufti stated three things that the ex-prisoners of war would like. First, they stated-and quite reasonably-that they are completely satisfied with the existing repatriation hospital system. Secondly, they went on to say that they are aware that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs guaranteed on a number of occasions that no repatriation general hospital will be transferred to a State unless a satisfactory agreement has been reached on matters such as priority of access and quality of health care for veterans and war widows, and unless the interests of the hospital staff have been adequately safeguarded; and that no final decision will be taken if the Returned Services League has reasonable cause for dissatisfaction with the proposed arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia owes a great debt to its returned soldiers and an even greater debt to those people who were incarcerated during the war. I was lucky enough not to have to go to war for my country, but my father was a captain during the Second World War, so I well understand some of the things that happened to those men. I also understand the importance to them of the repatriation hospital. It is very much their hospital; they feel comfortable with it. Because the Second World War has now been over for a number of years, their need is becoming greater and greater year by year. In fact, statistics show that the usage of that hospital system will require more in the next few years than in previous years, apart from the peak period just after the war. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not fair and reasonable for a Government to try to implement cost saving measures to overcome what, after all, is more in the interests of these people who have given so much to Australia. Cost cutting methods alone are not good enough. People of their age want security of mind so that they can go somewhere and know they will get a sympathetic hearing, where they have doctors who understand their specific needs and war wounds and who have perhaps dealt with shrapnel and other products as well as with the trauma that these people faced and are still facing these days. I ask that the Minister and Government members think seriously and carefully before they take away from some great Australians something that they need, want and have earned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a great deal of pleasure and a great deal of pride to draw to the attention of this House details of an important and an innovative conference recently held in the Richmond electorate in northern New South Wales. All honourable members will know that the Richmond electorate is one of the fastest growing in Australia. People, many of whom are leaving metropolitan areas, are moving into the electorate, not only bringing their skills and talents with them but also taking the opportunity to make a fresh start.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Richmond electorate is famous for other things. At another time I will draw the attention of this House yet again to its high unemployment-much of it youth unemployment-exacerbated by the rapid increase in population and the very low industry base. This is just one of the legacies of the past brought about by decades of lack of representation. I am happy to say that, even in these difficult times, this Government is seeking to address that poor industry base through initiatives which I hope to put before the House at another time. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn my attention to a conference held on 21 and 22 March called `Common Sight, a collaborative approach to public art'. It was held in Byron Shire, which as honourable members may know is Australia's most easterly shire and shares with the rest of the electorate the attribute of being a gem on the brow of New South Wales. Those honourable members who have visited Byron Shire will know that I am not exaggerating in adopting that description, which was first attached to the area in about 1880. </PARA>
<PARA> The Common Sight conference, assisted financially by the Federal Government through the Visual Arts/Crafts Board, the Australia Council and the community cultural development unit, aimed to address the need for vision planning in shaping the physical identity of the far north coast of New South Wales through the consideration of public art projects. It advocated a collaborative approach to public art, using the skills of councillors, town planners, architects, landscape designers and professional artists as well as community groups such as tidy towns committees, chambers of commerce-in fact, any civic design body with a commitment to design planning for its locality to develop these projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Public art, its importance and place in cultural planning, was considered in terms of some of the following: good signage, creative playgrounds, gateways, art in open spaces, heritage sites, public performance spaces and cultural facilities. I pay tribute to some of the keynote speakers who participated in this conference and gave their time: Mr Evan Walker, an architect and member of the Victorian Legislative Council, Melbourne; Mr Kevin Taylor, consultant in landscape design, environmental planning and community; Mr Bill Kelly, professional artist; and Suzanne Holman, an artist in special design and community and public arts projects. These people were joined in panel discussions and forums by representatives from small business associations, law, local government and developers to explore how public art may be most effectively used. </PARA>
<PARA> The keynote speakers had a national profile. The importance of the conference was that a national conference attracting participants across State borders was held in a regional context, giving regional leaders access to national concepts and expertise. It was pointed out to me that this type of conference, with its funding, was one of the first to be held outside a metropolitan or city region in Australia. The choice of the Richmond electorate, particularly Byron Shire, was very fitting considering the talents of the people who reside there. Cultural policy was an important part of the agenda, and the process of drafting an appropriate policy with a place for public art for local authorities represented began. </PARA>
<PARA> The final draft and recommendations of the conference will be submitted to Federal and State governments for consideration. Other outcomes will be the maintenance of a professional artists' register to facilitate the further collaboration between artists, developers and design professionals on public art projects. A regional collaboration committee will also ensure public art continues to be given a high profile in the region. It will act as a reference point for groups developing public art projects. Conference participants included representatives from the Queensland State departments of arts and housing, Brisbane City Council, Queensland Art Workers Alliance, the Australia Council, art councils of New South Wales and Queensland shire clerks, town planners, landscape architects-designers from the local government area, chambers of commerce representatives, the New South Wales Department of Planning, the Tidy Towns Association and so on. A regional exhibition of public art was organised as part of the conference in a local gallery, created, cared for and maintained by Mr Larry Youngson. I pay tribute to Larry and his good work. Larry is the lessee of the ANI Pavilion at Bangalow Park, which is also a part of the Bangalow Agricultural Society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am in possession of a copy of a letter written by the Secretary of the Area Committee of the Australian Defence Industries Bendigo facility and addressed to Senator Robert Ray, the Minister for Defence. I quote from that letter because it is of great importance to Australia's defence:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I write on behalf of the ADI Bendigo Area Committee concerning the response made on your behalf by Mr G. Fary, Senior Adviser, to the report entitled ``Union Attitude to January 1991 Proposed ADI Bendigo Redundancies.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Area Committee has determined that it is gravely disappointed at your failure to address the matters presented in this report. This grave disappointment particularly applies to your failure to address the issue of why $150 million worth of ANZAC Frigate work went overseas rather than to ADI Bendigo. The Committee points out that less than two years ago the Prime Minister stated ADI Bendigo would win a large slice of ANZAC Frigate work. The Area Committee therefore can see no reason for your failure to address this very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, I want to tell you what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said on that occasion. The Prime Minister was asked, by way of question:</PARA>
<PARA>Does the Prime Minister recall a statement he made in Bendigo in June 1989 that he would like to be as sure of the next Melbourne or Bendigo Cup winner as he was of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory picking up a large slice of the new ANZAC Class Frigate contract?</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure the Prime Minister would recall the statement. I would like the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), who is at the table, to take this matter up with the Prime Minister and ask him whether he recalls that statement about the Australian Defence Industries (ADI) and whether he could advise the House of the information on which he based his statement. The letter from the Area Committee secretary continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Information that Unions have recently received shows that there is an urgent need for the Government to provide a full explanation concerning what has been going on with this Frigate work. </PARA>
<PARA> Four months ago, the Government decided that the contract to supply 5 inch guns for the Frigates would be awarded to the USA F.M.C. corporation. This contract was worth approximately $158 million. The F.M.C. proposal to manufacture the guns contained virtually no Australian industry content. </PARA>
<PARA> The other company vying for the Frigate gun contract was the OTO Melara company from Italy. Oto Melara quoted approximately $138 million for this contract with approximately 50 per cent Australian industry content. A large slice of this Australian industry content would have been manufactured at ADI Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian decision to buy the USA gun is even harder to understand when it is appreciated that 12 months ago Japan did an evaluation of whether the F.M.C. gun or the Oto Melara gun should go on new Frigates for the Japanese Navy. The Japanese, with their renowned technical expertise, no shortage of funds, and no apparent vested interest, chose the Oto Melara gun. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of this gun contract to ADI Bendigo cannot be just measured by the amount of work involved in the actual gun manufacture. </PARA>
<PARA>There is also the maintenance during its operational life of 20 to 30 years. Of course, the Bendigo ADI would be geared up to do that maintenance work. That work has gone out of Australia, even after the Prime Minister's assurance. I want to put the Prime Minister's statement to the Minister again: the Prime Minister stated that he would like to be as sure of the next Melbourne or Bendigo Cup winner as he was of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory, as it then was-now the ADI-picking up a large slice of the new ANZAC class frigate contract. I ask the Minister at the table to take this matter up with the Prime Minister to see whether he has better recall than he has shown in the last couple of days and ask him to advise the House of the information on which his statement was based. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NT4">Dr CATLEY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Adelaide)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.54)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the attention of the House tonight to a new urban development program under way in the electorate of Adelaide-the Northfield project. Situated only eight kilometres from the central business district, Northfield haphazardly developed from its origins as a farming district to encompass the site of the Hillcrest Hospital for the mentally ill and the Department of Agriculture Research Centre. There are about 8,000 residents in the suburbs of Greenacres, Northfield, Hillcrest and Gilles Plains-the suburbs surrounding these two large non-residential centres. The Agriculture Research Centre has recently been relocated to an area in the southern part of the metropolitan area nearer to the Waite Agricultural Research Centre of the University of Adelaide. A proposal to close the Hillcrest Hospital is presently under discussion and is exciting some controversy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Northfield region is one of the more poorly serviced areas in Adelaide as far as residents are concerned. I discovered this first hand as a resident of the area for my first four years in South Australia. There is very little housing variation, with large allotments of Housing Trust accommodation. Although the area is only 15 minutes drive from the city, nonetheless, it is somewhat isolated from the inner city services. The local schools send few students on to tertiary education. Child and aged services are rather few. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to learn recently that there are plans to develop the area of Northfield as part of the State Government's urban consolidation program. The project will involve the South Australian Urban Land Trust, the Enfield Council, many private developers and, possibly, the Commonwealth Government. It has been suggested that if Adelaide gets the nod for the 1998 Commonwealth Games, housing for athletes will be developed at Northfield, to be transformed into residential accommodation after the games are over. This is an opportunity for the Federal Government to provide some financial assistance which I will be reporting to the House in the event of that assistance being required. </PARA>
<PARA> Northfield aims to offer more varied housing types than are currently available, particularly in that part of Adelaide. There will be no more than about 20 per cent of Housing Trust accommodation. The rest will be a combination of medium and low density quality residential housing. The project will be spread over the four existing suburbs, each with a component of the existing suburb and the new development. The focus will be on integrating the old and new, as well as integrating the whole project into the Adelaide metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefits of this project for my constituents will be quite extensive. Urban consolidation in itself, of course, could prevent Adelaide from sprawling any further than the 75 kilometres it currently stretches from north to south. This sprawl in itself has brought with it many social, economic and environmental costs. Communities in the northern and southern extremities have tended to become isolated and there has been pressure on infrastructure, such as extensive public transport systems. Urban consolidation could utilise the services that already exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Northfield will help compact Adelaide. It will also assist the upgrading of the housing stock in the region, some of which has run down over the years, particularly since I have lived there, as I found a couple weeks ago when I doorknocked every house in the suburb of Gilles Plains. Services will be improved for both new residents and those in the existing suburbs as a larger more diverse population will bring about a greater choice in schooling, shopping and community and recreational facilities that have not been available to that area before. </PARA>
<PARA> A project of this scale also brings with it a broader range of employment opportunities for the young people of the area both in the short term and in the long term. There will be jobs to be filled in building and constructing the new facilities over the four stages of the project. In the longer term, there will be permanent employment opportunities newly available in the service sector, in retail trades, in education, in building maintenance and in the social services that the area will develop. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the project will give residents of Northfield, Gilles Plains, Greenacres and Hillcrest, the opportunity to become actively involved in a new community development from scratch. All levels of government have ensured that the community is fully aware of the project. A letter has been sent to households and a community fun day has been arranged for next Sunday, 21 April. Representatives of all levels of government, including me, will be attending and residents will have the opportunity to exchange information and opinions about the way in which this very important urban consolidation project will be developed. I am very happy to say that it is being developed in an area that might previously have been described as underprivileged in the sense of community facilities. This will bring it right up to the front line of facilities in the metropolitan area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the very short time left in the adjournment debate tonight, I want to raise the concern of the physiotherapy profession-expressed through the Australian Physiotherapy Association-the Australian Medical Association in Victoria and radiologists throughout Australia. It relates to the omission of the physiotherapy profession from section 16B(1) (b) of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment (No. 2) Act. The effect of that exclusion is that the amended legislation as currently worded means that no Medicare rebate is available for R-type diagnostic imaging services unless there is a written request for the service from either a medical practitioner, a dentist or a chiropractor. The omission of physiotherapists will cause serious patient distress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With this omission after 1 May 1991, a patient for whom a physiotherapist has recommended x-ray diagnosis will be forced to then attend a medical practitioner for reassessment in order to get the necessary referral. This may cause further discomfort, delay and suffering for the patient. </PARA>
<PARA> The exclusion of physiotherapists will not only be inconvenient for a significant number of patients but also it is likely to lead to increased Medicare costs. I am sure that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) would be as anxious as I and all other members of the House to ensure that those Medicare costs are kept to a minimum. I know that the Minister's Department is investigating this matter. On behalf of those people who will be using those physiotherapy services in the future, I ask the Minister immediately to direct his Department to look into the matter further.</PARA>
<PARA> I am prepared to give the Minister the benefit of the doubt that this exclusion was indeed an oversight and I ask him to address that. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr Baldwin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Employment Service collects data on numbers of unemployed awaiting placement at local CES office level (local UAP) for internal management purposes only. The data is not released because it is neither an accurate measure of unemployment nor a reliable indicator of changes in unemployment. General release of UAP data would involve an undue use of Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) resources in preparation of material and responses to inquiries, yet it would provide no additional reliable information on the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA> The UAP data is based on records of registrations held in CES Offices. While the CES removes individuals from the register when it becomes aware that they are no longer seeking work (e.g., they have found work or they have left the labour force), registrants are not required to inform the CES when this is the case. (Unemployment beneficiaries are, of course, required to inform the Department of Social Security). To seek to ensure that all individuals are removed from the register as soon as they find a job would require an undue and unjustified diversion of CES resources to this task. Further not all people seeking employment register with the CES.</PARA>
<PARA> In short, the UAP data essentially provides a measure of the number of people who have registered with the CES and are still listed as possibly requiring assistance, but unavoidably it includes many who no longer require this assistance. It is certainly not a measure of the number of people ``actively seeking employment''.</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, numbers on the CES register of job seekers vary over time not just as a result of changes in labour market conditions, but also because of variations in administrative procedures, and the effects of Government policy, particularly the impact of changes in labour market programs and changes in the use of these programs.</PARA>
<PARA> The inaccuracies and distortions in the data are especially significant at the local level.</PARA>
<PARA> The most accurate indicator of the number of people in Australia actually seeking employment is available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) estimates, collected via the monthly Labour Force Survey, which are specifically and rigorously designed to measure unemployment in accordance with International Labour Organisation standards. These ABS figures, which are the official measure of unemployment in Australia, are available monthly for 60 regions in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> DEET also prepares annually a document titled ``Developments in Regional Labour Markets-Australia''. This provides estimates, based in part on regional data from the ABS Labour Force Survey, of unemployment levels and unemployment rates in Local Government Areas. While I would stress that the figures in this publication are only estimates and not the actual situation, they do provide the best available estimates of unemployment at a local level. A number of Local Government Areas in the Bendigo and Maryborough areas are separately identified in that publication. The next update of the document covering the June quarter 1990 is currently in preparation. DEET is also taking steps to ensure greater timeliness in the production of these estimates in the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Commonwealth's Middle Management Development Program (MMDP) is a three year Government wide program (1990-91 to 1992-93) aimed at developing the competencies of Australian Public Service (APS) staff whose salaries fall between AS05 and the top of the Senior Officer levels and their professional and technical equivalents. Across the APS the 42,000 officers falling within this group undertake very diverse work. In my Department, staff at these levels are involved in research, policy development and service programs to support Australia's primary and energy industries.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's aim in implementing MMDP, which is administered by the Public Service Commission (PSC), is to increase productivity and efficiency in the APS. Major responsibility for designing and providing the training and development activities rests with Departments. My Department has been allocated, on a per capita basis, a proportion of the MMDP funds to develop its staff in the target group. Of my Department's 4,600 staff 1,500 are employed in the broad range of categories identified by the PSC as eligible for the MMDP. 1,200 of them are located in Canberra.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government supports a non-racial and democratic political system in South Africa, but it is for the people of South Africa to determine the shape of that political system.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government does not have any blanket policy about the protection of special rights in the constitutions of foreign sporting organisations.

<PARA> (4) The South African Cricket Union and South African Cricket Board have undertaken to merge their organisations into a single non-racial body. The constitution of this new body is currently being negotiated, and whether it contains special rights to protect minority groups remains to be seen. The decision of the London meeting of the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on Southern Africa was to recognise South African sports which unify, and to be guided by the views of representative non-racial sporting organisations in this regard. In accordance with that decision, irrespective of the presence or absence of special rights provisions in sporting bodies' constitutions, I will support the right of any unified non-racial body to recognition by the international community, including the right to play international sport.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Since some countries do not have clear policies on sporting contacts with South Africa, it is not possible to put a precise figure on the number of Commonwealth countries which allow certain South African sportspersons to play on their territory. It is clear, nonetheless, that only a small number of countries allow South African sportspersons to play on their territory.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr Hawke</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) One of the legacies of South Africa's history of sports apartheid is the reality that neither the South African Cricket Union (SACU) nor the South African Cricket Board (SACB) can claim to be truly representative of South African cricket. It is because of this that the two bodies are currently engaged in a process of reconciliation and unification to form a single, non-racial cricket body which will represent all South African cricketers. The Government applauds this process and looks forward to the early normalisation of South African cricket.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no clause in the SACU constitution which provides for automatic expulsion for discriminatory conduct. There are, however, provisions which would allow the suspension or expulsion of an affiliate of SACU for such conduct.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The SACU does not keep specific figures on the racial composition of its members, nor does the Government hold statistics on the question. SACU claims that about 40% of players in SACU-organised competitions come from black, Indian and coloured communities, but the SACB doubts that the figure is as high as this.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Coaching programs in South African cricket are now run under the joint SACU/SACB development trust formed in January this year. While it has no specific figures, the trust is confident that there would be more than 100,000 participants.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) There is such a scholarship system for black-and other-school teachers. Like the coaching program, it is also under the joint SACU/SACB development trust.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) No. The SACB contains members from all racial groups-including blacks and whites. While the Western Cape and Natal have higher proportions of coloureds and Indians (reflecting their greater overall presence in these provinces), there are still significant numbers from other population groups playing in these provinces. In the Eastern Cape and border regions, membership at both player and administrative level is almost completely black (again reflecting the overall population composition of these regions).</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The Government does not unequivocally support, as a matter of policy, any foreign sporting organisation. The Government supports the process of reconciliation and unification that the SACU and the SACB are engaged in, and trusts that this process will soon bring about a single, non-racial South African cricket body.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Government established the Special Assistance Program for South Africans and Namibians (SAPSAN) in 1986 with a view to assisting South Africans and Namibians disadvantaged by apartheid. The focus of SAPSAN was on education and training for people of South Africa and Namibia, whether in their own countries or as refugees elsewhere in Africa. Some humanitarian assistance has also been provided. A total of $11.9 million was spent under SAPSAN during the period 1986-1990 (The Program was renamed as the Special Assistance Program for South Africans (SAPSA) in recognition of Namibia's independence).</PARA>
<PARA> 1. (a) (i) Details of programs funded under SAPSAN from 1986 to June 1990 are set out in the attached Appendix.</PARA>
<PARA> In May 1990, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade announced that assistance of up to $15 million would be provided over the period 1990/91 to 1992/93 for SAPSA. A further commitment of $2 million ($200,000 of which was spent in 1989/90) was made by the Minister to assist with the repatriation and resettlement of black South Africans living in exile. This total of $16.8 million available under SAPSA during the 1990/91-1992/93 triennium is additional to the $11.9 million spent under SAPSAN to June 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> 1. (a) (ii) The basic criteria governing expenditure of funds under SAPSA are:</PARA>
<PARA> * the funds are for activities identified in consultation with the ANC. Funding of such activities is through Australian or international non-government organisations or relevant Australian High Commissions or Embassies.</PARA>
<PARA> * Activities funded must meet the objectives of the program which are:</PARA>
<PARA> - give substance to Australia's condemnation of apartheid;</PARA>
<PARA> - meet humanitarian needs caused by apartheid;</PARA>
<PARA> - help prepare disadvantaged South African inhabitants and refugees for the post-apartheid era;</PARA>
<PARA> - assist in the accelerated economic and social development of black South Africans in the movement to a free and democratic society, with particular emphasis on those sectors (i.e. education and training) and communities especially disadvantaged by apartheid;</PARA>
<PARA> - to increase Australian's awareness of the need for change in South Africa and what they can do to support it; and</PARA>
<PARA> - to give Australians a meaningful and positive role to play in helping disadvantaged South Africans prepare for the future of their country.</PARA>
<PARA> 1. (b) Australia does not provide direct funding to the ANC under the SAPSA program.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. We understand that a private business consortium has purchased a building in Johannesburg for the use of the ANC. No Australian or other aid money was used in the acquisition of the building.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Civil marriage celebrants in Australia are required to be listed in the Telecom Yellow Pages of their local telephone directory under the heading ``Marriage Celebrants-Civil.'' In addition, civil celebrants may of course advertise in local publications in accordance with established guidelines. Appointments as civil marriage celebrants are made to provide a service to the community and it is important that their services are made known to the general community.</PARA>
<PARA> A large number of celebrants throughout Australia have not listed their names in the Yellow Pages. In the 1991 Yellow Pages, only about 58% of civil marriage celebrants have their names listed. A celebrant's continued authorisation could be reconsidered if his/her name is not listed.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A Yellow Pages listing is a prominent and convenient way of ensuring a celebrant's availability is made known to the general community on a continual rather than periodic basis, as is the case with newspaper advertisements. The additional charge for a Yellow Pages listing is not considered unreasonable and may be claimed as a taxation deduction under the provisions of subsection 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Regular advertising in a newspaper may well cost more and be less effective.</PARA>
