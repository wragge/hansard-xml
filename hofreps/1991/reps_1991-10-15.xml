<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer him to his previous statements that there is a massive inequity in the tax system and that the tax system is often a rip-off for the wealthy. Does the Acting Prime Minister still support the imposition of a wealth tax, and would a wealth tax make our society more equitable?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-If I were asked to say what I believed about tax, I would say that, above all else, I believe that a taxation system should be fair. I would want to contrast the taxation system with the system we inherited in 1983, which had become quite scandalous, not so much because of what it did but because of what it failed to do, not so much because of the taxes that were collected but because of the failure to collect tax from those who had the greatest capacity to pay it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The honourable member does not really have a great deal of credibility when it comes to the area of taxation. He speaks within the context of a Party which is built on privilege, which remains committed to privilege, and which certainly has never sought fairness or equity in relation to the taxation system. It is a Party that at the moment is preoccupied with introducing a broadly based consumption tax, on which so far it has been unable to give us any details.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It was remarkably clear that the question was about the incidence of tax. I made the point, that historically, the Opposition has sought to avoid taxing those who are better off, to avoid any sense of commitment to fairness. At the beginning of the decade it wanted to impose a taxation regime that would be inherently unfair, particularly on those on lower incomes, those in the work force and those who are most disadvantaged. I would have thought it was quite clear that my position and the Government's position is to do all that is necessary to achieve a situation in which the taxation system is not only efficient but fairer. By contrast, the Opposition is proposing a broad based consumption tax that would fall--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I conclude my remarks by saying that, as far as the Government is concerned, it is well known that we have taken a number of steps to improve the equity of the taxation system. They have gone to capital gains taxes; they have gone to the question of fringe benefit and entertainment taxes; they have gone to the imposition of a tax file number; they have gone to closing off international tax shelters; they have gone to ensuring that those in the community with a capacity to pay can pay their fair share. They have been compatible with economic policies which have produced significant growth in employment over a long period and which have been consonant with a stronger economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In contrast, at a point when this economy is beginning to move into recovery, the Opposition would threaten to bludgeon that recovery with a tax which is not only inherently unfair, but which would dramatically increase the level of inflation and unemployment, as we have seen in New Zealand.</PARA>

<QUESTION PAGE="1898" SPEAKER="Jenkins Mr H.A." NAMEID="HH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SCULLIN" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HH4">Mr JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I direct my question to the Acting Treasurer. In light of recent surveys of business conditions and other economic indicators, can the Minister inform the House whether the Budget forecasts for a pick-up in economic activity are on track?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1898" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In response to the honourable member for Scullin's question, I can say to the House that there is no reason to believe at all that the Budget forecasts are not on track. In the two months since that time, there has been all sorts of evidence that the recovery which was forecast in the Budget is taking place and is likely to take place in broadly the way in which it was described in the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Budget forecast for GDP was that during this year we would have growth of 3 3/4 per cent compared with a decline of 2.4 per cent in 1990-91--a very dramatic turnaround--and with that recovery we would get employment growth in the second half of the year with something like 100,000 jobs. Of course, various factors are driving that growth. They include an expected increase in private consumption because of particularly increasing real disposal incomes, the improvement in the rebuilding of stocks as a result of the substantial run-down in non-farm stocks over the last couple of years--they are probably at a point where they would need to be rebuilt--and a substantial improvement in dwelling investment and also in exports.</PARA>
<PARA>  As I say, the indicators since the Budget are that there is every reason to believe that those forecasts will be fulfilled. Various surveys have shown that there is expectation by industry of recovery in the course of this year. Recently the National Australia Bank quarterly survey for the September quarter showed less adverse business conditions in that quarter and significantly less adverse or positive expectations for the December quarter, and expectations for the next 12 months indicating strong growth in profitability, output and capital expenditure. The CAI-Westpac survey of industrial trends said that the decline in manufacturing activity had bottomed out in the September quarter, with respondents anticipating a modest recovery.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Dun and Bradstreet business expectation survey released last Thursday shows the third successive quarterly improvement in business expectations, with expectations for the December quarter showing improvements in sales, profits and new orders, together with a smaller run-down on inventories and less labour shedding. Yesterday, the MTIA survey of the metal industry showed that over the next 12 months there will be a very substantial increase in the proportion of respondents who expect increases in forward orders, sales, exports, production activity, investment and employment. Today the Westpac leading index was released, which shows that index at its highest level since February of 1990. All of these surveys that have been around for the last month or so certainly give credence to the view that we are in the course of a recovery during this year.</PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, the evidence is starting to come out in the statistics themselves. Building approvals in the last two quarters have been rising and are now up by 5.4 per cent on last year. Housing finance rose by 8 per cent in July and is now 36 per cent above last year. Retail trade figures for August rose by 1.4 per cent, giving the third strong rise in the last four months.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There is clear evidence that the decline in employment has now virtually bottomed out. We have had ups and downs in the last three or four months, but the level of employment--the number of people employed--in Australia in September was the same as it was in June, so we have virtually had that bottoming out which was forecast in the Budget and we would expect to see increases later this year. The DEET leading indicator of employment released last week has now risen for four months in a row.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We are in a position where we can say that the Budget forecasts are on track and that the recovery that was forecast appears likely to take place. Indeed, there is evidence that it is already occurring. But the Government is not simply resting on the Budget and saying that there is nothing else it needs to do. It is looking at every possible action it can take to try to generate more activity within its strategy.</PARA>
<PARA>  In that respect, as the Prime Minister announced last week, we have instituted a review of business tax to assess its competitiveness against the business tax regimes in other countries, and a review of major projects will be conducted to consider what might be done to get some of those projects up and moving more quickly than would otherwise be the case. A report on the latter matter will come back to Cabinet by the end of this month.</PARA>
<PARA>  In answer to the honourable member for Scullin, I believe that there is every reason to believe that the Budget forecasts were accurate, that the recovery is taking place and that this Government remains alert to taking every possible action to ensure that it gets higher rates of growth in activity and employment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I ask the Minister for Transport and Communications to explain the difference between public interest considerations which last year led to his enforcing a strict 20 per cent limit on foreign investment in Channel 9, thereby effectively handing that network back to its former owner, Mr Kerry Packer, and his present stance on ownership limits for the tenders for the Fairfax Group newspapers which imposes no limits on foreign non-voting equity, to the advantage of the bid by the Tourang group, of which Mr Kerry Packer is a principal.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-What I would like to know is when the Opposition is going to permit the Senate to pass the legislation which will place beyond doubt the capacity of the Broadcasting Tribunal to investigate the set of arrangements in Tourang. That will make absolutely certain that that set of arrangements does not controvert the Broadcasting Act and that in fact the position of Mr Kerry Packer, whom the right honourable member named in his question, is actually that of an investor, and only that, and not a person controlling the operation--which would be ultra vires the rules of the Broadcasting Tribunal--who would be obliged therefore to divest any shares that he might subsequently have in the Fairfax group or the Nine network.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We took that proposition on board on the basis of advice from the Broadcasting Tribunal. We did not accept all of its advice, but we accepted its advice on that. The Federal Government put the proposition before this Parliament with some considerable urgency. In negotiations with the Opposition in the Senate, we discovered that we cannot get members of the Opposition to exhibit any sense of urgency at all. The Opposition decided to pass the matter off to a committee. I learnt from Senator Collins that he has sought to have that committee meet this week. We cannot have it meet this week because the Opposition people want to get back to their constituencies on Friday. We said, `Can we meet next week?'. No. We cannot meet on these matters next week. We are going to meet, apparently, on 4 November. This is what the Opposition does.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Opposition's obstruction in the Senate on this is of a piece with statements made in the Parliament by the Opposition when this matter was being debated a week or so ago, when the Opposition said it saw no need for this legislation and that this legislation ought to be held over until the Select Committee on the Print Media reported. We do in fact see a need for this legislation, which is why we put it before the House. The Opposition has an opportunity to expedite what is a very simple piece of legislation indeed and one that will give the ABT firm powers to go down the road of investigating that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The question I was asked on the issues of foreign ownership went to this: as members of the Opposition well know, there has always been a difference on the question of foreign ownership as it appears under the Broadcasting Act and foreign ownership as it relates to the Foreign Investment Review Board. As I understand the position of the Opposition when these matters were discussed, it was that the laws under the Broadcasting Act ought to be made the same as the laws under the Foreign Investment Review Board and that the Opposition would accept up to 40-plus per cent foreign ownership in the television area. So honourable members opposite should not get up on their unctuous high horse and wander around this House as though on this matter they happen to have some set of views which places them in some way in a more restrictive position than the positions adopted by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>  The fact of the matter is that in the broadcasting area all sections of the broadcasting community are obliged to conform to strict foreign investment rules, with that strict 20 per cent limit, and where they do not, they become the subject of investigation. One of the reasons why those strict rules have been put in place is that there is an acknowledgment that broadcasting is a technically limited resource. This will become less the case over the years, but it is still the case now. Whatever might be the barriers to market entry in newspapers, and those are not inconsiderable, newspapers are not a technically limited resource and, therefore, successive governments, including this one, have taken a position on foreign investment in that area which is different from the position that has obtained under the Broadcasting Act. The proof of the pudding is, of course, in the eating. If one goes around the print media in this country, one will find that most of the operations--</PARA>

As Leader of the Opposition he is given extraordinary latitude in that regard. He has been complaining that I have not been answering his question. I would have thought that front and centre I was answering the question now. The Leader of the Opposition should just ruminate on the fact that he has decided to situate himself in a coward's castle in respect of the release of his goods and services tax policy, with the Prime Minister out of the country. So he should go and ruminate on that while he listens to the answer that I happen to be giving to his colleague down at the other end of the table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The fact of the matter is that, in most of the groups associated with the operation of the print media in this country, the levels of foreign ownership far exceed the levels of foreign investment provided for in the Broadcasting Act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I will now conclude the answer to the right honourable member's question, which I would have thought has been a very thoroughgoing one in terms of explaining the reasons why I adopted the views I did. As far as foreign investment matters per se are concerned, they do not come within the ambit of my portfolio; they come within the ambit of the Treasurer's portfolio. No matter what sort of conducting the Leader of the Opposition might want to do on the subject to get a bit of noise going on his back bench, whatever he might happen to say about this, the fact is that foreign investment remains the concern of the Treasurer in terms of his response to anything that comes forward to him from the Foreign Investment Review Board. It is then a matter for the Government and the Caucus. What is different now from the situation that obtained before those Caucus meetings is that a clear-cut decision has now been put forward by the Government, effectively as a result of that Caucus decision, that we will not accept an extension of foreign ownership in the print media area by seeing the Fairfax group fall under foreign control.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I ask the Acting Prime Minister to inform the House how much Government funding the Catholic Social Welfare Commission receives and how this Government money is spent. How is its capacity to deal with broader social concerns assisted by Government funding?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1901" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; HEALTH, HOUSING AND COMMUNITY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I think all honourable members will be interested in the answer to the question. The Catholic Social Welfare Commission received funding of $859,000 from the Government in this financial year for its natural family planning secretariat. It makes a significant contribution, as honourable members would know, to the broader social concerns of this country by providing clinical services, which include one-to-one teaching on natural family planning by accredited teachers, as well as the training of health professionals and community education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The funding also contributes to the natural family planning secretariat. In fact, it is one of a number of secretariats of community organisations that were discussed by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs. Its unanimous report, You have your moments, which discussed the funding of peak health and community organisations, was published in February of this year. The deputy chair of that Committee is the honourable member for Hawker, and the Committee also includes the honourable member for McEwen, the honourable member for Lyne, the honourable member for Sturt, and, interestingly enough, the honourable member for Franklin. The Committee unanimously recommended continued Commonwealth funding for national secretariats of non-government health, housing and community service organisations on the basis that public education, public debate and community consultation assist the development of appropriate policies and programs, especially where disadvantaged groups are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>  Although five members of the Opposition obviously support the funding of community organisations to publicly espouse the interests of the disadvantaged, it would seem that there is some question on the view of the Opposition. I quote from a story from the Australian yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA>With the release of its controversial goods and services tax imminent, the federal Opposition is planning a tough pre-emptive campaign against government-funded community interest groups that come out against the tax.</PARA>
<PARA>  The federal Liberal Party secretariat has compiled a national profile of publicly funded lobby groups which it plans to use if such groups attack the consumption tax while claiming to represent the interests of consumers.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact of the matter is that the Catholic Social Welfare Commission, amongst other things, published a report that dealt directly with the issue of the goods and services tax. In that report it argued that the bulk of arguments presented for a goods and services tax did not appear to justify its introduction and that taxation `should be direct and honest, not hidden and devious'.</PARA>
<PARA>  Opposition members--Ha, ha!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Honourable members will be aware that this is laughter by the Liberal Party and the National Party about the state of the National Catholic Social Welfare Commission, about its capacity to produce an intelligent, critical report on the issue of the goods and services tax, and about its fundamental right as an organisation that receives government funding to make use of some related resources it may have to attack a proposal from the Opposition that deals with the issue of the goods and services tax. These people are not prepared to countenance that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Opposition has a committee which produced a report that says there ought to be public debate and that an organisation which is funded by the Government ought to be able to join in public debate without fear or favour. When an organisation produces a report that the Opposition does not like--it does not like the Australian Council of Social Service--it wants to attack that body. It says to the Catholic Social Welfare Commission, `You had better be worried because you are on a hit list that is going to be dealt with when the appropriate time comes'. It is very interesting that when an organisation contributes to debate--an organisation that is supposed to be about rights and protecting people's capacity to contribute to debate--the threats come out. We hear not only from the secretariat but from the Leader of the National Party that clearly it would be subject to `Treasury model tax A, B, and C, and that many of the publicly funded lobby groups would attack it as well'. They say, `We have factored all this in'--that is, organisations that get into the business of debating this issue do so at their risk.</PARA>
<PARA>  This question of a goods and services tax is a controversial issue. One would expect the community sector to have views about that and to want to express those views, and to produce publications and research reports that relate to that issue. The National Catholic Social Welfare Commission has a right to expect that its views will be respected and that it will not appear on some hit list to be knocked off by an Opposition that does not believe in free speech.</PARA>

<PARA>  The answer to the aviation component of the honourable member's question--the figures were released here yesterday--is this: 4.7 million passengers were carried by the airlines during the September quarter. That represents an 18 per cent increase over the previous record set in our bicentennial year in 1988; 5.1 billion revenue passenger kilometres were flown, an increase of 30 per cent on the previous record; 6.4 billion available seat kilometres were performed, which is an increase of 34 per cent on the previous record. As to discounts--on the top 20 routes the average discount during the spring seat sale was 53 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>  One can guess from all of this the very significant impact on the tourism industry which comes from the contribution made by aviation. Of course, in various prospects circulating as to what the Government might do about it, we come to the issue of the attitude in this community to the significance of that tourism industry. We find that the Opposition tourism spokesman was discussing this quite recently--over the weekend--at a tourism forum.</PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, that forum had to live down the comments of his leader in July in which he said he equated tourism with the black economy. He said, `Tourists, of course, will start to contribute under a goods and services tax. There'll certainly be two groups, that is, the tourism industry plus the black economy, that are worse off as a result of the introduction of a broad-based goods and services tax'. The Opposition spokesman on tourism was attempting to answer that when he appeared recently before a tourism conference. In the course of his remarks, he let one cat out of the bag. He said, `I can't actually tell you what the goods and services tax will be, but it will fall somewhere between 10 and 15 per cent'. I suppose, on the basis of that particular logic, we have had the tourism spokesman announce the level of the goods and services tax at 12 1/2 per cent. I suppose we assume that it will fall between 10 and 15 per cent, so we will settle on that 12 1/2 per cent level. He went on to say--</PARA>

<PARA>  What the Opposition spokesman did indicate to the tourism industry was, `We will attempt to get some form of exemption in for foreigners with tourism packages'. So clearly we would have a situation in which we were moving away from the foreign tourist element, which was going to share an equal burden with the black economy or whatever with that introduction, and hitting the domestic airlines instead. Of course, that would relate very directly to what the domestic airlines are doing, because, basically, the big gainer from the process that has been gone through with the change in air fares is not the foreign tourist coming into this country--he or she has gained; there is no doubt about that--but domestic tourism. So we would have the situation in which somebody who is visiting Kakadu, for example, and has arranged his trip via a domestic package would be paying effectively 12 1/2 per cent more for his tourism activity than a foreign tourist coming into this country would pay for his tourism package without the addition of the goods and services tax.</PARA>
<PARA>  What we are coming to here is the problem for the Opposition that, basically, consumption taxes do not work unless they are universal. But one after another, Opposition members are building up all the exemptions from the goods and services tax that they want to put in place, and this one is in the area of foreign tourists.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That gives me an opportunity to go through what has been an excellent decision by the Government in terms of both the entertainment of the public and the prospect for jobs in this community, because there is no question at all. There are industries in this country which can support the development of a pay TV operation by providing the infrastructure--the dishes, the decoders and the rest--and also, of course, by developing Australian products for a pay TV operation. So we do look upon this as a measure which will materially contribute in the employment area as well as address what are now technical realities in the services which might be provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If the Opposition member who asked this question had read my press release, he would have seen these things: firstly, the lifting of the ban takes place in October next year, which brings it into line with the availability of the service from the new Aussat satellites, which should be up by then and being effectively calibrated for the purpose. So we have until that date to effectively establish the regime which will regulate the development of pay TV.</PARA>
<PARA>  Nevertheless, Cabinet foreshadowed certain attitudes to it. The first was in the area of cross-media rules. Cabinet decided firmly--I might say on my recommendation--that nobody who currently owned television stations in this country would be permitted to have any more than 25 per cent of a pay TV consortium. Of course, the question arises: what if there are two or three television stations in operation together in the one consortium, thereby being capable of taking their ownership well over 50 per cent? That was left as an unsettled question. It is a matter which we will go through in the process of the review of the general regulations. But my disposition is that we would not permit such a situation to take place.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the area of foreign ownership it was decided that there should be foreign ownership restrictions. The exact level of foreign ownership restrictions was not set. That will also await further regulatory study. I will go into the regulatory study in a minute, but I will try to pick up all the points the honourable member raised.</PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member also raised the issue of Australian content. As he would be aware, under the current Broadcasting Act, the levels of Australian content are not established by legislation; they are established in the first instance by government disposition. The Government indicates to the Broadcasting Tribunal that it thinks the operators of free-to-air television should be obliged to provide a substantial level of Australian content. On the basis of consultation, it sets particular limits. On the whole, those limits have been increasing in favour of Australian produced product. We envisage something similar applying in the pay TV area. A broadcasting authority would make some determination about what the appropriate levels of Australian content ought to be.</PARA>
<PARA>  As I said, we have 12 months to finalise all of this, but the process by which it gets finalised is intimately bound up with future discussion on the broadcasting services Bill which will make wholesale changes to the way in which broadcasting services are regulated in this country, and which the Government intends to bring forward for public consideration prior to Christmas and then for detailed final legislative processes after Christmas, with the intention of having it in place by the middle of next year--in ample time.</PARA>
<PARA>  In relation to the process of finalising who should hold the national licence--as there would be one national licence in operation--the Government envisages a tender process. The criteria that would be established in the tender process would go to a whole series of things such as intentions in relation to industry support, and there would be a price in that tender process. The tender process would be conducted, I presume, in those circumstances, by my Department.</PARA>
<PARA>  There is another area of pay TV which was also opened up--delivery across the country by systems effectively other than a national system, utilising the satellite. That would be done, for example, by broadening the base of the MDS system, which currently supports activities of VAS hotels, and permitting niche operations into people's households. That would be done, effectively, by establishing conditions for a class licence. The class licence also will appear in the Broadcasting Act.</PARA>
<PARA>  The intention here is not to protect any particular set of what the honourable member defines as `media mates'; it is obvious from the decisions that we have already taken that, when implemented, those decisions will broaden the base of ownership of a particular media outlet in this community. In addition, the Cabinet decided in principle that it would have no objection to the ABC and SBS participating in pay TV opportunities, though, again, that would be something that would have to be worked through in consultation with them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for Cowan for her very important question which, contrary to what it may seem to the Opposition, is of concern to many people on this side of the House and in the community. There have been concerns about silicone breast implants in Canada, the United States and Australia. These have prompted action by the respective governments to obtain information to justify the quality and the safety of these devices. The Therapeutic Goods Administration wrote to all sponsors and manufacturers of breast implants in July this year seeking such justification by 30 November this year. I am quite happy to table that letter, which may be of interest to honourable members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Since almost all breast implants are imported from the United States, this action is being taken very much in conjunction and cooperation with the US Food and Drug Administration. As in the United States, it is likely that some companies will withdraw their products from the market or be required to withdraw their products because of failure to submit the required information. The polyurethane-coated implant which was the subject of much concern in last night's program was withdrawn from Australia and, indeed, worldwide by that company in April this year.</PARA>
<PARA>  In Australia we have exempted saline-filled prostheses from this review of safety and quality. We will be pushing our manufacturers to use those water-based fillings. I make the point that it is the responsibility of the medical profession to ensure that patients are fully informed about the risks associated with breast implants. For that matter, people should be much better informed about the risks associated with or the side effects of other devices and drugs.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Government set up a therapeutic device problem reporting scheme to provide an avenue to alert the regulatory authorities, such as the Therapeutic Goods Administration, about problems patients might be experiencing with medical devices. That was highlighted on the ABC's Investigators program on 8 October. People who experience anything they might perceive to be a problem with a medical device, including such things as surgical implants, should call the reporting scheme hotline that is now available. The number is available through press release and in other forms.</PARA>
<PARA>  Therapeutic devices that are used in Australia apply to both sexes but many of them also apply particularly to the health needs of women. In that regard, the Government considers the role of women in the therapeutic devices area to be very important. That is why we have increased the representation of women on those therapeutic device evaluation committees from one only 12 months ago to four out of the eight now. It is a very important area of health care. We rely more and more upon the use of drugs and therapeutic devices for our health and well-being and upon processes such as this but, very importantly, upon accurate reporting and information to patients about problems--</PARA>

<PARA>  The point that needs to be understood is that the reason why that report said that drought should not be treated separately is that there are many factors that impact upon a farmer's financial difficulty. If honourable members are prepared to look at the comparisons--and I will go into this in some detail later--between the present drought and the one in 1982-83, which was much more widespread than the drought now, they will see that the impact on rural communities is almost about as severe today. Why? Fundamentally it is because of the dramatic fall in commodity prices.</PARA>
<PARA>  What we are trying to do is to bring some order and sense into a system whereby people, whatever the reason for their financial hardship, can get support. It also ought to be understood that the rural adjustment scheme is a scheme to ensure adjustment, to provide carry-on finance for people to get through the difficult time, whether it is drought or whatever, and to ensure that they have the ability, amongst other things, to use carry-on finance.</PARA>
<PARA>  I happen to believe that that distinction ought to be maintained. If there are to be methods of providing income support or household support, I happen to believe that that support should be appropriately allocated through the Department of Social Security provisions. That is also a matter on which I am having discussions with my colleague the Minister for Social Security in the context of the review that is currently taking place.</PARA>
<PARA>  So my answer to the honourable member's question is this: I am fully aware of the impact of the drought. I have argued very strongly about the need for the Government to take action. That action will be taken, but it will not just be through the rural adjustment scheme, which we have to negotiate with the States and about which I will be meeting with them next week; we will be looking to take it also through mechanisms that currently exist.</PARA>
<PARA>  We will be prepared to look after farm families; we will not be prepared to condone the sorts of schemes that existed in the past whereby particular drought assistance led to rorting. Examples were alluded to--I will finish on this point--by the drought review body whereby regions in Queensland were declared drought needy 70 per cent of the time between 1964 and 1989. That is the sort of thing that used to go on under a National Party rorted system that really did not make allocations based on need, that did not really understand that financial hardship could be caused by mechanisms other than drought, and that tried to lump into Commonwealth funds based on analysis and definition that States took without any reference to the Commonwealth. We are going to clean that up. We are going to have an effective drought policy. But, most importantly, we are going to have an effective assistance policy for those farm families that are in financial difficulties.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question and, indeed, his very obvious interest in the tourism industry, as he represents one of the great tourism regions within Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  A number of honourable  members in this House would be aware of a series of nationwide consultations in which I am currently involved to develop a national tourism strategy. I have already met with a number of tourism representatives, members of the general public and industry organisations in a range of public meetings in the six States and the Territories. Honourable members in this House and those others who understand the nature of the tourism industry would know that it is an industry that is extremely diverse--ranging from areas such as accommodation and attractions to transport, restaurants and tour operations. The purpose of this strategy is to try to develop a coordinated approach so that ultimately there is a shared commitment between government and the industry as to the future directions of the industry. This is important if we are likely to achieve the targets set for the year 2000; that is, six million inbound visitors.</PARA>
<PARA>  While we undoubtedly have the best tourism product in the world, that alone is certainly not enough to secure the sorts of numbers that we are currently talking about in terms of the development of this strategy. We need to ensure that we have an appropriate infrastructure in place; we need to maintain our present excellent international promotion effort through the Australian Tourist Commission; and, most importantly, we need to remain price competitive.</PARA>
<PARA>  During consultations serious concerns have been expressed to me by industry representatives of the likely impact of a goods and services tax on the very competitive position of the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA>  Opposition members interjecting--</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FJ4">Mr SIMMONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The usual line trotted out by honourable members opposite is that every other major tourist country in the world has a GST or a VAT, so why not Australia? I think we should ask that question in the reverse: why should we not continue to have a special internationally competitive position that makes us continue to be a very attractive international tourist destination? Unlike the United Kingdom and North America, Australia is a long haul destination and when we are talking about international attractiveness for Australia's inbound markets, as such we must understand that price sensitivity is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I must admit that I was a little disappointed with my colleague the honourable member for Fadden, the shadow Minister for tourism and aviation, during the discussion last week of a matter of public importance dealing with the impact of taxation and the level of competitiveness in this industry.I thought he would have taken the opportunity during that debate to explain how the tourism industry would be affected by a GST. But no, not one single word was uttered during that debate about the GST and its impact on the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>  As the Minister for Transport and Communications mentioned this afternoon, at the Australian Tourist Industry Association conference in Brisbane last Friday the honourable member for Fadden was specifically addressing, so he told us, the effect of a GST on the tourism industry. But all he could do was hint at certain exemptions for inbound tourists. Again, as the Minister pointed out, important as inbound tourists are to this country, 80 per cent of the tourist market in Australia is domestically based. The Opposition does not seem to understand that. If it is going to exempt inbound tourists from its proposal, I guess that is commendable, but surely it must realise that this market, the Australian market, represents 80 per cent of the total market.</PARA>

Under the existing sales tax regime, 2 to 4 per cent is added to the total cost in the accommodation sector and about 7 per cent in the transport sector.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I will come to the question of productivity in a minute; it happens to be my patch, even though it may not be my portfolio.

We are the only government in the history of this country that has seen the significance of wages policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Leader of the Opposition should turn around and listen to this, because the Achilles heel for the Liberal Party is wages policy; it does not have one. That is why in the last drought period, to which I have just referred, honourable members opposite had such high rates of inflation. Their Government was unable to control wages policy, because they had no basis for talking to the trade union movement about achieving it.</PARA>
<PARA>  Apart from what this Government has been able to achieve through the accord--that is, non-inflationary wages growth in each of the years that it has been in power--over the last three years the wages system has moved significantly, and for the first time in the history of this nation, to linking wage increases to productivity improvements.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The forerunner to that direction was the 4 per cent productivity offset. The next development was the award restructuring. Honourable members need to understand that not only does this country have a wages policy that can contain aggregate outcomes below the inflation rate but also, in the context of the last Budget, including the superannuation component, the ACTU has committed itself to working with the Government to ensure that our wage increases will not detract from our international competitiveness with our trading partners. Not only do we have that commitment in terms of future aggregates, but we also have the dynamism in wages policy now to drive productivity agreements and get them into place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Those who laugh ought to look at the understanding that has been reached in relation to the waterfront, for example. That agreement will produce--this is important for the export industries, in particular the farms--productivity savings of the order of 60 per cent. Yet we hear from the other side that such an agreement is not to be welcomed but to be criticised. Where do honourable members opposite really stand on wages policy?  Do they say that even if one is prepared to give 60 per cent productivity improvements there should be no wage increase?  That is really what their policy stands for. It says, `No matter how much productivity gain you get, you should get no increase'. That is the consistency of the Opposition's position in opposing the outcome on the waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am committed, as is this Government, to the view that wage increases have to reflect productivity and productive outcomes in the economy. The challenge to this nation's economy is to become a more productive nation, not just a competitive nation. For the first time in the history of this country, we have a wages policy that can drive it. I think the Australian public is beginning to understand the importance of that. The difficulty is that honourable members on the other side of the House do not understand it. I am going around the country to explain to people in the farm sector where we stand. Quite frankly, it will be the first time they hear it. They will not get it from honourable members opposite, but they will get it from me.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I appreciate that advice, and I appreciate as well the question that was asked by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who quite clearly is concerned about the possible impact of a goods and services tax on all those services. People need to be perfectly aware, when the Opposition refers to a wholesale based sales tax, that that tax relates simply to goods which are sold at the wholesale level, so there is no possibility of retail mark-ups being built into that tax structure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It contrasts markedly with a proposition that a 15 per cent goods and services tax be put on everything, including all those services which hitherto have not been taxed. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro refers particularly to the impact of such an impost on Australia Post. I have indicated before that, if Australia Post had increased the price of a standard letter in accordance with the CPI since about 1977, the charge for a standard letter in January of next year would be about 70c instead of the 45c which is proposed.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is also significant that that 45c cost for a standard letter at the beginning of next year, as a result of the 15 per cent consumption tax, would increase to about 52c. So the impost that the Opposition proposes would be responsible, for the first time, for putting the cost of sending a letter from a person to his or her next-door neighbour through the half a dollar limit--to 52c.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is also interesting that a special provision has been made by Australia Post so that at Christmas time people can send their Christmas cards and communicate with their friends and relatives wherever they happen to be in Australia not for 43c but for 38c. If we were to put a 15 per cent goods and services tax on, for example, the cost of sending Christmas cards, that would take the cost from the present level up to 45c, which would put it ahead of the cost of sending a commercial letter.</PARA>
<PARA>  There are some other interesting implications of the goods and services tax. The total revenue from services by Australia Post last year was about $1 billion. None of that represented tax. As a result of a 15 per cent goods and services tax being imposed on Australia Post, that would represent--</PARA>

The Australian people will be perfectly aware of the imposition of a goods and services tax. Australia Post, for a start, will become responsible every year for collecting about $150m in tax. The implications of that are quite serious: all those services which in the past have been free of tax will be taxed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Over a vast area of eastern Australia there is now an extreme drought. The rainfall is either the lowest on record, the lowest this century or in the lowest 10 per cent--and this brings up this definition of `extreme drought' as something that happens, say, every 10 to 15 years. We are talking here about extreme doubt, not a prolonged dry period or, as it may have been called at one stage, an ordinary drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Already in Queensland there has been a loss of production, a loss of income of $500m-plus. The area under drought is spreading and the losses are increasing. In New South Wales 55 per cent of the State is now declared to be affected by drought. It is estimated that 20 per cent of farmers in these areas could fail. There has been a dramatic increase in applications to the State adjustment authorities. So far, to my knowledge, the States of New South Wales and Queensland have committed themselves to about $50m and, so far, the Federal Government has committed itself to only $7m. </PARA>
<PARA>  That extreme drought is bad enough, but it comes on top of the worst rural depression this century. There is the grain trade war between the United States and the European Community. There are the export subsidies of the European Community which interfere with prices for our exports of dairy products, rice, sugar, processed horticultural products and, in certain markets, meat. At present we have the lack of an adequate dumping and countervailing code for this country under this Government. There has been the collapse of the wool market and, according to figures obtained by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), the seasonal average greasy price of wool up till 27 September 1991 is the lowest in real terms in recorded history of wool sales in Australia, and 8 per cent lower than the price for any year this century. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Hawker" NAMEID="8H4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Say that again.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The price this season is the lowest recorded price ever for wool. In addition to that, we have the high cost structure impacting on all farmers in Australia because of the low labour productivity. For example, it costs 2 1/2 times more to slaughter a steer in this country than it does in the United States. We have outrageous rail freights. This Government has inflicted on our farmers the highest real interest rates that any farmers in the world have to suffer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The result, according to the September agricultural and resource quarterly report of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, is that net farm incomes for 1991-92 will be the lowest on record at $2,600. That is 24 per cent down on last year, which in itself was 35 per cent down on the previous year. Remember that those calculations were made basically in July-August and, according to the ABARE, did not include any consideration for the continuation of the drought. So the real figures are worse than that and are dramatically declining. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, according to a separate article, in 1990-91 the debt servicing ratio for 25 per cent of broad acre farmers in this country--the wheat, sheep and beef people--is now 87 per cent; that is, interest payments take up 87 per cent of their gross cash income. Once again, that was for last year, without any calculation for the drought this year. </PARA>
<PARA>  In total, it is a devastating situation. The dimension is incomprehensible to people who are not from the land and who have not visited those areas extensively. It is incomprehensible to other people in Australia. It means that even the most prudent of farmers with the best drought strategy--and all farmers in rural areas do their best with regard to drought strategy management--cannot manage the situation. It is an extreme drought on top of a rural depression, and the one form of self-help that was there for farmers over the years, an adequate income equalisation deposit scheme, was ruined by this Government. So the Government cannot say to any of the farmers of Australia that they did not do enough to be prudent in relation to this drought situation. Like the drought, the impact is extreme. </PARA>
<PARA>  For many grain growers in northern New South Wales and the Darling Downs of Queensland there will be virtually no harvest whatsoever. For sheep people, wool production is down 50 per cent and most of it is very poor quality; it is tender. Sheep are dying in their thousands in western New South Wales and western Queensland. Fodder is scarce and too expensive because, as is obvious from the figures I have been quoting, there is no cost benefit in providing fodder for them. </PARA>
<PARA>  As to cattle, there has been a premature slaughter of significant magnitude, which in itself is tragic because that is one of the few agricultural markets that gives indications that it will strengthen next year. It has implications beyond those individual farmers and beyond the present situation; it impacts on the total national herd in the future. One of the great achievements of the coalition Government's assistance during the 1982 extreme drought was that the national herd was maintained and, with it, the ability to produce export income as well as individual income for those farmers. </PARA>
<PARA>  Land prices have collapsed. Any talk about the value of a rural property is meaningless in those drought areas. Feral and wild animals are invading what crops and forage there is. Goats, pigs, rabbits, kangaroos and emus in their thousands are invading these properties. People are leaving their farms. The cost of educating children is beyond their ability in those areas. For the sake of their children, some are leaving their properties and moving closer in. The Austudy criteria--even the new criteria introduced by this Government--are useless. Basically, those farmers cannot qualify for Austudy. Welfare is equally impossible to achieve at this time. In spite of the Government saying that it is going to fix it--and we heard again today from the Minister that he is going to fix it--it still has not been fixed 12 months after the rural depression started and we are months into the drought. These people are not able to pay for groceries on their table; they have no effective cash income. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister has promised and promised, but still nothing has been done. Town and community life has been destroyed in many of these areas, whether it is the town businesses, those servicing the rural sector, community life, sporting clubs or whatever. The whole structure of a vast area of rural and regional Australia is now at risk. The people affected have understandable resentment and despair against this Government. They believe --and I agree with them--that they played more than their part over the years in providing exports, in far better than average productivity for this country and in creating national wealth, in which everybody has shared. Yet now in their hour of need, in their period of greatest trouble, they have been deserted by this Government. They ask: does the Government really want a rural sector? Does the Government really want family farms and country towns? So far they have not received any positive reply. </PARA>
<PARA>  With this extreme drought the Government has done nothing since it removed the ordinary drought arrangements from the natural disaster system in July 1989. Interestingly, when it removed drought from the system, it did nothing to lower the State threshold payments for all natural disasters, so there has been some sneaky work by this Government with the other natural disasters as well. This task force, which according to the rural representatives was stacked by anti-rural people, bought some time for the Government. In its interim report, the task force recommended against ordinary drought--that is, the prolonged dry period, say, every three years or so--being considered a natural disaster. It wanted to look at extreme drought, which is the situation of drought every 10 to 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  The final report of the task force was in May 1990 and the only thing that this Government has accepted out of that May 1990 report is that no drought, not even extreme drought, is to be included in the natural disaster arrangements. The Government has ignored every other recommendation; and some in the rural sector say that they were not the best of recommendations from their point of view. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nothing has been done to restore tax incentives as was recommended. There is no rural adjustment scheme assistance under part D. So far the Government has provided New South Wales $4.352m and Queensland $2.176m through part B of the rural adjustment scheme. I want to make the point to the Minister, in case he starts talking about the extra $100m for rural adjustment, that that was determined long before the drought was an issue. That was there because of the rural depression and has nothing to do with this drought. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-If the Minister wants to argue about what the Government has done, he cannot use that argument. If he wants to argue about what it is going to do, everybody has been hearing for months what the Government has been going to do--and nothing has been done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In addition, there has been no recognition in part B of a State contribution for fodder and transport. I acknowledge the point that farm recipients of part B can use it for fodder and transport if they so desire. Everyone now accepts that ordinary drought is out in the sense of special assistance other than, as the Minister and others say, under RAS where there is hardship. It is recognised that for Federal Government assistance there has to be some form of extreme hardship or extreme drought. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is no good for the Minister to go back over what may have happened some years ago, either by Chatterton in South Australia when he was the Minister or for that matter in any other States, or what may or may not have happened now. We are interested in what should be happening now, taking into account that farmers do, to the best of their ability, prepare  for ordinary dry or longer than ordinary dry period arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>  Labor removed what incentives there were for farmers to be prepared--the tax incentives for fodder conservation and water conservation. The drought task force recommended 18 months ago that they should be restored--and nothing has been done. </PARA>
<PARA>  The task force recommended a decent income equalisation deposits scheme. Although the IED scheme has improved from the terrible scheme it was, it is still not adequate and is not an incentive either for post-drought or the rural depression situations so that farmers can effectively self-insure. </PARA>
<PARA>  The States and the farm organisations want extreme drought to be included in the natural disaster arrangements. In addition, at present there is a debate between the Federal Government and the States as to whether just extreme financial hardship should be covered and a part D for rural adjustment arrangements with no interest loans, or whether we should just continue, as the Minister appears to be doing at this stage, through part B rural adjustment assistance.  Whatever may finally be decided, the reality is that at this stage there is no real Federal assistance. If the Minister sticks with part B, he has to change one of the great weaknesses of that, which is that there is an assets test, I am advised by farmer organisations, for part B assistance at present. </PARA>
<PARA>  The coalition calls on the Government to act--to stop talking, to stop promising, and to stop saying that it is going to fix it. It should get on with it. It should either settle for extreme drought within the natural disaster arrangements, as the farmer organisations and the States prefer, or do something worth while through the rural adjustment scheme. If the Government does that, to be honest it should reduce the State threshold for the other natural disasters. Real assistance has to be significant and additional to the $160m that was provided for rural adjustment assistance in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has to stop promising that it is going to fix the welfare gap. It must fix it because the average farm family with no ability to pay for groceries on the table is right out of the welfare system at present; it does not qualify for unemployment benefit, and household support in part C is only a loan--and they have had enough loans. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has to fix Austudy also. It has promised that. It has to bring in a better IED scheme. It has to reduce interest rates. Finally, if it really wants to do something about the cost structure in rural and regional Australia, it will bring in a goods and services tax so that transport costs can be reduced for these people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The last thing that people who are struggling, in the rural community in particular, at the moment would welcome from any government would be an increase in their costs by the introduction of a goods and services tax. I have never heard anything so nonsensical in all my life. I thought the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) was going reasonably well until he threw that in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Let me just say this: I do acknowledge the problem that the severe drought has caused in Queensland and also northern New South Wales. I have had the opportunity over the past two weekends to visit those regions, to inspect the country, to talk with people, to learn of the hardship that is being experienced by them, and to discuss with them their concepts of measures and relief, because that, as well as reports, is an important dimension. I have genuinely come away from both of those two experiences with a much stronger conviction that this Government needs to do something, and as quickly as possible. So on that score I do not have a problem with those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those opposite say that the additional $100m in RAS is not a matter that we should hang our hats on--and I do not. It is true that the $100m was announced in April, but it is also true that the review of the RAS scheme was scheduled for December this year and I brought it forward to October. Why did I do that? It was as a result of my concern not just about the drought, because the drought this time around--this was my answer to the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) earlier--is more constrained in its area of application than was the case in 1982-83. My purpose was to bring forward the review of RAS so that we could test whether the funds were adequate to meet the need. That was announced by me in the first month that I took over the Ministry. Not only did I do it in terms of bringing forward the review but also, whilst I accept the fact that social security should be providing the basis for income or household support, I accepted that it would be a difficult task to pursue but sought breathing space through a variation of part C--a variation that gave access to people to get household support and not to have to exercise for up to six months the option of whether or not to leave the land. </PARA>
<PARA>   In the very short space of time since I took over this portfolio, I did try to recognise that there may be a problem associated with the adequacy of the fund and bring forward the review, and also to use existing mechanisms, even though it was the intent of the rural adjustment scheme not to provide household support but to provide flexibility within it as a breathing space. In that sense, to say that the Government has done nothing to date is wrong. Those two important aspects that were developed through RAS ought to be acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other thing that I think we should do is put this current drought in context. It is important to understand why the Government believes that the approach being advocated by the Deputy Leader of the National Party as one of his options, that is, to have a severe drought component off on its own, is wrong in approach and is not going to be supported by the Government. The reason for that is that the rural community is experiencing a combination of factors that are causing a degree of financial hardship, some much more severe than others. There is no question that in the regions that I have referred to--southern Queensland and northern New South Wales--drought is a significant contributor to it. </PARA>
<PARA>  If one looks at the maps and makes a comparison between the rainfall deficiency at the end of the 1982-83 El Nino effect and that for August 1991, one sees that the former was far more extensive than the latter. In 1982-83 the deficiency was so severe that it was the lowest on record over all of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, except for the northern coast of New South Wales and a small area of south-east Queensland. Large areas of South Australia and the Northern Territory also experienced record deficiencies. In contrast, the dry conditions of June to August 1991 were restricted to the eastern and southern areas of Queensland and northern New South Wales. Much of Victoria and South Australia has experienced rainfall significantly above the average. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important to set that point against the problems that still beset rural Australia in the current circumstances. Again, if we take the comparisons between the two periods, we see that the net value of production declined by 97 per cent in the 1982-83 drought and by 94 per cent in the current circumstances. Prices received by farmers went up by 4 per cent in the earlier period, whereas they have gone down by 18 per cent in the current circumstances and, interestingly, prices paid--this is an important point--went up by 23 per cent in 1982-83 but only by 3.4 per cent currently. In other words, regardless of comparisons of the severity of drought in the land mass of this country, the fall in the real net value of farm production is roughly the same. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is for that reason that we as a government believe that whatever the causes of financial hardship--whether they be drought, commodity prices, floods or whatever--people ought to be able to access a scheme that gives support and the ability to carry on. We do not believe that we should separate drought and say that it is the major cause of difficulties on the land; it is not. </PARA>
<PARA>  What we sensibly have to do in policy terms is to recognise that, because we are exposed to international market places and rortings and price subsidies, because we are exposed to climatic conditions, and because we are exposed to a whole range of issues that can impact upon the land, severe hardship is the test. It is not a question of whether drought is causing it or otherwise. That is why we have moved to the incorporation of drought, and the risk management that should be associated with that into the RAS, to ensure that what we are addressing is hardship generally. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will come to the question of severe hardship because that is where I believe the scheme needs some adjustment, not just because of drought. The reality is that the RAS is needs based. And it ought to be, because people who are most suffering financial hardship ought to be the basis and the target for most attention. The RAS encourages self-help, it encourages risk management, it addresses issues which are beyond the producer's control--those I have mentioned--and it is an adjustment mechanism, not fundamentally a compensation mechanism. In policy terms, that is something that I would urge the National Party in particular, but the coalition generally, to contemplate. We have to try to develop good policy, not just score points. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition will not have any difficulty in my arguing for additional resources if they are needed, for the targeting of people most in need and for the recognition of particular circumstances; but it has to be in the context of a good policy framework. In the past we have not had a good policy framework. That is the reason why the review of the natural disaster relief arrangements was set up in 1989. As a result of that, drought was removed from the natural disaster relief arrangement, not for the reason that it was the only thing that we pulled out because we decided we liked it, but for the reason that at the time the NDRA followed the leaking of a Queensland Department of Primary Industries report highlighting widespread rorting of the NDRA in Queensland. I do not have time to go into the detail of this. My colleague who will follow me, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), will follow it up. I merely reiterate the point that I made in Question Time: one thing that stands out in my mind--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am running short of time, but in essence that finding, amongst others, was the reason why all States and the Commonwealth adopted the direction that was recommended in the report, that of advocating a self-reliant risk management approach to drought. That is what we have tried to do under the RAS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I wish to discuss this because I think it is important. I brought the adequacy question forward by two months for review. The drought will go to the question of whether funds are adequate or not. But I accept that we may need a recognition of the severity of hardship associated with circumstances that may be drought. That is one of the areas that at the moment we are discussing with the States and that I have already discussed in principle in Cabinet. The difficulty is that I am not in a position to be able to announce the answer today or this week, simply because on the one hand we have to establish what we can negotiate sensibly with the States, and we have to have a proper analysis as to what the real problem is and what the demands generally for the adequacy of funds are going to be. I then have to be in a position of knowing what sort of submission in financial terms needs to be taken to the Cabinet. But in answer to the honourable member for Groom's question, I have indicated that it is my intention to take that submission at the end of this month. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst the Deputy Leader of the National Party points to the fact that only $7m has been released for drought assistance under part B, that is acknowledged by those two States that are affected as being adequate until we know where the review is. So Opposition members should not shed any crocodile tears about the fact that the money is not enough at the moment. The States acknowledge that it is enough but they say that it will not be sufficient in the longer term, particularly if the drought continues. </PARA>
<PARA>  What I have done is ensured that there is adequacy there now, through the existing mechanisms. As soon as this issue blew up, we wrote to the States and advanced that money. It did take some time because the States had to decide whether they were going to activate and match those funds. For that reason they consider the funds adequate at the moment, but the overall adequacy will be considered. </PARA>
<PARA>  I accept that the other consideration that must be followed up is the question of whether RAS--because it still recognises loans, whatever the interest subsidy on those loans might be--may not be able to accommodate the circumstance of a person who simply cannot, for a range of reasons, incur additional debt. That is also something that I am grappling with. It is something that has to be negotiated with the States to understand the extent to which they are prepared to match, but it is also something that needs to be considered in the context of the social security provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>  The main problems with making special exemption under social security provisions are that it could flow on to small businesses which are high in assets--the same circumstance that is knocking out farmers at the moment--and we need to consider whether the income test will be distorted. They are the sorts of concerns that I believe need to be addressed and will be addressed. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-For many in our coastal areas happiness is the forecast of fine, clear and sunny weekend weather. However, as last weekend's Sydney Sun-Herald pointed out, it is an unfortunate fact that this sun-seeking enjoyment is inevitably someone else's agony. That agony is epitomised in the present extreme drought conditions in parts of New South Wales and Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has said, more than half of New South Wales is officially declared drought stricken, while large parts of southern and central Queensland are arguably in the most severe drought conditions since the 1890s. However, this dry spell is adding another catastrophic dimension to an already struggling rural sector in which powder-dry topsoil is being blown away, turning much of our arable land into hard-baked, bleached, unproductive and irreversible moonscape. </PARA>
<PARA>  No-one would argue that drought is one of those risk factors that Australian farmers will face from time to time. However, what we have today is a drought of great severity, following hard on the heels of a number of factors: a rural commodity downturn of unparalleled scope and degree, deep domestic recessionary economic conditions, unemployment now in excess of 10 per cent, and a Federal Government--despite what the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), who is at the table, says--that is strong on rhetoric but light on substance when it comes to an empathy for our rural communities and their economic and physical ills. </PARA>
<PARA>  Arguably, the cumulative impact of this drought is so profound that more than one in</PARA>
<PARA>10 of the farming community as we know it today may be forced off the land in the next two or three years. We have in prospect a slump in rural incomes of about 60 per cent over that period of time. This cannot continue without doing permanent damage to the rural sector and the economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>  I agree with the recent comments by my coalition colleague the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) that this drought could push the economy into a depression unless urgent policy remedial measures are taken. Regrettably, some in this place still remain seemingly oblivious to the extent of the destruction of one of our greatest national assets on which our economic well-being relies in very large part. I would simply like to say to those members: let there be no doubt that we have a national disaster on our hands, not only in terms of its geographic spread but also at the individual family farm level and in terms of the many millions of dollars likely to be lost to our export revenue. We need to avoid blinkered vision that the problem is a minor cyclical one and should realise the extent of its potential to threaten our social fabric and to further degrade our national economic performance. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn to my home State of Queensland and economic performance. In some parts of that State the drought began with poor seasonal rainfall in the middle of last year. The situation became critical this year after the normally wet months of January and February failed to yield their usual rainfall. Very little rain has fallen since in the south-eastern and central regions. In terms of wheat production, last season Queensland harvested around two million tonnes. At the end of this season, output is expected to be about 400,000 tonnes. In other words, Queensland's 5,000 wheat farmers must resign themselves to a 75 per cent reduction in their annual output, which usually provides around 10 per cent of the 13 to 15 million tonnes of wheat that this country exports each year. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn to sugarcane. At the end of November, Queensland growers will harvest about two-thirds of last year's quota of 3.6 million tonnes of sugar. That represents a loss of $200m State-wide in export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the case of the Queensland beef industry, which nets about $1.4 billion a year, the full impact is not yet clear. However, in many places feed supplies are non-existent, very low or too expensive because of short supply. Many cattlemen are saying that they can no longer guarantee the usual quotas that they supply interstate. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the case of the dairy industry, the State's annual 630 million litres of milk, or 10 per cent of the national output, will be seriously affected. At best, many dairy farmers are breaking even; at worst, they are now borrowing heavily to meet increasing feed bill demands. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my area of the Darling Downs, even easier to grow substitute crops such as chickpeas for the Indian and Bangladesh markets have also failed. The big worry has to be that we may lose the Japanese market for prime hard wheat to an overseas competitor. What is in prospect is the invidious situation of our having to consider imports from the United States to sell to Japan in order to retain the market share. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn now to the personal impact. I draw to the House's attention the situation of a wheat farmer in my area--I will call him Mr C--who in mid-June of this year planted 40 hectares of wheat on his 260-hectare property. There has not been a drop of rain since and, with the crop having grown to only 20 centimetres and little chance of it developing further even if rain comes soon, it is now being devoured by dairy cattle on agistment from Toowoomba and elsewhere. If this wheat crop had succeeded, it would have realised around $40,000. Mr C also planted 40 hectares of barley a month or so before his wheat plantings. This has no chance of maturing but has grown high enough to be cut and baled for fodder. As Mr C has said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have had the substantial cost of the seed and the planting. What I get for the crop as fodder does not even cover my costs. On top of that, I don't know when I'll be paid for the fodder I've sold because most are broke. I don't know where the money is going to come from for my next planting. </PARA>
<PARA>The General President of the Queensland Graingrowers Association, Mr Ian McFarlane, has echoed this frustration; he pointed out that last year we could not get a worthwhile price because of a combination of oversupply and the US and European subsidies. Whereas this year the price is good, there will not be enough grain to meet demand and only a few farmers will make any money. In fact, at the recent ABARE rural outlook conference in Toowoomba, the point was made that around 40 per cent of broad acre farmers are likely to have negative farm incomes this financial year and that almost half of farm families had taxable incomes, including off-farm incomes, of less than $10,000 last financial year--with prospects, of course, worsening. </PARA>
<PARA>  Furthermore, at a recent Country Women's Association meeting on the Darling Downs, delegates made the following points: many children would not return to city schools after Christmas and enrolments at the Charleville School of the Air might increase up to 50 per cent; such self-education at home would place further demands on country women already struggling to save their properties; and women in regional areas have little access to social services. A case was cited where one woman with two small children had been feeding her family boiled rice for a week and did not know what they would eat next. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many delegates expressed deep frustration that they had nowhere to turn other than to sell their properties and to leave their farms, at a time of deeply depressed property values. The Brisbane Courier-Mail of 9 October also spoke of farmers' suicide rates as the rural crisis deepens, quoting from the comments of the Reverend Noel Park, the Director of Lifeline in Toowoomba, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>We are getting a disturbing number of telephone calls from people in absolute desperation. . . farmers who have been on the land for two or three generations who are unable to feed their families. The calls we are getting match the number of reports from country police on attempted suicides. </PARA>
<PARA>While the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is increasingly saying that his Government has the solutions, I think he is unreasonable to view the provisions of the rural adjustment scheme as the panacea, whether they be in respect of part B or, indeed, a new part D, covering extreme drought or hardship. I simply repeat my earlier question to the Minister: why has his Government done nothing in this respect?</PARA>
<PARA>  To his credit, the Minister is listening and attempting to come to grips with the problem, in conjunction with his Queensland and New South Wales colleagues. However, much of the emphasis is rhetorical and seems to be on the periphery of the problem. Much of what has been achieved in recent weeks in conjunction with the States is simply window dressing, a point which a number of Queensland ALP Ministers have also made. I simply say to the Minister, in conclusion, that we need urgent action, not more confusing Cabinet rhetoric; time is running out fast for many out there on the land. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On the east coast of Australia, and particularly central and northern New South Wales and a large part of Queensland, we are facing one of the worst droughts on record. It is probably as bad as or worse than the droughts of 1890, 1932, 1946 and 1982. But, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) said, it has varied; when we look out of the window here we see beautiful green grass, and people in Victoria and Tasmania have been much more fortunate. It is one of the frustrating things about the driest continent on Earth, a continent of 3 million square miles, that in any decade there is always a severe drought in one part of our country, and there always will be, and there will always be an abundance of rain in another part.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government is setting up a structure that individually targets those people most in need. That is why we have put our emphasis on the rural adjustment scheme, parts A, B and C. I can understand the frustration of farmers who have watched their crops die. I have seen my crops die. I have seen my friends' crops die. I can understand some farmers who are on the edge because their farm unit is small, because of the massive drop in commodity prices over the last two to three years, and because of a trade war in which we are victims and in which we have taken no part. They are now faced with a drought, which in many instances is a final straw. There is no doubt that over the next two to three years, maybe sooner, something like 20 to 30 per cent of Australian farmers in particular areas may lose their entire equity. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are, sadly, some farmers whom nobody can help. There are others whom we can help, and we are doing it in two ways: not only through the rural adjustment scheme but also through rural counselling. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), I believe sincerely, mentioned his concern about suicides, something that touches us all. A very dear friend of mine took his own life only a few weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA>  The rural counselling service has done an outstanding job on the ground across this country in dealing on a local basis with families who are suffering trauma. It is hard for people who have been on the land for generations to face the reality that they do have to sell. There is no doubt about that. But we on this side of the House are not prepared to offer false hope or play on people's emotions to get cheap points or votes. </PARA>
<PARA>  In regard to part A of the rural adjustment scheme, this year $74.9m has been allocated to improve farm structural adjustment and for the longer term. In part B, which is matched by the States, there is $13.6m for carry-on funds to maintain the farm and for fodder buying. In part C, which is the most traumatic, $57.5m has been allocated to help farmers who have lost their equity to leave the land with dignity. Part C has now been means tested and indexed, and that means that $34,000 is available for farmers to take with them to start life again. That money cannot be taken; it is `quarantined'. In other words, if a family owes $350,000, sells its property and only gains $200,000, it still takes that $34,000 with it to start a new life. It may not be compensation for a lifetime's work--it is certainly not. It cannot compensate for what people have lost, but it gives them the opportunity to start again. I think that is important. </PARA>
<PARA>  In April 1991 the Commonwealth Government approved an increase in funding for the rural counselling service up to $2.6m for 1991-92. There are now 49 counselling services, employing 57 counsellors, throughout Australia. As I have said, they have done an outstanding job. The Minister and I are prepared to listen and take on board any constructive propositions put to us--either as a Government or in his capacity as Minister or mine as the chairman of the primary industries committee--which can help farmers in any way. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, it is my view, and that of the Government, that subsidies are not the answer. In fact, instead of helping those most in need, subsidies tend to go to the wealthiest and to the distributors of products such as fodder, not to the farmers themselves. As I have said, part B of RAS can be used for fodder, water and agistment services. While in every drought it has been said that unless governments provide transaction based subsidies, particularly for fodder and agistment purposes, the viability of the national beef cattle herd and our meat export markets will be threatened, that has not necessarily occurred in the past. Fodder and water subsidies provided in previous years were not large enough to have a significant effect on this outcome. Part B of RAS is there to do just that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that freight and other subsidies are reactive rather than pre-emptive; they do not have the intended incentive effect and they are highly inequitable across industries. That is why we have included the whole structure in RAS to help primary producers. We did that because back in Queensland in 1988 drought relief was rorted. I well remember going to a public meeting in Monto with the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I was accused of not doing enough for farmers because I would not agree to a subsidy of $40m to wipe out farm debt. While I was being accused by the State National Party and Federal National Party members in Queensland of not caring because I would not acquiesce to that, the former National Party State Government knew, and admitted after the public accounts inquiry, that its own structure of drought relief was being rorted. Some $15m was paid out in subsidies during one drought in Queensland. Of that, 84 per cent of users received only $5,000 or less; the remaining 16 per cent received 76 per cent of all subsidy payments. In other words, 16 per cent received $11.4m and 84 per cent received the difference--$4.6m. </PARA>
<PARA>  That demonstrated once again that subsidies do not work for the people most in need. This is why the rural adjustment scheme is there, targeted specifically to help. To take the matter even further, we all know about the famous Behan loans affair where $85,000 was given out of disaster relief at 4 per cent to a former National Party organiser in north Queensland. A former Queensland National Party Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Turner, revealed in a radio interview with Greg Turnbull that he found it necessary to overturn decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>  A former National Party member, Mr Menzel, said that he would go to the Minister to try to overturn decisions made by the independent committee at any time he felt like it. In other words, it was a slush fund. There they were, heads in the trough, up to their armpits getting out the dough for their rich mates, while the blokes who were battling, the blokes the honourable member for Groom mentioned, were missing out. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst I believe that the honourable member for Groom and the honourable member for Murray are genuine in their concerns, it was not demonstrated in the past that the former State Government in Queensland could be trusted with 10c, let alone an open cheque for national disaster relief arrangements. That is why we have this process in place. As I said, I agree that we should be prepared to look at any proposition that can be beneficial or any proposition that is sensible. I am certainly prepared to look at it and take the matter to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who is at the table. But subsidies are not the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I have said, I am sure that both Opposition members who have spoken are genuine, but the last thing farmers need at this time is a goods and services tax--a tax on farmers who are not earning any money, a tax on their food, on their clothes, on everything they have to purchase, and on the education of their children. That is the last thing they can afford. I am sure the honourable member for Groom will not want to go to the Lockyer Valley and tell his growers that he wants to lob a 15 or 12 1/2 per cent tax on their onions, on their potatoes, on their pumpkins, at a time when they are flat out making a living. That is the last thing they can afford or need to do. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition has about as much chance in the bush of selling a GST as it has of selling leprosy. If honourable members opposite really want to help the farmers, they should cross the floor on that issue and roll the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). If the shadow Minister for Defence can roll him, surely to goodness others can if they are really genuinely concerned about the man on the land. The conservationists claim that they are concerned about the negative side of resource security. I would like to see them out in the bush now worrying about the degradation of the land--</PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to reform Australia's marine cargo liability legislation, which is concerned with legal responsibility for loss or damage occurring to seaborne cargo. This new Bill replaces the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill 1990, which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 12 September 1990 following a review of Australia's marine cargo liability regime. </PARA>
<PARA>  The 1990 Bill resulted in a number of representations being received from shippers, ocean carriers and the legal profession expressing concern about certain technical aspects of the proposed legislation. These concerns focused on the use of modern language instead of the original texts of international conventions, the need to clarify the Bill's application to contracts of carriage other than those evidenced by documents of title such as bills of lading, and the scope of coverage of Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA>  The complex legal issues raised by these representations were addressed in consultations between Commonwealth officials and the parties concerned. The revised provisions of the replacement Bill, which I will detail later, satisfactorily resolve those issues and there is broad industry support for the approach now adopted. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia's current marine cargo liability regime is embodied in the Sea-Carriage of Goods Act 1924. The Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill 1991 will repeal that Act. However, a `savings clause' will allow the Sea-Carriage of Goods Act 1924 to continue to operate in relation to contracts of carriage entered into prior to the commencement of the Bill. The objectives of the Bill are to provide Australia with a marine cargo liability regime that is up to date, equitable and efficient; is compatible with arrangements adopted by our major trading partners; and takes account of developments in this area within the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Sea-Carriage of Goods Act 1924 is based on the 1924 International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading--commonly known as the Hague Rules. It is the basis of marine cargo liability regimes generally included in national legislation in force in the world today. The main thrust of the Hague Rules is to limit the extent to which shipowners are liable for loss or damage to cargo while it is in their keeping. The relevant circumstances of such liability are defined in the Rules and an upper monetary limit is imposed on any claims made by cargo owners or shippers. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Hague Rules have been amended by two international protocols: the Visby Protocol of 1968 and the SDR--Special Drawing Right--Protocol of 1979. These protocols update the Hague Rules by increasing the liability limit for shipowners, replacing the gold standard with the International Monetary Fund's modern currency unit--the special drawing right--and  redefining the term `package or unit' of cargo to take account of the modern use of containers in shipping. These two protocols are gaining acceptance among maritime trading nations and this Bill provides for their incorporation into Australian law. Schedule 1 to the Bill sets out the provisions of the Hague Rules as amended by the Visby and SDR protocols. Australia will also formally accede to these two protocols. </PARA>
<PARA>  Shippers have argued that a deficiency of the Hague Rules, which these protocols do not substantially alter, is that shippers bear the major burden of risk for loss or damage to seaborne cargo, even though the shipowner has care of the cargo. As a result, shippers generally have to make separate arrangements to fully insure their cargo against this risk. </PARA>
<PARA>  This criticism is addressed in the 1978 United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea, commonly known as the Hamburg Rules. The main feature of the Hamburg Rules is the transfer of much of the burden of liability from shipper to shipowner during the time that the shipowner has care of the cargo. The text of the Hamburg Rules is set out in schedule 2 to the Bill. The Hamburg Rules will not come into force internationally until 1 November 1992. Few of the signatories to the convention are significant maritime trading nations and so far none of Australia's major trading partners has acceded. Nevertheless, the Government does recognise the argument of the greater equity of the Hamburg Rules and the potential benefits for shippers that may accrue from a general international acceptance of the Hamburg Rules. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia remains essentially a shipper nation and the Bill will ensure that the Hamburg Rules will be kept under review to determine the optimum time for them to eventually replace the Hague-Visby-SDR regime. This does not mean that the Hamburg Rules will be left to languish indefinitely. In an endeavour to specify a more definite `trigger' mechanism than originally provided for in the Bill, the Government moved an amendment which was passed in the Senate. The Bill now provides that if the Hamburg Rules provisions have not been proclaimed within three years of the Act receiving the royal assent, they automatically come into effect unless, before the expiration of the three year period, both Houses of Parliament have passed a resolution that the provisions be repealed or that the question of their repeal be deferred for a further three year period. </PARA>
<PARA>  The inclusion of the Hamburg Rules in the Bill is a signal that Australia intends to accept this Convention when its international standing is such that it can demonstrably provide a viable basis for new cargo liability arrangements for international seaborne trade between Australia and its trading partners. As long as the Hamburg Rules have not come into force internationally it is inappropriate to seek proclamation of the parts of the Bill that deal with the implementation of this Convention, and the Government will not be moving to implement the Hamburg Rules until it is in the commercial interests of Australia to do so. In other words, there will be no moves towards implementation until the Hamburg Rules have come into force internationally and a sufficient number of our major trading partners have adopted, or expressed an intention to adopt, the Hamburg Rules as the basis for their marine cargo liability regimes. Any decision on the timing for implementation will also be made on the basis of a broad and comprehensive consultative process with representatives of shippers, cargo owners, carriers and ship owners. </PARA>
<PARA>  The 1990 Bill sought to reproduce the texts of the amended Hague Rules and the Hamburg Rules in a modernised `plain English' version. However, concern was expressed that the changes, though intended only to be stylistic, could inadvertently change the meaning of the rules as established by the extensive interpretation of courts internationally. In order to avoid possible increased litigation under the amended versions, it was decided to retain the internationally accepted texts. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the case of the Hague Rules, there is no official English translation of the original French version of the convention agreed to in 1924. It was decided after extensive consultation to use the Australian Treaty Series translation of the Hague Rules as the basis for schedule 1 of the Bill, as this is the version most commonly used in the English speaking world. </PARA>
<PARA>  The coverage of the Bill also extends, on a voluntary basis, to contracts of carriage evidenced by non-negotiable transport documents. These non-negotiable transport documents fulfil similar functions to bills of lading--that is, they are evidence of the contract of carriage of the goods between the carrier and the shipper--with the exception that they do not convey title to the cargo. The extension of the Bill's coverage in this regard recognises the increasing use of non-negotiable transport documents in Australia's interstate and international sea trades and resolves the question as to whether the Hague-Visby-SDR regime can be applied where such documents are used. </PARA>
<PARA>  A provision has been included in the Bill along the lines of sections 9(1) and (2) of the existing Sea-Carriage of Goods Act 1924 which applies Australian law to the resolution of liability disputes arising from the sea carriage of goods in our export trades. This avoids the potential delays, increased costs and language difficulties which may be involved with the resolution of disputes under foreign laws. A provision has also been included to preserve the effect of the jurisdiction and arbitration articles of the Hamburg Rules which permit the complainant to choose under which jurisdiction disputes are arbitrated. </PARA>
<PARA>  Rather than producing an amending Bill, which would require users to make continuous reference to the 1990 Bill, it was decided that it would be better to have a self-standing Bill which incorporated all the agreed amendments. For this reason it was decided that the existing Bill will be withdrawn from the House of Representatives at the earliest opportunity and replaced with the Bill being introduced today--the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also provides for a minor consequential amendment to the International Arbitration Act 1974. This amendment will ensure that the International Arbitration Act will not override the Australian law and jurisdiction provisions of the Bill. This is consistent with the current approach under the International Arbitration Act which contains a restriction which ensures that it does not affect the operation and jurisdiction provisions contained in section 9 of the Sea-Carriage of Goods Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill does not affect the operation of the relevant parts of the Navigation Act 1912 which deal with the carriage of dangerous cargoes and which preserve the protection that shipowners enjoy from liability in respect of fire damage and theft of valuables in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also does not affect the operation of the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Act 1989 which gives the force of law in Australia to the Convention on the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims. This means that shipowners can limit their total liability from all claims of a certain nature arising on any distinct occasion, including claims of loss of life or personal injury, or loss of or damage to property occurring on board or in direct connection with the operation of the ship. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill prevails over the relevant provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to the extent of any inconsistency. This will remove the potential for action to be taken against an ocean carrier under the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act in respect of loss or damage to cargo by a shipper who is not normally in the business of cargo shipping. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, the legislation being proposed makes no specific calls on the revenues of the Commonwealth. There is no government administrative involvement in the operation of the Bill's provisions. I commend this Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and the supplementary memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>In May 1989 the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters presented its report No. 3, which flowed from its inquiry into the conduct of the 1987 Federal election and the 1988 referendums. A number of the recommendations made by the Committee in its report have already been put into effect administratively or by regulation, and some others were enacted in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 to give effect to the remaining recommendations made in the Committee's report No. 3 which have been accepted by the Government. A number of minor amendments, the need for which has become apparent since the Committee reported, have also been included in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn to the major provisions of the Bill. The Bill proposes that registered officers of political parties are to be able to nominate all endorsed House of Representatives candidates to the Australian Electoral Officer for the State or Territory concerned up to 48 hours before the close of nominations. It is also proposed that nominations may be made by facsimile provided the deposit is also received before the close of nominations. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also imposes a new requirement on a candidate to state in his or her nomination whether he or she became an Australian citizen by birth, by naturalisation or by other means. This should minimise the possibility of the election results being subsequently voided by the courts because the candidate is not an Australian citizen, as occurred in the case of former Senator Wood. Any person who makes a claim on the nomination form which is false or misleading in a material respect shall be guilty of an offence, with a penalty of $3,000 or imprisonment for six months or both. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also proposes to introduce an infringement notice system for enforcement of compulsory voting at elections and referendums, under which apparent non-voters will be given the option of paying a penalty, showing cause why they should not be prosecuted, or having the matter dealt with by the court. </PARA>
<PARA>  Other features of the Bill include:</PARA>
<PARA>.  provision for candidates who have silent enrolment not to have their addresses publicly announced;</PARA>
<PARA>.  ensuring that the addresses of silent electors will not be disclosed to persons inspecting postal vote applications;</PARA>
<PARA>.  giving senators and members the choice of recording their enrolled address or place of residence when completing their nomination forms;</PARA>
<PARA>.  enabling an incumbent senator who has lodged a voting ticket to be included above the heavy black line on the Senate ballot paper along with the word `Independent';</PARA>
<PARA>.  clarifying the provisions relating to the scrutiny of Senate voting; and</PARA>
<PARA>.  modifying the provisions of section 351 relating to the publication of matter regarding candidates to enhance its enforceability. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia must have effective immigration controls to ensure that only those persons who are entitled to enter and remain in Australia do so. This Bill contains amendments to the Migration Act 1958 which will strengthen the effectiveness of Australia's immigration controls. These amendments will place in the Migration Act a power to obtain information to identify and locate illegal entrants and create offences relating to the arrangement and use of contrived marriages or de facto relationships to obtain residence in Australia. The Bill also includes a power to limit the number of applications which may be considered within a specified class of visa or entry permit. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government will not tolerate the continued presence of illegal entrants in Australia. In August 1990, we introduced an enhanced compliance strategy which included measures to reduce the number of people illegally in Australia and to discourage further illegal entrants. These measures were further bolstered by the provision of additional resources in this year's Budget. They are producing results. However, additional powers are necessary to detect illegal entrants, including overstayers. The Government must be able to obtain information about their identity and location. The information gathering provisions included in the Bill will authorise the Minister to obtain information, including documents, about the identity or whereabouts of suspected illegal entrants. </PARA>
<PARA>  Opposition members interjecting--</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5H4">Mr HAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Opposition might find this amusing, but it is not. However, the Government recognises that a person's privacy should not be intruded upon without clear justification. The provisions of proposed Division 1A allow information or documents to be sought only where the Minister has reason to believe that the person in relation to whom the information is sought is an illegal entrant. Furthermore, the provisions can only be used where the person from whom the information is sought is capable of providing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There are people who will go to extreme lengths to enter or remain in Australia. These lengths include entering into contrived marriages or de facto relationships with Australian citizens or permanent residents. While there are cases where the Australian party willingly lends himself or herself to the contrived relationship, I should also point out that there are cases where the Australian party is misled. </PARA>
<PARA>  The use of contrived marriages or de facto relationships for obtaining residence in Australia is unacceptable. My Department, the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations and the Migration Committee of the National Population Council have examined the use of contrived marriages and de facto relationships to gain residence in Australia. The result has been strong recommendations to the Government to adopt firm measures to discourage this practice. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government will not tolerate the activities of persons conducting business as arrangers of false marriages or de facto relationships for migration purposes. Severe penalties are necessary to punish those involved and to discourage any other persons from considering involvement in this disgraceful business. The arrangement of a non-genuine marriage or de facto relationship for migration purposes will be punishable by a penalty of 10 years imprisonment or a fine of $100,000 or both. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is also essential that the Government discourage persons from entering into fraudulent relationships. For this reason a term of two years imprisonment may be imposed on the Australian citizen or permanent resident who is convicted of nominating another person as his or her spouse where that person has no intention of living in a genuine and continuing marital or de facto relationship. The person who applies for residence on the basis of the contrived relationship may not only be subject to two years imprisonment upon conviction, but may also be removed from Australia as an illegal entrant. </PARA>
<PARA>  This complements the Government's earlier introduction of longer qualification periods to demonstrate the genuine and continuing nature of relationships and to discourage fraudulent relationships. I am advised that there are a number of people providing supporting statements which claim that others are in a genuine and continuing relationship when in fact they are not. It is necessary for the law to provide a check to ensure that persons making supporting statements are certain of their facts. Offences have been created for knowingly making a false or misleading statement, or making a false or misleading statement without having made sure that the statement was correct. </PARA>
<PARA>  These offences will only be operative when the departmental form on which the supporting declaration is made contains a warning of the penalties for making such false or reckless statements. Persons wishing to provide supporting statements will be clearly warned by the notice on the form of the possible consequences if their statement is false or misleading. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members will recall my announcement on 30 April of this year of the Government's decision to introduce a special assistance category in the 1991-92 migration program. This new category has been established to target people in need who do not meet the refugee and other special humanitarian criteria but who nevertheless are considered by the Government to have special humanitarian claims on Australia. In the past these groups did not qualify under the existing program criteria. </PARA>
<PARA>  The special assistance category will be introduced by regulation. As I announced in April, decisions will be made each year by the Government on groups which are identified as being eligible and the numbers which can be accommodated. The Government recognises that program capacities will be limited. For this reason the Bill will amend the Act to allow the Minister by gazettal to set a limit on the number of places available. </PARA>
<PARA>  The changes proposed by clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill mean that once the announced program limit is reached, there would be no further consideration of applications. These application capping powers will only apply to those classes where use of the power is specifically permitted under the regulations. The powers are, in effect, an extension of the capping powers already found in sections 28 and 40 of the Act. As I have mentioned, their introduction is principally intended to give effect to the new special assistance category. I would not rule out the possibility of the Government using the powers in relation to other humanitarian responses which may need to be put in place in the future. We need to have available the legislative tools to respond flexibly to the growing mass movement of peoples throughout the world. Honourable members can be assured that this power will not be used in relation to preferential family cases. This would be consistent with the approach already reflected in sections 28 and 40 of the Act. Any person who lodges a fee with an application which is subject to the capping power will have the fee returned if the application falls outside the capped number. </PARA>
<PARA>  A further amendment to be made to the Migration Act by this Bill will allow criteria in the regulations to include, by reference, matters published by notice in the Gazette from time to time. This will overcome the limitation imposed by section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act requiring these notices to be in existence at the time the regulation is made. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, these amendments demonstrate the Government's continued vigilance to ensure that the effectiveness of Australia's immigration controls is maintained and, where necessary, enhanced so that only those persons with a right to enter and remain in Australia may do so. The amending provisions will not impact on the costs of administering the migration program. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Evidence Bill has two main objects. The first is to provide a modern evidence law applicable in all Federal courts and, until the Australian Capital Territory enacts a new evidence law, in ACT courts. The second is to provide for proof of Commonwealth records in all Australian courts. This Bill is largely based on recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission in its report on evidence. A Bill also based largely on the Law Reform Commission's recommendations was introduced into the New South Wales Legislative Assembly earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is my hope that the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories will be able to agree on substantially uniform evidence laws, using both the Commonwealth Bill and the New South Wales Bill as a basis for consideration. It is highly desirable that substantial uniformity, particularly in the area of business records, is pursued. Business could achieve substantial savings in its record keeping costs if uniformity is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>  There can, I believe, be no doubt that the law of evidence is greatly in need of reform. The reference to the Law Reform Commission on evidence was given by the then Attorney-General, Senator Durack, on 18 July 1979. It resulted from a recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in November 1977. That Committee had a reference on the Evidence (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1972. It recommended that a review of the whole of the law of evidence be undertaken by the Law Reform Commission with a view to producing a wholly comprehensive code of evidence based on concepts appropriate to the present day. </PARA>
<PARA>  In its report, the Law Reform Commission, after extensive consultation, stated that there should be a comprehensive uniform law of evidence applying in Federal courts and that the laws of evidence now applying in Federal and Territory courts are badly in need of reform in all areas. At present, by operation of sections 79 and 80 of the Judiciary Act 1903, the evidence laws of the State or Territory in which a Federal court is sitting apply in that court. The law is the common law, as varied by statute in each jurisdiction. Significant differences occur from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Thus, the preparation by a practitioner of a case before the Federal Court of Australia may differ, depending on where the trial is likely to take place, and if evidence is limited, its outcome may depend on where the trial does take place. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Law Reform Commission reported about the state of present evidence laws, and the need for their reform, in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>The present law is the product of unsystematic statutory and judicial development. It is a highly complex body of law which is arcane even to most legal practitioners. It contains traps and pitfalls which are likely to leave the unrepresented litigant baffled, frustrated and defeated. There are also many areas of uncertainty in the law of evidence--areas on which definitive law is yet to be pronounced by the courts. The need for reform is also demonstrated by what happens in practice: the complexities are ignored, oversimplified versions of the law are applied and judges try to discourage use of its technicalities. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I mentioned, the Bill is based largely on the Law Reform Commission's recommendations. It also repeals, and re-enacts with some modifications, most of the provisions of the Evidence Act 1905. The Bill also includes a number of provisions the Law Reform Commission considered outside its terms of reference. These provisions, dealing mostly with procedural matters, are drawn from the ACT Evidence Ordinance and, in the interests of uniformity, from the recently introduced New South Wales Evidence Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will apply in all federal courts--the High Court, the Federal Court and the Family Court--and, at least until responsibility for evidence law in the Australian Capital Territory passes to the ACT authorities next year, in the ACT courts. While passage of the Bill will be a proper discharge of the Commonwealth's responsibility to provide the Australian Capital Territory with an up-to-date evidence law, the Bill provides for a proclamation to be made to terminate the application of most of its provisions in the ACT courts. A proclamation would be made if the ACT Legislative Assembly passes its own evidence law. </PARA>
<PARA>  The re-enacted provisions of the Evidence Act 1905 will continue to apply as they now apply to proceedings in all Australian courts and tribunals, to proceedings in courts exercising federal jurisdiction or to certain specific proceedings in the Federal Court. Further, the provisions of the Bill reforming the law relating to documentary evidence are to apply to the use of Commonwealth records as evidence in any proceedings before a court or tribunal in Australia. This will enable the Commonwealth to achieve significant savings in record keeping costs. The retention of original documents is now necessary because of the best evidence rule and diverse State and Territory documentary evidence laws. </PARA>
<PARA>  Several of the topics upon which the Law Reform Commission made recommendations are not included in the Bill. One topic--tape recordings of admissions--has been the subject of legislative reform earlier this year in the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Act 1991. This Act followed the report Detention Before Charge by the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law. Another topic omitted is identification evidence. Possible legislation on identification evidence is under consideration in the context of the Fifth Interim Report of the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill follows the structure and, to a large extent, also the language of a draft Bill prepared by the Law Reform Commission. However, because the Bill does not deal with all the matters covered by the Law Reform Commission, it does not enact a code of evidence. Existing common law and State and Territory evidence laws will have effect subject to inconsistency with the Bill. However, because the Bill is comprehensive, the scope for operation of these laws will be quite limited. Special evidentiary provisions in other Commonwealth Acts and prescribed ACT laws are preserved by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are two dominant themes in the Bill. The first is to remove unnecessary restrictions on relevant evidence being put before courts. The second is to take into account modern technology. It is artificial, and in many instances absurd, to limit the material a fact-finding tribunal can accept as evidence. The Bill will reform the existing rules relating to admission of hearsay evidence. A hearsay statement of a person who witnessed the relevant event--first hand hearsay--is to be admissible, subject to safeguards such as the giving of notice to other parties and to the calling, if available, of the person who made it in civil proceedings and for the defence in criminal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>  Only specific categories of first hand hearsay evidence similar to evidence able to be led under a number of the present common law exceptions to the hearsay rule are to be generally admissible, subject also to the same safeguards against the defence in criminal proceedings. More remote hearsay is to be admissible if it falls within one of a number of categories inherently reliable for some reason; for example, because it is a business record. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill abolishes the best evidence rule under which, generally, the contents of a document had to be proved by production of the original. The Bill provides a number of ways in which the contents of documents can be proved, including photocopies, facsimile copies, microfilm output or optical laser reader output. The computer output will also be admissible. Safeguards are provided in relation to the testing of documents and of the means by which documents have been produced or kept. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposes amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 to provide for the reporting and analysis of international telegraphic transfer data. The reporting of international telegraphic transfers will complement the existing requirements under the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 for cash dealers to report to the Cash Transaction Reports Agency (CTRA) those transactions which are either suspect or involve cash in excess of $10,000 and for individuals to report the export and import of currency in excess of $5,000. The existing reporting system fills a gap left by the removal of a system of tax screening arrangements and foreign currency controls which ceased to operate from 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>  The success of the CTRA, as described in its recently tabled annual report, has been impressive. The degree of effectiveness of the agency, still in its infancy, reflects the enormous goodwill and cooperation of the financial sector in assisting law enforcement, and the growing expertise of our revenue and law enforcement agencies in dealing with the financial aspects of illegal activity. </PARA>
<PARA>  This measure now proposed will assist in combating large scale tax evasion and organised crime. The trend in tax evasion and corporate crime is to internationalise illicit profits, and international telegraphic transfers are the principal means by which funds are channelled from Australia overseas. The reporting of the data to the CTRA will allow the easy collection, analysis and immediate dissemination to law enforcement agencies of accurate information relating to international telegraphic transfers of funds. </PARA>
<PARA>  In March 1991 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial and Public Administration--the Martin Committee--in considering the issue of international profit shifting found evidence of the perpetration of large scale revenue evasion, possibly of the order of $100m to $250m, and recommended that a system of monitoring and reporting international telegraphic transfers of funds be implemented, with the CTRA responsible for the establishment and administration of such a system. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Martin Committee has indicated that the capture and analysis of telegraphic transfer data would add a significant dimension to the ability of the Australian Taxation Office and law enforcement agencies to strike at financial gain, which is the major incentive of international organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA>  Existing reporting systems do not adequately provide for the monitoring of international transactions. This is a serious deficiency since it deprives the Australian Taxation Office of an important source of intelligence in its efforts to combat international profit shifting to avoid tax liability. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some international telegraphic transfers have been reported to the CTRA in the form of suspect transactions. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg in international profit shifting activities. Telegraphic transfers are effected in a very impersonal manner without the counter contact which brings the staff member face to face with the customer in circumstances where he or she might notice something peculiar about the transaction. As pointed out in the Martin report, because of the sophistication of the abuse of withholding tax arrangements, the likelihood of the associated transactions being reported through the CTRA's reporting arrangements is minimal. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the issue of tax avoidance, the Martin committee received evidence indicating that arrangements or schemes are operating in Australia which allow Australian residents to avoid their taxation obligations by paying 10 per cent withholding tax instead of personal or company rates of income tax. Some of the schemes are extremely complex and difficult to detect, involving circuitous routes through various countries, including tax havens, and can often reappear as legitimate transactions. </PARA>
<PARA>  A feasibility study has shown not only the real need for law enforcement agencies to have access to information about such transfers to trace the profits of criminal activity for taxation and confiscation purposes, but also that many cash dealers are in a position to readily provide much of this information. The remainder is transmitted by telex. While the proposed legislation will require the reporting of transfers transmitted by telex, the Government is conscious of the burden that this could impose on those cash dealers who conduct a high volume of telex transfers and whose systems are not computerised. It is therefore proposed to exempt those cash dealers from reporting telex transfers until the telex systems are computerised. International telegraphic transfer data is already in electronic form for transmission through the SWIFT --Society for World-wide International Financial Telecommunication--system and can be duplicated by cash dealers and transmitted on line to the CTRA. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said earlier, the measures in the Bill will provide a necessary tool for detecting offshore tax rorts, which are believed to be flourishing, and for assisting in the appropriate assessment of tax liability. Conservative estimates are of revenue gains in excess of $37m per annum. The CTRA considers that 85 per cent of non-cash funds transfers are remitted offshore through the telegraphic transfer system. The Taxation Institute of Australia indicates how a substantial sum can slip through the reporting system as it currently operates. One instance is where, for example, $1m--perhaps the proceeds of a successful drug importation in the process of being laundered--is remitted to a tax haven by telegraphic transfer. This would not be reported since it is not in the form of cash. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this respect, the current system is narrower in its scope than the previous tax screening system. Lost taxation revenue may, in fact, exceed $100m per year, according to the Martin report, with additional lost customs revenue estimated at $10m per year and proceeds of crime at $30m. In contrast, the cost of implementing the proposal is relatively modest. The outlay in the first two years will be $13.8m because of the capital investment in information technology facilities but will be less than $5m in subsequent years. There will also be costs to cash dealers, principally in the modification of computer equipment to duplicate existing data for transmission to the CTRA. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Bankers' Association and representatives of other major cash dealers groups have worked closely with officers of my Department and the CTRA in the development of this initiative, and I wish to thank them for their cooperation and support. This cooperation is continuing in the development of appropriate technology to permit the monitoring of such transfers to ensure the effectiveness of the scheme and its appropriateness to the practices of the finance industry. The Bill will make provision to protect banks, whether Australian or foreign, operating in Australia from any possible legal action which may arise in Australia from the banks complying with the reporting requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also proposes two minor amendments to the CTR Act: first, to clarify the last point in time when a person is able to make a report to a Customs officer when bringing currency into or taking it out of Australia; and, secondly, to change the name of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre--AUSTRAC--and the name of the Act to the Financial Transaction Reports Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also includes a provision to clarify the obligation to report in section 15 of the Act. That section requires a person bringing into, or taking out of, Australia currency of a value greater than $A5,000 to make a report in a prescribed form to a Customs officer. An uncertainty was brought to light in a recent South Australian Supreme Court decision which held that a report could still be filed during a Customs baggage search without breach of the provision. The amendment clarifies this obligation by defining the last point in time when reports of such transfers can be made--namely, prior to baggage search or prior to being given permission to leave the Customs control area without search for inwards passengers, and the point where Customs officers inspect passports for outwards passengers. Provision is also made in relation to persons other than passengers--crew, for example. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will also amend the name of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre. This title will more accurately reflect the nature of the Agency's major operations since, particularly with the addition of the reporting of international telegraphic transfers, only a minor proportion of the Agency's operations will relate to cash transactions. For the same reason, the name of the Act will also be changed to the Financial Transaction Reports Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, I stress that the country cannot afford to continue to suffer the vast revenue losses through tax and customs evasion or tolerate the removal offshore of the proceeds of some of our most serious crimes. The average Australian is tired of seeing the high fliers rort the system. The shareholders of this country are tired of seeing their investments moved offshore, seemingly without trace and certainly beyond their reach, often for the personal gain of unscrupulous manipulators. Lack of means to detect and trace such movements is a serious weakness in the system which must now be remedied. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We have been examining the adequacy of Government policies with regard to amendments to the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. There is no doubt about it: the Government's policies have been established as completely inappropriate, harsh and lacking in real understanding of the difficulties of manufacturing industries. The Government's lack of understanding and harshness is highlighted by two measures in particular that are contained within this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government has identified, I believe, by its statements and by some of the attitudes expressed by Ministers, the difficulties and problems in the Australian community today. One would have to be blind not to recognise that there are huge and increasing queues of people seeking unemployment benefits. One would have to be both deaf and blind to fail to recognise that there is a massive 70 per cent increase in the number of bankruptcies in Australia today.</PARA>
<PARA>  Despite the indications that the Government has belatedly noticed that there is high unemployment and a high level of bankruptcies, it has not been able to respond in an appropriate way. In the Government's industry statement, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) laid down a course of action for the Government. Little of it has been fulfilled, much has not been done, and the Government has not moved ahead to initiate reforms to the Australian way of life for which it is responsible so that the benefits can flow through to the community, and so that there can be an increase in productivity and efficiency in Australian industry, a creation of jobs in the process, and a better chance for all Australians. The Government, instead, has chosen to continue its destructive policies of high interest rates and, at the same time as running a high interest rate policy, it has chosen to reduce tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nothing could be designed to dramatically destroy Australian manufacturing capacity more than running the dual policies of high interest rates and a reduction of tariffs. There is no compensatory feature for Australian job creators or Australian manufacturing industries. We have had the Government running the worst possible agenda for creating jobs and making Australia productive and efficient. It acknowledges the disaster that these policies are causing but is unable--it is hamstrung--to find remedies and alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be well aware that there has been a struggle within the Australian Labor Party over ideas as to who among the potential leaders of that Party can offer the best direction for the Australian people. Part of the reason for the struggle is the lack of direction the Government has given to Australians and the concern being expressed by the members of the Government and the whole community for the future of Australia in relation to job opportunities, the potential to buy a house and the potential to raise a family. Nothing has been done to increase efficiency or to reform our productivity levels, which are low when measured by world standards. Nothing has been done in the workplace to make Australians feel confident about their future. </PARA>
<PARA>  The whole community knows about the difficulties that occurred at SPC and is aware that they are reflected right throughout workplace relations. In New South Wales a strike has been called for tomorrow or next week rather than trying to negotiate on the difficulties. Power hungry union leaders are clinging to their cars, their salaries and their expense accounts rather than trying to work through the problems. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are two features of this legislation that are of particular interest to me. The first is the decision made by the Government to wipe out, ahead of time, tariff protection for a very small industry, an industry affecting two or three manufacturers. I refer to the manufacturers of audio tapes and audio players. The Opposition agrees to the predictable decline in the level of tariffs, and we endorse that process. But in this instance the Government has chosen to honour some foreign agreement and wind down the tariff more quickly than it indicated previously it would do. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other feature that is of interest to me is that the Government has decided to give increasing preference to foreign manufacturers to enter Australia. The Government continually talks about a level playing field, that is, one where all self-interests are balanced. I do not think it really occurs in fact. But surely our self-interest in this area must be predictable as we gain efficiency for Australian manufacturing industries and not be so stupid as to give preferences to competitors where it is not warranted. We should be contracting the number of developing countries to which we provide a system of tariff preferences. There should be a systematic process of assessing those preferences and dealing with them. </PARA>
<PARA>  Preference in this instance offers a 5 per cent margin for all dutiable items entering Australia where the general tariff rate is 5 per cent or higher, so there is a 5 per cent tariff. To give an example, if there is a 10 per cent tariff generally applying to a product being imported, developing countries which have a 5 per cent preference pay a rate of duty of 5 per cent and if the Australian rate of duty is 5 per cent or less, no tariff is paid. So a definite preference is given to developing countries. That may be all very well; it does give to some countries access to Australia at favoured rates. But when one comes to look at the schedule of the Customs Tariff Act, one finds that about 168 countries are designated as developing countries and have this favoured treatment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The names of the countries are laid out in three parts. There are the islands of the South Pacific Forum, which are our near neighbours and friends and should not at any stage--certainly not in the near future--be considered for removal from the developing nation status.  Then there are developing countries, including countries which are our competitors and selling their products on world markets. They are countries such as Brazil, Chile, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, where I believe the standard of living is such that they could no longer be termed developing countries. It is time the Government looked at this issue. The Opposition has made a commitment to examine the developing country preferences given in relation to tariffs and re-order that process, because it is long past the time when that should be done. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government, however, instead of saying even that it will conduct an examination of this process, has recently added Hungary and Poland, and now Czechoslovakia and Namibia, to this legislation, so that the Government is increasing the list of countries that can export goods to Australia on a favoured basis. At the same time the Government is running down at an accelerated and unpredictable rate the protection for Australian industry.  It is inconsistent and very damaging for the Australian community that the Government should adopt these attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australian exports to developing countries are worth about $17 billion a year, accounting for about 36 per cent of Australia's exports. Imports from developing countries are worth about $12 billion, or about 23 per cent. However, 60 per cent of imports from what Australia terms developing countries are from Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, China, Hong Kong and Malaysia, many of which could not be any longer regarded as developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is time the Government took stock of where its inconsistent policies are leading Australia. There can be no confidence whilst it is so inconsistent. The Czechoslovak Republic will be added to the list in the legislation. Australia had about $63m worth of exports to Czechoslovakia in 1990. The balance of trade was $22m in Australia's favour. As to Namibia, we exported approximately $1.8m worth of goods, with a balance of trade of about $1.7m in our favour. </PARA>
<PARA>  I understand the need for self-interest in these areas, but true self-interest is to be able to allow Australians to flourish and to work in their own place of habitation. The Government is not encouraging that. This legislation is minor legislation. The principles are prime principles, because the principles that the Government has applied in this legislation are ones that are destroying jobs and creating bankruptcies. What the Government needs to do is re-examine these principles of preference for developing countries. It needs to provide a predictable downturn in tariff protection so that Australian manufacturers and job creators know what is happening and can make appropriate investments. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There are two Bills in this cognate debate: the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1991 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. The purpose of the amendment in the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill is to increase the rate of excise on certain naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG, and to reduce the rate of excise on aviation gasoline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Australia's demonstrated economic reserves of LPG are equivalent to about 30 years supply at current rates of production. However, in the absence of new projects, production of LPG is expected to decline from the current level to 1.6 million tonnes by the year 2000, particularly as the production from the Bass Strait fields declines. Refinery production of LPG as a by-product of petroleum refining is expected to remain fairly constant. </PARA>
<PARA>  Demand for LPG in all its uses in Australia has grown by an annual average of 12 per cent in recent years--far faster, I add, than for other fuels. Demand for LPG is still growing rapidly at a rate which would require significant imports within a few years. Development of further LPG reserves will depend on the exploration for and development of oil and gas discoveries. That in turn will depend on developers receiving world market prices for their oil, gas and LPG. Only world prices will encourage companies to develop further new discoveries for the Australian market, and only world prices will induce explorers to spend the capital to provide future supplies. </PARA>
<PARA>  We did enter into this debate last year when the Middle East crisis was on our hands and we saw an escalation in the cost of fuel. I wish we could isolate ourselves from oil price increases. But Australia can no more isolate itself from world oil and gas prices than it can isolate itself from world trade. If we cannot develop more LPG reserves, we will end up importing it--at world prices. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 1 January this year we saw the introduction of deregulation of the LPG industry. The Prices Surveillance Authority no longer determines the producer-wholesale prices of LPG. The industry is now free to negotiate market prices for LPG. In place of its previous role, the PSA has increased monitoring of distributor and retail prices of LPG to ensure that there is no exploitation of consumers. If prices are found to have increased beyond a reasonable level, individual producers and marketers may find themselves declared under the provisions of the Prices Surveillance Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  Liquefied petroleum gas in automotive use does have some environmental advantages over petrol, although its consumption still produces carbon dioxide and other exhaust emissions, and its environmental advantages should not be overstated. An important factor in dealing with environmental problems is getting the price signals right. In a more deregulated market, prices reflect more closely the real costs of supply and the nature of the fuel, including its environmental characteristics. </PARA>
<PARA>  The full effects of deregulation are not likely to be evident for some time. There is no doubt that deregulation will be in the long term interests of consumers. Already there has been a great deal of interest in the market, with a number of large investments being planned and committed into infrastructure and distribution facilities. The seasonal shortages that have plagued the market in past years appear to have been overcome. Deregulation is giving greater confidence to producers. It is certainly becoming a more dynamic market, with healthy competition and more expansion being encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA>  The increase in the rate of excise on LPG proposed in this Bill is for the period 1 April 1991 to 30 June 1991. The reason that the proposed increase will apply only from 1 April to 30 June is that from 1 July 1991 the excise on LPG will be replaced by a resource rent tax under the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reason for the increase in the rate of excise from $5.789 per kilolitre to $35.94 per kilolitre is that it reflects the higher export prices obtained for LPG during the Gulf war. The increase in the excise rate for naturally occurring LPG is estimated to result in an increase of $9.4m in excise receipts for the three months commencing 1 April 1991. The excise arrangements for LPG apply only to LPG from a limited range of sources, with LPG produced from refineries, onshore fields or fields that commenced production after 16 August 1977 excluded from the arrangements. The result is that only LPG produced in Bass Strait is covered by the arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second amendment in this Bill refers to the excise on aviation gasoline which contributes towards recovering the costs of en route terminal navigation rescue and firefighting services and facilities where no specific charges apply for those services. In July 1991 the Civil Aviation Authority announced that it would remove rescue and firefighting services from capital city secondary airports. These included Bankstown, Essendon, Moorabbin, Archerfield, Parafield, and Jandakot in Western Australia. The CAA's decision to withdraw its rescue and firefighting services from the six secondary airports followed a comprehensive review of existing RFFS arrangements which involved input from the aviation industry, local authorities, metropolitan fire brigades and the Federal Airports Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The effect of this amendment will be to decrease the excise rate on avgas by 0.321c per litre from 27.395c per litre to 27.074c per litre. The reduction in the rate of excise and customs duty on the gasoline for use in aircraft will reduce the Commonwealth revenue by approximately $340,000 for 1991-92. The money appropriated to the CAA will accordingly be reduced by that amount. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second Bill is the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. In 1966 Australia became the first country to introduce tariff preferences for developing countries. The previous speaker, the honourable member of Mitchell (Mr Cadman), seemed to be critical to some degree of our position on developing country preferences. The Australian system of tariff preferences for developing countries, ASTP, was established under a special waiver granted by the contracting parties to the GATT. It consisted of a non-reciprocal preferential agreement arrangement under which specified manufactured and semi-manufactured goods could be imported from developing countries free of duty or at reduced rates of duty subject to quota limitations on imports at the developing country preferential rate. </PARA>
<PARA>  This system has been reviewed a number of times and the system currently in force addresses a wide range of concerns. Essentially, the current system provides a trade-off for the Australian domestic industry whereby a single low 5 per cent preference margin was introduced in return for wider coverage of imports from developing countries. In the March industry statement we announced the progressive exclusion of Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea--the four big tigers of Asia--from benefits under the Australian system of tariff preferences, and rightly so. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1989 Australian exports to developing countries amounted to $17 billion, accounting for 36 per cent of total Australian exports. Imports from developing countries amounted to $12 billion, accounting for 23 per cent of total Australian imports. That raises a very interesting point. We have a trade surplus of $5 billion--these are 1989 figures--with developing countries. When all politicians are under a bit of pressure, and particularly given that our rural sector is under pressure, it is easy to talk about the old McEwenism, the tariff monkey on our back, and to say, `Let us put up protection'. But the real losers would be Australian producers, in agriculture, manufacturing and in the service sector, because we have a trade surplus with these countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other important thing is that, by allowing these countries to find markets, their standard of living will rise, consumer demand will rise and we will gain access to even bigger markets. It is often very hard to go out and tell that to people when things are tough. But it is the right way to go, and it was encouraging, when members of this House were in Brussels recently, that all political parties supported the right proposition, together, united. It is in our long term interests to break down the protectionism of the European Community and the USA. Australia is leading the way not only in free trade through the Cairns Group. It is not naive because, without that, we would not survive. Eighty per cent of our markets have to be found overseas. The fact is that we are leading the way in supporting these preferential rates for developing countries. In the long term it helps also the security in our region. When countries have access to markets, the likelihood of problems between countries is broken down, so it is a very beneficial process. </PARA>
<PARA>  But we have to watch continually to see whether countries are improving their standard of living. A country comes to my mind as one that over time will also eventually pass into the category that Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea have. I refer to Thailand because its economy is improving dramatically. But at present Thailand is not one of those countries to be considered. These preferences are beneficial particularly when we have a trade surplus in our favour. Obviously, it will be hard to continue to argue such a large trade surplus with those countries because trade is about bilateral trade. We fill up ships with our products and send them to a country. It is commonsense and economically rational to send something back in those ships. Without back loading, the shipping companies would go broke and countries would not trade on that basis. So that is the very root of the problem, which is why these measures are beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA>  Schedule 6 of this Bill, which is operative on and from 1 October 1991, accords developing country status to Czechoslovakia. The Government has also accorded that status to Namibia. It is sad and a tragedy that a country with such a great history as Czechoslovakia has to come under this proposition today--a country that suffered under the regimes of fascism and communism for so long and a country that has produced so many first class quality products. Let us hope that in a short time it will be able to move out of that category once again, but it is entitled to come under that category at present. Let us hope that, with a lot of wisdom and hard work, those Eastern bloc countries will get back to where they once were. The countries involved in the Renaissance were returned to the Dark Ages for far too long. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill will also give effect to certain of Australia's obligations under the Florence agreement. In accordance with this agreement, Australia will remove duties on such goods as magnetic recording media, film, catalogues, bibliographical information, transparencies and aids to the disabled. To date, 79 nations, including the United States, Japan and the European Community nations, have acceded to the Florence agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>  In January this year the Customs Tariff Amendment Act 1991 was assented to. Among other things, this Act amended the Customs Tariff Act 1987 to allow duty free importation from 1 January 1991 of invalid carriages, for example, wheelchairs. However, the amendments did not extend to parts of invalid carriages which currently are dutiable at a rate of 17 per cent. The amendment proposed by this Bill is intended to correct this anomaly. The cost of removing the duty for parts of wheelchairs, in terms of Customs duty forgone, is estimated at about $100,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Burnett region of my electorate around Gayndah and Mundubbera is a vast citrus growing area, one of the biggest and best in Australia. The Queensland citrus industry has experienced delays and rejection of some consignments in the past due to the variable presence of symptoms of the disease black spot on fruit. A recent protocol agreement will mean that Queensland suppliers can now export with greater certainty as New Zealand will have more assurance that products shipped under agreement will meet their quarantine requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last year saw the introduction of stricter controls for the labelling of imported fruit juice. I have recently met with the Committee of Direction of Fruit Marketing in Brisbane to discuss a submission for stricter controls on the labelling of fresh fruit and vegetables, and processed products as well. We require the agreement of all States. A committee of inquiry is under way at the moment. I have stressed the need for this to be the first cab off the rank in investigation. As soon as we have this labelling, consumers will be able to use their own preference to choose Aussie products. Without resorting to the tariff barriers of the past, I am convinced that we will be able to reduce the demand for products that are imported from overseas in our supermarkets and not be contrary to the GATT. Already the Queensland banana growers are promoting the Broncos, the best rugby league team in the competition. If we can get more promotion like that, we will be able to outdo the imported products because we produce first class quality products. </PARA>

<PARA>  Australian citrus growers have recently sought Commonwealth assistance to counter sharp falls in world orange juice prices, which have eroded producer returns. After examination of the problems facing the citrus industry, the Government decided to provide a grant of $2m to the Australian Horticultural Corporation, the AHC, over the period 1990 to 1993 for special marketing projects for Australian fresh fruit juice and fresh oranges. The AHC estimated that $1.1m would be spent in 1990-91 and revised estimates were submitted. The implementation of this program was delayed with the result that no request for funds for 1990-91 was received. The AHC estimates that it will use approximately $833,000 of the funds in the 1991-92 financial year. Provision of the funds is expected to result in increased promotion and marketing of fresh Australian oranges and Australian fruit juice. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the August 1991 edition of the Australian Citrus News, the Chairman of the Australian Citrus Growers Federation said:</PARA>
<PARA>Overseas markets were tough and competitive, demanding quality fruit delivered reliably and on time. The citrus industry's target of doubling exports within five years would be reached only with a professional and coordinated approach to growing, packing and marketing. </PARA>
<PARA>He stated that there was increased overseas interest in Australian oranges this year after heavy crop losses in last December's Californian freeze. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendment in schedule 4 of this Bill defines orange juice to include products of oranges, regardless of methods of derivation. This amendment restores the intended rates of assistance for orange juice following representations from the citrus industry. Currently, orange pulp wash concentrate is classified as a food preparation and as such imports are dutiable at a general rate of 10 per cent. The effect of the proposed amendment will be to increase the general rate applicable to 18 per cent. I am very pleased to support both these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I welcome the opportunity to make some remarks in today's debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. The Bill before the House is largely a housekeeping exercise but includes some important provisions which deserve comment. This debate is occurring at a time when the Government's industry policy is in a state of chaos. Despite the promise of a new start in the March ministerial statement, Building a Competitive Australia, this Bill highlights the Government's piecemeal approach to industry and trade reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Bill before the House contains a number of schedules and I will offer some brief comments on those which have major significance. Schedule 1 is a housekeeping provision and amends the principal Act by providing free rates of duty for pre-tanned bovine leather. This provision corrects an anomaly created by conversion to the harmonised tariff and is effective from 1 July 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>  Schedule 2 is a more complex matter. Honourable members will be aware that this amendment is in response to the 1990 report of the Industry Commission dealing with tariff penalties, as they apply to aids and appliances for the disabled. At the time of the Commission's report, the general rate of tariff for wheelchairs was 17 per cent, with 12 per cent for developing countries. The Commission recommended that the tariff on wheelchairs be set at 15 per cent on 1 July 1991 and then be reduced by 5 per cent each year until it reaches zero on 1 January 1994. The Commission concluded that a reduction in such tariffs was unlikely to have a severe adverse effect on local manufacturers. The Customs Tariff Amendment Act 1991 went further than the Commission's recommendations and from 1 January 1991 the import of wheelchairs has been free of duty. </PARA>
<PARA>  Schedule 2 corrects an anomaly--forewarned by the coalition--and it reduces the tariffs on wheelchair parts, currently dutiable at 17 per cent, to zero. This amendment has the support of the coalition. I would suggest that the Government was untidy in its amendments in the Customs Tariff Amendment Act 1991 and the anomaly should not have arisen. The need for this amendment highlights the danger and stupidity of ad hoc tariff changes. The Government should have a policy which is comprehensive and which Australian industry understands and can anticipate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Schedule 4 redefines orange juice to include the products of oranges, regardless of derivation. As part of its economic statement in May 1988, the Government announced that the tariff on citrus juices would be converted to an ad valorem rate and be phased to 15 per cent by 1 July 1992 and 10 per cent for developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  In recent years, the import of Brazilian citrus produce has had a significant impact on the production and prices of Australian orange juice. The relatively low prices and the increase in availability of Brazilian produce and the sharp falls in world orange juice prices have resulted in Australian citrus growers seeking Commonwealth assistance. This amendment is part of the Federal Government's response. Federal Cabinet has rejected a proposal for a price underwriting scheme for oranges, as proposed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), and a price stabilisation scheme, as proposed by the citrus industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  It appears that the effect of this amendment is to give additional protection from imports to the local producers of orange pulp wash. Under current provisions, pulp wash concentrate is classified as a food preparation and imports attract a duty of 10 per cent, and 5 per cent for developing countries. The effect of this amendment will be to increase the tariff to 18 per cent, and 13 per cent for developing countries, as from 10 April 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  Schedule 5 reduces the duty rate for aviation gas by 0.321c per litre following a decision by the Civil Aviation Authority to withdraw its rescue and firefighting services from capital city secondary airports. Such an airport is the Moorabbin airport which is situated in my electorate of Isaacs. Whilst I do not wish to debate at length the merits of the decision of the Civil Aviation Authority, I wish to place on record my concern that the withdrawal of the rescue and firefighting services from airports such as Moorabbin may lead to a significant decline in the safety of users at such airports. I note the concerns of the United Firefighters Union of Australia in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 2 July 1991, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The specialised airport units, reached the scene of an accident at any of these airports, within two minutes, while it would take up to eight minutes for outside fire brigades to arrive. Added to this, they have not been properly trained in dealing with an aviation accident, which is a specialised field. </PARA>
<PARA>Similar concerns have also been expressed to me by representatives from the firefighting service at Moorabbin airport. Schedule 5 also implements measures to enable Australia's partial accession to the 1950 UNESCO Florence agreement on the importation of goods of an educational, scientific and cultural character. Included with these changes is the introduction of zero duty for audio cassettes as from 1 July 1991, which previously attracted a duty of 17 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Schedule 6 includes Czechoslovakia and Namibia as countries eligible for developing country status and preferential duty rates. This provision gives these two countries a discount of 5 per cent off the general industry assistance tariffs over 5 per cent. In the March 1991 economic statement, Building a Competitive Australia, the Government announced that tariff preferences for Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea will be phased out by 1 July 1992. While I welcome the removal of these countries off the list of developing countries for trade preference, I am concerned that this Bill seeks to add additional countries on an ad hoc basis. Rather than engaging in an overall review of countries receiving tariff preference, we see here yet another example of policy on the run. I can see why Namibia is deserving of preferential treatment, but how can it be argued that Czechoslovakia and Namibia are deserving of the same treatment? Czechoslovakia is an industrialised country. Certainly its development has been hampered by its Eastern bloc involvement, but to describe it as developing is certainly generous. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members will be well aware of Czechoslovakian products such as Zetor tractors, Skoda cars, fine glassware and crystal, to name just a few. Yet this Bill seeks to place Czechoslovakia on the same level as Namibia. I find this difficult to understand. If we continue the process of extending developing country status to more and more countries, then this continues to undermine Australian industry and it negates the whole process of phased and predictable tariff reductions. It is even harder to accept when I see that the inclusion of Czechoslovakia will cost $1.7m per annum in lost duty, while the inclusion of Namibia will cost the princely sum of $7,000. </PARA>
<PARA>  The coalition does not oppose the changes to Australian protectionism. We believe that in many cases the level of protectionism is a burden on the community and industry itself. Protectionism encourages resource misallocation, the development of inward looking industries and a lack of efficiency. As a result, the coalition is supportive of any moves to reduce this burden and to make Australia more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, the very important difference between the coalition's policy and the Government's policies is that the coalition will ensure that these reductions in tariffs are in conjunction with major micro-economic reforms. This would include reforming the industrial relations system, including the dismantling of the centralised wage fixing system, eliminating inefficiencies in transport, cleaning up the waterfront and opening up the telecommunications sector, to name just a few. Unlike the Government, we would therefore be addressing the issues of low productivity, high interest rates and an artificially high currency. As a result, business will be able to compete in a fair and competitive environment. The barriers and hurdles which currently exist and cost industry in this country approximately $17.5 billion per annum in the micro-economic reform area alone will be removed and the need for protection will diminish. But it is imperative that the necessary micro-economic reforms are in place before we remove the protection or else we will send Australian industry to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA>  The search and desire for a level playing field is admirable, but let us not create a playing field that has lush green grass at one end and a mud patch at the other. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise this afternoon to join the cognate debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2). This Bill is quite a broad ranging Bill. It covers topics such as import duty payable on wheelchairs, import duty on orange juice and excise payable on aviation gasoline. The theme of the Bills is import duties and excise rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We know that import duties certainly add to the cost of goods that we supposedly do not produce in Australia. The added costs are a burden on all Australians. Some of the industries that tariffs seek to protect include the motor car industry and the textile clothing and footwear industry. In the area of excise rates we are really talking about duties which fund services provided by the Commonwealth; in other words, they were originally designed to fund services provided on a user-pay basis. </PARA>
<PARA>  Both topics play a crucial role in Australia's economic well-being. I would like to highlight a number of inconsistencies propagated by this Government in relation to the avgas excise. This Excise Tariff Amendment Bill will reduce the rate of excise on gasoline for use in aircraft by a mere 0.321c per litre. It is an infinitesimal amount. The decrease will have effect from 1 July 1991. The rationale behind the proposed reduction in the avgas excise, as explained in the second reading speech, is the withdrawal of the Civil Aviation Authority's rescue and firefighting service from the capital cities' secondary airports. </PARA>
<PARA>  Originally, avgas was legitimised as a fee for service rather than a revenue raising tax. I agree with the principle. It is a very sound principle. The theory then is that if a service is withdrawn, it is costing the customer less, and therefore the product becomes cheaper. However, to be truly equitable and consistent in this debate, fuel excise paid on avgas by primary producers in agricultural production should be subject to an excise rebate similar to the diesel fuel rebate. We have a situation with excise where a diesel fuel rebate exists to cover agricultural production and mining. </PARA>
<PARA>  Remote Australian properties are not privy to an advanced aviation infrastructure. There is certainly no debate in my electorate or in towns such as Birdsville or Charleville about a third runway, which is certainly advanced aviation infrastructure. In the inland of Australia, many aeroplane and helicopter pilots never see infrastructure such as that or airports as advanced as the Canberra airport. In fact, the taxes that they pay on this aviation gas is contributing to the overall aviation infrastructure in Australia today. In 1990, 23 per cent of the total flying hours in Australia were spent on agricultural aerial work. That sort of work entails mustering with helicopters or light aeroplanes, checking water installation facilities, checking where flood waters are and how stock are faring during flood time and, in some cases, dropping fodder to stock stranded by flood waters, and many other day to day operations on a rural property. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1990-91 approximately $6.5m in avgas excise was paid by the agricultural sector alone. A typical property in the inland of Australia uses approximately 3,000 litres of avgas a year. That equates to about $700 or $800 per year for each property in inland Australia which has an aeroplane or a helicopter; people are paying for a service from which they receive no benefit. Of course, larger enterprises will be paying much more than that. This is an inequity; it is an anomaly which should be addressed. It equates to a tax on production, because no service is provided by the payment of this excise. It is a cross-subsidy which is paid by the agricultural sector to the overall aviation infrastructure of Australia, and the agricultural sector receives no benefit from it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I hope the Minister looks at this inequity. It is an area where I believe this Government could simply introduce a Bill to allow avgas to be exempt from excise. In the same way as there is a diesel fuel rebate, there is no reason why avgas could not be exempt from the payment of excise in the agricultural sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  Import duties are also racked with anomalies and discrepancies. The amendment proposed by the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill serves to correct one such anomaly in the Customs Tariff Act 1987. This Act allowed for the duty free importation of wheelchairs without providing the same concession for wheelchair parts. This Bill rectifies that, but it took four years to rectify a very simple anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wonder how long it will take the Minister to address another anomaly that I see. I draw the attention of the House to the levelling of an import duty of 15 per cent on a biological insecticide not produced in Australia but imported from overseas--bacillus thuringiensis, or BT for short. BT occurs naturally in the environment, mainly in the soil, and, when ingested, reduces both feeding and the reproductive efficiency of the adult insect. It is a very important breakthrough. The bacterium is particularly proficient in the control of the cotton bollworm and it is being hailed by authorities as the most environmentally friendly cotton insecticide for the 1990s and for the year 2000 and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA>  The insecticide is imported from the United States and attracts a 15 per cent import duty, resulting in an Australian retail price of $17.50 a litre. The Australian producer pays at least 50 per cent more for this product than his counterpart in the United States pays. At this price, with that impost of a 15 per cent excise tax, there is little incentive for growers to use the insecticide and little incentive for producers, who are very conscious of the costs of their inputs, to move to a biologically friendly insecticide. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has ignored repeated calls to remove the 15 per cent tax and in so doing is prejudicing the future of the insecticide BT for pest control in the Australian cotton industry. Furthermore, the Government's inaction is at the expense of the environment, the local cotton growing industry and Australia generally. At the moment the Australian cotton industry is undergoing significant expansion. There are many farmers in the wheat belts of Australia who are moving into dry land cotton as a result of the corrupt world prices that are currently applying to the world wheat market, and that, of course, is a direct result of the activities of the Europeans and the Americans and the subsidies that they pay on the export of their wheat. </PARA>
<PARA>  The cotton industry is an important industry. We should be trying to encourage its further expansion. Cotton production in this current financial year, 1991-92, is expected to rise by a mammoth 37 per cent over last year's figures. Much of this increase is expected in the dry land areas. The industry is not asking for a subsidy; the industry is requesting the removal of an import duty that is discouraging a technological advance that is going to benefit the environment. I would have thought that, if a government were environmentally conscious and aware of the need to get safer and better herbicides into our agricultural sector, the removal of this 15 per cent import duty would be commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA>  The wool industry represents a further example of the iniquitous and illogical import duty regime of this Federal Government. In 1988 this Government increased the tariff on the finer end of the wool and fabric market, the cool wool area. Prior to this date there was a 2 per cent tariff on fine wool materials. It is very important to look at the timing, because 1988 was the time of very high wool prices in Australia and I think this Government thought, `Let's go for some money; let's see if we can rip a bit out of the wool industry'. It raised the tariffs from 2 per cent to 40 per cent, and it took 1 1/2 years of lobbying by industry to get lightweight wool fabrics exempted from such a tariff. The Government removed the tariff on that imported lightweight wool, which really only fits into the definition of wool of 125 grams per square metre, in other words, fabrics which are of shirt material weight. The Government left in place tariffs on wools in the cool wool category, that is, dresses, suits and apparel wear generally. The cool wool fabrics fit into the area of 125 to about 250 grams per square metre. These fabrics are not manufactured in Australia and still attract a 35 per cent tariff. </PARA>
<PARA>  I can only imagine that this was due to the lobbying of some of our wool processors in Australia who do not make these products now but who said, `Maybe one day we will' or `We would if there were a greater demand for them in Australia'. It is illogical to have a 35 per cent import duty on a product that we do not make in Australia. We should be encouraging manufacturers of clothes in Australia to import some of these fabrics. There is a huge market out there for products at this end of the market and it would be commonsense to remove that tariff and allow the ready to wear products to be manufactured in Australia. Whilst we do not make the material, we could certainly make the suits and dresses, and add some value to our wool industry by way of removing these tariffs, which are a crazy 35 per cent at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my electorate I have an expanding citrus industry. It is in the central Queensland area of Emerald. A very innovative farmer moved into the area a number of years ago and he draws his water from the Fairbairn Dam. It is pertinent that I should touch on what is going to happen to the citrus industry as a result of this Bill. The citrus industry, like every rural industry today, is battling the destructive Labor Party policies which have failed to address the real problems of food imports and labelling of fresh food products as distinct from manufactured or processed food products. The Government has still not addressed adequately, as far as I am concerned, the issue of anti-dumping and countervailing duties. To highlight that allegation, last year alone Australia imported a mammoth $2.2 billion worth of foreign food which Australian producers could well have supplied. </PARA>
<PARA>  Further, on the citrus industry side of things, fresh orange imports in 1990-91 totalled almost 10,000 tonnes, a 40 per cent increase over the year before; that is, a 40 per cent increase in the importation of fresh oranges into Australia over the 1989-90 figure. Is it any wonder that the citrus industry is calling for some action on labelling, anti-dumping and countervailing duties?</PARA>
<PARA>  The real tragedy in this figure is that there exists no requirement in Australia to label unpackaged fresh food products. Australian horticulturalists and citrus growers who pay for the promotion of Australian fresh fruit and vegetables are unwittingly promoting the market for foreign growers. It is very difficult today to determine at a shop anywhere the difference between an Australian grown orange, a Brazilian orange or one from California. If we had requirements that they be labelled as such, I believe the fresh food industry, our Australian producers of oranges, would be a lot happier. They pay levies for the promotion of their product. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian consumer is the other person involved in this debate. The Australian consumer is not permitted to make a really informed choice as to the country of origin of these fresh foods. If it were to be a requirement that these products be labelled, I believe the Australian consumer would be choosing fresh Australian products rather than some of the imports. With the well-being of the primary industry sector in Australia at stake right now, this Government must ensure as a matter of urgency that an effective labelling regime covers fresh food as well as processed foods. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the area of citrus, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill corrects yet another anomaly which defines orange pulp wash concentrate as a food preparation attracting a general rate of 10 per cent, as opposed to a juice, which has a general rate of 18 per cent. The definition has been amended and, as proposed in the Bill, pulp wash will attract the 18 per cent duty. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I have outlined, this Government must go a lot further in remedying other anomalies that exist under the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. It must do this as a matter of urgency. We must be prepared to ensure that there is fair play and a level playing field. The way to do that and to ensure against subsidised imports is to ensure that we have adequate anti-dumping laws and countervailing duties that will apply in cases where there are clear breaches of the law. In many instances it takes up to one and two years to get a case heard. We must at the same time encourage our Australian agriculture, which is the most efficient in the world, by promoting responsible economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst I support the changes in this Bill, I believe they have not gone far enough. I hope the Minister acts to remove the other excises and import duties to which I have referred today. </PARA>

<PARA>The proposal I have just tabled relates to a proposed alteration to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 which will operate from 1 January 1991. The alteration results from the Government's decision on Industry Commission report No. 5 on the automotive industry and subsequent changes made to the passenger motor vehicle manufacturing plan announced in the Government's industry statement on 12 March this year. </PARA>
<PARA>  These changes extend the cover of the plan to light commercial vehicles and will also allow component manufacturers to avail themselves directly of credits which they earn under the export facilitation scheme. The changes also raise the upper weight limit of vehicles subject to plan coverage from 2.72 tonnes to the European standard of 3.5 tonnes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Rice Levy Bill establishes the industry and government research partnership on a more formal basis. It brings it into line with the partnerships existing, I believe very successfully, with a large number of other rural industries where there is a dollar for dollar industry-government payment arrangement for research up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production for that particular industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The rice industry has given a good lead to other industries, even though it has been rather late in coming into this formal arrangement. Last year it collected $166,000 in voluntary levies. Usually one of the problems with voluntary levies is that no money is collected; that is why we have statutory levies. But it is interesting that the rice industry has been able to obtain that amount of money. The total expenditure by the rice growers last year was $585,000, of which the maximum part beyond the $166,000 was made up by a contribution from the rice growers' cooperative pool. </PARA>
<PARA>  The particular structure of the rice industry is that it is concentrated in the Riverina area of New South Wales and, to a lesser extent, in the Burdekin area of Queensland. I am talking here more of New South Wales than Queensland. I do not mean to be nasty to Burdekin; it is just that I happen to know the New South Wales situation better. </PARA>
<PARA>  The structure of the industry has given it an ability to do certain things which I think other industries cannot do as well or as easily. One is to make that payment out of the general pool for the rice industry. Secondly, this industry is able to have a far better communication and accountability arrangement than those of many other industries. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is criticism from time to time along the following lines, `Is this really what the industry wants? Did the industry really agree to that amount of money for a research levy?'. On the basis of the information that I have obtained, one can say that for the rice industry the answer must definitely be yes, because a high percentage of the total number of growers attend their annual meetings, this matter is discussed and a motion is passed. The industry also has a good feedback by way of a newsletter. It is a good model for many other industries. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another reason why it is a good model relates to value adding. The new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) keeps talking about value adding. Everybody has been talking about value adding, or doing value adding, for a long time when it has been sensible to do so. Some have done it better than others. Once again, I think the rice industry has been good in this regard in that it has been gaining better value from the market by producing packeted goods and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA>  The rice industry is an important industry in the Riverina area of New South Wales and the Burdekin. Close to one million tonnes of rice is being produced. It is a world leader in efficiency of production, and 85 per cent of the product is exported. If fair access to international markets were to be given to Australian rice, production could expand quite considerably, because the Australian industry can compete. But rice is subject to considerable restrictions in international trade. Japan is well known for its restriction, but it is not quite as well known that Taiwan and Korea also have complete restrictions on importing rice. There are also restrictions in a number of South East Asian countries. Many people would think that surely these countries could produce rice more cheaply than Australia. They cannot. The price in Japan, and I believe also in Taiwan, is three to four times the cost of production in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  This raises the importance of the Uruguay Round of GATT. The bipartisan parliamentary delegation has been to Europe, and prior to that it was in the United States. Our focus tends to be on Europe and, to a lesser extent, the United States. But if there is a successful GATT round, many of these restrictions against agricultural exports to a whole range of South East Asian countries would, over a period, be reduced and fairer trade would operate for our products. This is where our real market opportunities are, and is very significant in terms of the advantages to Australia of a successful Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA>  Also, of course, the rice industry is subject to import competition in Australia, and there are no restrictions on that. It is interesting that some of those imports are from countries which subsidise their exports and from countries that do not allow our rice to be exported back to them. Hopefully, a GATT round will sort that out. </PARA>
<PARA>  The new levy arrangement--that is, the more formal dollar for dollar arrangement--will raise about $600,000, to a total of $1m to $1.2m. Previously the Government had contributed only $203,000, that is, $166,000 on a dollar for dollar basis plus an additional $37,000 grant. So over a couple of years there will be a significant increase in the amount of money available for research. I should make the point that the New South Wales Government is also a major provider of research assistance, to the value of about $2m, through research farm arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>  The rice industry has another positive feature with regard to its rice levy arrangements for research, and that is that it wants to maintain a stable budget for its research activities. Rice is subject to fairly corrupt international pricing arrangements and differences in production from year to year. My understanding is that to provide stability in that research budget, the industry, when it knows what the level of production and the price will be, will actually determine a figure by regulation each year. That will allow the budget to be stable. That is another good point with regard to this particular arrangement that the rice industry wants. </PARA>
<PARA>  The coalition will support the legislation, and I commend the rice industry again for some very positive features in that very important regional industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-At the outset, I would like to take this opportunity to commend all research and development corporations on the excellent work they are doing. Research carried out in Australia has made a vital contribution to the superb track record of farmers in improving the efficiency of production. Commodity specific R&amp; spending is a major component of the total R&amp; effort. The rural industry research funds are financed by producer levies matched, in terms of expenditure, by government subsidies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government believes that there should be close industry involvement in the determination of research priorities. Among other benefits, this involvement will facilitate the development of effective strategies for research and it will lead to a higher rate of adoption of research results. </PARA>
<PARA>  A review of the corporation model for funding research and development is currently being undertaken within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. The review will assess the influence of the corporation model on the effectiveness and accountability of research and development funding in the primary industries and energy portfolio. The review is to be conducted by Dr Alexander Lascelles and Mr Tony Gleeson. They will be working for about four months, as I understand it, on the review and will submit their report in December this year. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Rice Levy Bill provides for the imposition of a levy on rice produced in Australia to raise funds for a research and development program for the rice industry. Funds raised by the proposed levy will be matched by the Commonwealth up to a maximum of 0.5 per cent of the rice industry's gross value of production. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) said, this is in line with the practice in so many other primary industries where we have seen this R&amp; funding come in--and it is so good to see. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia produced 748 kilotonnes of rice in 1988-89, compared with 741 kilotonnes in 1987-88. The gross value of Australian rice production in 1988-89 was $133m, compared with $117m in 1987-88. The largest purchasers of Australian rice are Papua New Guinea, Hong Kong, the Pacific islands, the Middle East and New Zealand. As the honourable member for Murray quite rightly pointed out, while we do look to Europe and the United States for trade access for our products, it is in the Pacific Rim area and Asia that our real future and opportunities lie. With this industry in particular it is in these countries that we have a great opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>  Production of rice in Australia is centred in two geographical zones--in the Riverina district of south-western New South Wales and, closer to home for me, in north Queensland in Home Hill and Ayr, in the Burdekin. Last year production totals made records for both areas. In New South Wales, a total harvest of some 900,000 tonnes of paddy was achieved from sowings which had not increased. This has resulted from a combination of improved farming practices and the breeding of better varieties. That is the key to profitability for farmers. If we can get that productive capacity up on the same acreage, our costs overall come down. </PARA>
<PARA>  In Queensland, production of some 23,000 tonnes of paddy followed settlement by the Queensland Government of new farms, consequent upon completion of another stage in the Burdekin irrigation project. In both areas paddy rice is milled, packed, financed and sold by totally grower owned cooperatives. The vast majority of rice growers are members of their respective cooperatives. </PARA>
<PARA>  The principal issues facing both cooperatives are the establishment and maintenance of export markets in an increasingly contested international environment, and the maintenance of market shares in a competitive and open Australian market. There is no doubt that the cooperatives in the rice industry are very good. In regard to a free market economy--and I have always been a leader in the charge in that regard--we must not forget the very successful cooperatives in agriculture. It comes back to administration. If we look at my own area we see that the Isis cooperative mill has been successful through all the years of drought. It now has irrigation because it has a good board of directors. Of course, other areas--Babinda comes to mind--had problems in years gone by because of poor directors. But the rice industry has good directors, with sound business management skills, and that is why it has been so successful. </PARA>
<PARA>  With such a high degree of export orientation, the principal concern of the industry is obviously related to levels of international rice prices and market access. No other rice exporting country sells such a high proportion of its output on overseas markets. Of course, that applies to the majority of our rural commodities. The high level of government intervention in the international rice trade gave it a high level of prominence in the GATT round. The Australian rice industry has very much to gain from a positive outcome of the GATT agricultural trade negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Access to the Japanese market and allegations by a Japanese consumer group that Australian rice is contaminated with chemical residues have recently been the subject of media attention. Access of Australian rice producers to the Japanese domestic market could provide a significant boost for the Australian industry. I add that our rice is better than Japanese rice. We need to see the Japanese, who lead the world in so many areas, finally coming to grips with this protection and pulling down the barriers. They do not need protection to be competitive--they have proven that in many areas and they have to do it in agriculture. The Japanese market consumes approximately nine million tonnes of rice per annum--a massive amount. Currently, entry into the Japanese market of Australian rice is prohibited. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Rice Levy Bill 1991 gives effect to the establishment of funding for a rice research scheme. The Australian rice industry requested early in 1991 that a rice research fund be established by statutory levy and that the fund be under Rural Industry Research and Development Corporation management. The new funding arrangements will allow the industry to establish a broader based cooperative research program and to widen the scope of grower funded research. The arrangements will also allow the industry to continue a major commitment to research in order to maintain its competitive export and domestic marketing position. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, I would like to make the following observation: when we look at large grower organisations we always tend to think that it is the bigger ones--whether it be the UGA or the Cattlemen's Union of Australia--which have all the clout and produce all the leaders. That is not the case at present. It is interesting to note that the President of the National Farmers Federation is a rice producer. I was very pleased to be in his company, standing shoulder to shoulder with him, while taking on the Europeans in Brussels recently. The President of the Queensland Farmers Federation, Lindsay Hall, is also a rice producer from the Burdekin. So both Graham Blight, President of the NFF, and Lindsay Hall, President of the QFF, are rice producers. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note that finally small producer groups are being taken notice of within their own organisations and structure. I think that is very important. Both these farm leaders have shown great ability at a time when rural Australia is facing one of its biggest challenges. Certainly now, with the double whammy of record drought in a large part of eastern Australia and a crush in commodity prices over the last two years--one of the greatest challenges agriculture has faced since the 1890 depression--these two men are doing an admirable job. I would be very pleased to work with them in a constructive way. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note that this industry, which has often been regarded as so small, has now thrown up the two leaders, in my home State and nationally, of producer organisations. I wish them well in the challenging fight ahead that we must face together if we are to overcome the vagaries of corrupted world markets, and work through with the distribution of RAS funds to try to save as many farmers as possible who are facing a crisis at present.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --I rise to support the Rice Levy Bill 1991. This legislation gives effect to the establishment of a levy for the funding of a rice research scheme from July 1992. Rice growers have long realised the benefit to their industry of investing in research and development. Some $700,000 of growers' funds are provided annually towards rice production research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is the task of the industry's Rice Research Committee to prioritise growers' research needs and provide this funding to research and advisory agencies to address the priorities. The industry's annual research and development budget is around 2 to 3 per cent of farm gate value of production, a considerable amount of which is expended on produce development and has led to an impressive range of value added rice products in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA>  In both the New South Wales and Queensland industries, finance for rice research has been a specific budget allocation which has been recouped through a voluntary levy on rice growers. Last year growers contributed $166,500. The Commonwealth matched this and in addition provided a $37,294 grant through the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation to take its total contribution to $203,848. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Ricegrowers Association of Australia has requested this legislation so that it can broaden its major commitment to research in order to maintain its competitive export and domestic marketing position. The industry produces around 800,000 tonnes of paddy rice per year, with a gross value of production in 1989-90 of $148m. About 85 to 90 per cent of the production is exported to around 30 countries and is one of our rural industries which practices value adding, with the industry packaging and marketing its own brand of products. </PARA>
<PARA>  The industry's support for this legislation is demonstrated by the fact that the following motion was passed unanimously at the Association's recent annual conference, which the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and I attended:</PARA>
<PARA>That Annual Conference endorse the Rice Research Committee's proposal to enter into a matching funding arrangement for rice research within the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, commencing July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>The rate of the levy for each rice variety and the season to which the levy applies will be specified by the Minister after accepting recommendations made to him by the State rice marketing boards on levy rates. However, this legislation sets a maximum levy of $2 a tonne, which can be amended only by the Parliament. The levy is payable by the producer and will apply to rice produced in Australia and delivered to a processor of rice. </PARA>
<PARA>  The justification for this levy and the success and progressiveness of the Rice Research Committee of the Ricegrowers Cooperative Ltd is exemplified by the variety of research projects it undertook in 1990-91. One of its major research projects was aimed at developing shorter season, higher yielding rice varieties of medium and long grain types with improved and appropriate quality. Improved cold tolerance and seedling vigour are also priorities, as well as maintaining pure seed of all varieties. It is important that this research produces a high yielding, top quality, shorter season medium grain, as it would be able to use the better part of the season to grow and it would require less water. This would then lower the cost of rice growers' largest input and allow water saved to be used to produce other income. We all know the importance of this water in Australia, the driest of the continents. </PARA>
<PARA>  The release of a new fragrant rice variety, Goolarah, the direct result of research by the Rice Research Committee, is a milestone for the industry and it fills a gap in its produce range. Its success will hopefully see fragrant rice imports disappear. Evaluation of rice grain quality was also a major research project. This program aims to evaluate the quality of cross-breds from the rice breeding program. The factors that influence rice grain quality are described and measured; namely, grain appearance, milling yield, cooking behaviour, market and consumer preference and processing requirements. Special emphasis is being given to evaluating Japanese texture and flavour characteristics, Bahai-type quality and fragrant rice. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Rice Research Committee is dedicating an increasing portion of its budget to sustainable resource use in rice growing. Two specific research projects currently under way are aimed at reducing groundwater accessions under rice by soil modification and optimising rice production within sustainable environmental constraints. These will receive $330,000 funding from the rice industry. As well, sustainability of resource use is a feature of all other projects the industry funds. </PARA>
<PARA>  The research projects I have just mentioned are only a few of the many being carried out by the Rice Research Committee. Some other projects include rice weeds research, predicting rice crop fertiliser requirements, improving rice seedling establishment and optimising rice production within sustainable environmental constraints. These projects and others will benefit from the research levy being discussed today. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not only is the Rice Research Committee experiencing success with its research, but its long term objectives are now reaching fruition. Firstly, the Committee has been able to increase the Federal Government's contribution to the rice research program from around $50,000 four years ago to $336,000 in 1991-92. The contribution is in addition to the $700,000 of growers' funds supporting the program. Secondly, the Committee's aim to have the Federal Government match the growers' contribution dollar for dollar has been realised with the introduction of this Rice Levy Bill, and the Rice Research Committee is to be congratulated on this major achievement. </PARA>
<PARA>  Despite the success of the rice industry in New South Wales, there are several matters of concern to it. One is the instruction given by the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) to the Industry Commission to conduct an inquiry into water resources and waste water disposal. The terms of reference state that the Commission is to report in 12 months on institutional, regulatory or other arrangements subject to influence by governments in Australia which lead to unsustainable and inefficient resource use and advise on how these institutional, regulatory or other arrangements might be revised. </PARA>
<PARA>  What worries me and irrigators is that this inquiry may be a backdoor way of introducing a resource tax on water, that is, another attempt to increase water charges beyond full cost recovery which it is rumoured the Federal Government has been proposing for some time. I know that the current Treasurer has rejected any such suggestion, and I hope he is speaking on behalf of his Government. However, having read the transcript of a speech he gave to the Canberra Fabian Society when he held the portfolio of Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, all irrigators have some reason to be concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>  Also of concern is the Federal Industries Commission's inquiry into statutory marketing authorities which was critical of such things as crop acquisition powers. No doubt, the rice industry will be vigilant in this regard, particularly in light of its success in retaining the present marketing arrangements whereby the Rice Marketing Board retains its vesting powers and the ability to authorise the Ricegrowers Cooperative Ltd as its sole buyer. </PARA>
<PARA>  One misconception that I would like to dispel is that the rice industry is highly protected. Some time ago the Industries Commission calculated the rate of protection for the rice industry at 50 per cent. However, as a result of the Ricegrowers Cooperative Ltd convincing the Industries Commission to use more accurate figures, the level of protection has been revised downwards to 10 per cent. This figure should remove any doubts that the rice industry is highly protected. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would also like to bring it to the Parliament's attention that the New South Wales rice industry is the only rice industry in the world which is not a recipient of a tariff or any other form of protection. The industry in New South Wales competes successfully with protected industries solely on the basis of industry efficiency, product quality and reliability. </PARA>
<PARA>   For an intensive irrigation industry, rice is a relatively low user of agricultural chemicals. Very successful quarantine arrangements at the seaboard and around rice growing areas have kept New South Wales free of all exotic rice pests and diseases that are endemic in overseas rice growing areas. However, there is a concern in the industry about the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service's decision to increase the tolerance level for paddy rice contamination in imported milled rice from one grain per kilogram to five grains per kilogram. The New South Wales rice industry is concerned at this decision. Because of the industry's disease-free status, there is no resistance in current rice varieties and no resistant genes in the breeding material. Any action that may threaten this disease-free status is of concern.</PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be aware, rural  Australia is hurting, but signs for the New South Wales rice industry are more promising than for most other commodities. This can mainly be attributed to the highly efficient management of a New South Wales rice industry by the Ricegrowers Cooperative Ltd. For example, in August 1990 the industry introduced a highly successful production limiting scheme which was strongly supported by growers and which will enable the Ricegrowers Cooperative Ltd to clear its stocks before the 1992 crop harvest. This has placed the rice industry in a strong position in which to manage the potential record crop of up to one million tonnes. A record crop has potential because of the lower returns being experienced by wheat and wool growers and the relatively better situation for rice which will encourage many traditional growers to either reactivate or increase their rice growing areas and encourage some new growers to plant rice for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA>  Although a record crop will test the receival, storage and milling facilities of the Ricegrowers Cooperative, the returns to growers should be enhanced by the recent reduction in the Californian rice crop due to drought resulting in lower medium grain production, cold weather affecting some European sowings and the serious floods in China should also create some export demand. Without the Russian subsidised fertiliser, production in Vietnam is expected to be lower this year. </PARA>
<PARA>   I think that, because of the ability of the rice industry to survive and to flourish in times of great difficulty, something should be known of the history of the rice growing industry in Australia. Unfortunately, I believe that my time tonight does not allow me to do this, but I will briefly go through some of the history, particularly of the MIA and the Coleambally irrigation area. Of course, most people would know that John Oxley was a surveyor who first went through the area in 1817. He said that he was the first white man to see it and would, undoubtedly, be the last. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a uniformity in the barren desolation of this country that wearies one more than I am able to express. </PARA>
<PARA>But today that barren, desolate land makes up the Murrumbidgee and Coleambally irrigation areas which are part of the Riverina and produce one of the world's finest and most sought after rice crops. Rice is grown by nearly 2,500 families in those areas and also the Murray River related irrigation areas and is stored, milled and marketed by their own Ricegrowers Cooperative Ltd. It is rightly regarded as one of the most successful and well-run producers' cooperatives in Australia and this rice growing centre is considered by many experts as the most efficient in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  The productive Murrumbidgee irrigation area was born at the turn of the century. By 1913, 3,000 kilometres of canals had been created, harnessing the power of the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers. This massive and complicated engineering feat unlocked the resources of these two rivers and provided a huge source of valuable water for agricultural use. However, due to the choice of crops planted by the early pioneers, the Government did not receive the revenue from the irrigation project as it had envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA>  Fortunately, some rice growing experiments have been conducted during the early stages of settlement in the Riverina. Borrowing from Asia's success with rice production, a variety was planted which had flourished in some of Asia's more tropical highland areas. These early attempts failed and speculation soon grew about the viability of developing a sustainable and profitable rice farming operation in the Riverina. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, in 1920 one of the region's industry leaders, while visiting California's irrigation project near Sacramento, observed a variety of rice which was thriving in conditions and a climate similar to the Riverina. Convinced that this was the solution to the rice farming problem in Australia--and, indeed, the larger problem of finding a profitable crop to use the costly water--he ordered three bags of seed. In a large-scale trial in 1923 the seed was sown at Leeton and the crop was an overwhelming success. Australia's first commercial rice crop was harvested in 1924 by six farmers who led the way through the early years of this new developing industry and formed the Ricegrowers Association of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  As rice farming in the Riverina flourished, the growers soon realised that they needed a more orderly system for marketing their rice. With more and more farmers choosing to grow rice, many of the important yet tedious marketing functions were being duplicated by each farmer. They knew that if the rice industry in New South Wales was to continue to grow and be profitable they needed to work together in order to create efficient economies of scale. </PARA>
<PARA>  Through the Ricegrowers Association, the growers lobbied the New South Wales Government and, in 1928, the Government constituted the Marketing of Primary Products Act. In this Act it proclaimed that all rice grown in New South Wales must be delivered to the newly established Rice Marketing Board, that board, of course, being responsible for receiving, drying and storing the paddy, negotiating sale prices, receiving proceeds from sales and returning these proceeds, less costs, to the growers. </PARA>
<PARA>  From that time, the rice industry has progressed and prospered under very careful management. Of course, in recent times it has come up against other problems. For example, in 1985 a subsidy trade war between the United States and the European Economic Community caused havoc with worldwide rice prices, as it did with other commodity prices. As prices fell, demand for Australian rice plummeted, due to Australia's policy not to artificially lower rice prices with government subsidies. Consequently, the rice industry was forced to take strong measures to cut overhead costs and boost returns to growers. </PARA>
<PARA>  After great deliberation, the Riverina rice growers decided to rationalise the operations of the industry under the management of one organisation. The new industry organisation, now known as the Ricegrowers Cooperative Ltd, not only allowed for significant cost savings but also generated considerable operating efficiencies. The cooperative now carries out the physical activities which were previously the responsibility of the Rice Marketing Board. This allows for the orderly marketing of all New South Wales grown rice. </PARA>
<PARA>  The New South Wales rice industry is an efficient industry by any standards, and I have always been impressed by the professionalism displayed by industry leaders. As the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) has just told us, the President of the National Farmers Federation, Graham Blight, was a very active member of the organisation. Of course, Mr Graham Blight is not the only well-known member. There are many respected names in the rice industry which come to mind. </PARA>
<PARA>  In supporting this Bill I suggest that many other rural commodity organisations could learn from the rice industry, which is not afraid to collectively make tough decisions for its long-term welfare and for those who are economically dependent upon it, while, at the same time, producing a commodity that is equal to the world's best. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In the absence of my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), the shadow Attorney-General, I am leading for the Liberal and National parties in this debate to present our response to the Family Law Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, which seeks to amend the Family Law Act 1975 to fix the maximum retiring age of 70 for Family Court judges. The Liberal and National parties will be supporting the passage of the Bill. We are pleased that the Government has decided to adopt the recommendations of the first report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. Indeed, an important part of the Liberal and National parties' law and justice policy was fulfilled by the establishment of that Joint Parliamentary Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In September last year, the honourable member for Kooyong and Senator David Brownhill moved motions in the House and in the Senate to establish the Committee. In December, the Australian Democrats gave their support to the proposal and, in February this year, the Government changed its position and agreed to the establishment of the Joint Parliamentary Select Committee. The Committee is providing an opportunity, for the first time since 1982, for the Parliament to review the family law system. A comprehensive review is currently being conducted and public hearings have commenced. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is worth while in the context of this debate, although this Bill is a relatively brief one, to remind the House of the terms of reference that the Committee has and the issues that it is to examine. They include: the provision of counselling and mediation services; resolution of custody, guardianship, welfare and access disputes; resolution of property disputes and whether the Act should extend to property disputes arising out of de facto relationships; the enforcement of court orders; the width of discretions conferred upon Family Court judges; the adversarial nature of the proceedings and their associated legal costs; restrictions on the reporting of court proceedings; and the retiring age of Family Court judges. </PARA>
<PARA>  In its first report, the Committee has examined the retiring age of Family Court judges. It has recommended as a matter of priority that the Family Law Act be amended to fix a maximum retiring age of 70 years for Family Court judges. The Bill before us thus implements the Committee's recommendations. It amends the Act by repealing section 23A, which fixed the maximum retiring age of Family Court judges at 65. The repeal of section 23A means that future appointments to the court will be governed by section 72 of the Constitution, which provides, in its form as amended by a referendum in the late 1970s, a maximum age for Federal Court judges of 70 years. The Bill further amends section 41 of the Act to provide that the Governor-General may make a proclamation under subsection 41(2) in relation to a State Family Court whose judges have a maximum age the same as judges of the Family Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased to note that the effect of the Bill is in line with the general direction that the Liberal and National parties are taking in their retirement income policies, which provide for raising and, where possible, removing any age bars to the employment of people over 60 and 65 who wish to remain in employment. We are of the view that the national interest makes it essential that our mature and skilled members of the work force be productively employed for as long as possible and for as long as they wish to continue in employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1977, the retiring age of Family Court judges was set at 65 years of age for a number of reasons. It was thought then that in the family law, more than in other areas, judges adjudicating over disputes should be aware and keep abreast of current social values and attitudes. For this reason and because of the demanding nature of some of the disputes, it was considered appropriate that judges of the Family Court retire at least by the age recognised as the maximum retiring age for most other occupations in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee and the Liberal and National parties are of the view that these reasons are no longer valid. The role of the Family Court judge has been expanded. A Family Court judge no longer deals exclusively with family law, but may now be involved in matters similar to those heard in the Federal Court, where the retiring age is 70 years. The advent of the Commonwealth and State cross-vesting legislation has meant that the Family Court can exercise the jurisdiction of the Federal Court and State Supreme Courts in appropriate matters. Disputes about property in the Family Court can raise complex questions of law relating to property, equity, taxation, contract, company, constitutional and conflict law. Similar questions may be raised in other superior courts where the retiring age is 70. </PARA>
<PARA>  There will always be concern that judges of any court over the age of 65 may have difficulty in relating to much younger people who appear before them. This is true, I guess, of the way in which many younger people view older people in many other walks of life. But the Liberal and National parties agree with the view expressed by the Committee and the Family Law Council that an important qualification for judges of the court is their awareness of social values. However, there would not be a substantial difference in that area between judges who are 65 and those who are 70 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA>  Most of the current Family Court judges maintain active family or community lives whilst they are still on the bench and, no doubt, beyond. In any event, there are many other parties who make a significant contribution to the final decision of the judge. There are counsellors and registrars in the court who make reports on how property should be divided up and make recommendations in relation to children in custody disputes. Solicitors, barristers and other witnesses also have an influence on the judge's decision. So</PARA>
<PARA>the whole process, although ultimately culminating in the decision of the judge, is a process where there is a large number of experts, professionals and people who have close relationships with the social values, attitudes and needs of people. There is no reason to say that one or any of those on reaching 65 should necessarily then be excluded from continuing in active service in this most vital area of work. </PARA>
<PARA>  I appreciate that adjudicating on family law matters is a stressful job--and that was one of the reasons that was put forward when the age was set at 65. It is also a highly emotional job and can involve emotional issues. But I note the views of the Chief Justice of the Family Court, the Honourable Justice Nicholson, who queries whether the job of a Family Court judge is necessarily more stressful than that of a judge in any other court or the jobs of many other people who are aged between 65 and 70. I quote from Mr Justice Nicholson's submission to the Committee from whose recommendations this Bill has emanated. His Honour said:</PARA>
<PARA>  The work of Judges in all such Courts is stressful. There is little to choose between the emotional strain of conducting a criminal trial and arriving at an appropriate sentence, for example, than there is in conducting a trial of a custody or access issue. Matrimonial property disputes frequently require Judges to display the same skills and learning as is required of a Court of Equity. </PARA>
<PARA>In any event, this Bill does not require judges to remain on the court past the age of 65 but it enables them to do so. A judge can exercise the right to retire at an earlier age if the work is found to be too stressful or if, for other reasons, the judge decided that his or her career in the service of the Family Court had been complete from his or her point of view. This enables judges to remain and continue to contribute to the age of 75 in lieu of the age of 65, which is the requirement under the present legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I confirm that the Liberal and National parties support the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-in reply--I thank the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) for his contribution, which was not only constructive but also thoughtful in respect of the change in this area. As he correctly pointed out, the Family Law Amendment Bill implements the first report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act; that is, the recommendation that, as a matter of priority, the Family Law Act be amended to fix a maximum age of 70 years for judges of the Family Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As the honourable member for Sturt indicated, there was a different thought on this some time ago when the maximum age was fixed at 65. As he correctly pointed out, that may well have been misplaced. I think that the submissions made to the Committee--the honourable member for Sturt mentioned in particular the submission of the Chief Justice of the Family Court, His Honour Mr Justice Nicholson--probably sum up the position very succinctly. It is pleasing to see that the first report from the Joint Select Committee has bipartisan support not only at the committee level but also in this Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Again, in the absence of my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), I present the response to this proposal on behalf of the Liberal and National parties in relation to the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 1991. This Bill amends the provisions of the National Crime Authority Act 1984. The Liberal and National parties support the general thrust of the Bill. However, during the committee stage I will be moving some amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Bill will make four major changes to the National Crime Authority Act. Firstly, clause 2 of the Bill will insert into the Act proposed new sections 29A and 29B. By these new sections, where the Authority summonses a witness to give oral evidence, or issues a notice requiring the production of documents, a member of the Authority will be given a discretionary power to include in the summons or notice a notation prohibiting the disclosure of certain information. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, clause 3 of the Bill will amend section 31 of the Act to enable the Authority to apply to a court to obtain a warrant for the arrest of a person who, having been served with a summons, fails or refuses to appear at a hearing conducted by the Authority. The amendment contained in clause 3 is, in effect, one of a clarifying nature for it overcomes the drafting anomaly presently found in section 31(1) of the Act, which empowers the Authority to apply for a warrant of apprehension in the more limited situation where the recipient of a summons is evading service. </PARA>
<PARA>  Thirdly, clause 4 of the Bill will amend section 50 of the Act to provide that the Chairman of the Authority, instead of the Attorney-General, may appoint counsel to assist the Authority. The delegation of power brought about by clause 4 is an appropriate and reasonable one, for the need to appoint legal counsel to assist the Authority is a matter which the Chairman is in the best position to assess. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, clause 5 of the Bill will amend section 59 of the Act, which sets out the obligation that the Authority has with respect to the provision of reports dealing with the Authority's function. Under the amendment, the Authority, if requested to do so by a State or Territory Minister who is a member of the intergovernmental committee, will be obliged to furnish reports to that Minister about the conduct of the Authority's general investigations in the relevant State or Territory. As I mentioned earlier, when we reach the committee stage, I will move amendments on behalf of the Liberal and National parties which touch upon clause 2 of the Bill which, as I have mentioned, introduces proposed new sections 29A and 29B into the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  I take the opportunity now to outline the concerns that we in the Opposition have with these proposed new sections. Under section 28 of the Act, the Authority has power to summons a person to appear before a hearing to give oral evidence and to produce such documents as requested. In addition, section 29 enables the Authority to issue a written notice to a person requiring the person to attend before the Authority and to produce such documents as are requested. </PARA>
<PARA>  Persons aggrieved by the service of a summons or notice may, pursuant to section 32, ask the Authority to review its decision. If a person is still dissatisfied with the Authority's decision, as reviewed, application may be made to the Federal Court for an order of review. Upon hearing an application the court may affirm or set aside the Authority's decision. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the past, there have been occasions where persons served with a summons or notice have, perhaps inadvertently, disclosed the existence of the summons or notice and information relating to the Authority's investigations. This, in turn, has had the undesirable consequence of jeopardising investigations conducted by the Authority and has also, in some instances, had the effect of damaging the reputation of other persons. Proposed new sections 29A and 29B are designed to overcome some of these problems. In this respect, the Liberal and National parties welcome this legislative measure as it goes some way towards achieving an appropriate balance between the needs of effective law enforcement and the need to protect the reputation of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>  Proposed new section 29A will give the Authority a discretion to include in a summons or notice a notation prohibiting disclosure of relevant information. Under proposed new section 29A(2) the Authority will be able to exercise its discretion only if it is satisfied that a failure to do so might--and I emphasise the word `might'--prejudice the reputation or fair trial of a person or the effectiveness of an investigation or where the failure to include a notation might otherwise be considered to be contrary to the public interest. Proposed new section 29B sets out the circumstances in which a person receiving a summons or notice containing a non-disclosure notation may disclose the existence of such a document and information relevant to it. </PARA>
<PARA>  We on this side of the House are of the view that the matter can and should be taken further and, to this end, the amendments that we propose contain three elements. Firstly, where it is clear that a failure to include a non-disclosure notation would, as opposed to might, have an adverse effect, the Authority should be under an obligation to include a notation in a summons or notice. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, if the Authority decides to include a non-disclosure notation in a summons or notice, the Authority should provide a written statement setting out the reasons for the inclusion of the notation and the rights and obligations that the recipient of the summons or notice has. </PARA>
<PARA>  Thirdly, section 32 of the Act should be amended so that a person who is aggrieved by the receipt of the summons and the terms of the non-disclosure notation may be able to seek an order of review in the Federal Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) will be aware, the Liberal and National parties are and have been supportive of the Authority and believe that the Authority has an important role to play in law enforcement in Australia. In particular, the Authority has a vital function in the collection and dissemination of information and intelligence relating to criminal activities. The Attorney will also be aware that we have been supportive of the new directions being taken by the Authority under its new Chairman, Mr Justice Phillips. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Liberal and National parties are particularly supportive of the efforts made by His Honour Mr Justice Phillips to enhance cooperation between the Authority and, on the one hand, the Federal Government law enforcement authorities and, on the other hand, State government law enforcement authorities. In the past there has been much duplication and multiplication of effort on the part of various Federal and State law enforcement authorities. It is hoped that the work being done by His Honour will go some way to minimise any unnecessary overlap. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Liberal and National parties appreciate and acknowledge the efforts being made by Mr Justice Phillips to foster the spirit of openness and cooperation in the Authority's relationship with the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. The existence of the parliamentary Committee, in acting as a public watchdog, is crucial to ensuring that the Authority is accountable to Parliament and through Parliament to the public. In past years it was a perceived lack of accountability that led to criticisms about the Authority, in particular criticisms that the Authority was overly secretive in its workings. However, in recent times Mr Justice Phillips has helped to build a constructive relationship between the Authority and the parliamentary Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>  This brings me to two matters on which I seek a response from the Attorney-General. In February of this year Mr Justice Phillips put forward proposals to amend some other provisions of the Act. The proposals, if implemented, would make the Authority's operations more open and accountable. Central to the proposals put forward by His Honour was the need to clarify the statutory relationship between the Authority and the parliamentary Committee. It will be recalled that His Honour proposed that the Act be amended in the following ways: firstly, that the secrecy provisions of the Act be amended so that they have no application to the workings of the Committee; secondly, that greater definition be given to the Committee's powers of inquiry; thirdly, as a corollary to removing the secrecy provisions, that the Committee members be subject to a statutory obligation of confidentiality; fourthly, that the procedures for resolving disputes about the publication of sensitive material be put in place; and, finally, that the Authority be given a discretion to conduct hearings or parts of hearings in public. </PARA>
<PARA>  In late February the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong, advised the parliamentary Committee that in principle he supported, with one exception, the proposals put forward by Mr Justice Phillips. My colleague indicated that he had reservations about the proposal for an appointment of a judicial arbiter to resolve disputes between the Committee and the Authority. On 29 May this year the honourable member for Kooyong in this chamber advised the Attorney-General of the Liberal and National parties' support for the legislative reforms proposed by Mr Justice Phillips. Although the proposals are presently before the parliamentary Committee for consideration, I hope that the Attorney-General, on behalf of the Government, is in a position today to express a view as to whether or not the Government supports the changes advocated by His Honour. I ask the Attorney to give an indication today of the Government's thinking in this area. It is disappointing that the proposals put forward by His Honour have not so far been acted on. That disappointment is compounded when one has regard to the fact that legislative action could have been taken by now. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second matter I raise for the Attorney-General to respond to relates to a proposal put forward by the intergovernmental committee chaired by the Attorney-General to the effect that the parliamentary Joint Committee be abolished. In the debate that took place on 29 May the Attorney-General was advised by the honourable member for Kooyong that the coalition unequivocally opposed this proposal. In response, the Attorney indicated that a meeting would take place in late June--that is, late June last--between the intergovernmental committee and the parliamentary Joint Committee. The Attorney also indicated that the Federal Government's position on the matter would be reviewed after the conclusion of that meeting. Accordingly, I ask the Attorney to inform the House as to the Government's present position on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, the Liberal and National parties hope that the Government will support the amendments that I will move at the committee stage. They also hope that the Attorney, in summing up in this second reading debate, will be able to advise the House of the Government's position with respect to, first, the legislative reforms that the Chairman of the Authority has put forward and, secondly, the future role of the parliamentary Joint Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-At the outset I must say that I appreciate the usual constructive contribution from my colleague the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), but I must disagree with the reasons that he has advanced in anticipation of the amendments that he proposes to move to the provisions of the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill. With respect, he has not adduced any grounds upon which this House could reasonably consider the merits or otherwise of his proposed amendments. In any event, I suggest that the Bill as presently before the House is the legislative framework that has been sought by the National Crime Authority in order to discharge its very important role in the investigation of relevant criminal activity in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The National Crime Authority Amendment Bill introduces several amendments to the National Crime Authority Act of 1984. These new amendments will be of great assistance to the National Crime Authority in its investigations. The National Crime Authority was established in 1984 and, generally speaking, its focus has been on the investigation of organised crime. For example, the Authority is currently involved in a number of investigations dealing with drug importations, serious offences against the person, large scale tax evasion, money laundering and corporate crime. </PARA>
<PARA>  The extent of the Authority's investigations has international ramifications. It is in the national interest that the successful conclusion of these investigations will result not only in persons being charged with criminal offences but also in the recovery of substantial funds from either tax evasion or the proceeds of crime. Over recent years the National Crime Authority has recovered millions of dollars as a result of its investigations.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Authority's 1989-90 annual report notes that assets worth $23.6m were seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 and the Customs Act 1901. Furthermore, as a result of National Crime Authority investigations the Australian Taxation Office collected $8.7m. This is an impressive record. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the National Crime Authority is to continue its impressive record it must operate under a legislative framework which ensures that its investigatory functions are not impeded or in any way diminished by any deficiencies in the existing Act. For some time, the Authority has recognised that sections 28 and 29 of the Act were deficient. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under section 28 of the Act a member of the Authority may summon a person to appear at a duly constituted hearing. At the hearing the Authority may make directions prohibiting the disclosure of any evidence before it, including the contents of documents and any information that might lead to the identification of a person who has given or is about to give evidence before the Authority. In practice, summonses issued under section 28 of the Act sometimes contain a notation to the effect that recipients of the summonses must not disclose that they are about to give evidence to the Authority, subject, of course, to their right to obtain legal advice in connection with the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is conflicting legal opinion as to whether the notation so made on the summons would withstand a challenge in court because the direction contained in the notation was made prior to the hearing. In the case of section 29 of the Act, which enables a member of the Authority to require a person to produce documents for the purposes of the special investigation, there is no provision to ensure that the recipient of the summons is prohibited from disclosing information about the summons. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendments in this Bill to section 29 of the Act will allow members of the National Crime Authority to prohibit disclosure of details of or information about summonses or notices issued under sections 28 and 29 of the Act. The notation on summonses, to which I referred earlier, usually contains details about investigations and suspects so as to provide witnesses with information on the matters they will be asked about and documents they will be required to produce. Obviously, their disclosure of these details has the potential to tip off suspects and, more importantly, could threaten the physical safety of witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendment to section 29 will give members of the National Crime Authority discretion to include a notation on process, such as summonses and notices, which will prohibit disclosure of the information in the document, except in any circumstances which the member may specify. This will allow the member of the National Crime Authority to limit the non-disclosure requirements to the particular circumstances of the investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important to note that members may include this notation only where they are satisfied that the failure to do so may prejudice the safety, reputation or fair trial of a person or the effectiveness of the investigations or might otherwise be contrary to the public interest. This safeguard provision is in line with the National Crime Authority's desire to be open and accountable. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendment also contains a number of other safeguards. First, the non-disclosure notation is automatically cancelled after five years, or sooner than this if the National Crime Authority investigation has been concluded, and all prosecutions that will arise from it have commenced. Secondly, the recipients of National Crime Authority process will always be able to make disclosures in certain circumstances. These circumstances are to obtain legal advice or representation; to obtain legal aid; where a body corporate is served with a National Crime Authority process, such as a summons or a notice, to officers or agents of that body corporate to enable compliance; and if the person served with National Crime Authority process is a legal practitioner, to enable compliance with any legal duty of disclosure which may arise out of the professional relationship with the client, or to enable instructions to be obtained on the waiving of legal professional privilege. Finally, further disclosure can be made in the circumstances, if any, specified in the notation, depending on the particular investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Now that the National Crime Authority has decided to concentrate its investigations on white collar crime, it is in the public interest that the investigations of the Authority remain confidential if the task of the Authority, which is to collect evidence of criminal activity, is to succeed. In respect of section 29 of the Act, it was apparent that because there was not a non-disclosure provision, some institutions, including banks, apparently advised clients that the National Crime Authority was requiring production of their clients' banking records. This had the effect of alerting those persons being investigated, including their associates, to the interest in them by the National Crime Authority. Furthermore, some of the banks, lending institutions or financial institutions took the view that, because there was not a non-disclosure provision contained in section 29 of the Act, the financial institutions therefore had a duty to inform their clients that confidential information relating to their affairs was required by the Authority by force of law. </PARA>
<PARA>  I understand that the financial institutions also interpreted the legislation as not providing them with any legal protection from a civil suit launched by a client claiming that he or she had not been notified by the bank of the interest in their affairs by the National Crime Authority. This concern by the financial institutions will now be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important to note that members may include a notation, to which I referred earlier, only where they are satisfied that the failure to do so might prejudice the safety, reputation or fair trial of a person. I repeat that because of the comments made by the honourable member for Sturt. Every safeguard has been introduced into these amendments to protect the civil rights of the people who are recipients of National Crime Authority process. The drafting of these amendments is in line with the National Crime Authority's desire to be more open and accountable. Instead of inserting a blanket prohibition into the Act, as could have happened, these provisions will operate when, subject to certain qualifications, a decision is made by a member of the National Crime Authority to restrict disclosure in accordance with the reasons I have advanced in my remarks tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Sturt has already addressed in detail the other amendments proposed in the Bill, particularly with respect to section 31 for the issue of a warrant of arrest of a witness where there is a deficiency of an existing Act; the amendment with respect to counsel assisting the Authority--that is, the deletion of the Attorney-General--and in lieu thereof to enable the Chairman to appoint counsel to assist the Authority; and also the amendment with respect to the furnishing of reports and information, where the amendment authorises the Authority to pass information concerning its general investigations in a State or Territory directly to the relevant Minister who is a member of the intergovernmental committee. In the present situation, only information concerning a specific investigation initiated by a State reference may be provided to the State or Territory Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>  I record my personal appreciation of the efforts made by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in his assistance to the Authority and to the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. It is a tribute to his cooperation and careful advice since his assumption of the office of Attorney-General that the Authority in particular and also the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority have entered a new era of cooperation and constructive reform of the relationship between the Authority and the Joint Committee. I support these Bills and I commend them to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It has been pointed out in the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the remarks made this evening that the purpose of the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill is to prevent the disclosure of information about summonses or notices issued by the National Crime Authority and to allow specifically requested information to be passed on directly to the relevant State Minister. As indicated, since the establishment of the National Crime Authority in 1984 the purpose has been to conduct investigations in relation to organised crime. The Authority conducts two types of investigations, special and general. When undertaking the special investigations, the NCA may use coercive powers to force people to appear before its hearings to give evidence and to produce documents. Until June 1990, the NCA had been given 11 special references relating to matters such as tax evasion, the importation and distribution of narcotics, bribery, corruption and murder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Authority has therefore played a vital part in the fight against major crime in Australia. For example, in its 1989-90 annual report, it was indicated that 79 people had been charged with 650 offences; 38 people were convicted, mostly for offences committed in previous years; assets worth $23.6m were seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 and the Customs Act 1901; $8.7m was collected by the Australian Taxation Office due to NCA activities; and, in addition, some seven kilograms of heroin were seized by officers of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>  It should be recalled, though, in any debate about the NCA that it is not a court of law. The NCA is essentially an investigative body. Thus, section 11 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 indicates that the primary function of the legislation is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to collect and analyse criminal information and intelligence relating to relevant criminal activities and to disseminate that information and intelligence. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the fact that the NCA is not a court of law, it is surrounded by a number of powers traditionally reserved for courts within our justice system. These powers include: the power to require the attendance of witnesses; the power to allow examination and cross-examination of those witnesses; the power to subpoena documents; and the power to direct that evidence before the Authority not be disclosed. Thus, this Parliament has given the NCA inquisitorial powers. In effect, what we are dealing with here is an exception to the long established and dearly held principles of the British and Australian justice systems that a person is entitled to have all matters of a criminal nature dealt with in a public manner. To repeat an old cliche, justice should not merely be done; it should also be seen to be done. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill will insert provisions into the Act which will enable the NCA to prohibit in certain circumstances the disclosure of, the existence of or any information about summonses or notices issued under the National Crime Authority Act or any proceedings or matters connected with them. As the explanatory memorandum indicates:</PARA>
<PARA>The provisions are designed to prevent people whose activities are under investigation by the NCA from becoming aware of the investigation. This has happened in the past when, for example, financial institutions received summonses or notices relating to their clients affairs and felt legally obliged to inform their client. On being told of the receipt of such process, suspects have concealed or destroyed evidence or gone into hiding, thus frustrating NCA investigations. This amendment aims to prevent this happening in the future and clarifies the legal position of bodies such as financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment will also ensure that people's safety is not threatened, or their reputation or fair trial is not prejudiced by others revealing the existence of NCA process, or any information about it or proceedings connected with it. </PARA>
<PARA>These objectives will achieved by the introduction of proposed new sections 29A and 29B. Section 29(1) of the Act provides:</PARA>
<PARA>A member . . . may, by notice in writing served on a person, require the person--</PARA>
<PARA>  (a) to attend, at a time and place specified in the notice, before a person specified in the notice, being a member of the Authority or a member of the staff of the Authority; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) to produce at that time and place to the person so specified a document or thing specified in the notice, being a document or thing that is relevant to a special investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed new section 29A will allow the member to note on the summons or notice that disclosure of the process is prohibited. Under subsection (2) of proposed new section 29A, the member may include the notation only if satisfied that failure to do so:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) might prejudice:</PARA>
<PARA>  (i)   the safety or reputation of the person; or</PARA>
<PARA>  (ii)   the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with   an offence; or</PARA>
<PARA>  (iii) the effectiveness of an investigation; or</PARA>
<PARA>(b) might otherwise be contrary to the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>I therefore support the amendments which have been foreshadowed by the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), which require the NCA to include a notation where the member is satisfied that a failure to include a notation in a summons or notice would reasonably be expected to prejudice safety, reputation, a fair trial or the effectiveness of the investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I note that section 22 of the Act uses the words `reasonable grounds for suspecting' concerning the issue of search warrants, as does section 24 concerning the delivery to the Authority of a passport. Although the proposed notation acts by way of a warning rather than direct imposition on personal freedom, the consequences of disclosure where there are reasonable grounds to suspect adverse consequences--for individuals, the investigation or the trial--reinforce my view that the notation in those circumstances should be made. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of more importance is the insertion of a right of review for persons subject to the non-disclosure notation. It is to be noted that the summons or notice is issued by a member of the National Crime Authority, not by a judge or magistrate who would be seen to exercise a degree of impartiality about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, in the proposed amendment Bill introduced by the Attorney, the notation may be based on the widest of grounds. It is conceivable that many things, of both a major and a minor nature, might prejudice the effectiveness of a National Crime Authority investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>  And what constitutes public interest?  From the perspective of an officer of the National Crime Authority, the public interest may be entirely subsumed by an overwhelming desire to wipe out all crime. While this is an admirable motive, the inquisitorial nature of the process must be balanced against the protection of the fundamental freedoms which our forebears fought hard to establish and to maintain. </PARA>
<PARA>  A further amendment to section 32 of the Act to make the notation on a summons or notice the subject of an application to the Federal Court would ensure that there is an adequate avenue by which a review of the decision of a member of the NCA may be made in regard to the placing of a notation in the first place. In my submission, such an amendment is consistent with the provisions of section 73 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. Section 73 of that Act provides that an application be made to a judge of a Supreme Court for an order directing a financial institution to give information to a law enforcement agency. As a summons or notice under the National Crime Authority Act does not require the order of a judge or even a magistrate, it is reasonable, in my belief, to allow a notation about non-disclosure to be reviewed by a court, in this case by the Federal Court. I therefore support the amendments which have been foreshadowed by the honourable member for Sturt. </PARA>
<PARA>  Before concluding my remarks and contribution to this debate, I wish to comment on proposed new section 29B. This section creates offences for the disclosure of information where a notation has been made on a summons or notice pursuant to proposed new section 29A and allows for certain exceptions. It is the drafting of the exceptions to non-disclosure with which I have difficulties. I raise this matter for the Attorney, although it is not the subject of any proposed amendments by the honourable member for Sturt. </PARA>
<PARA>  Proposed new section 29B(2)(e) provides that disclosure of the notice or summons may be made by a legal practitioner:</PARA>
<PARA>(i) for the purpose of complying with a legal duty of disclosure arising from his or her professional relationship with a client. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Given that the object of the new provision is to prevent people whose activities are under investigation by the NCA from becoming aware of the investigation, it appears to me that a legal practitioner will necessarily be under a legal duty to his client to disclose to that client any demand for documents by the National Crime Authority. If my interpretation is correct, there remains a loophole in the legislation and in the amendment Bill introduced by the Attorney. </PARA>
<PARA>  In summary and in conclusion, I support the general thrust of this legislation but also support the amendments which have been foreshadowed by the honourable member for Sturt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I support the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill and in doing so make the point that a number of the amendments proposed by the Opposition certainly, at first glance, have substance and will, I am sure, be taken into consideration by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), a Minister who is known to have a fair disposition towards constructive input from our side of the House. I do not propose to canvass the proposed amendments, although the last suggestion raised--that there ought to be a reference to the Federal Court, to a notation, as my colleague the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) might say--does open up the old feeding trough to the legal profession whence the honourable member came, I think. So I suppose he is protecting the interests of his former colleagues. However, it does open up the suggestion, `Here is the trough, stick your noses in it, and add a little more legal cost to the process'. With that observation I caution the Attorney-General in his consideration of the proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In supporting the legislation, it is appropriate that I take this opportunity to commend Justice Phillips and the National Crime Authority for the successful transition that has taken place during the past 18 months in both the role of the NCA in its relationship with the other criminal investigation authorities in Australia, at State and Federal level, and the role that they play, and also in the style of work being carried through by the Authority. I think it has become evident to people who take an interest in these things that the nature of organised crime, in whatever form it exists, has become much more sophisticated and now involves much more of an emphasis in some ways on the money trail and a more sophisticated analysis, detection and prosecution of those on the money trail than was the case during the first five years of the Authority, when there was very strong evidence that what we would call straight `cops and robbers' criminal activities were much more the focus of attention of the NCA. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not easy to manage a transition like that, to adopt more sophisticated approaches, to adopt more sophisticated technology and now to take on probably what will be the most major task of the lot. The proposals incorporated in the legislation go in some way towards assisting the process of prosecution of these more complex modern-day criminal activities. When I say `prosecution', I am obviously aware that the NCA does not have a role in actually prosecuting the persons involved in the activities that it detects. It hands its best briefs over to the Director of Public Prosecutions at State level or, in some cases, at the Federal level and it is then up to those authorities to give weight to the evidence that is brought forward by the NCA and to prosecute those persons through the court system. </PARA>
<PARA>  I highly commend a recent public seminar held by the NCA, at which the public, along with the media and people who are practising law at all levels, were invited to a three-day exposition in Melbourne. I think the Attorney-General opened that exposition and indicated his support for this process. The courtrooms of Australia are going to be--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes. The NCA will be the host to some very complex prosecutions. I thank the honourable member for Herbert for giving me some direction as to what I was trying to conceptualise. One of the principal concerns that we all have in relation to those matters is that accused people may not be given a fair trial. They are entitled to a fair trial, and part of that fair trial comes from a proper understanding of the processes. Therefore, it is very important that the media in particular understands the process that will be taking place, understands the complexity of the charges and understands the way different financial networks have been traced. It is also important that juries and, in fact, the Bench understand these complex tracing processes that are now involved in the detection of sophisticated crime. These legislative proposals do include the wherewithal for the NCA to do its job in that form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I observed on the front page of today's Sun-Herald some rather strong allegations made by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) in the House last night, in which he expressed his concern that organised crime is, in its various forms, back into the meat processing industry in Australia. I make no comment whatsoever about his claims, other than to say that I share his concerns in this area. I can state before the House that I have seen the very unfortunate situation in which, in my own electorate, a major abattoir employing 400 people was closed in circumstances in which the owners blamed people like the meatworkers and Wally Curran and all the rest of them, whereas in fact it had failed to pay tax instalments to the Australian Taxation Office, it had failed to pay its meat inspection fees and had not passed on to the Taxation Office the tax deductions taken out of workers' wages. For a whole lot of reasons in that particular case the episode came to a halt. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am also aware that banks have made very large loans to this operation against security which does not exist, and I have to say that I drew some inferences into this whole exercise which are similar to those which have been drawn by the honourable member for Gippsland. </PARA>
<PARA>  So, while I do not think it helpful for the meat processing industry in Australia to have the whole thing dragged through the coals again, as happened with the meat substitution rackets--(Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA>  I note that now that the House has a quorum, there are about 50 members of the Government in the House and I think three members of the Opposition. I am thankful to my colleagues for coming into the House, and I inform them that I will not be very long. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was making the comment that I had observed the public comments of the honourable member for Gippsland about his concerns that organised crime had infiltrated the meat industry. I made the observation that I agree with him that it is a matter of concern. This goes to the very heart of what I was talking about earlier. The NCA has gone to enormous lengths to ensure that these issues are properly examined and properly tried in the courtroom process as it evolves. I do not mean the meat issues;  I have no idea whether the NCA is investigating or has any interest in that area. The point I make, though, is that the issue is now, rather sensationally, on the front page. </PARA>
<PARA>  Two problems are associated with that. One is that the meat industry in Australia will certainly suffer, not from the exposure of these things if they are real, but for the same reason that it took nearly a decade to recover from the antics of the spivs associated with the substitution of kangaroo meat and horse meat in export meat. During that time, most of the blame was pointed towards the unions and the workers in the industry. I hope there is not an overreaction to these claims in the judgment of the Australian meat industry. Because of the processes the NCA is now going through to ensure proper education of the key players in the game, I am sure that these matters will be better and more properly examined in the public forums. </PARA>
<PARA>  I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to my colleague the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). He is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, which oversees the NCA. He took up that role about 18 months ago in very difficult circumstances. We have now evolved to the point where I believe it can be said that the Committee is working very cooperatively, not only with the NCA but amongst Committee members as well. Interestingly enough, only a few weeks ago we had our first ever meeting with the IGC. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) is to be commended for convincing his State colleagues that there was merit in having discussions with the other body that has the parliamentary responsibility for monitoring the NCA, the Parliamentary Joint Committee. That process is going along well, and the honourable member for Herbert and the Attorney-General should both be given credit for that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe these proposals add significantly to the ability of the NCA to carry out its function. Its function has changed. It is now much more of a coordinator and leading light in the fight against organised crime rather than the solo kind of role it was playing in its early years, albeit for good reason. As I said earlier, the Chairman of the NCA, Justice Phillips, his colleagues and the people working for the NCA deserve considerable credit from this Parliament for the way they have adapted to the very significant change taking place in the role and scope of their organisation. I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-in reply--In summing up on the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill, I propose to deal with the amendments proposed by the Opposition. Before doing so, however, I should like to pick up on a few general points raised during the debate. It is reasonable to say that something that ran through all the speeches--those of the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) specifically, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) and, probably by implication, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), if it was not explicit--was the fact that there is a great deal of support for the efforts of the new Chairman of the NCA, Mr Justice Phillips. That is extremely pleasing to me for two reasons. Firstly, it is very satisfying to see an appointment to the chair of the NCA of somebody like Mr Justice Phillips whom, I must say, I thought was not likely to accept. Secondly, the acceptance of his appointment on both sides of the House showed that there is bipartisanship in some areas, and this was apparent twice tonight in debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  One aspect of the work done by Mr Justice Phillips was mentioned by the honourable member for Burke, who referred to the seminar held in Melbourne, under the auspices of the NCA, on complex trials of white collar crime. Sometimes a solution is put forward--in my view, a gross oversimplification--that these trials should be conducted by a specialist court and not by a jury. We would need to be very careful about ever going down that path. The Guinness trial in England showed that one does not have to have a specialist court to hear complex white collar charges. In that trial the jury was given more assistance than usual, even to the extent of having somewhere they could properly take notes; the court was set up in a different way. Looking at something of that nature indicated the change of direction of the NCA, and it was appreciated by all involved. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Herbert and the honourable member for Burke were gracious in their reference to some of the problems that existed between the parliamentary committee, the NCA and, to a large extent, the intergovernmental committee. As the honourable member for Burke said, the honourable member for Herbert came to the position of Chairman of the Committee in difficult circumstances. May I say that he was also pretty difficult, quite correctly, in his defence of his Committee. It was not easy for him, because Committee members had strong views. I will not go back over the matters that concerned the intergovernmental committee; I would rather we put them behind us. I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his efforts in bringing about a lessening of the differences between the IGC and the Joint Parliamentary Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>   The meeting of the IGC and the Joint Parliamentary Committee started off in a rather strange way. Those honourable members opposite who are members of the Committee will confirm this. I think that people sat there staring at each other for a long while, and it was not all that easy to break the ice. Once the discussion got going it was quite clear that there would be an improvement--I must say, it could not have got much worse--in the relationship between the two bodies. I thank the honourable member for Herbert and all members of the Committee, on both sides of the House, for what was a very constructive meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Sturt raised some specific matters and asked for some answers. They concerned the proposals by Mr Justice Phillips for further amendments to the Act in relation to the Joint Parliamentary Committee. Firstly, he mentioned the secrecy provisions; secondly, greater definition in the area of investigations; thirdly, as a result of the removal of the secrecy provisions, that Committee members be subject to confidentiality; fourthly, the disputes between the two bodies--the Committee and the NCA; fifthly, public hearings; and, finally, and most significantly, the IGC's proposal for the abolition of the Committee. In summary, those were the matters raised by the honourable member for Sturt. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many of those matters have been overtaken as a result of the first of the meetings between the parliamentary Committee and the IGC. The IGC has not had an opportunity to consider those matters further since that meeting with the Committee, but the intergovernmental committee will be meeting in Melbourne on Friday week, and it is the intention of the Committee to address those proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>  One other matter that is causing some difficulty is the proposal that we on the IGC put forward--to move towards a judicial arbiter in relation to some matters involving the Committee, and the NCA more specifically. I do not know whether that matter has quite as much support now as it did, but I would not want in any way to pre-empt the thinking of the IGC on Friday week. However, in starting negotiations with what was a very difficult Committee in the sense of the independence of its members on both sides of the House--I will put it no stronger than that --I think the ante was raised when the abolition of the Committee was put forward by the intergovernmental committee. The atmosphere at the time was so bad--this was the view of all the State Attorneys on the intergovernmental committee as well as my own view--that the abolition of the Committee was put forward as a very serious and considered position. I would be very surprised if that matter is pushed any further. It arose, I think, because of all of the matters that I have mentioned. The atmosphere is now different. </PARA>
<PARA>  In some ways, the fact that it got to that stage was a bit of a lesson to all. I think the responsibilities of the parliamentary Committee, the NCA and the intergovernmental committee are probably now better understood. I do not think that there will be any further attempts to suggest that a parliamentary committee set up to oversee the NCA should be abolished. That matter was touched on to some extent by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews). He said that the NCA was not a court of law--nobody disputes that--but that it has many powers which are normally reserved for a court, and that is why, of course, a parliamentary committee was established. But I think that issue has passed. </PARA>
<PARA>  In respect of the amendments foreshadowed by the Opposition, I must say that, while I know that the best laid plans sometimes come unstuck, I did not see these amendments until 8.15 this evening and I only had a chance to consider them during the debate. The first amendment proposes the substitution of the word `would' for the word `may' in respect of disclosure. In the short time I have had to look at that amendment, I must say that it does not cause me any particular difficulties. Subject to looking at the drafting and having the necessary discussions, it may be an amendment which does not cause the Government much concern at all; in fact, my immediate disposition is that, subject to procedures which I might indicate in a moment, the amendment is likely to be accepted on this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second amendment is very similar. This amendment requires the reasons for the inclusion of the notation and the written statement of the rights and obligations. At this stage, I think that amendment would also commend itself to the Government, after we have had an opportunity to give it consideration. There is nothing in either of those amendments which, at first glance, causes me any great concern. </PARA>
<PARA>  I indicate that the third amendment--again, I have not had the opportunity to peruse it in detail; I think the honourable member for Burke mentioned it--does cause me a fair bit of concern, not necessarily for the reasons that the honourable member for Burke put forward. As one who may voluntarily or involuntarily have to return to the legal profession at some stage, I do not propose to join him in his views of it at this stage, other than to say I share his concern that it may lead to a lot of litigation, as has been mentioned by the honourable member for Burke. More significantly than that, though, I think it would create a real difficulty in the NCA's investigations. If it found itself before the Federal Court, it would have to disclose a lot of information about the nature of the case that was currently under investigation. I think that would become extremely complex. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not propose to accept the first and second amendments of the Opposition tonight, because I have not had the opportunity to examine them closely in the last half an hour. In respect of the first two amendments, it may be that the matter can be sorted out in the Senate. It would then be very simple for those amendments to come back here. Whilst I cannot agree to them this evening for the reasons that I have put, I do not see any reason why those two amendments could not be accepted at a later stage, and that certainly is my disposition at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do have some real difficulties with the third amendment. Once again, I would like an opportunity to have a look at it. I think that the honourable member for Burke and the honourable member for Herbert mentioned that amendment, which does cause us some difficulties. Because the third amendment seeks to insert a new provision in the principal Act rather than amend it, those amendments will not be able to be dealt with together but rather clause by clause. So I have decided that, rather than interrupt the committee stage, it was better to indicate my view on the amendments at this stage. I confirm that, whilst favourably disposed to the first two amendments for the reasons that I have put, I do not propose to accept them tonight. But I think that they will be back here in the not too distant future. In respect of the third amendment, at this stage I find it impossible even to contemplate accepting it, but it is one that I will also have a look at. </PARA>

<PARA>  I thank the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) for his very kind comment about my speech in the second reading debate. He went on to say that he had difficulty with all the amendments. I emphasise that if these amendments were accepted--and I very much appreciate the Attorney's present response--they would give the National Crime Authority a very wide discretion to determine that one of these notations should be made. This amendment would then put an obligation on the Authority to include such a notation in the circumstances specified in the amendment. The Authority would be required to do that when the circumstances would reasonably be expected to prejudice, firstly, the safety or reputation of a person; secondly, the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence; or, thirdly, the effectiveness of the investigations. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would have thought those grounds would be quite self-explanatory to the honourable member for Herbert. What we are saying is that where the Authority may reasonably expect any of those events to occur--not just in a discretion, because there are wider circumstances in which the Authority may want to use the power that is contained in the Government's amendment to the Bill, but in these special circumstances--it would be obligatory to give people that notification. As implied by the honourable member for Herbert, we are not only concerned about the tip-off situation. Of course, where the tip-off situation is the reason for putting the notation, it should be in the discretion of the Authority. Our concern is as to the manner in which it might affect individuals, as to their safety, their reputation or their fair trial. In circumstances where that can reasonably be expected to occur, even if the Authority is not concerned about the tip-off implications, we think people should be protected by the inclusion of such a notation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I apologise to the Attorney if my best laid plans did not give him the opportunity of seeing these amendments earlier. I had intended and hoped that the plans put in place would have resulted in him having that opportunity. I appreciate, therefore, his comments as he reads my amendments this evening, and in that context I look forward to us dealing with them in the manner in which the Attorney has described: that they go to the Senate and the Government has more time to consider our proposition. I hope the Government adheres to the view that it has expressed this evening, that it makes any necessary drafting alterations to the achievement of the purposes I have outlined and that we hear from the Senate that these amendments are to be made to the Government's Bill and the necessary procedures are put in place to incorporate proposed clauses 2A and 2B in the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>    `(d)  a person claims to be entitled to refuse to comply with the terms of a notation included in a summons or notice under section 29A;'". </PARA>
<PARA>I listened to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). I understand that, as he sees it at the moment, he has some difficulties with this amendment. But he did say that he would examine the purpose of our proposal. It may be that our purposes could be achieved in a way that would overcome the difficulties that the Attorney presently sees and the way in which we have drafted that proposal. I have asked him to look at it and I accept his assurance that he will. </PARA>
<PARA>  In light of that, although we would like to see that amendment put in--as in the different circumstances of the first amendment that I moved he has indicated general acceptance--I accept his undertaking to examine it and, therefore, rather than divide the House on this amendment, I accept the arrangement that it be considered in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>  I point that out because I want the Attorney and the Government to understand that we do believe very strongly in the desirability of the amendment, and I would not like my action in not dividing on it to be taken as any lessening of our support for that amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Hearing Services Bill provides for the establishment of the Hearing Services Authority from 1 July next year. It follows a Cabinet decision in October last year that the National Acoustic Laboratories now become a statutory authority to be known as the Hearing Services Authority. It also repeals the Acoustic Laboratories Act 1948 and amends the National Health Act 1953 to bring the delivery of hearing services under one piece of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  NAL has been around for a considerable length of time and offers a range of services which broadly fall into three areas: firstly, the research area; secondly, the manufacturing area--either directly or indirectly; and, thirdly, into a service provision area. It provides audiological services, including hearing aids, and in particular hearing aids are presently free of charge under the hearing services program for a range of people, including people under 21 years of age, social security pensioners holding a health benefits card and their dependents, DBA pensioners, members of the armed services, people referred by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, Commonwealth compensation clients and people referred by Commonwealth medical officers. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a whole range of people who, by and large but not exhaustively and completely, are in a disadvantaged group. Certainly the largest number of NAL clients fall into the pensioner group and are, therefore, considered to be somewhat disadvantaged. NAL has in the order of 44 permanent hearing centres and some 65 visiting clinics, all of which are supported by the central laboratory in Chatswood. The central laboratory also undertakes research into hearing loss and evaluates various hearing aids, other audiological equipment and procedures in terms of ways of fitting hearing aids and the like. </PARA>
<PARA>  Until the recent collaborative arrangement, most of the hearing aids dispensed by NAL had been assembled locally using a case and mechanical parts made in Australia, but using imported electronic components. NAL has until recently purchased most of its hearing aids by tender from various producers and assemblers in Australia made to NAL specifications. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note that until recently at least--and according to these figures I have--the majority of NAL's hearing aids are behind-the-ear hearing aids, whereas most of the aids dispensed by commercial distributors in the private sector--and there are some 31,000 of those--are in-the-ear aids, those that actually bury themselves in the auditory canal and are, therefore, much more discreet. This, in fact, follows a worldwide trend. </PARA>
<PARA>   The services offered by NAL are indeed very comprehensive and many of its clients develop a very close bond with it. They have complaints about NAL, of course, but they also have some praise. The complaints largely relate to inefficiencies of the service offered. As with many large bureaucracies, NAL has problems in terms of the efficiency of the service offered. There are some complaints about the quality of the hearing aids offered and there has been some criticism of the fact that some of the standards of NAL hearing aids have lagged behind the leading edge of the hearing aid market and certainly behind the quality and the standards of those available in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>   For a number of reasons, the Industry Commission--and prior to that the Industries Assistance Commission, its predecessor--issued some reports on the functions of NAL. The first one was in 1981 when the Industries Assistance Commission issued a report Hearing Aids and Certain Parts Thereof. It found that the Government sector was not subject to market forces and encouraged, therefore, inefficient uses of those resources, resulting in unnecessary costs to consumers and taxpayers. That report was some 10 years ago when, in fact, my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), who is at the table with me, was Minister for Health. The report found that the private sector, taking over NAL's role, would benefit the community in general and the hearing impaired in particular. </PARA>
<PARA>  There was subsequently a report last year by the Industry Commission which found a number of interesting facts: firstly, that NAL had lagged behind in meeting consumer demand, especially in terms of the in-the-ear hearing aids; secondly, in comparison with commercial private area distributors, it provided an aid which was much less pleasing cosmetically and which was technically inferior; and, thirdly, that it did not offer great flexibility in the provision of services when compared to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  In its submission to the Industry Commission, the Hearing Aid Council of Australia claimed that commercial distributors updated on a more regular basis and kept pace with new technology, whereas NAL tended to stay with the same technology long after it was outdated. The same council also submitted that, if the private sector had access to the 65 per cent of market which was effectively locked up into NAL, the private sector would be able to realise significant economies of scale and cost and the cost of most private sector fittings could be reduced by about 25 per cent. The Department of Community Services and Health, however, believed that the only problem with NAL was the fluctuation in waiting times which was, in fact, a problem and indeed still is a problem. On the other hand, it offered a very highly regarded service delivery network, particularly with its mobile clinics which went into isolated areas, which many of its clients found to be of great value. The Council also referred to the high degree of competence and skill, particularly in dealing with paediatric cases, which is a very specialised area and requires expert auditory services which NAL claims--and I think with some justification--it can provide in a much better way than the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  There were also a number of submissions in support of NAL in the April draft report. I have a list of sources for those submissions, but I will not go through them here in the interests of time. A number of the submissions were very concerned that changing the structure of NAL in any significant way would have lead to a downgrading of audiological services, particularly to deaf and hearing-impaired children. One claim was that the special expertise of NAL in the paediatric area would have been lost because the private sector lacked that expertise and, particularly, had more expertise in audiometry as opposed to audiology; that is, the fitting of hearing aids rather than the whole question of looking at hearing problems. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is some truth in that, of course, but it is also true that because NAL has 65 per cent of the market it tends to corner the market in audiologists. There is no reason at all why if, in fact, the fitting of hearing aids, particularly to hearing-impaired children, was farmed out to the private sector, then those audiologists would certainly go to the private sector as well. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are other concerns, as is always the case with the suggestion of privatisation, which the draft report suggested. It also suggested that the private sector would not have an interest in the provision to the paediatric segment; it would not want to go to isolated areas; and it would not be able to offer the service that NAL provided because it would be cost driven. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fact that NAL hearing aids are standardised is, of course, both a bonus and a demerit. The advantage, of course, is that it allows for the very rapid servicing and the maintenance of a reasonable stock of spare parts and that that servicing is relatively simple because the staff involved are trained in that one particular type of hearing aid. The disadvantage, of course, is that we get locked into out-of-date technology. That certainly seems to have been the case with NAL to a significant extent. There was also the question of whether the private sector might actually overservice the hearing impaired, although there was no evidence really provided to support such a suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the end, the suggestions and the recommendations of the Industry Commission report were: firstly, that all suppliers should be permitted to compete to provide hearing aids under the hearing services program; secondly, that NAL itself should be privatised, separated from the Department of Community Services and Health, as it then was, and funded by payments for the services it provides to hearing services program clients and from revenue generated from sales to those not eligible for such Commonwealth assistance; thirdly, that a schedule of fees should be established to apply for hearing aids and services; fourthly, that the provision of hearing aids and services to children should be restricted to medical practitioners and audiologists; and, fifthly, that full refunds be given for the total cost of hearing aids and services to a variety of children. </PARA>
<PARA>   The report suggested that tenders should be invited for the provision of non-commercial services, such as visits to schools and to Aboriginal communities, and that the Government in particular should set aside its proposed collaborative arrangement between NAL and the private sector manufacturer. This collaborative arrangement has, indeed, caused some problems. I will come back to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA>   The Bill before us does not alter the availability of services to the clients of NAL, but it does, however, provide for the making of regulations to set charges for hearing services. The Minister, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples) announced in this year's budget that a $25 annual fee will be imposed to cover the annual supply of batteries, et cetera. The charge is per individual but will apply neither to families in receipt of FAS nor to children of eligible clients. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think it is fair to point out that the establishment of the authority is central to the collaborative arrangement that I mentioned between NAL and a commercial partner known as Australian Hearing Aids, which is a joint venture between a Swiss consortium and Crystalaid which is, I understand, a wholly owned Australian manufacturing company based in Queensland. The aim of this collaborative arrangement is to design, develop and supply programmable hearing aids in particular to NAL clients. The plan is to develop an export market in Asia, the USA and, indeed, Europe. In the long run, that export market theoretically should be worth something like $9m. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry Commission suggested that the collaborative arrangement should be done away with. It said that there was a range of problems with the proposed arrangement. We also had criticism from a number of the competitors of the partners in the arrangement. For example, Starkey Laboratories (Australia) Pty Ltd, one hearing aid manufacturer which has a very high reputation both locally and overseas, disputed both the value of the anticipated export market and the provision by the collaborative arrangement of low cost, Australian produced hearing aids. Starkey's view was that many hearing aids already on the Australian market are at least equal to, if not more advanced than, the product which the collaborative arrangement hopes to produce--which, of course, is in complete conflict with the statement of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services at the opening of the joint venture in Queensland on 16 September, when he claimed that the hearing aid program was `in advance of any other type in the world'. That does not seem to be the view of the rest of the industry, but I accept that it may have a slightly more biased point of view there. I am not in a position to make a value judgment on the matter. I simply raise the fact that there have been suggestions that the truth--and the whole truth--has not been entirely told in regard to the quality of the product which is available. </PARA>
<PARA>  Certainly it is true that there are something like a dozen companies supplying the USA and Europe and, unless the particular product is vastly or significantly superior to those which are already on the market there, it seems unlikely that there will be much scope for further export potential for this new Australian product. There was also, of course, concern about the way in which only selected companies were invited to submit expressions of interest in the tender and the limited amount of time which was available to complete that tender. There have also been some complaints about the proposed legislation from pensioner groups, despite the exemption of FAS recipients and children of NAL clients, who are opposed to the $25 charge. </PARA>
<PARA>  But we support the Government in this matter. We are always open minded about these things and happy to give a helpful hand. We believe that, with escalating health costs, there is an argument for some type of price signal. I think it is fair to say that the price which individuals would pay if the Commonwealth were not supporting this program would be at least $50 to $100, if one were buying the batteries alone at retail prices, and people would have to pay for maintenance, repairs and the replacement of damaged or lost aids. There are a number of advantages here. </PARA>
<PARA>  The question is whether we should go further than the proposal to establish a statutory authority and adopt the recommendations of the Industry Commission, which basically are to privatise NAL and do away with the collaborative arrangement. But, as I said, we on this side of the House are an open minded bunch, and we are happy to look at the proposed Hearings Services Authority and give it a chance to work. We believe that a bipartisan approach is appropriate in this situation, so we will not be opposing the recommendations in the Bill. We will support the Government in this matter. We hope that the change to an independent statutory authority and the associated independence from government regulations and the bureaucracy may lead to an improvement in the service. It may lead to an increase in competition. We do have some doubts about the collaborative arrangement, but we are hopeful that our doubts will be unfounded and that NAL will resurrect itself and become a very competitive and viable body in the hearing aid market. </PARA>
<PARA>  The most important reason for this is, of course, not the Government coffers or, indeed, the coffers of the independent authority, but to make sure that the best quality service is offered to the clients of NAL, in particular to such disadvantaged groups as pensioners and children who are hearing impaired. It is vital that we make sure not only that they are protected and have access to a hearing service but also that they have access to the very best hearing service and the very best hearing aids, to prompt attention to any problems which might arise and, particularly with the children involved, that they have very regular follow-ups. It is very important during the development of children that the fittings, in particular, are altered on a regular basis. This is to make sure that the fittings inside the ear are good, tight fittings; otherwise the hearing aids are unable to function at their optimum level. </PARA>
<PARA>  They, overwhelmingly, are the most important criteria which the Opposition has followed. We hope that the independent statutory authority will be able to achieve these ends and, for that reason, we will support the legislation. But I take this opportunity to raise a few points which the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has raised and to ask the Minister for comments on those. Firstly, subclause 4(1) defines `hearing products' as including:</PARA>
<PARA>(e) such other products as the Minister determines to be hearing products. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee considers that this is a Henry VIII clause, which effectively means that the Minister could extend the meaning by way of subordinate legislation. The Committee considers that this is an inappropriate delegation of legislative power as it allows the effects and application of primary legislation to be extended by delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second problem is with subclause 5(1), which sets out the classes of persons who are to be treated as eligible persons. Again the Minister has the power to determine who comes under this definition and again the Committee considers this to be an inappropriate delegation of legislative power. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third problem that the Committee has is with subclause 66(5). This imposes a fine for the improper use of the name `NAL' or `National Acoustic Laboratories' or other names as prescribed. Again, the Committee raises the same concern that this may be considered to be an inappropriate delegation of legislative power. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fourth and last concern which the Senate Standing Committee had was clause 70, which provides that Australian Hearing Services had the power to delegate all or any of its powers to a person. The Committee considers that it may be appropriate to limit the classes of person to whom those powers may be delegated, and the Committee also notes that the explanatory memorandum is misleading in that it assumes that the clause provides that that person is a member of the authority or a member of the staff of the authority when that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA>  In summary, we will support this Bill. Our aim in supporting this is to ensure that the very best quality hearing services are offered, in particular to the disadvantaged groups in our society--the pensioners and the hearing impaired young. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Hearing Services Bill this evening, as I am sure that many of my constituents will welcome the adoption of this legislation. I also welcome the support that has been provided this evening by the Opposition and I applaud the Opposition's decision to support this Bill in the interests of a better service for hearing impaired people throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Bill provides for the establishment of the Hearing Services Authority from the start of the next financial year to provide a national scheme for the delivery of hearing rehabilitation and hearing impairment prevention services. The Hearing Services Authority will provide eligible clients with enhanced quality, cost effective, timely and relevant hearing services. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill is beneficial as it does not impact upon the delivery of services to NAL's hearing impaired clients. It simply makes changes to the administrative and operational aspects of the program. NAL will continue to provide hearing rehabilitation services to its traditional clients. There will be no change to eligibility under the new Act. As the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) said, the Authority will continue to provide hearing rehabilitation services to Department of Social Security pensioners with a pensioner health benefits card and their dependants, veterans' affairs pensioners, anyone under the age of 21 years, people referred by the Australian defence forces, Comcare, the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service and the Australian Government Health Service. </PARA>
<PARA>  In developing this legislation, the Government has reaffirmed its commitment to the hearing impaired in the community. During the term of the Hawke Government, the number of permanently staffed centres has increased to ensure eligible National Acoustic Laboratories clients receive the same level of service wherever they attend a NAL centre. In doing so, the Government has rejected the report of the Industry Commission into the National Acoustic Laboratories. In April last year, when the Industry Commission released its draft report, it recommended that the National Acoustic Laboratories' operations be open ended and that other suppliers be allowed to provide hearing aids under the Federal Government's subsidy scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  NAL provides more than 70,000 hearing aids a year. This is more than 65 per cent of all hearing aids distributed in Australia. These people all benefit from the National Acoustic Laboratories. The Government's NAL hearing services program employs a team of highly trained and caring people. These include university trained audiologists, some of whom specialise in either paediatric or adult services, technicians and administrative staff, who all work hard so that eligible clients receive the level of service they require to enable them to communicate effectively in their everyday life. These services are delivered through a network of over 100 permanent and visiting NAL hearing centres to ensure that all clients receive the same level of service across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Deafness is a problem which confronts many Australians. Each year in Australia, up to 500 babies are born with a significant hearing loss. These children face major disadvantage. Many face a lifelong battle to communicate; many will never achieve a high standard of education; and few have any real chance of a professional career. According to Dr Merv Hyde, a lecturer in education at Griffith University in my electorate, less than one per cent of people with severe hearing impairment reach tertiary education level, and even fewer achieve any kind of professional career. The figure for the hearing section of the population is about 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last year when the Industry Commission released its report I was contacted by many of my constituents--relatives, families and friends of the hearing impaired, as well as clients of the service--who urged me to lobby the Government not to adopt the recommendations of the Commission. Many times daily I was confronted with stories of how some of the most vulnerable in our community--the aged or those struggling to raise and educate deaf children--would be adversely affected by the changes proposed by the Industry Commission. It is these people, who already face severe disadvantage in our community, who would have been most adversely affected by the changes. They pleaded that they should not be further disadvantaged by the changes that would have been introduced with the adoption of the Commission's report. </PARA>
<PARA>  It must be pointed out that not one single person contacted me asking that I lobby for the adoption of the Industry Commission report. That is to say, not one person in my electorate wanted the Government to follow the recommendations of the Industry Commission--or no-one was prepared to admit support for such harsh proposals. It is important to note that the clients of the National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) do not believe that they would be better off with a privatised service. The clients of the National Acoustic Laboratories want a fair and equitable service to which they can have reasonable access. </PARA>
<PARA>  For the hearing impaired within our community to have a better chance of success means addressing the issue of hearing problems as early as possible and doing as much as possible to reduce the impairment. This was recognised by the Industry Commission in its revised report, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>NAL tests all children referred to it. Urgent cases, usually children with certain `risk factors' apparent after initial screenings by doctors, health clinics, community nurses, etc are given highest priority and are usually seen within a week. The initial assessment procedure for children aged three years or less involves three audiologists, one of whom is a paediatric audiologist. Each child requires an average of 10 hours with audiologists when first diagnosed, then several hours per year thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA>This was after the report had earlier noted:</PARA>
<PARA>Many participants noted that NAL employs only audiologists, including those who specialise in paediatric work. They argued that the equivalent service is not available outside NAL because most assessment and fitting of hearing aids, in the private sector, is undertaken by audiometrists who have little experience in working with children. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the crucial point and the crucial reason why so many people opposed the Industry Commission's report. They realised that they would not receive the same level of service for their children from a privatised service. Many parents who contacted me stated that they were concerned that the private sector would not have the capacity to provide the same comprehensive service as they receive from the audiologists employed by NAL. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission accepts that some groups now treated by NAL, in particular children, require specialised treatment. It also notes that many participants praised the quality of services provided to children by NAL audiologists, and expressed scepticism about the private sector's ability to provide a suitable service to this group. </PARA>
<PARA>Privatising NAL would mean that hearing impaired children would be further isolated within the community; communication would be even more difficult as they would have great difficulty in accessing quality hearing aids at affordable prices. </PARA>
<PARA>  What does the Bill before us do?  First of all, it replaces several outdated and archaic Acts and combines them into one easily readable piece of legislation. The Bill will establish the Australian Hearing Services Authority to provide services that will include hearing loss assessment, the selection and fitting of appropriate hearing aids and devices, and counselling at no cost to the client. It is only in respect of the repair and maintenance of hearing aids and devices and for the annual supply of batteries that clients other than those in receipt of the family allowance supplement and children of eligible clients will now be required to make a small contribution. The Department of Veterans' Affairs will cover veterans for this cost.  I appreciate the support of the Opposition on this point in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reorganisation of NAL as a statutory authority represents just one part of the reforms for the delivery of services to clients who have a hearing impairment and who would not be able to afford the hearing aids and devices supplied by the private sector. Honourable members will be pleased to hear that considerable progress has been made with the joint venture between NAL and its commercial partner, Australian Hearing Aids (AHA). Recently the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), was in Brisbane to open a hearing aid plant in Fortitude Valley. Unfortunately, that is not in my electorate, but it is in the electorate of the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis). </PARA>
<PARA>  Under collaborative arrangements, NAL will enter into an arrangement with Australian Hearing Aids to develop and produce state-of-the-art hearing products at this plant. AHA will manufacture hearing aids in Australia under a supply contract with the Government. This new facility in Brisbane will manufacture some 70,000 hearing aid units in the first 12 months. By 1994 it is expected to be producing 250,000 hearing aids annually and some 400,000 remote control units. This new plant is good news for Brisbane, good news for Queensland, and good news for the hearing impaired throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Despite what the Industry Commission chooses to believe, National Acoustic Laboratories has achieved international recognition for its research and development activities with a number of recent achievements, and I would like to list them. First is the procedures for prescribing and fitting hearing aids, the first being the Byrne Dillion hearing aid selection slide rule, which has now been computerised and is to be launched and marketed in the United States. Secondly, in regard to hearing conservation, there is the evaluation and testing of hearing protection devices, with the development of a new device that will provide natural protection from high level sounds while not cutting out speech, hence not impeding communication. </PARA>
<PARA>  A third initiative has been to develop and introduce a new type of radio frequency hearing aid used by NAL clients, particularly benefiting Aboriginal children. A fourth initiative has been the development of procedures for identifying auditory receptive language problems in young children, which enables action to be taken to minimise reading and learning problems. Finally, NAL has made major contributions to relevant Australian and international standards for hearing aids, electro-acoustic and audiometric equipment, hearing conservation, noise and acoustics. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has been a substantial increase in the number of hearing impaired Australians assisted by NAL over recent years. There has been a 15 per cent increase in the number of applications over the last two years. More timely services are now available to NAL clients, with waiting times now of less than six weeks in 40 per cent of the centres. NAL has also designed and developed FM systems for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders with hearing loss resulting from chronic middle ear infections. Some 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Queensland alone use NAL FM hearing aids. This service is especially important to these young people, according to Dr Hyde from Griffith University, who states:</PARA>
<PARA>In some Aboriginal communities for instance, some 60 percent of the kids have a middle ear disease at any one time and a lot of them have it recurrently month after month. It leaves a terrible legacy in terms of lost learning during those early years at school. </PARA>
<PARA>These children, who benefit so much from the National Acoustic Laboratories, will clearly not benefit from the suggestion of privatisation of hearing aid services. Privatisation will hamper even more the process of learning for these children. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Authority not only will fit and maintain hearing aids but also will research into hearing loss, hearing assessment and rehabilitation, hearing loss prevention and the effects of noise on people. A further activity for the Authority which fits with its more commercial orientation will be the hearing impairment prevention services provided by NAL. These activities fit well with the Government's overall objective of promoting better health in the community. Clearly, the National Acoustic Laboratories provide a complete and comprehensive service for their clients and the changes contained in this legislation will benefit those clients. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>  The services to date have been provided by NAL through 44 permanent hearing centres and 65 visiting clinics. In 1989-90 NAL fitted some 66,700 hearing aids. Outlays for the hearing services program totalled $34.128m in 1990-91 and are estimated to total $53.29m in 1991-92. These outlays, particularly that huge increase, must be seen in the context of the health system generally. There is almost a $10 billion shortfall between the cost of the Medicare system in Australia and the health provided by it and the sum raised by the Medicare levy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Given the problem generally of scarce resources, the question arises as to what health services we are able to afford as a nation. In these circumstances there is an argument for patient contributions to the cost of the services that are being provided by NAL currently. Indeed, as the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) indicated earlier, it has been estimated that most users of the system would have to pay about $50 to $100 per year for the batteries, the maintenance and the repairs if charged at commercially realistic rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is understandable that the professional providers of hearing services and the pensioner and other groups have been opposed to the user pays principle underlying this Hearing Services Bill. But the annual charge of $25 proposed to be imposed by regulation remains at most a part payment in a health system already costing the nation billions of dollars.   What the concerns of these groups point to is the failure of the Government to recognise the increasing demand for resources for the communication impaired. Nearly one in 10 Australians suffers from a hearing impairment, and this ratio leaps to one in three in the age group of 65 years and over. With an increasingly aged population, it is apparent that hearing services must be prepared and equipped to cope with an increase in demand over the rest of this decade. It is tragically true that a communication impairment can happen to anyone--some through birth, some through accidents later in life. </PARA>
<PARA>  The inability to communicate strikes at the very heart of our humanity. It affects not merely the way in which we are treated but also the way in which we see ourselves. Many well-known people have suffered from various communication disorders. The former Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran, suffered the paralysis of one of his two vocal chords which had to be treated by injection and which accounts for his rather husky voice. Elton John has small growths or nodules on his vocal chords, which are the lot of the professional singer. Roald Dahl's wife fought her way back from a stroke. King George VI was afflicted with a pronounced stutter that he largely managed to overcome in two years of daily speech therapy after he became king. Winston Churchill and Marilyn Monroe--an unlikely pairing--are also thought to have overcome stutters in their early days. Of course, many of us would have seen the actress Marlee Matlin, who starred in the film Children of a Lesser God, who was born hearing impaired. </PARA>
<PARA>  In only 20 years time 25 per cent of our population will be over 60 years of age. As our nation ages, our need for the treatment of hearing and communication disorders will become even more urgent than it is already. Ninety-five per cent of people in nursing homes have one or more communication disorders, yet there is only one--one--full time speech pathologist employed in nursing homes throughout Australia. There is no provision for staff in nursing homes to train in and understand how best to communicate with people in their care. Most of the centres and homes which care for people with communication disorders and disabilities do not have regular access to audiologists or speech pathologists, or these services are available only on an irregular or consultancy basis. Only 40 per cent of private hospitals and nursing homes in the private sector receive a consultancy service. </PARA>
<PARA>  This neglect of the need for speech pathology and related audiology services in our community makes communication impairment the invisible sister in the field of disability. It is much easier to hand out artificial limbs than it is to give ongoing regular or continuous therapy that may last for years. Lack of resources means added stress for both the clients and the professional carers who cannot act on their own diagnosis of what a person may need but, because of budgetary and therefore financial constraints, have to give people only the crumbs of the small cake available rather than what they need. We are talking about giving some people access to the society that the rest of us take for granted; the results are tragic in terms of the loss of human potential. </PARA>
<PARA>  The cost to government has yet to be appreciated. While 71 per cent of the communication impaired population was identified in a 1986 survey as having an intellectual disability, almost 30 per cent of these people are unable to communicate or have difficulty in communicating but are not in any way intellectually impaired. For these individuals, effective treatment by trained people is the difference between being able to make a life with dignity for themselves and a death-in-life in which their needs, their desires and their interests cannot be expressed or developed. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill again highlights some of the real issues that the Government refuses to face up to about the Australian health system. The Government is willing to introduce a kind of co-payment system here for these services to be provided by the new Australian Hearing Services Authority, but baulks at any realistic assessment of the overall cost of our health system. </PARA>
<PARA>  Moreover, the views of the Industry Commission have been rejected in this legislation. The Commission concluded that the Government's proposed collaborative arrangement would not be in the community's best interests and should be set aside. In its April 1990 draft report it called the proposed joint venture proposal naive and destined to fail unless it received substantial financial assistance. It concluded by quoting a hearing aid manufacturer which, in its submission to the Commission, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>  . . . the collaborative arrangement cannot be, will not be of any benefit to anyone except the commercial company. The reason they will benefit is they will be in a position to totally dominate the private sector market. There will be no exports of significance. </PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Commission's proposal was that all suppliers should be permitted to compete to provide hearing aids and that the National Acoustic Laboratories should be privatised and separated from the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. They should be funded by payments for the services they provide to hearing services program clients and from the revenue generated from sales to those who are not eligible for Commonwealth assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>  Here again is the obscenity of the Labor health fantasy:  by continuing to subsidise all, including those who can pay for their own health services, Labor's Mad Hatter health policy continues to pretend that the barrel of resources is bottomless, whilst depriving those who ought to be protected of a safety net of its advantages. One can see this demonstrated yet again in this Bill. The eligibility requirements set out in clause 5 not only include those people who hold a card issued by the Commonwealth, known as a pensioner health benefits card, a red service card or a yellow card, to the benefits of which one might expect to be entitled under the provisions of this legislation, but also include a person who is under 21 years of age, a member of the Australian Defence Force and a person who is an officer or employee within the meaning of the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  Here we have a system of positive discrimination towards certain persons arbitrarily chosen by the Minister and the Government to receive these services, when many of these persons--persons under 21 years of age, members of the Australian Defence Force and persons who are employees within the meaning of the Public Service Act--are also entitled to the same provisions and the same benefits as the pensioner receives. The ranking star general in the Australian Defence Force or a senior public servant within the Commonwealth Public Service is, under these provisions, still an eligible person. Here we have what I could only describe as Labor's Mad Hatter health policy being demonstrated again. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the same time, some of the real concerns of audiologists and speech pathologists are not being met. Will these professionals be represented on the board of the new body? Will there be adequate finance for the research which the Bill predicts, and will adequate standards and properly qualified audiologists be encouraged? Nor does the Bill address some of the more fundamental issues, such as the industrial tyranny which requires a minimum of 21 hours work per week, thus depriving many professional women of a job and clients of professional services because female professionals often wish to work less than the 21 hours per week that is required. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the end of the day, I reluctantly support the Bill, not because I have any confidence that the proposal will work or achieve the so-called equity which the Government aspires to or much less because the real issues surrounding our health system have been faced, but because changes are required in the overall context of our health system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-in reply--I thank the honourable members who have contributed to the debate on the Hearing Services Bill. It was quite a nice discussion really, when it got going. I would like to make some comments in response to matters raised, particularly those made by the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods). He initiated his comments--setting the scene, I suppose--with the usual litany of concerns between public and private enterprise, about large bureaucracies, the markets and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is pretty clear that through the National Acoustic Laboratories and the new developments we have a very important process under way that will ensure that Australians get access to not only the best hearing products in the world but also the best services in the world. That is also important. That is as important as the hearing service itself. That is one of the main reasons why the joint venture is now in operation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Ascom has recognised the virtually unique basis of hearing services in Australia through the National Acoustic Laboratories and the hearing services program, where we have the second largest market in the world. That is not because we have a much higher incidence of hearing impairment, but because we have a national system that ensures that people have access to affordable hearing services. That is achieved in a way which allows not only through the provision of the aid but also through that great network of hearing centres right throughout Australia--both the fixed and the mobile ones which are very much a feature of it--the producer of hearing aids to get access to that consumer feedback that leads to improvements in the quality of the products. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting that people have gone back to the Industry Commission report. That whole process was very important. It gave many people in the community an opportunity to say what they thought about the structure of the hearing services program and the provision of those services in Australia. It was very clear that the draft report of the Industry Commission changed quite dramatically to its final form. It was forced to realise that through the National Acoustic Laboratories the hearing services program gives great cost efficiency, great service quality to Australia and great industry capacity. That is something that has withstood the rigours of the Industry Commission. It was a very public and exhaustive process. </PARA>
<PARA>  Comments were also made about out of date technology. Much mention was made of the fact that behind-the-ear hearing aids were old technology and therefore not wanted by people. I put it to the House that about 60 per cent of the market in Europe is behind-the-ear technology. It is not simply and solely the location of the hearing aid but also the quality of the hearing sound that is available to people with different hearing problems. It is becoming more and more clear to people that in Australia we have both behind-the-ear and in-the-ear hearing aids available, particularly through government services, that are equal to the best throughout the world. The best is yet to come, because with the opening up of the new statutory authority and the joint venture we have a great opportunity for Australia not only in terms of export and industry and technology gain but also in terms of access for Australians, young and old, to what is the best in the world in hearing technology. </PARA>
<PARA>  The concern that I have is that the Opposition, despite its support for this Bill, still seems to harbour the misapprehension that if we split up the market everything would be great--we would get all these wonderful products, there would be great competition and all the rest of it. If the market was opened up, as is suggested, we would be losing one of the great advantages that we have; we would have a loss of economy of scale, which would increase the cost to the taxpayer by about $34m per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the problems that we have in Australia is that we are often restricted in our trade and technology by distance, we are restricted by our scale and we are restricted by the fact that often technology seems to leave Australia. Here we have a complete reversal. It is almost the exception that proves the rule. We have a product that does not rely upon very big and efficient distribution systems close to the market. We do not need to have multiple container ships to carry a very big supply of hearing aids. Distance and transport costs are not the problem they would be for a lot of the other products that we sell. </PARA>
<PARA>  The economy of scale is very important. As the second largest single market of hearing aids under the National Acoustic Laboratories, we have an economy of scale that allows production scaling efficiencies. As I mentioned before, one of the main reasons why we are able to attract the top hearing aid manufacturers in the world to Australia is that we have that consumer network, which is a very big plus and something that feeds back into better quality hearing services. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this situation, we also have the opportunity to have state of the art, world technology from the Swiss manufacturers being transferred to Australia and the products then being made in Australia to be exported to other parts of the world, particularly to the United States, Japan, eastern Europe and Asia. Therefore, we have a great opportunity which should not be down played. I think we will very quickly learn to be very proud of what we have achieved in this regard.   Under the arrangement, Australian Hearing Aids will manufacture the hearing aids from the production facility in Fortitude Valley, as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) quite proudly announced. That commences in the second half of next year for release to the National Acoustics Laboratory hearing centres following full trialing of the products by 1 January 1993. Once the factory is in full production by 1994, AHA will be producing some 600,000 units, which will include both hearing aids and remote controls. It is estimated that approximately 70 per cent of those units will be for export at a value of around about $25m annually. I think the honourable member for Lowe suggested that the value would be about $9m. I think he was confusing that with the royalties that would be coming to the Government over the period of the contract. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not only do we have the most sophisticated, world class, programmable hearing aids, but also a purchase price for these units which would certainly be the envy of the world. It is because of the National Acoustic Laboratories, the structure we have had and the structure we will now have that we are able to maintain that price, which is a benefit to the taxpayer and to the consumer and very much a benefit to us when we sell those products on the world market. As I have said on other occasions, it is really a win situation for Australia, the taxpayer, the consumer and certainly our industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will touch on a few points raised by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews). I certainly appreciate many of the things he said. He identified the importance of good hearing and the problems that many people, both young and old, experience when they suffer from hearing loss. Certainly it would be far more difficult to operate in this environment if many honourable members suffered from a hearing impairment, as do so many in our community. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to clarify a couple of points for the honourable member's benefit. There has not been a $20m increase in the NAL costs from $29m to $53m. That is incorrect. What has happened is that the extra $20m that seems to have been added to the cost of NAL in the next 12 months is basically money that was previously allocated within the department. So the full cost of the National Acoustic Laboratories has been transferred to the NAL ledger. In fact, in the last 12 months--this will be the case in the future--the National Acoustic Laboratories has contained its costs, reduced waiting times for clients, and has coped with a 15 per cent increase in clients. </PARA>
<PARA>  In summing up, very few other countries in the world give their citizens the opportunity that has been given to Australians--children, elderly people, veterans and others--over the life of the National Acoustic Laboratories. Not only does it provide the hearing services program, hearing aids and assistance in that regard, but it also performs a very important role in the community by working on the prevention of hearing loss, particularly in industrial environments. It has over 100,000 clients, including children, pensioners, veterans and others, such as members of the armed forces. They, along with the rest of the community, can sleep very soundly tonight knowing that the National Acoustic Laboratories is still there and that at the moment in a factory in Brisbane we are gearing up to produce the state of the art hearing aids that will be available to Australians. About 70 per cent of the products produced in that factory will be exported and will therefore produce a significant and important industry for Australia in that very important area of technology. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In answering a question without notice from the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) today, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe) has given what may be a confusing answer to this House. The reply was that there were no proposals yet for the better cities program announced in the 1991-92 Budget. Yet a news item today carried on AAP claims that the Deputy Prime Minister had allegedly told Caucus that there was no problem in considering three projects nominated by the Brisbane Lord Mayor, Jim Soorley, because they had State support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Is it a coincidence that a Labor lord mayor in a Labor State gets the apparent first bite of the cherry? Where does that leave the residents of New South Wales or the residents of Victorian municipalities not covered by ALP members? Will the regional cities be eligible for funding or is the program merely directed at the State capitals? How will the funding be allocated--on the basis of population, political favouritism or by some Caucus committee determining needs versus wants? The Deputy Prime Minister may care to explain these far from insignificant points. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has trumpeted its better cities program as one of the best things since sliced bread. It tells the Australian electorate that the $56m provided in the 1991-92 Budget and the total of $816m over the life of the initiative will result in a better standard of living for all Australians expressed in such measures as more up to date infrastructure, a reduction in the cost of new housing developments and better social services in urban areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  The program is a figment of the loony Left of this Government and, as such, will solve few of the problems brought about by this Government's inability to tackle the hard issues, such as taxation reform and the introduction of true enterprise bargaining without interference from the centralised union bureaucrats. Better cities could be better described as Whitlam and Uren revisited. Who cannot remember the spectacle of Mr Uren saying with a lump in his throat, `What a marvellous city Monarto South, near Murray Bridge, South Australia, would make'. History has shown that this pipedream has remained just that. Will the better cities venture prove any more achievable?</PARA>
<PARA>  In announcing the program, the Treasurer stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The program is a first step in building a new partnership between Federal, State and local governments so that our cities and the quality of life of the people who live in them can be improved. </PARA>
<PARA>Today we had the spectacle of the Acting Prime Minister suggesting that local authorities might miss out on their share of funds unless their plans had State government support. Perhaps the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) ought to be asked how support can be given to the plans that are not even formulated because the local government instrumentalities have not even been made aware of the funding guidelines, nor of the way in which to apply for funds. </PARA>
<PARA>  Today I was informed by the town clerks of the cities of Geelong, Colac and South Barwon, as well as the rural city of Bellarine, that they had received very little in the way of communication either from the State or Federal governments for the better cities program. </PARA>
<PARA>  One council had seen some briefing notes, but that was all; another did not even know of the program's existence. Coordination between the levels of government takes real effort. It is my understanding that the States will know little of the details until the Premiers Conference on 22 November. Will they be expected to have suggestions on the table at that conference? It certainly seems an odd way to start a partnership without proper discussion in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA>  Areas such as outer suburban and regional areas have certainly been neglected by this Government, and it is stretching the longbow to suggest that throwing $1m at areas such as Geelong, with a regional population in excess of 150,000, will solve any problems. How on earth will urban sprawl be reduced under this program? Does this mean that inner urban areas will receive more funding, thus condemning those in the outer suburbs and regional cities to a lower standard of living? Will the cost of new housing developments be cut by the adoption of smaller blocks of land in outer suburbs, or will the prices in new areas be charged to developers, to be increased to such an extent as to drive young couples into the rental market for longer?</PARA>
<PARA>  Transport is another consideration. The Federal Government, under another program, has just announced the funding of Sprinter rail cars for Victorian interurban services, but nothing is being done to reduce chronic overmanning of the passenger side of the railways as they seek to serve these outer areas. Local governments and their residents have much reason to feel aggrieved about such a shabby, ill-conceived program of pork-barrelling, which this questionable exercise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is. The saddest feature is that the Government cannot even communicate with its colleagues in the other levels of government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to talk garbage. Members may laugh and make snide remarks, but you and I know, having been to the Antarctic, that garbage is an extremely important issue. Recently, in Eden-Monaro and in the Illawarra and the rest of the south-east region, important initiatives were taken in garbage disposal and recycling. I convened a seminar responding to a request from the Queanbeyan YMCA, which had already commenced a recycling centre to deal with aluminium cans and PET plastic containers. Following that response a seminar was called and people came from all around the region, including Wollongong and Canberra, and formed a south-east region recycling group. That group was formed separately from the Illawarra group, which was already fully engaged in recycling and garbage disposal. With the cooperation of industry the group has been able to set up an important recycling centre in the Canberra-Queanbeyan region; in fact, in Queanbeyan. At that recycling centre, Comalco has supplied a recycling plant. The plastics industry has also supplied plant which has enabled the group to take material, aluminium cans and PET containers, from all round the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This has not only been of great benefit to local government in the region, which has fully participated in the group, but it has also been of great benefit in educating young people about recycling, because these people have drawn on schools and youth groups right through the region. These groups have got together and supplied the recycling centre. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not only that; private industry and people who are already collecting in local areas are also connecting with the Queanbeyan centre because it means that they no longer have to send the products long distances to Sydney or Melbourne. So the work that the group is doing is particularly important. It all really happened because not only the YMCA in Queanbeyan but organisations such as the Monaro compost group and local councils throughout the region were expressing to me their great problems. In the case of local government, it had problems in supplying land fill areas for its garbage disposal. So what is happening is extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting that today I received a copy --and I guess other honourable members did as well--of The Magazine of the Commission for the Future--21C. It talks about `Previews of a changing world'. It is interesting that in the first article in this magazine the publishers expose five garbage myths. First of all they point out:</PARA>
<PARA>  Most people believe landfills are 20-30 per cent fast-food packaging, 30-40 per cent polystyrene foam, and 25-45 per cent disposable nappies. In fact, in an average American landfill--</PARA>
<PARA>and probably in an Australian land fill--</PARA>
<PARA>fast-food packaging makes up only a quarter of one per cent, some of which is polystyrene, which itself makes up about 0.9 per cent, and disposable nappies only 0.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Most people see plastic as the landfill villain. </PARA>
<PARA>But the real villain is paper, because paper, including newspapers, telephone books and computer print-outs, makes up between 40 and 50 per cent of land fill refuse, while plastic accounts for 10 to 13 per cent. We are also learning that plastic is often better for recycling than are paper products, such as paper cups, or glass, when one takes into account the amount of energy and material used. </PARA>
<PARA>  The publishers have made some important points and I believe that the call by the south-east region recycling group for a national recycling education centre in Canberra, to bring together all that we are learning and all that we are initiating in this region, will make the point clear to children. Each day hundreds of children visit this Parliament. Would it not be great to have a national recycling education centre here in Canberra to show these children and others just how recycling can happen and is happening? So I applaud the south-east region recycling group and the Wollongong City Council for the work that they are doing in Wollongong and the important initiatives they are taking for Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There is great stress today upon the farming community throughout Australia, particularly those who are working and have their properties within the drought-stricken areas of the Commonwealth. I speak about New South Wales, and particularly Queensland, where we hear some very sad stories indeed concerning debt. Farmers have not got the money that they need today to live in the way that they would normally like to.  The stress is of great concern to me, because I have talked to many rural people about their families and their concern not only financially but also about keeping their stock alive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I want to mention something that concerns me greatly indeed. In New South Wales the RSPCA has the right to prosecute, and it has been brought to my notice that there are instances in which the RSPCA has taken or is taking legal action against certain owners because of neglect of their stock. I mention one particular case of a grazier within my electorate who is a very well-known person and a person who, so far as the community and I are concerned, certainly cares for his stock. He is a good farmer generally and is noted for this. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other day he was asked by the local police to come into town in the early morning to meet a representative of the RSPCA. He arrived in town and, accompanied by the police officers and the representative of the RSPCA and the veterinary inspector, he took them to a property that he owned further up the river. When they arrived at the property they inspected the stock, and the outcome of the inspection was that photographs were taken and three of the stock were destroyed. They were destroyed because the RSPCA inspector believed that they were neglected. I understand that they were cows and that their calves had been removed from them some days earlier. These stock were actually shot and destroyed. I am told that one of the animals was shot three times by the RSPCA inspector before it actually died. </PARA>
<PARA>  It concerns me that our farmers should be subjected to this at a time when at least 80 per cent of that district is under severe stress from drought conditions. I believe the grazier concerned has already purchased over $20,000 worth of hay; he has also bought other commodities to feed his stock. He has done his best to maintain the strength and general condition of the cattle he owns. I am also advised that the RSPCA inspector referred to the conditions in which the dogs were housed. We know that graziers have to have dogs. I believe that this grazier had three or four dogs, and he was told that a special kennel should be built for them and that they should be properly cared for. </PARA>
<PARA>  Later on the same RSPCA inspector returned with a representative of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture and inspected the rest of the cattle. I do not know the result of the inspection, but that grazier is up on four charges of neglect of stock. He is apparently only one of a number up and down the coast, and maybe elsewhere in the State, who are affected in this way. It concerns me that in a time of stress we have a situation where not only do the farmers concerned have to live up to their financial responsibilities but they also have to work long hours to care for their stock.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish to explain to the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) and his colleagues all about the better cities program. I can do it very simply in five minutes. The better cities program is a means of bringing together a number of Commonwealth initiatives to address the problems not just of cities but of urban environments and of Australian low density cities. It is part of a series of five different Commonwealth initiatives. The better cities program is a means of bringing together the five initiatives in particular instances for demonstration purposes. Later I will give an example of one possible demonstration project in Brisbane that may well be funded under the better cities program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The first of the five initiatives is a national housing strategy. For example, we are looking at the interrelationship between taxation and housing and the efficient supply of land and housing. The second initiative is the housing industry development strategy whereby we look at things such as better skills in the housing industry and new technology, for instance, in medium density housing. The third initiative is the reform of strategic planning; for example, so that we can more accurately identify the demand for and supply of land and housing. The fourth initiative is the reform of the regulatory environment so that, for instance, the regulations which planners use when they impose rules on developers can be simplified. The fifth initiative is the reform of infrastructure charges and taxation, which the Special Premiers Conference is addressing, so that we can look at how State instrumentalities charge for water, electricity and roads, for instance. </PARA>
<PARA>  The better cities program, which is a fairly modest program of Commonwealth intervention, will bring together in a number of different places each of those five initiatives. The example I have in mind is one based in the inner north-eastern suburbs of Brisbane. It is based on an urban renewal report by the Lord Mayor, Alderman Soorley. The Commonwealth will look at this as an example only if Alderman Soorley can show that all of the five Commonwealth initiatives can be demonstrated as part of this project. He will need to demonstrate that there are the sorts of outcomes that are required. </PARA>
<PARA>  He must demonstrate that he can reduce the capital and recurrent costs of urban development or redevelopment; that he can make better use of land and infrastructure; that he can increase the housing choice and affordability for people living in that area; that he can improve the links between public transport, employment and services in the area; and that he can reduce traffic congestion and pollution costs and improve access to employment, health, education and community services. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a tall order that the Commonwealth asks of any State or local government if it wishes to be part of the better cities program. Alderman Soorley may well have come up with an interesting proposal. He wishes, for instance, in the inner north-eastern suburbs of Brisbane--actually, in the City of Brisbane itself--to lift the number of people living in that district from 12,000 to 30,000. The entire program of investment is of the order of $4 billion over one or two decades. Alderman Soorley is suggesting that with Commonwealth and State government assistance and investment of the order of only $125m, we can bring in many billions of dollars of investment that satisfy the aims of the Commonwealth under the better cities program and under its five major initiatives to make Australian urban environments better places in which to live. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I know we are not supposed to produce examples, but I have with me today a sample of a quilt to which I have referred in the Parliament before. It is a CSIRO invention, manufactured by Tontine and marketed in various stores. It is a mixture of wool and polyester in which the wool remains fluffy. Of course, it is using substantial quantities of Australian wool. I hope it will be seen throughout the world as the replacement for the well-known feather doona. I read in one article that the Japanese market alone uses eight to 10 million doonas a year, so we can see that this product has a lot of customers. I slept under one this winter and would recommend it to anyone. There is also a pillow that, as a proprietor of hotels and motels, I find is an excellent product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I read the CSIRO press release on this matter and I was concerned to get out and discover where I could buy one. I had almost to become Sherlock Holmes to do so. As this House is probably aware, I am something of a critic of the International Wool Secretariat. I was pleased to see that in quite spectacular style the other day the Australian Weekend Magazine chose to look at the efforts of the International Wool Secretariat and it noted some interesting figures. Firstly, for the past three years the International Wool Secretariat has spent an average of $261m per year compared with the budgets of, for instance, Mazda on a worldwide scale of $351m, Mobil $280m, and Levi Strauss $220m. Yet as the article goes on to say, there was a steady decline in wool consumption in every year in which that money was spent. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wondered what the IWS had been up to in marketing this product. Generally I found nothing in Australia, and I have not been able to find much evidence overseas. Yet we have four million bales of wool in a stockpile. This product uses some of the coarser wools, so it would be very handy. Of course, it has other attributes. A person sleeping comfortably in bed still loses between a third and half a litre of moisture through the skin each night. Wool, being the product we know it is, can transfer that away. That is something the straight polyesters and so on will not do. </PARA>
<PARA>  I therefore took on a marketing project myself. I wrote to firms such as Target, David Jones, Coles-Fosseys and Big W and asked, `Are you selling this product?'. I got some interesting responses. Target wrote back and said that yes, it does sell it in shops in Western Australia. I think Scarborough Beach Road, Innaloo, shopping centre would be pretty close to the electorate of the Acting Speaker. He might duck in there; they might even have some on special at the moment because it is approaching summer. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It would certainly be better than the feather ones. One thing about the feather ones, summer or winter, is that all the feathers end up at the bottom of the bed. They do not give much help.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  But David Jones is stocking them, and I thank David Jones for that. Coles-Fossey, a firm that operates to a price, gets the biggest tick from me, because, after I wrote, it wrote back to me and said, `No, we do not have them because we sell only things up to $100, but we will investigate whether a product can be made to meet our market'. At the same time, Big W got the big cross, because it gave the answer that it was all too hard. I would like to congratulate Mr Ron Bulley, Managing Director of Coles-Fossey, for having written back to me on 16 September to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We have finalised plans with Vita Pacific to provide a Wool/Polyester blend doona for trial in a number of our better stores next winter. I would expect that stock will be in stores around the March/April period . . . The product will sell for similar prices to the feather and down products in our range ($39.95 for a single bed). </PARA>
<PARA>Now that is good marketing; they are positive people; and I hope that Big W gets the message that it is worth while to sell Australian products and give our woolgrowers a go. It is no handout; it is a good product. I can recommend it to anyone. In fact, I think it is something that all Australians should be buying and Australian stores should be marketing. I thank those stores that responded to me in the way that they did, and I congratulate those that did for putting the item in stock, particularly Coles-Fossey, because it showed initiative. When the proposition was put to Coles-Fossey, it found a product to market in its price range, which means that a lot more Australians in lower income groups can benefit from this product next year. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-With a group of backbenchers from the coalition here and a couple from our side, it is interesting to observe that backbenchers at times get a rough time from their frontbenchers. I suppose that was certainly true for us in the Labor Party last week. I wrote a little ode which I hope that honourable members on the opposite side will take in good heart.

<PARA>Having read some of the press articles, especially in Adelaide, I am certain that some of the backbenchers in the coalition are having very serious doubts about a GST. </PARA>
<PARA>  On a more positive note, a constituent of my electorate of Port Adelaide rang my office last week delighted at the news regarding a revolutionary laser technique which corrects short-sightedness by shaving the surface of the cornea. The technique was developed in the United States, and many of Australia's short-sighted people have been eagerly awaiting its introduction into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has been said by one of the surgeons involved in the introduction of the Excimer laser unit that the procedure would be most effective with people with mild to moderate myopia, for which the success rate is 95 per cent. The Excimer uses laser pulses in concurrent circles to shave the surface of the cornea to correct myopia. The laser penetrates only the outer surface of the cornea and there is no pain whatsoever to the patient. </PARA>
<PARA>  Dr Chris Rogers, an eye surgeon at Sydney's North Shore Hospital, said the laser was safer and more precise than the existing operation to treat myopia, radial keratotomy, whereby the cornea is sliced to reshape it. The technique is currently being used in the United States, Italy, Germany, Korea, Britain, Ireland, Spain and Sweden, and already some 15,000 people have undergone the process. It is probably good news for all those Australians who cannot read the signs at the end of the passage. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to take this opportunity to talk also about the home tutor scheme. For those who do not know what home tutoring is, I will firstly say a few things on this subject. Home tutoring is the teaching of English in the home of residents--who are often, but not always, newly arrived people from overseas countries--by voluntary tutors who often have had no previous teaching experience. In fact, my own wife and my own research assistant are both involved in the home tutor program in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>  These people give of their own time, firstly to attend classes on how to teach, and then to visit the students in their own homes on a regular basis. Depending upon the student's knowledge of English, or lack thereof, the tutor works out a program which he or she considers appropriate for his or her student. Throughout Australia there are thousands of tutors and even more students teaching and learning the English language through this scheme. The scheme, the adult migrant English program, is fully funded by the Commonwealth Government, mainly through the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, with a small amount of expenditure through the Department of Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my own State of South Australia the program is called the adult migrant education service. There are currently 705 tutors in the scheme and the number of students totals 798. That is the number currently being tutored; there is a waiting list of 106 prospective students. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I previously stated, the tutoring is entirely voluntary and no payment whatsoever is made to the tutors. I think that I should take this opportunity to acknowledge the excellent work they are doing in the nationwide Australian community to assist adults from non-English speaking backgrounds to assimilate as quickly and as efficiently as possible into the Australian society.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Patrick O'Brien, Australia's 1991 Fulbright scholar and a senior visiting fellow at the University of California, asks in the September 1991 issue of Time Australia magazine: `What is wrong with the conduct of politics in Australia?'. He cites the endemic leadership struggles of the last 20 years, the seemingly endless royal commissions and inquiries around Australia, and the way governments and their agencies managed to lose billions of dollars of taxpayers' money in the 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The electorate has been asking the same questions and, as a result, an inexorable change is occurring in our system of government. That change is challenging not only the two-party adversary system of politics but also what we call the `Westminster system'. This winner take all model of parliamentary democracy, inherited from Britain, is failing. The concept of a government and opposition arraigned against one another in parliament in two monolithic blocs does not reflect the complexity of society or serve the people's needs. The brutal wielding of the government's majority power in the parliament has destroyed any faith in the myth of parliamentary supremacy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The executive is supreme and without any real check on its power by parliament. It has proven in too many cases around Australia to be supremely arrogant and corrupt. For a decade, at successive elections at all levels of government and in all States of Australia, the public has been moving to remedy this enormous defect in our system of parliamentary democracy by electing Independents to Parliament. Independents are seen as representatives of their electorates who are not compromised by party executives or preselectors. They are responsible only to the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since 1981, when the Australian Senate slipped out of the control of the Executive Government, one by one the various houses of parliament around Australia have done likewise. It is almost incredible that today, out of 15 houses of parliament, we have only four in which the executive still dominates. That situation was unthinkable even three or four years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>  Supporters of the status quo are, of course, appalled at this trend. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was reported in the Sunday Telegraph as having said, in effect, `Yes, the system is flawed but there is no alternative'. Laurie Oakes, in the Bulletin of 5 October, under the heading `The Independent Disease', argued without substance that `Independents are useless'. </PARA>
<PARA>  More perceptive commentators such as Patrick O'Brien take the view that `what is being revealed is that the Westminster system itself is seriously flawed'. The fundamental flaw is the immense power concentration in Premiers, Prime Ministers and executive governments unchecked by parliaments. The unbridled power of the Executive in Queensland, according to O'Brien, confirming the conclusion reached by Commissioner Fitzgerald, `managed to turn parliament into a compliant, powerless--and largely irrelevant--institution that could not even begin to check the power of a government that elevated patronage and secret deals with supporters to an art form'. This power, made possible by the rigid party system and the Constitution, has led to endless destructive leadership fights and the institutionalising of the triumph of the private interest over the public interest. It has led to stacking of the judiciary, government departments, agencies and financial bodies with family, failed candidates, and party acolytes. </PARA>
