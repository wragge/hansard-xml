<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Pearce moving forthwith:</PARA>
<PARA>  `That this House calls on the Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to comply with the resolution of the Senate of 10 September 1991 and to table forthwith in this House, and to have tabled in the Senate, the tape recording of discussions between her and conservation organisations on 4 September 1991'. </PARA>
<PARA>I move this motion because the Parliament is now in the situation where the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has clearly demonstrated her contempt for the parliamentary processes. She has done that both in Question Time and in her response to the motion which was moved and carried in the Senate yesterday, in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>  That there be laid on the table, on or before 11 September 1991, the tape recording of the discussions held on or about 4 September 1991 between the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, the Honourable R.J. Kelly, MP, and representatives of conservationist groups. </PARA>
<PARA>The reported response of the Minister to that is that this is a political stunt and she will ignore it. That is a response which is contemptuous of the obligations of the Parliament and completely ignores the responsibility of the Minister to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  This motion is permitted under the Standing Orders of the House of Representatives, which provide, under standing order 316:</PARA>
<PARA>Papers may be ordered to be laid before the House, and the Clerk shall communicate to the Minister concerned all orders for papers made by the House; and such papers when received shall be laid on the Table by the Clerk. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion for the suspension of Standing Orders to enable the moving of the substantive motion follows a series of questions put to the relevant Minister which she has, in the main, refused to answer. She has, however, been prepared to indicate that the reason she is not releasing the tape is `simply because I believe the meeting was a private one'. That is one of a number of answers given by the Minister in similar terms over the last two days. </PARA>
<PARA>  The sole ground which is claimed by this Minister for not releasing this tape is not some ground of Executive privilege or some esoteric legal or constitutional defence; it is the simple ground that, in her view, the meeting was a private one and therefore the record of the discussions was private. The patent absurdity of that situation is quite evident from the situation where numerous participants in those discussions have been happy to come forward to give their version of what happened, and of course the Minister herself has come into the chamber, and has also appeared on television and in the print media, and been prepared to give a quite different version. The problem for this House is that the version being given by the Minister is quite different from the version given by all other participants in the discussion. Those participants have reaffirmed their view over recent days since the controversy has erupted. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are in a situation, therefore, where there is only one ground for refusal of disclosure, and that is the ground of privacy. That ground is clearly absurd.  Only last night we had a new participant in the discussion. A Ms Sue Jackson, from the Northern Territory Environment Centre, was interviewed on the ABC radio program PM. She was the latest person to make it clear that she had absolutely no objection to the removal of the restrictions on the tape. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't see why there's any reason why it should be restricted. </PARA>
<PARA>So there is only one person who is denying the access to this tape, and that is Minister Kelly. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is the possible reason for the Minister's objection? Of course, there is only one logical and coherent reason that can be given and that is that the Minister has misled both this House and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). We all know that the Minister was woken from her slumber on Saturday morning by a rather cross Prime Minister. We know that the Minister gave him an explanation which is consistent with the explanation she has given this House--it just happens to be inconsistent with the version which is given by every other participant in this transaction. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have a situation where the weight of evidence is clearly against the Minister and the only possible reason for not producing this tape is that it will disclose the truth. I quoted yesterday from public comments made by people far from the political process. The Courier-Mail said that this could all be solved so simply. Really, this is one of those rare political issues where the simplicity is evident to all. We have conflicts of evidence coming from the Minister as against multiple witnesses and a very simple method of solving this, yet the Minister refuses on the grounds of privacy which clearly no longer exist. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, a more serious question arises with respect to the role of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has so far supported his Minister. That is, of course, consistent with the craven lack of leadership which the Prime Minister has been showing now for many months. What we have is a Minister who is frightened to reveal the tape because it might show the truth, and a Prime Minister who is frightened to have the tape revealed because it might disclose the weakness of his own position. If, as the evidence clearly indicates, the Minister has not given us the truth, and if the situation is that she has been critical of the Prime Minister and one of his core policies, the truth is that the Prime Minister will be shown up again to be a weak leader--a man without the capacity to exert any discipline. </PARA>
<PARA>  Look at the political context in which this is occurring. The sad fact is that the edited tape--which, eventually, after the Prime Minister's second thoughts, was made available to a member of the Prime Minister's staff--was probably edited by a staffer who had worked for the Prime Minister's challenger, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). Who do we have as the so-called press secretary for the Minister for the Environment at the moment but the previous press secretary for the honourable member for Blaxland, the previous Treasurer. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Mr CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am reminded by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that he still works for her and it is a matter of public record that he is handling the media inquiries for the honourable member for Blaxland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We have a situation where there is absolutely no reason of principle--no constitutional legal reason--why this matter should not be disclosed; we have a situation where important questions of Government policy have been challenged by one of the Ministers in the Government which is supposed to be actively upholding those policies; and we have a situation where she is refusing to divulge to this House the truth. </PARA>
<PARA>  The evidence is available. The evidence could bring this matter of controversy to an end in a matter of minutes. It would require merely the playing of this tape recording. The Opposition says, therefore, that this motion that the Standing Orders should be suspended should be passed, and that the motion I have given notice of in which we call on the Minister to comply with the resolution of the Senate of 10 September and to table this tape recording, should be mirrored in this House and acted on forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are, of course, numerous precedents for the tabling of documents under a motion passed in the other chamber. For many years the procedure has not been followed in this House. No doubt that relates to the fact that the Government has the numbers in this House, it tables what documents it wishes to without any resolutions and there are probably few opportunities for an opposition to get a motion of this sort carried. </PARA>
<PARA>  I make the point that in the whole history of the use of this procedure by the other place there are only two occasions on which the Government has not complied with the order. In the examination that we have made there are at least 19 occasions on which the order of the Senate has been followed by compliance on the part of the Government. On each of the two occasions when compliance has not been agreed to by the Government, there have been weighty questions of law and constitutional principles which have been debated in that chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the case of the 1975 summonsing of public servants before the House there was a claim of Executive privilege which, of course, went to issues which were subsequently subsumed in an election in which the Government which refused to answer the questions was consumed in the holocaust. </PARA>
<PARA>  When I was a member of the Fraser Government in 1982 and indicated that on the advice of the Solicitor-General and the Commissioner of Taxation a limited class of documents should not be disclosed because that would prejudice the prosecution of certain alleged offenders, there were important issues of principle involved. None of those issues arise here. This matter should be addressed by this House. We should not leave it to the Senate to be the only sensible legislative check on the Executive. The House of Representatives should assert its authority and on this occasion should show some commitment to principle, not to mere party politics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I second the motion and strongly support the excellent comments made by the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) today. I want to build on his point in relation to the precedents which exist for this motion in this House. No fewer than 12 precedents for this type of motion have been successfully carried over a period of years: 1921; 1931, on three occasions; 1943; 1965; 1967; 1968; 1975; 1982; 1984, on two occasions; 1987; 1988, on four occasions; and 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In other words, this is a perfectly reasonable matter to be before the Parliament. It is a perfectly reasonable motion, for which we demand of the Government of this day that it produce a perfectly reasonable result: the truth--nothing more, nothing less--of the matter of whether the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has misled the Parliament, whether the Minister has misled the people, and whether the Minister has misled the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in relation to this critically important matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a superior principle involved in this matter. As the honourable member for Pearce has demonstratively proved, the meeting is no longer a private meeting by any definition. In any event, the superior principle goes to the core of leadership of this Government and goes to the core of ministerial integrity and probity. It is clear that the only way this matter can be properly settled once and for all is for the tape and the partial transcript to be produced in the Senate and the House of Representatives so that we can all see it. I warn the Government and I warn the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that they will bleed and they will continue to bleed until such time as they produce this tape. The sooner they produce this tape, the better, so that we can focus on many related issues. </PARA>
<PARA>  In terms of the issue of focus, this matter is related to the economy, to the million people unemployed and to the monumental drift of direction in this Government, because this issue is the epitome of what is wrong with this Government as it is paralysed and so deeply divided in terms of the Hawke versus Keating battle, in terms of where the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories stands in relation to that battle, and as to why the Prime Minister will not take the one step necessary to bring this to fruition and produce the tape and the transcript. Worse still, this Minister is an incompetent Minister for the Environment. It would be in the interests of the nation if the Prime Minister took that step. He would look good; he would have a fraction of the chance to get back on the rails if he took the one action that everyone is trying to convince him to take by virtue of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister has been incompetent, as the honourable member for Pearce has pointed out, over many months in relation to Wesley Vale, Ravenshoe and Coronation Hill. It is not only my own colleagues who have pointed that out, but also Peter Cleeland, a former member of this place who, I affirmed yesterday, has launched a strong attack on this Minister in respect of her action over Coronation Hill. That has been backed up by the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths). The Minister for Resources actually had a majority of Cabinet to proceed with the mining of Coronation Hill. Yet so divided, paralysed and negative is its attitude and modus operandi that, sadly, we have reached this stand-off which requires, quite responsibly, the Parliament to address this motion in the House of Representatives this morning following the excellent resolution and decision of the Senate yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>  We want action on this matter. We want the matter tidied up quickly. It can be done in the course of just two minutes by producing that tape and producing the transcript which we know exists; it has been proven by the Prime Minister to exist. We want the Prime Minister to show the sort of leadership so badly needed at this time of critical economic circumstance for Australia and to take the action to order the Minister for the Environment to come into this chamber and produce that tape and transcript as quickly as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-To some extent it has to be conceded that there is a degree of expertise on the part of the honourable member who moved this motion on the subject of avoiding decisions of the Senate that material ought to be tabled. As I look through the record of what has actually been refused in the Senate from time to time by the government of the day when things have been tabled, the frequency with which the now honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), the then Minister for Social Security, appears is manifest. Those occasions relate to issues of tax evasion, bottom of the harbour schemes and papers that were relevant to his handling of the situation in the Department at the time. They were weighty matters, but the government of the day refused to table them in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  How can one contrast a situation here, in which one has a minor meeting taking place with members of the constituency, if you like, of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), to what was the major scandal of the later years of the Fraser administration, when the Government militantly refused to accept repeated motions by the Senate on related matters? Motions were carried by the Senate that the Government subsequently refused to deal with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-When we get to a subject like this the Opposition is enormously unctuous. Let us go through one of those particular propositions after refusal. In December 1982 the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(a)  notes the refusal by the Government, communicated in the Acting Prime Minister's letter of 15 December, to comply with the Senate's direction to produce, subject to independent editing, certain papers relating to the Government's administration of tax evasion and avoidance laws;</PARA>
<PARA>(b)  notes that this refusal is not based on any claim of Executive privilege, which claim would clearly under established law and practice be a matter for the Senate itself to determine, but upon a new and unprecedented claim--possibly capable of judicial determination--that the Senate has no constitutional power to require the production of documents relating to the exercise by the Executive of its law enforcement functions;</PARA>
<PARA>(c)  is of the opinion that there is no foundation whatever in constitutional law or convention for any such claim, and that--subject only to reasonable claims of Executive privilege--both Houses of Parliament are fully entitled to scrutinise and demand accountability for all aspects of Executive behaviour;</PARA>
<PARA>(d)  is further of the opinion that this latest obstructive stance by the Government, when seen in the light of the persistent obstruction and evasion which has occurred since the Senate first insisted on the production of the documents in question on 23 September, is now ample demonstration of the fact that the Government has something to hide which the documents in question would clearly reveal, namely that the Fraser Government was culpably negligent in failing to proceed effectively against those involved in bottom-of-the- harbour and related tax avoidance and evasion schemes from 1976 on;--</PARA>
<PARA>and on it goes. Who was the responsible Minister of the Government in the Senate at the time? The honourable member for Pearce. </PARA>
<PARA>  Is a meeting during which the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories is alleged to have said that she had a few grievances with the process of Commonwealth-State relations and environmental issues to be compared by the Opposition, with its unctuous moralising, with what was the major scandal during the latter years of the Fraser administration on the issue of tax avoidance, which members of the Opposition when in government ran away from in the Senate?  This shows a double standard by those on the other side, which is truly breathtaking. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us get this whole darned episode into perspective. It is, of course, an episode in the politics and life of this nation which is of infinitesimal significance in comparison with the significance of the issue that those opposite ran away from in the Senate in those years. There is a Freedom of Information Act; if people want to pursue a freedom of information claim through the normal processes, let them get out there and do it. I understand that there has been a request. I was not aware that there had been a request from the honourable member for Pearce, but there has been a request from the media for a freedom of information release of the materials. </PARA>

We introduced the broadening of that Act, and that is the reason why honourable members opposite have any opportunity at all, as opposed to the total absence of opportunity that was presented on those major tax evasion issues that were directly connected with the administration of the coalition Government. It was not some little meeting that took place with a few people who were interested in government policy on the environment; the issue on which the coalition Government refused the Senate on that particular occasion went to the heart of the administration of the tax law. Those opposite are bumbling hypocrites when it comes to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

He put that in the context of the bottom of the harbour scheme--which was correct--and he reflected on me. That was augmented by an interjection from the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) in rather more unpleasant terms.

The advice was that the tabling of those particular documents could prejudice prosecutions of alleged tax evaders and law-breakers. On that basis, and that basis only, a limited number of documents were withheld. That matter was substantially debated in the Senate on a number of occasions--14 October and 25 November were two of them. I direct to the attention of honourable members the existence of those debates, which set out very clearly the principal basis on which there was a withholding of information. There was no question of simply trying to cover up; there was simply a question of maintaining the integrity of the prosecution process.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The coalition supports the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991. This underpins the Aboriginal education policy, about which I will speak briefly. This is a machinery Bill that has no contentious provisions. It transfers the higher education funding component into the Higher Education Funding Act, which means that higher education institutions will provide supplementary assistance to Aboriginal students out of the global budget. This would seem to make sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Prior to the introduction of an Aboriginal education policy, there was good evidence that 10 per cent to 15 per cent of Aboriginal students in the compulsory schooling years were not participating in primary and basic secondary schooling, despite the national expectation that all school age children would receive such schooling. Also, participation rates for Aboriginal people in post-compulsory schooling are only about one-third of the number for all other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  These concerns led to the development of an Aboriginal education policy which came out of the Hughes report of 1988. This report found that, despite improvements over the past two decades, Aboriginal people remain the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. The need to develop a comprehensive and coordinated national education policy for Aboriginal people was a priority. Based on these findings, the Aboriginal education policy was developed. This involved agreement between the Commonwealth and all State and Territory governments, and it had the full support of all political parties. </PARA>
<PARA>  The key consideration in establishing the Aboriginal education policy was to define the respective roles of the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments. The Commonwealth has adopted a strategic planning and monitoring role, and the operation and implementation role is largely the function of the States. I suggest that this is a model that could certainly be looked at in other areas of Aboriginal programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are two main programs under the Aboriginal education policy: firstly, the Aboriginal education strategic initiative program; and, secondly, Abstudy direct assistance. The Aboriginal education strategic initiative program funds operational plans, the Aboriginal student support and parents awareness program, and Aboriginal language initiatives. It includes supplementary funding for Aboriginal education strategies of higher education institutions, which has now been transferred. Abstudy direct assistance incorporates non-income support elements of Abstudy. It has two programs consisting of the Aboriginal tutorial assistance scheme and the vocational educational guidance for Aboriginals scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said, this policy is quite new. There would appear to be some very obvious strengths in it. There is agreement among all levels of government, with the Commonwealth playing a strategic, planning and monitoring role and the States working on implementation. It is a strength that such a policy works on the basis of agreed goals. It has a high degree of Aboriginal input into decision making, and it works on a triennial basis, which gives it a high degree of predictability and planning. </PARA>
<PARA>  The year 1990 was the first year of the triennium of operation. A review will take place in the first year of the Aboriginal tutorial assistance scheme. This year, 1991, is the first year of the vocational educational guidance for Aboriginals scheme. We are at a stage where it is not possible to fully assess the effectiveness of this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  I perceive some areas of weakness that I would foreshadow. Firstly, the information coming back to the Federal Government, which is largely dependent upon the States for that information, indicates that the scheme appears to have been slow. Certainly, the Commonwealth's early monitoring of this scheme is not adequate. However, that may be overcome as the scheme gets over its early problems. Secondly, the Aboriginal tutorial assistance scheme, while a very good scheme in concept, works on the basis of establishing a large number of Aboriginal homework centres. This in itself is not a bad thing, given the home conditions under which many Aboriginal students try to work. It is very important that Aborigines have a place to do their homework. </PARA>
<PARA>  I query the need to establish separate centres rather than looking at the further extension of already existing schools. I suspect this might have more to do with the policy of the teacher unions than with efficient delivery of services to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>  While this program does not relate directly to Abstudy, Abstudy is fundamental to Aboriginal education, and I have very great concerns that there is a very lax definition of Aboriginality for Abstudy payments. This has been raised by the Auditor-General. It is very easy to get an exact idea of the number of Aboriginal people in Australia because the definition of Aboriginality refers to `a person who identifies with an Aboriginal com- munity'. Those people who were sufficiently identified to put themselves down on the 1986 census can then be determined and predicted today with known mortality rates. If we look at this and then look at the take-up of Abstudy, we find that 72 per cent of all Aboriginal people between 12 and 18 years of age are getting some form of Abstudy, and that of those between 12 and 44 years of age more than one-third of every predicted Aboriginal person in Australia is receiving Abstudy. Clearly, not more than a third of all Aboriginal people between 12 and 44 years of age are getting some sort of higher education. </PARA>
<PARA>  Aboriginal education is not an easy area. This was brought home to me very early on after taking this job when I visited a small school at a place called Ipolera in the Northern Territory. Ipolera is an out-station west of Alice Springs, and the two senior Aboriginal people there are Herman and Mavis Malbunka. They have a small school on that out-station which I visited. There were 15 students there, not one of whom spoke any sort of acceptable English; their language is Aranda. The newly arrived teacher had come from Newport Primary School in Melbourne. She did not speak any Aranda, the kids did not speak any English and so there was a rather wonderful chaos in the entire school. </PARA>
<PARA>  This happens very much in remote Australia and is the reason language initiatives are so important. We assume that English is spoken widely around the country, but probably 10 per cent of Aboriginal people in Australia would not use English in the home. For many people English is not a second language, it is totally a foreign language. This is why it is so difficult for students coming into schools; they may have no working knowledge of English and a program entirely in English is irrelevant to their needs. The Northern Territory has been particularly innovative in this area and by far leads all the other States in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Good educational opportunities are fundamental to Aboriginal people having the opportunity to be full participants in Australian society. This was put very well by Charles Perkins in Alice Springs two weeks ago, when talking about education. Charles Perkins was the first Aboriginal Australian to graduate from university. That it was 1965 before any Aboriginal Australian did so is a shame that I believe we all wear. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>This has not received the focus it justifiably demands. It has been our greatest "blind spot" over the years in not realising the vital element of good education. We have usually left this to others or we have let our academic Aborigines tinker at the fringes with the Federal Government. . . The reality is we are in the majority, unskilled and uneducated, and as such, at the mercy of governments, bureaucrats, pathetic politics and the rise and fall of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>We have in the Aboriginal education policy a goal driven cooperative policy that works on the basis of determining the respective roles of Commonwealth and State governments, with clear and agreed goals. It is for these reasons that the coalition continues to support this policy and supports this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It gives me pleasure to speak in this debate on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Bill for a number of reasons, not the least of which is being able to follow the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) and pick up on a couple of remarks which he has made. I will do that in the course of my contribution. I will certainly pick up on those remarks which relate to the cooperative nature of the relationship which we are supposed to have between the Commonwealth, the Northern Territory and the State governments. In my view, it has not been as successful as it ought, primarily because of the tardiness of the State and Territory governments, and I will allude particularly to the Northern Territory Government, whose efforts, in my view, have been less than satisfactory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The amendments to this legislation are minor and relate to clarification of the indexation clause of the Act; amending the amounts appropriated in the 1991 and 1992 calendar years to reflect the transfer of the higher education component of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, AESIP, to the Higher Education Funding Act; adjusting the amount appropriated under the special appropriation for the 1992 calendar year to reflect the transfer of the Aboriginal student support and parent awareness scheme, ASSPA, from the principal Act to Appropriation Bill (No. 1); and adjusting the amount appropriated under the special appropriation for the 1992 calendar year to reflect the transfer of funds formally allocated to the national Aborigines language program, NALP, from the principal Act to the Appropriation Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  In his second reading speech on the Bill, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) noted the changes were minor and of an administrative nature. However, he also noted that the passage of the amendments also afforded an opportunity for the Parliament to give a commitment of support to the principles and practices of the Aboriginal education policy as a means of addressing the educational needs of Aboriginal Australians. It is the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act which provides a legislative basis for the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, commonly referred to as AEP. </PARA>
<PARA>  The AEP is a national policy. It is a policy which has received the agreement and endorsement of the Commonwealth and all State and Territory governments. It is an attempt to coordinate the efforts of all levels of government and non-government bodies to deliver educational services and to meet the educational needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people throughout Australia. It is this matter of coordination and cooperation between the Commonwealth and other levels of government and, in particular, the Northern Territory Government, to which I now turn. </PARA>
<PARA>  Coordination is a matter of identifying common goals agreed upon through a process of discussion, formal consultation and negotiation between governments, and then implementing programs to achieve these goals. But when it comes to the Northern Territory Government I am afraid that coordination and cooperation are sadly lacking, for it appears that the attitude of the Northern Territory Government to the Aboriginal education policy is to present a facade of living up to the letter of its agreement with the Commonwealth while disregarding the spirit of that agreement, ensuring that it does not put one ounce of effort into addressing the educational needs of Aboriginal people over and above that specifically required under the agreement--and even that is questionable. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the calendar year 1991, the Northern Territory Government is receiving some $10.6m from the Commonwealth under the Aboriginal education policy. That is money given to the Northern Territory Government in addition to normal allocations. It is money specifically aimed at achieving the agreed goals of the Aboriginal education policy through implementing a strategic plan formulated through discussion, consultation and negotiation with the Northern Territory Government. It is part of the agreement with the Northern Territory Government that none of the Territory's own expenditure in the area of Aboriginal education will be diminished as a result of the Aboriginal education policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since the beginning of the first triennium of the Aboriginal education policy, and since the agreement of a strategic plan between the Commonwealth and the Territory to tackle issues confronting Aboriginal people in the area of education, there have been two significant developments. The first is the implementation of the Northern Territory Government's policy of devolution. The second is a wide range of cuts to the Northern Territory's badly managed Budget announced earlier this year as a result of an Expenditure Review Committee process. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under devolution, school councils are compelled to accept responsibility for the day- to-day administration and policy development of their schools. If the councils decide, for whatever reason, that they do not want to assume that role, then the principal of the school will be compelled to take on that job. Devolution involves such work as administering the budget for the school, ensuring maintenance, new capital works, relief and ancillary staffing, purchasing and so on. It is an onerous load for an unpaid parents council. It is an onerous load for councils where there is a very sophisticated non-Aboriginal population with a high level of education and a high level of participation in school councils because it requires accounting expertise, public administration expertise, management expertise, industrial relations expertise and purchasing expertise--skills which in many respects one does not find in small communities. They are skills which require specialised knowledge, yet they are skills which the Northern Territory Government expects small Aboriginal communities to own. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is indeed an onerous task, and an onerous load for unpaid parents councils. It is true that some parents councils will seek this load, but it is also true that there are many community councils and many communities in the Northern Territory which do not have the expertise and would, if the choice were available to them, revert to another situation in terms of the administration of these functions. </PARA>
<PARA>  It demands an enormous commitment of time and the existence and development of a high level of skills, as I have said, particularly in the area of administration. Under the Aboriginal education policy there were to be more community liaison officers, there was to be assistance in setting up Aboriginal school councils and greater involvement in teacher selection, and so on. But under the Northern Territory Government's devolution proposal, any parents coming into a school will find themselves totally overtaken by the administrative matters thrown up by a purely European tradition of education and administration. Where they do not take on that responsibility--and I could hardly blame people for not doing so because of the daunting tasks that confront them--they will lose total control to the principal. </PARA>
<PARA>  What does that say about devolution of responsibility? What more does it say about the intent of the Northern Territory community's aspirations in relation to education and its management? The Aboriginal education policy is attempting to give Aboriginal people a real say in how the schools are run. The devolution package put up by the Northern Territory Government aims to weigh down any parent game enough to give it a go. For those parents who are game enough to give it a go, all power to them. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a goal of the Aboriginal education policy to increase the number of Aboriginal people employed as teachers, administrators, liaison officers and so on. As I have said, it is a fine goal, but the reality is that the Northern Territory Government's ERC cuts have reduced the number of positions in schools. The effect at, say, Yirrkala is that, when the 19 students currently studying for their teaching qualifications at Batchelor College have completed their training, there will be only 14 jobs. Positions such as assistant teachers, linguists and literacy workers have all been cut as part of this Northern Territory Expenditure Review Committee's proposals. So the chances of greater Aboriginal involvement, as envisaged under the AEP, are being eroded by the Northern Territory Government's policy decisions and administrative practices. </PARA>
<PARA>  As part of the Northern Territory Government's ERC processes, certain schools were earmarked for closure--six in all. I do not think it would fail to surprise honourable members that two of these have a very high Aboriginal enrolment. One, the Traeger Park school in Alice Springs, has achieved Australia-wide acclaim for its work in language development. Student-teacher ratios in bush schools have been increased and education officer and resource teacher positions for remote communities and out-stations have been abolished.</PARA>
<PARA>  Let me give a stark example of the pathetic level of the Northern Territory CLP Government's commitment to Aboriginal education. It is a well-acknowledged fact that chronic otitis media--that is, middle ear disease--is prevalent among Aboriginal children in Australia, particularly in the bush. Research indicates that in the Northern Territory some 75 to 80 per cent of Aboriginal students suffer some form of hearing loss. At least 50 per cent of students outside the main towns will suffer some educationally significant hearing loss during their school life. The AEP recognises this fact. Under the Northern Territory strategic plan for the AEP it was set down as a goal:</PARA>
<PARA>  To increase the level of special education assistance to students with health problems that impair hearing . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The reality is that in the East Arnhem region, under the Northern Territory Government's ERC processes, the position of adviser to teachers of hearing impaired students has been abolished. Some 75 to 80 per cent of Aboriginal students suffer from some form of hearing loss. Hearing problem assessors say that, with classroom acoustics, teaching in front of a class of Aboriginal students with hearing impairments is like trying to teach `in front of a running Mack truck while the kids are wearing earmuffs'. </PARA>
<PARA>  What we are talking about is restricting the ability of young Aboriginal people to acquire an education because of ridiculous and stupid decisions made by the Northern Territory Government in relation to Aboriginal education--decisions which it need not have made, but which it has chosen to make and decisions which will palpably damage the educational opportunities of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>  Frankly, I am totally appalled at the failure of the CLP in the Northern Territory to deliver quality educational services to the entire population. In recent months my office has received representations from educators, parents and students from all over the Northern Territory. A few weeks ago I sat with a group of educators in the East Arnhem region who were expressing their disgust with the Northern Territory Government's practices--particularly those in relation to the Aboriginal education policy; the subsequent imposition of devolution; and the Estimates review cuts. I have received similar representations from Yuendumu, Hermannsburg, Elliot, Katherine, Tennant Creek, the Barkly region, the West Arnhem region, the Victoria River region--you name it. </PARA>
<PARA>  People from those areas expressed their valid concerns about the state of Aboriginal education and the Northern Territory Government's commitment to this cooperative arrangement which it signed with this Commonwealth Government about the funding and future of Aboriginal education in the Northern Territory.  It is of extreme importance that the Northern Territory Government live up to its responsibilities--accept its responsibilities--and acknowledge that it has not done the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA>  In terms of the Traeger Park school, let me point out that this school is situated in Alice Springs. In excess of 90 per cent of the school population is Aboriginal. There was absolutely not one dot of consultation with the school community about the future of that school. The Northern Territory Minister responsible refused, at one point, to meet with a representative body from that school. He was not even prepared to countenance a change in Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not as if there are alternative arrangements. It has become clear, as parents of these students have said, that they are concerned that with the closure of the school their children simply will not go to school. That ought to be a problem. It is a problem, but one which is not being faced up to by the Northern Territory Government. It emphasises the Northern Territory Government's extreme lack of commitment to this AEP arrangement with the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is not the only area. I note that the shadow Minister spoke glowingly about the importance of this cooperative arrangement. Well, it is important and it is the way ahead, but cooperative arrangements work only if both sides stick to the bargain. The problem I have is that I doubt that the Northern Territory Government is sticking to the bargain--certainly not to the spirit of the agreement which has been made--not only in the area of school education but also in the area of post-school education. </PARA>
<PARA>  We noted that the shadow Minister talked about Aboriginal graduates. The Northern Territory has a very fine institution which I have praised in the past and I acknowledge here in this House. Batchelor College is a very fine institution. It provides a model for how we can develop higher education programs for Aboriginal people in this country, and it ought to be seen as a model which can be used for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>  The difficulty is that the Northern Territory Government, again, signed an agreement with this Government about triennial funding for Batchelor College and has, basically, withdrawn from that agreement. We are left in a situation where Batchelor College, assured of triennial funding from this Government-- guaranteed by agreement with the Northern Territory Government that it would get support from the Northern Territory Government--is now being told by the Northern Territory Government not to expect funding for certain courses in the next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>  What does that mean for Aboriginal education and the Northern Territory Government's commitment to it in the Northern Territory?  It is similar to its commitment to Aboriginal living areas. While it is not the time in this debate to raise that issue, it is worth pointing out the discriminatory way in which Aboriginal people are treated by the Northern Territory Government. It is something which needs to be acknowledged not only by all the people in this House but also by the Northern Territory Government. It has shown that it is totally incapable of accepting the responsibility of governing in a proper way--good government for the whole population of the Northern Territory, not a selected few. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has demonstrated time and time again that it cannot be trusted. It has demonstrated time and time again that it is prepared actively to oppose the interests of Aboriginal people in the area of education. It has treated with absolute contempt the advice of Aboriginal educators--teachers. I note the sly swipe that was made at teachers unions by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge)--something which he should retract. The fact of the matter is that, without the dedication of these teachers in the Northern Territory and without their commitment and without their diligence, there would be absolutely no merit in acknowledging the support of this House for Aboriginal education because without those teachers there would be no Aboriginal education. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we are to go ahead in this area--and I acknowledge the commitment of the honourable member for Chisholm to Aboriginal education--and put ourselves in a situation where we can proudly say, at the end of this triennial period when this agreement will be renewed, that everyone has done their job, then it is up to the Northern Territory Government to live up to its commitment. It has not lived up to its commitments. At the very least, it should show that it is prepared to rethink the absurd proposition of closing Traeger Park school. Propositions have been put to it about alternatives, but it has refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of those proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has been left to the school community in a very public way to fight the Northern Territory Government in this area. I acknowledge the work of Mervyn Franey and other people who are associated with the movement to maintain Traeger Park school in Alice Springs--Harold Ferber, who is now studying here in Canberra; Jeannie Egan from Yuendumu; and Mundawuy Yunupingu, an Aboriginal principal at Yirrkala in Eastern Arnhem Land, a very important person in his own culture and community, a headmaster of a school and a person who has indicated, through his school community and through the community at Yirrkala, abject opposition to the propositions which have been put forward by the Northern Territory Government in relation to the ERC cuts in Aboriginal education. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have to look very carefully at what fronts up as an agreement with the Northern Territory Government. We have to reconcile ourselves to the fact that at the moment it is not doing its job properly--it is not pulling its weight. It has to pull its weight if we are to be successful in reaching our goals in Aboriginal education, employment and training. I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- Before I address the  Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991 I wish to say to the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) that I agree with him that one aspect of Aboriginal education that needs to be addressed is this cooperative aspect. Whilst I understand what he is saying about the Northern Territory, I am sure that my colleague in the other place Senator Tambling would have something specifically to say about that when this legislation gets to that other place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I would also say to the honourable member that his comments are not restricted to the Northern Territory. We find that the same problem exists with the Labor Government in the State of Queensland. It is not simply a question of the non-Labor side of politics wanting to drag the chain when it comes to Aboriginal education policy or Aboriginal policy in general--that also happens in some other States. </PARA>
<PARA>  Before I address the specifics of the legislation, I congratulate the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), on his foresight in his public comments yesterday in relation to Aboriginal land rights and nickel mining at Yackabindie. I also congratulate him on his public statements that the Commonwealth will not be intervening in that very important project for the State of Western Australia. I have to be somewhat cynical, however, and make the point that I only wish that his attitude had been similar when it came to Coronation Hill. It leads one to ask the basic question as to whether the power of Bula is much stronger than the carpet snake and the dragonfly, which are very much part of the Yackabindie project. </PARA>
<PARA>  Very few reasonable people could argue that our Aboriginal people are not disadvantaged to a greater degree than most Australians. The issues of unemployment, education, housing and health are central to the reversal of the Aboriginals' unfortunate lot in our society today. All of that will take time. However, it seems to me that time is fast running out if we are to make real progress in this particular area. They are some of the comments I made in this place on 5 June in the very important debate on the Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill. I reiterate those comments here this morning. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the Minister's second reading speech to this Bill he said that it will not appropriate any additional funds and that the amendments to the amounts appropriated under the principal Act also reflect Budget neutral transfers between the special appropriation and the annual Appropriation Bills. I support him on that. He also went on to say that the central features of the Aboriginal education program, to which the honourable member for the Northern Territory referred, will remain the same. With the indulgence of the House, I refer to the policy document of October 1989 in relation to Aboriginal education policy, which said in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders are the indigenous peoples of Australia. Their distinctive cultures are a rich and important part of the nation's living heritage. </PARA>
<PARA>The historically-developed education processes of Aboriginal culture have been eroded in many communities for a variety of reasons. The education arrangements and procedures established from non-Aboriginal traditions have not adequately recognised and accommodated the particular needs and circumstances of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only have Aboriginal people been consequently disadvantaged, but Australian society generally has not come to understand and appreciate the significance of Aboriginal culture. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government is a signatory to several international covenants recognising international standards for the protection of universal human rights and fundamental freedoms. These include the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and Civil and Political Rights. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that education is fundamental in enabling Aboriginal people to exercise their rights and participate fully in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the time available to me, I would like to explore a little of the genesis of that policy. I go back to 1985, when the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aboriginal Education reported and made a number of findings and recommendations in relation to education in the Aboriginal community. The report found that absenteeism from secondary schools amongst Aboriginals was very high--as much as 70 per cent in some schools--and was not confined to Aboriginal- only schools. Secondary retention rates were poor, although improving. The retention rate for year 12 students increased from 7.5 per cent in 1979 to 9.9 per cent in 1982 and 13.1 per cent in 1984. The most recent estimate puts that rate at 22 per cent in 1988. That is in contrast to the general year 12 retention rate in 1988 of 57 per cent. The same general trends have been seen in post-secondary education. </PARA>
<PARA>  That report in 1985 also found that Aboriginals lacked equality in educational opportunities and outcomes and noted the difficulties due to the Commonwealth's having responsibility for Aboriginal people and the States having responsibility for education, and the different views of the States and the Commonwealth on Aboriginal education referred to earlier by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report also found that a major problem was lack of coordination in Aboriginal education. The recommended approach was that the Commonwealth rationalise its agencies before assuming a greater responsibility for the coordination and funding of Aboriginal education. </PARA>
<PARA>  After a number of studies in 1985, 1986 and 1987, in 1988 the Commonwealth established an Aboriginal education policy task force to draw together the main findings of numerous reports over a period of three or four years with a view to developing a comprehensive long term approach to Aboriginal education policy. In July 1988 that task force found that Aboriginal people remain the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. The task force made specific recommendations about the need to develop a national Aboriginal education policy to redress the educational inequalities faced by those people. In part, it said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australians take it for granted, as an inalienable right of citizens in this country, that their children will receive at least 10 years of education, as well as the benefits of early childhood education. However, these fundamental rights have not been extended to all Aboriginal families. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that in the compulsory school years, 1 in 8 Aboriginal children aged 5 to 9 years do not go to school or pre-school, and for those aged 10 to 15 years an appalling 1 in 6 do not have access to appropriate schooling. Moreover, access to and participation in education for Aborigines beyond the age of 15, whether in senior secondary school, technical and further education or higher education, remains at unacceptably low levels--generally at rates some 3 to 5 times lower than for the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>The task force called for the development of a national policy to achieve broad equity between Aboriginal people and other Australians in access, participation and outcomes in all forms of education by the turn of the century. The task force stated that a new approach to Aboriginal education can succeed only if Aboriginals are fully involved in determining the policies and programs that are intended to provide appropriate education for their community. </PARA>
<PARA>  In October 1988 the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) announced that the national Aboriginal education policy would be developed in conjunction with the States and Territories. This was developed over the calendar year 1989 and was tabled in this place in October of that year. The long term goals of that policy were outlined in the document I referred to earlier in this speech and include such things as increasing the involvement of Aboriginal people in educational decision making, ensuring equality of access to educational services, achieving equity of educational participation and enabling equitable and appropriate educational outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA>  That education policy commenced on 1 January 1990 and embraces a number of programs referred to earlier by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), including the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, the Aboriginal student support and parent awareness program, the Aboriginal tutorial assistance scheme and, finally, the vocational educational guidance for Aboriginals scheme. As the honourable member for Chisholm said, two of those programs have been changed or amended in the context of the legislation before us this morning. That policy has been endorsed by all the governments of Australia and is financially underpinned by legislation in the form of the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989, the principal Act, which appropriated just under $240m in the triennium 1990 to 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer to a couple of other recent reports which have been tabled in this place.  The policy information paper on Australian language and literacy policy, released by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training only last month, stated, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a particular need for more English language and literacy assistance. In the last census more than 5 per cent of Aboriginal Australians reported having little or no competency in English, and most Aboriginal adults have had little access to post- school training opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody also referred, in part, to that same policy:</PARA>
<PARA>The utmost respect can be paid to the first long- term goal expressed in the policy, that is to establish effective arrangements for the participation of Aboriginal parents and community members in decisions regarding the planning, the delivery and the evaluation of pre-school, primary and secondary education services for their children . . and that it be recognised that the aims of that same policy are not only to achieve equity in education of Aboriginal people, but also to achieve strengthening of Aboriginal identity, their decision-making and their self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA>I conclude my contribution to this debate by again referring to the policy document and to a very important comment. It refers to the need for an Aboriginal education policy and says that that need arises from a number of factors:</PARA>
<PARA>.  long-expressed educational aspirations of Aboriginal people that have as yet not been realised;</PARA>
<PARA>.  persisting low levels of educational participation and attainment of Aboriginal people;</PARA>
<PARA>.  deficiencies in the provision and quality of educational services for Aboriginal people;</PARA>
<PARA>.  the joint responsibilities of the governments of the States and Territories and the Commonwealth for the provision of educational services for Aboriginal people;</PARA>
<PARA>.  inadequate coordination--</PARA>
<PARA>  which we have heard about before--</PARA>
<PARA>  between State and Territory and Commonwealth, and non-government, education providers in respect of policies and programs for Aboriginal education;</PARA>
<PARA>  a shared understanding--</PARA>
<PARA>  a very important thing--</PARA>
<PARA>  that most of the current deficiencies can be rectified--though not by any one government acting alone, and not immediately; but only through cooperative, long-term strategies. </PARA>
<PARA>Australians generally expect that policies and programs will be developed by the governments of the Commonwealth and the States and Territories, to overcome the economic and social disadvantages of Aboriginal Australians, help them to maintain their distinctive cultures, and enable them to achieve full recognition and status within the nation. </PARA>
<PARA>The need for a national policy to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for Aboriginal people is predicated upon the principles of social justice, equity, economic efficiency and cost-effective service delivery. It is also based upon the acceptance and valuing of cultural diversity. </PARA>
<PARA>It is with a great deal of pleasure that I support the legislation before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991. I am also pleased to follow the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). I certainly fully support his comments regarding the importance of the national Aboriginal education policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This Bill is a minor technical Bill in that it principally transfers funds from the principal Act, the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act, to the Higher Education Funding Act and makes some changes to ASSPA and the national Aboriginal language program. However, it gives me an opportunity to speak a little about the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy and to offer my full support for that. It is also an excellent opportunity for this House to confirm its support for that policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to make my contribution on a bit more of a personal level, probably having been one of the few people in this place who have actually taught in an Aboriginal community. My own experiences there have very much shaped my attitude towards Aboriginal issues, education issues and Aboriginal education issues. In fact, it would not be unreasonable to say that my experiences in the two years I spent at Yarrabah Aboriginal community shaped my desire to be more involved in the politics of administration of Aboriginal affairs and Aboriginal education in particular, because I started my teaching career straight out of university and teachers college at Yarrabah. It was my first experience as a teacher; it was certainly a very rewarding and interesting experience, and it was one that has certainly influenced my approach to Aboriginal education. I think the experience that I had as a brand new, very green teacher coming straight out of teachers college and going to a community some 1,800 kilometres away from my home, was one that has been faced by many hundreds and probably thousands of other teachers, but it is one of the problems we have had in Aboriginal education and it is one of the things that I am hopeful that the national Aboriginal education policy will rectify over time. </PARA>
<PARA>  I had had very little experience with Aboriginal people and particularly with Aboriginal education. That was demonstrated in my first few fumbling months in front of the classroom there, because I really was having a great deal of difficulty. When I went to Yarrabah I knew absolutely nothing about the Yarrabah community, except that it was near Cairns. In fact, when I rang up the Education Department and said, `Look, I have been appointed to Yarrabah; where is it?', the people there said, `We are not really sure;  we think it is on an island somewhere off the coast'. I said, `How am I supposed to get to this island off the coast?'. They said, `We think there is a barge once a week and you are supposed to go over and stay there'. I thought then that it was going to be very interesting. </PARA>
<PARA>  I found out that my parents had friends in Cairns and I rang them up and said, `Where is Yarrabah?'. They said, `It is just a drive, 20 minutes away'. I said, `Is it on an island?'. They said, `No, it is not on an island at all'. That demonstrated to me the treatment that Aboriginal education, and an important Aboriginal community, received within the Education Department. I did not have to go by barge, of which I was most appreciative; in fact I was able to live in Cairns because my new wife at that time was starting to teach at Cairns High. When I turned up at Yarrabah I was one of five first-year teachers, and of the staff of 13 teachers at Yarrabah there were five first-years, four second-years, three third- years and one person who had taught for about 10 years. But 12 of the 13 people had three years or less teaching experience, and I think that was a great shame--not that young people starting out in teaching do not have a lot to offer, but in any school it is important for the successful delivery of education programs to have a good balance between new teachers and experienced teachers. </PARA>
<PARA>  That experience at Yarrabah was unfortunately reflected on many Aboriginal communities through Queensland and probably many Aboriginal communities in other areas such as Western Australia and the Northern Territory. It exemplifies the fact that for too long the needs of Aboriginal people in the education field have been ignored, and the importance of education to Aboriginal people has also been largely ignored. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think that fact has been exemplified by the figures which have been printed in the booklet on the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. That was one of the reasons why we developed this policy in the first place. I would like to cite some of these figures. They are based on the 1990 situation, and I think they have probably improved from when I was teaching in Yarrabah in 1977-78. The figures show that fewer than 50 per cent of Aboriginal children have had some pre-schooling experience, compared with a national equivalent rate of more than 90 per cent. Some 30 per cent of those aged 16 and 17 years are participating in education or formal training, compared with a national equivalent rate of 75 per cent. That shows that we have a very poor retention rate for Aboriginal students, compared with non-Aboriginal students in Australia. Some 7 per cent of those people aged 18 to 20 years are participating in education or formal training, compared with a national equivalent rate exceeding 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  The figures keep getting worse and worse. Eleven per cent of all Aboriginal people aged 15 years and over have never attended a school; and 10 per cent of the Aboriginal population aged 15 years and over have post- school educational qualifications, compared with a national proportion of 31 per cent. It is those types of figures, which we still have in 1991, that exemplify the longstanding neglect of Aboriginal education that has been shown up through the various reports and task forces that have been mentioned previously in the contributions this morning and which were the basis of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  I hope that, through this policy State governments such as the Queensland Government will come a long way in their approach to Aboriginal education. I would hate to think we still have situations where Aboriginal schools are staffed nine-tenths with first or second year teachers, compared with the average in most other schools where there are three or four teachers beginning their training and a balanced mix of experienced teachers who can provide a stronger foundation for the education program in that school. </PARA>
<PARA>  The national Aboriginal education policy was developed by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) when he was the Minister responsible for Aboriginal education. It is a cooperative effort to address the educational needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by focussing on the educational strategies of the Commonwealth, States and Territories, non- government education authorities and educational institutions in achieving agreed national goals. It was one of the first instances where the Commonwealth, States and Territories sat down and actually tried to develop a national approach to a problem;  and they succeeded. They developed a very good national approach. It is that success that I think has laid the foundations for other initiatives in other areas which are now a part of the Federal-State relations program. </PARA>
<PARA>  I certainly agree with my colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) in saying that when we sit down and develop these national goals and say that these are the ways we wish to go as a nation--with the States, Territories and the Commonwealth working together to achieve these established goals--it is a two-edged sword. We all have to agree and we have to stick with our decisions. I am disappointed to hear from the honourable member for the Northern Territory that decisions are being made by the Northern Territory Government to cut back significantly on some successful education programs that are occurring, particularly in Aboriginal schools. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the other strengths that has come through the national Aboriginal education policy is the importance of involvement by the Aboriginal community in the delivery of education services to Aboriginal people in their community. That is the rock upon which this policy is founded. I quote from the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy joint policy statement which says:</PARA>
<PARA>The fundamental purpose of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy is to develop appropriate ways of responding effectively and sensitively to the educational needs and aspirations of  Aboriginal people. This requires an holistic approach, under the guidance of Aboriginal people, to achieve educational equity while accommodating cultural difference and recognising socio-economic disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>That goes to the very reason why almost all Commonwealth, State and Territory educational programs affecting Aboriginal people have basically failed up until this point in time and why, if we are to have any chance of succeeding with the national Aboriginal education policy, that community involvement--that involvement by Aboriginal people themselves in the running of their schools, the determination of curriculum and structures, and also the involvement of Aboriginal people as teachers--is fundamental to any chance of success of education for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>  If one looks at the successful examples where Aboriginal communities have been involved in the running of their schools, it proves the very essence of that statement by the national Aboriginal education policy. Since I have come to this place I have been involved in both the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. In my work with the Aboriginal Affairs Standing Committee I have had the opportunity and the pleasure to visit a number of Aboriginal communities across this country-- places that I had not had the opportunity to visit before. Through those visits I can contrast very clearly the successes that some communities have had in their school programs and in the delivery of education to their children, to others where this seems to be failing. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was delighted to have the opportunity to visit places such as Yirrkala school at Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory. I found that to be a very exciting place. There were lots of things happening:  the children were motivated, they were attending, the program seemed relevant to their needs, and the community was actively involved in the running of that school. It was a very successful program for that reason--the community felt that it was its school. Regardless of whether we are talking about Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal people in this country, if the community does not feel that it is its school--that it is an important part of the Aboriginal society and that the people have a stake in the educational policies of that school--then the educational system fails. It is the same in the suburbs of my electorate of Moreton as it is in Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA>  The success of Yirrkala school and the success of another school which we visited in the Northern Territory, Yipirinya school in Alice Springs, is because of that strong community involvement. The people believe that is their school;  they have a stake in the success of that school so they get themselves involved. </PARA>
<PARA>  I contrast that with what has been happening for a number of years in Aurukun in far north Queensland. I visited Aurukun a couple of weeks ago with the Aboriginal Affairs Committee, together with my friend and colleague the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) and the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), who is another member of the Aboriginal Affairs Committee. We had the opportunity to talk to people in Aurukun. Some honourable members may not be aware of the difficulties that have hit Aurukun, but the Queensland Government recently made a decision to take I think about eight teachers out of the school. It had a staff of about 10 or 11 and the Government has transferred eight teachers out of the school because, although the school has a notional enrolment of some 260 students, only 30 were turning up each day. </PARA>
<PARA>  We could try to lay blame for that. We could try to work out why that is happening;  we could say that maybe the community is not concerned about education. We all know that there have been a lot of alcohol problems in the community;  there has been a lot of violence and threats have been made against teachers. I am not criticising the Queensland Government for its decision to transfer teachers out of that place, particularly if there were safety reasons behind it. But I look at that school and I say, `Why is this school failing to address the needs of the community?  Why is the community not supporting the Aurukun school?'. I think one of the reasons why is that the community does not believe the Aurukun school is relevant to its needs, and that is a great disappointment. I do not think the Aurukun community is fully involved in its school. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is a pity, because in the late 1970s and early 1980s Aurukun was a very successful school. It had a bilingual program going in the school which was working really well. It had very strong enrolments occurring, the average attendance of any other school, of around 92 or 93 per cent, and the community was fully involved. One of the reasons it was so fully involved was that bilingual program. The community felt that the school reflected the needs of the community, because the people of Aurukun still speak their own language very strongly. They are still active Wik speakers and they were pleased that the education system recognised their language and actually taught in their language as well as in English. The bilingual program meant that students not only were becoming literate in their own language of Wik but also were becoming more fluent and literate in English. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have yet to be given an explanation as to why the bilingual program was taken out, but since the removal of that program the whole fabric of the school has wound away and enrolments have fallen back. The school no longer has the support of the community and the children of Aurukun are missing out because of the lack of community involvement. I am very disappointed that that is happening and I hope that some time in the next few months the Queensland Education Minister is able to fully examine the ways in which Aboriginal education is delivered at Aurukun and whether or not there are some alternative methods that he needs to consider for delivery of educational services. </PARA>
<PARA>  One thing that is happening at Aurukun is that a number of people are moving out of Aurukun to out-stations around the community. That was one of the reasons why a number of the children were not present at the school. Over 120, and possibly 160, people are living on out-stations, and perhaps the Queensland Education Minister needs to consider ways of taking some educational services out to the people on those out-stations as well. </PARA>
<PARA>  The strength of the national Aboriginal education policy lies in the fact that it relies on community involvement. That is highlighted by the success of the ASSPA program through which funds are dedicated to Aboriginal schools or schools with significant Aboriginal enrolments so that the parents of those Aboriginal students can determine which resources, programs or specific services they want. That has shown that Aboriginal parents do wish to be involved, because in every place where ASSPA has been offered and has got off the ground, it has succeeded and is operating very well. This is because Aboriginal parents are willing to be involved, get behind their children, sit as a committee, decide what resources they want and where they want the funding to go to address the particular needs of the students in that school. ASSPA highlights the fact that Aboriginal people do wish to be involved, as every other parent does, in the delivery of education. </PARA>
<PARA>  I hope that over time that element of the national Aboriginal education policy will grow stronger and stronger, that is, the communities are the very foundation of the delivery of successful education and we need to strongly encourage Aboriginal people to be involved in and take charge of the delivery of education in their communities. It has been proven that only in that way will we have students fully involved and receiving the same educational opportunities as those offered to the rest of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am indeed pleased to be able to speak to the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill, but regret that I will not be able to bring to this debate the richness of personal experience that we have just heard from the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson). Education is the door to a prosperous and rewarding future for all Australians. The keys to the door are literacy and numeracy which, in the hands of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, offer them a golden opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Commonwealth is to be commended for its attention to the provision of the Aboriginal education program, and the cooperation between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the Government in the establishment of that program is an example of interaction at the coalface. It is extremely important for consultations to be not only undertaken but actually taken into consideration when programs which impact on particular communities are being determined. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have particular and distinctive needs in education and those needs may vary from community to community. As we have just heard from the honourable member for Moreton, that community involvement is critical to the success not only of educational programs but of all sorts of programs which are offered by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remind the honourable member for Moreton that he and his colleagues on the Government side of the House still support the centralised bureaucracy of the education system that has been built up and up under the current Ministers. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have particular and distinctive needs in education. When reforms are being considered there must be real consultation and attention to the detailed needs expressed by those communities in order to achieve maximum desirable impact with minimum conflict. </PARA>
<PARA>  In his second reading speech the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation (Mr Tickner) mentioned several major reports which have identified Aboriginal people as the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. When referring to the AEP he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It has four main long term objectives: to increase the involvement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in educational decision making; to ensure equality of access to educational services; to ensure equity of educational participation; and to achieve equitable and appropriate educational outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA>The designation of four separate long term objectives of the Aboriginal educational program is somewhat disappointing. It is just another example of bureaucratic activity that simply confuses the real issues. Surely, the four objectives could be enunciated in one simple objective, which, furthermore, should not be long term. </PARA>
<PARA>  Restated, the objectives might be read as follows: to increase the involvement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in educational decision making and to ensure equality of access, participation and outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last week the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) released a White Paper on the Australian language and literacy policy titled Australia's Language. The Minister's paper discusses the need for plain English and in fact defines plain English as `clear, intelligible English'. The paper states:</PARA>
<PARA>It does not mean simplistic English. Plain English should be used in public documents issued by Governments and the private sector. It is not an attempt to strip English literature of its richness. </PARA>
<PARA>That is all good stuff, but the Dawkins paper is so riddled with bureaucratic doublespeak that it is very difficult to determine the real policy objectives or the methods which will be used to achieve the policy outcome that is sought. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, the bureaucracy has its own agenda, which includes self-generation. As long as the language in documents is obscure, difficult to interpret and, to some, incomprehensible, we will need the bureaucrats to translate for us the meaning of our own language. I ask honourable members whether those from Anglo-Saxon, English speaking backgrounds have some difficulty at times, or perhaps frequently, with Australian Government bureaucratic double speak. Imagine then the discomfort, difficulty and disillusionment felt by those from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who join with others from non-English speaking backgrounds as part of the Australian society who have difficulty coping with government documentation. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we are to improve the educational position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, it is imperative that the main objective of the Aboriginal educational program be to immediately provide greater access to educational services. With access comes greater participation. With greater participation at a face to face level comes increased involvement, with resultant enhanced outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA>  The four objectives as enunciated by the Minister are all part of the pathway which leads from easier access through greater participation in education to a more highly educated people. They are not, and cannot be, considered as separate and individual objectives. Access is a stepping stone to participation which leads to involvement of families and friends resulting in greater achievement with improved outcomes and enhanced self- reliance. </PARA>
<PARA>  Simplicity should be the fundamental basis of all education programs, whether they are for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people or others. It is time that this Government woke up to this very simple basic fact. I venture to suggest that all of us on both sides of the House have a commitment to the provision of effective and worthwhile educational programs for all Aust- ralians. However, that admirable commitment will have little value if we do not also simplify the processes of delivery in order to maximise the dollar value at the coalface--in the classroom, face to face with the consumers of education. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is very good at talking about commitment and establishing goals and objectives but when it comes to actual delivery the filter that is the bureaucracy often leaves little but the dregs for the actual consumer. Appropriation Bills Nos 1 and 2, which are still before the House, increase expenditure on tertiary education by 7.7 per cent. The Budget increases expenditure on student financial assistance by 18.5 per cent. It increases expenditure on general administration and overheads by 18.7 per cent. It is axiomatic that we have little hope of increasing real educational outcomes if we spend our money on the bureaucracy and living expenses to the detriment of the real delivery of real teaching programs in real schools. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased to note the Minister's emphasis on the involvement of Aboriginals in decision making. It is crucial that such involvement occur and become an ongoing process. I note that parents and teachers meet on a regular basis to discuss program priorities in the schools. Such interaction benefits all parties. In the Cockatoo Primary School in my electorate of La Trobe the parents, friends and relations of students have become closely involved with all aspects of schooling, particularly the reading program. As a result of that interaction literacy levels have increased in leaps and bounds not only among the students but also within the community at large. It has been exciting to watch the development of enhanced literacy skills throughout the whole community--something which has occurred to such an extent that Cockatoo Primary School is no longer considered a disadvantaged school.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am sure that such outcomes can also be achieved in Aboriginal communities. Education is such a wonderful experience when the students are given the basic skills--those of literacy and numeracy--that the desire to learn becomes endemic. For too long in this nation of diverse cultural backgrounds learning and the skills of learning have not always been available to the less advantaged. Equitable access to participation in and results from education will benefit our nation as a whole. The quest for knowledge can be contagious. The Minister in his second reading speech indicated:</PARA>
<PARA>The policy emphasises a cooperative approach at every level and operates with cross-party support. It links the work of education providers and State and Territory governments of all kinds through an agreed national approach. </PARA>
<PARA>I am delighted to note the Minister's acknowledgment of cross-party support. Education is an issue so important to the future of Australia that it should be non-political. Unfortunately, the teachers unions do not always agree. I will give honourable members an example. In Victoria we have recently had industrial action that denied primary students from non-government schools access to the education facilities at the Royal Melbourne Zoo. I ask honourable members: how can we as a nation ever become a clever country when primary school children become the butt of some union's sick joke? It is absolutely imperative that such rebel action not be allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA>  Cooperative approaches at all levels of education, not just Aboriginal, and the depoliticising of education policy can only make a positive contribution towards a smarter nation. All providers of education at both Federal and State levels must work together in a spirit of cooperation to ensure that the very best outcomes are available to all who would seek to be educated. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important to note the signs that indicate an increase in Aboriginal school retention rates. Of the 4,226 Aboriginal students in receipt of Absec and Abstudy allowances in year 8 in 1976, only 325 were still in the system and in receipt of those allowances when they completed year 12 in 1980--an apparent retention rate of 7.69 per cent. I say `apparent' because the figures do not necessarily indicate that all non-recipients had dropped out of school. The statistic simply measures the number of students who were still in receipt of educational allowances. It is assumed that non-recipients of allowances were no longer in the schooling system. </PARA>
<PARA>  There were 4,980 Aboriginal students in receipt of Absec and Abstudy allowances in year 8 in 1980. That figure fell to 3,540 completing year 10 two years later. Only 656 were recorded as being left in the system in year 12 in 1984--an apparent retention rate of 13.17 per cent. That is almost double that of the figure two years before. By 1984 there were 5,640 students in year 8 receiving Absec and Abstudy allowances. Two years later, 4,356 students were studying year 10. In 1988 some 1,292 were still recorded as being in education studying year 12--an apparent retention rate of 22.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Although the retention rates are assumed because only those students in receipt of educational allowances are included, one factor that is very apparent is the steady increase in apparent retention rates during the terms not only of the Hawke Labor Government, as the Minister claimed, but also during the Fraser years. </PARA>
<PARA>  The desire to pursue higher education that is being demonstrated by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is to be applauded and encouraged. It is essential that all Australians, regardless of cultural background, exercise their rights to an education. It behoves the Government to provide the opportunities. Education is an essential ingredient in the maturing of a nation; its significance cannot and indeed must not be underestimated. I am somewhat concerned at the Minister's comment in his second reading speech when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The reconciliation process emphasises education as a central and essential concern. . . There is a need to educate all Australians about Aboriginal history and culture and about the reasons for Aboriginal social and economic disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>Education of all Australians about the contribution Aboriginals have made to this country we call home is important--very important. However, we must be very careful in the structuring of the studies of Aboriginal culture and history that we do not get caught up in the guilt complex merry-go-round that some of our lefty and trendy teachers would hang on us. We must be careful not to attempt to rewrite our early history books in order to satisfy a new awakening of Aboriginal history. I do not condone or attempt to justify the many acts of aggression against our Aboriginal people by the early settlers, but recognition of those acts must be taught in the context of the times. Many similar acts were also being perpetrated against various sections of the settler community. </PARA>
<PARA>  To teach an unbalanced view has the potential to perpetuate discord. Let the emphasis be on cooperation, accord, harmony, and results in education rather than on guilt and disadvantage. There is a saying, `If you tell a person they are smart, stupid, attractive, or whatever, often enough, soon enough they will start believing it'. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders may be disadvantaged, but to continually harp on the disadvantage perpetuates that belief. </PARA>
<PARA>  Education is about changing one's view of oneself. Education is knowing that one can succeed. Education is about learning how to learn. Education is about transformation in all facets of life for all people--whether Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal. We are indeed one nation and one people. We in this place have an obligation to encourage the education of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in such a way as to emphasise the positive features of their culture and heritage, and to let that positive emphasis permeate the whole Australian education system so that we can have a nation that practises reconciliation and cooperation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I start by picking up a point from the second reading speech of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) which was mentioned by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). The honourable member quoted the Minister as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The reconciliation process emphasises education as a central and essential concern. As the Bill, supported unanimously in both Houses of Parliament, stresses, there is a need to educate all Australians about Aboriginal history and culture and about the reasons for Aboriginal social and economic disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>I think this point made by the Minister, who is at the table, is very important, because it is about something that all Australians have missed out on--that is, Aborigine culture. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have a lot to learn from our Aborigine brothers and sisters. The last 12 months or so, in which time I have been involved in the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, have been very educational for me. I think it has been said by some of my colleagues on the other side of the House that perhaps we all should take the opportunity to participate in such committees, because we do have the opportunity to learn more about Aborigine culture and the needs of these wonderful people. They have a great history and Australia certainly is a greater place for the contribution they make. </PARA>
<PARA>  But there are difficulties, particularly in the education field, and that is the subject of the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill. Whilst we can describe the amendments as minor, they are very important. The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the principal Act, the Aboriginal</PARA>
<PARA>Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989. There are four parts to these amendments, which previously have been outlined by the Minister and others, so I will not go through them again. </PARA>
<PARA>  The national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, a joint policy statement, certainly is worth reading. I commend it to all honourable members. The Aboriginal education policy task force was established in 1988 to bring together many reports, ranging from a report on Aboriginal education in 1985 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs to a number of other reports put out by the National Aboriginal Education Committee. Some of the comments in that report are very frightening. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Australians take it for granted, as an inalienable right of citizens of this country, that their children will receive at least 10 years of education, as well as the benefits of early childhood education. However, these fundamental rights have not been extended to all Aboriginal families. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that in the compulsory school years, 1 in 8 Aboriginal children aged 5 to 9 years do not go to school or pre-school, and for those aged 10 to 15 years an appalling 1 in 6 do not have access to appropriate schooling. Moreover, access to and participation in education for Aborigines beyond the age of 15, whether in senior secondary school, technical and further education or higher education, remains at unacceptably low levels--generally at rates some 3 to 5 times lower than for the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>This certainly is an appalling situation, about which I am sure all honourable members share my concern. I know that the Minister at the table does. That report highlights the point which we are talking about in Aborigine education.</PARA>
<PARA>  Earlier, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) referred to his and my participation in various aspects of our work with the Aboriginal Affairs Committee. Recently, I went with him on a trip to north Queensland. When we go to these places we see the problems that exist in them. I do not pretend to have the answers to them, but I think the commitment that this Government has given to Aborigine education policy goes a long way towards finding them. I think it is only with cooperation at all levels of government--and the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy goes a long way towards achieving that--that we will overcome a lot of these difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Moreton referred to Aurukun in north Queensland, where there have been difficulties in recent times. I hope that the Queensland Education Minister, in trying to get those teachers back into that area, picks up some of the points made by the honourable member for Moreton, because the attendance rate at the school in Aurukun is appalling. The teachers were taken out of the school because of the low number of children attending. </PARA>
<PARA>  In contrast, on that same visit to north Queensland, we also went to Kowanyama. Interestingly enough, the number of children attending schools there was very similar to the numbers in mainstream education in the rest of Queensland. We spoke to the headmaster of the school, who mentioned that the attendance rate at his school was the norm for most other communities throughout the State. I thought that was encouraging. It seemed to be a very vibrant community which had a lot of work going on. It was quite a contrast. I think we should look at different areas in which Aborigine communities are working together well in the interests of their families, because that is certainly something that needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst the honourable member for Moreton remained at Aurukun, I, along with the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), had the opportunity to go to an out-station. We flew there in a little aircraft, which I was not really keen on flying in, but it was a great opportunity. That is why the honourable member for Moreton did not go--he does not like flying in little aircraft. It was an interesting trip. </PARA>
<PARA>  People wish to move out to these areas. They are developing and getting back to their own cultures more now than they have in the past. The education question will need to be addressed because that is one of the things that will be lacking in these out-stations. They will need assistance to apply themselves. I think they will be able to do that with the assistance that can be provided by Government, provided the people themselves are involved in that education.   Today various speakers have mentioned how the Aboriginal people themselves need to be involved in decision making processes. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) highlighted some problems in the Northern Territory. I think most of us are aware of the attitude of the Government up there. Consultation is essential, and it is essential that the education centres for all people do belong to the people and that people do participate in them. I am sure that in our own communities, from our involvement with local schools, we all know that where there is a sense of belonging there is much greater participation by all the families associated with those schools. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is exactly the same as any other community, including communities comprising Aboriginal families who participate in those activities. I have had the opportunity to visit schools in Aboriginal communities and I have noticed that the successful schools have a greater participation rate of local people compared with the schools which impose a system of involvement on the local people. Many teachers are very dedicated to the work they do in those communities. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will not speak at great length on this legislation, but I wish to make a couple of points. If there are problems with housing and living standards, they flow right through the education system. Aborigines are very proud people. If they do not have good living standards and proper housing, the children are not properly prepared to go to school. In many cases, as a result of those poor conditions, the children do not go to school at all. These points were made to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, and they highlight the need to address a whole range of problems. It is not possible to look at education or housing in isolation. These problems, including the living standards of Aboriginal people in these communities in particular, must be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for the work he is doing. I call on our State colleagues to provide the necessary support. I am a Queenslander. Some unfortunate situations have occurred recently in Queensland which have not pleased me. I have stated that publicly on other occasions. I hope that some of the difficulties confronting Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland will be addressed very quickly by the Queensland State Government. If the Federal Parliament is fair dinkum about the reconciliation process--this Government and the Opposition have already said that they are committed to it--it will not augur well if State and Territory governments fail to show a commitment to the reconciliation process that we are working towards. </PARA>
<PARA>  I come back to the point where I started. Education is certainly a fundamental element in the reconciliation process, and it was also central to the findings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Education seems to be the cornerstone of the processes involved in the resolution of problems that really need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased that members of the Opposition support this legislation. They have worked in a bipartisan way to deal with these matters. I am pleased to have the opportunity to support this legislation and commend it to the House. </PARA>

They should visit the electorate of Kennedy, which is 772,000 square kilometres. It is impossible to walk around the electorate, so they would have to fly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  At the outset, while I welcome the bipartisan support for the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991, I must say that some of the comments made by the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) about Bula and carpet snakes smack of--dare I use the expression?--crass politics. I think his comments show a lack of understanding of the totality of the real issues involved in the Coronation Hill decision. I have not the slightest doubt that the Coronation Hill decision was absolutely correct. If the honourable member for Groom took the time to fully explore the complexity of the issues, I am sure he would come to the same conclusion without reverting to patronisation. </PARA>
<PARA>  During this debate, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) related very well his personal experiences as a teacher in Aboriginal communities generally, and Yarrabah in particular. He referred to the lack of interest demonstrated in the past in Aboriginal education. I, too, have a story to relate from my early days as a solicitor when I was retained by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service in north-west Queensland. This is a true story. It reflects the lack of appropriate education of Aboriginal people in the past in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not long after arriving in Mount Isa, I was speaking to a police prosecutor who told me about the difficulties encountered by Aboriginal people in understanding the criminal justice system. I must say that he agreed that this related to a lack of educational opportunities. He told me about an old Aboriginal bloke who was merely a witness to a fatal car crash. The old bloke was subpoenaed to give evidence at a coronial inquest. He came to court and, when it was time to give evidence, he was put into the witness box. He looked around the room and saw a room full of stuffed shirts. There were lawyers, a magistrate and court reporters present, and it must have been a very daunting experience for him. </PARA>
<PARA>  He looked around the room--honourable members should not forget that he was a witness to this car crash--and called out, `I plead guilty'. The court room roared with laughter, but the Aboriginal witness was not laughing. He had been subjected to a system that offered him no chance of acquiring an education and, therefore, no chance of understanding the system of justice in this country. Thankfully, things are slowly changing. </PARA>
<PARA>    The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991 amends the principal Act, the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989. As we have heard, the principal Act provides a legislative base for a consolidated program and funding approach that is supplementary to mainstream funding. The Act underpins the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, known as the AEP, which has been endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Act leaves intact the essential features of the AEP. However, as a result of this legislation, the administrative arrangements under which funding is disbursed will be  different under the AEP. The administrative amendments reflect the transfer of the higher education funding component within the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 to the Higher Education Funding Act and minor changes to the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program. </PARA>
<PARA>  While the changes to the legislation are merely administrative, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) has noted in his second reading speech--this has also been referred to by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), and I think it is worth repeating--that the passage of the amendments provides an opportunity for the Parliament to give a commitment of support to the principles and practices of the AEP as a means of addressing the educational needs of Aboriginal Australians. I wholeheartedly agree with the Minister, and I certainly welcome that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>  The origins of the AEP date back to 1988 when the Federal Government established an education policy task force to examine Aboriginal education. The task force conducted its own investigations and held its own consultations. It drew together the main findings of several major reports into Aboriginal education over the past decade. The Government endorsed the main findings of the task force report and responded by developing the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy in conjunction with State and Territory governments, educational institutions and Aboriginal groups. The policy was announced in October 1989 and resulted in the passage of the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) mentioned that the national policy has four long term goals:  the involvement of Aboriginal people in education decision making;  equality of access to educational services; equity in educational participation;  and equitable and appropriate educational outcomes. Through the national policy, the Government has allocated funds to preschools, primary and secondary schools including post- compulsory schooling, technical and further education colleges, adult education and higher education. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not wish to go into much detail on each of these long term goals. However, I take this opportunity to put on the record the success of the Aboriginal student support and parent awareness program, known as ASSPA, at Mount Isa's Central State School. The Mount Isa Central State School's ASSPA committee is one of over 2,000 similar committees throughout Australia. For the benefit of those who do not know, let me say that ASSPA committees are made up of Aboriginal parents and teachers who meet to discuss program priorities for schools. </PARA>
<PARA>  Before I was elected to Parliament, I used to work with a woman by the name of Amanda Brazier, who is now secretary and treasurer of the Mount Isa State School ASSPA committee. According to Amanda, the committee is operating extremely well. Not only is it giving Aboriginal parents such as Amanda the opportunity to discuss the educational needs and priorities of their children but it also gives teachers the opportunity, which is equally important, to learn about Aboriginal culture. </PARA>
<PARA>  Items on the agenda at ASSPA committee meetings can include:  ways of assisting Aboriginal children to learn two separate cultures;  how to make Aboriginal culture accessible to new teachers arriving from southern cities; the inclusion of Aboriginal history and culture on the school curriculum;  and National Aboriginal and Islander Day of Celebrations, which is known as NAIDOC. </PARA>
<PARA>  National Aboriginal and Islander Day is being celebrated in Mount Isa this week and Central State School has had a variety of projects happening all week that have encouraged young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children to be proud of their culture, and has brought some of the mystery and excitement of that culture to non-Aboriginal children. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Amanda Brazier, the Central State School ASSPA Committee and all other hardworking ASSPA committees in Mount Isa and around Queensland that have contributed very well to NAIDOC celebrations this week. </PARA>
<PARA>  The importance of the success of the ASSPA program and the other elements of the AEP--such as the Aboriginal tutorial assistance scheme, which is also working very well in Mount Isa, and schemes for the vocational and educational guidance for Aboriginals--is made all too clear when we look at the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education retention and participation rates, which have been referred to by some of the previous speakers. The AEP task force reported in 1988 that education participation and retention rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students were still well below those of the rest of Australia. About 13 per cent of Aboriginal students aged 5 to 15 years do not take part in compulsory education, whereas almost all other Australians of the same age group do. </PARA>
<PARA>  The number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students taking part in post-compulsory education also reflects considerable inequities between Aboriginal people and other Australians. Aboriginal participation in years 11 and 12, TAFE and higher education is only about one-third of the rate of the rest of the community. There has been considerable improvement in recent years. The number of Aboriginal students staying on to finish year 12 has increased markedly from about 11 per cent in 1983 to almost 23 per cent in 1988. Aboriginal enrolments in higher education have also increased considerably from 700 in 1983 to 2,604 in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>  While the record is improving, it is important to acknowledge the conclusion of the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in this regard. In volume 2 of the national report, in the chapter on schooling, Commissioner Elliott Johnston, QC, noted that, although there has been significant improvement in Aboriginal education indicators in the past two decades, Aboriginal people are still identifiable as the most poorly educated group in Australia. The report provides an excellent analysis of the factors influencing Aboriginal education, including inhibiting factors such as cultural difference, health, parental roles, the mobility of families, social conflict, poverty and living conditions, role models, curriculum, peer group pressure, general attitudes and unwillingness to leave home. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report also considered the AEP in some detail. Despite some criticism of the AEP concerning who should define appropriate outcomes, the Commission did conclude that the AEP provides a model set of cooperative arrangements that enable Aboriginal participation in decision making. The Commission recommended:</PARA>
<PARA>That:</PARA>
<PARA>a.  At every stage of the application of the National Aboriginal Education Policy the utmost respect be paid to the first long-term goal expressed in the policy, that is:</PARA>
<PARA>      To establish effective arrangements for the participation of Aboriginal parents and community members in decisions regarding the planning, delivery, and evaluation of pre-school, primary, and secondary education services for their children. </PARA>
<PARA>b.  It be recognized that the aims of the Policy are not only to achieve equity in education for Aboriginal people but also to achieve a strengthening of Aboriginal identity, decision making and self-determination; and</PARA>
<PARA>c.  It is unlikely that either of these aims--</PARA>
<PARA>the above two aims referred to--</PARA>
<PARA>can be achieved without the achieving of the other. </PARA>
<PARA>I am confident that, if the level of commitment on the part of Aboriginal parents and teachers at Mount Isa Central State School is typical  of  ASSPA committees  around Australia, the AEP will ultimately achieve its aims. </PARA>
<PARA>  The AEP is integrally related to the process of Aboriginal reconciliation, as set out in the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991. As the Minister has said, the reconciliation process emphasises the essential role of education and, specifically, that there is an urgent need to educate non-Aboriginal Australians about the cultures of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. As I have said before in this House, I believe that the tragic history of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people must be told with the objective not of creating guilt but of fostering compassion and empathy for Australia's indigenous people. It will be a central role of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to bring the history and the suffering of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people out into the open. The stories of abuse, murder, alienation and dislocation must be told--and non-Aboriginal people must listen. </PARA>
<PARA>  The AEP provides the framework for the national reconciliation and schooling strategy that is an integral part of this process. We should applaud, I think, the success to date of the AEP and look forward to the day when the four objectives have been met fully. I certainly have pleasure in fully supporting the Bill now before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-in reply--There has been quite a wide ranging debate which has reflected virtually an absolute cross-party commitment not only to the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill which is before the House but also, even more importantly, to the Aboriginal education policy which has been so extensively debated in the course of the Bill's passage through the House. However, I ought to respond to a number of things that have been raised in the course of debate, and I will proceed to do that as expeditiously as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  At the outset, I would like again, as often is my lot in this House, to pay credit to the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) for his constructive contribution to the Bill. He highlighted two very important matters which I want to give further emphasis to: firstly, the need for inter-governmental cooperation in relation to the Aboriginal education policy and, secondly, the importance of monitoring the outcomes of that policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  There was held in Alice Springs a week ago a meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers for Aboriginal affairs. One of the results of that meeting was a decision taken by Ministers to go forward to the Special Premiers Conference to bring about some very practical proposals for greater inter-governmental cooperation in Aboriginal affairs generally. I do believe that the Aboriginal education policy shows the way that such cooperation could be achieved. But it is important, both in terms of the broader initiatives of Federal, State and Territory Ministers in Aboriginal affairs and in relation to the AEP, that we have comprehensive monitoring of outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA>  I emphasise that because, as a number of speakers in the course of this debate have said, it is a principle of the reconciliation strategy that has been unanimously supported by the Parliament that the question of Aboriginal education be afforded a high priority, partly for reasons just mentioned by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls), which I will allude to further in a moment, and also because of a central principle of the reconciliation strategy that the governments of Australia need to work with Aboriginal people to address critical issues of Aboriginal disadvantage. The preamble to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . as a part of the reconciliation process, the Commonwealth will seek an ongoing national commitment from governments at all levels to co- operate and to co-ordinate with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as appropriate to address progressively Aboriginal disadvantage and aspirations in relation to. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, one of the matters that is mentioned there is education, and it is seen as a major objective of the reconciliation strategy leading to the centenary of Australian federation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I raise that because if the Aboriginal education policy is going to be effective we have to be in there as a nation for the long haul. The extent of the disadvantage, as many speakers have recognised, is so great that it will take a vast and ongoing commitment of resources. We have to be sure that the programs put in place under the AEP are adequately monitored to see that they are achieving the results that we have set out to achieve under the policy. So I endorse what I understand to be the sentiments of the honourable member for Chisholm in raising those matters. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn to the contribution of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon). In the context of referring to his contribution, I pick up the general sentiments put forward by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) and the honourable member for Kennedy in their contributions to the debate. All those Government members I believe made forthright and highly principled contributions. They made me exceptionally proud to be a member of this side of the House, because the Hansard will show that they took up in a forthright way issues of concern in relation to the Aboriginal education policy. The honourable member for Moreton, the honourable member for Oxley and the honourable member for Kennedy directly made reference to policies and issues of concern to them in relation to Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think it is important that honourable members of this House be able to speak forthrightly on matters of concern, especially in relation to Aboriginal affairs. If occasionally party allegiances get in the way of those forthright and heartfelt concerns, then I am proud that people on this side of the House--and I do hope, in years to come, on the other side of the House--can stick to their principles, stand up for their beliefs, and support the principles that underlie Aboriginal education policies. So I thank them for their contributions. I think they were constructively and moderately put, and no doubt they will be pursuing those matters further. </PARA>
<PARA>   I prefaced my comments in relation to the honourable member for the Northern Territory by referring to contributions made by other colleagues because I would not want it to be thought that the statements made by him are motivated by some short term, head kicking, party political agenda. The honourable member is deeply committed not only to his electorate but also to the Aboriginal education policy. I do not think I am betraying a confidence by saying that his persistent representations to me on that policy and the need for it to work effectively occupy a vast amount of</PARA>
<PARA>my ministerial staff's time. I know his sentiments were deeply felt. I believe, frankly, that they reflect some very real concerns which we ought to have about Aboriginal education in the Northern Territory. Having said that, it is not my intention to use this occasion to pursue those matters; that remains to be done at another time and place. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the main, I welcomed the contribution made by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). I would take this opportunity, however, to highlight to him--as the honourable member for Kennedy did--that the reconciliation initiative that the Commonwealth Parliament has unanimously committed itself to certainly does have as one of its major objectives the education of non-Aboriginal Australians about Aboriginal history, culture, dispossession, the nature of the disadvantage which Aboriginal people continue to experience, and the need to address that disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the honourable member for Kennedy said, that is not about a guilt trip. Both the honourable member for Chisholm and I have repeatedly emphasised that, but it is important that, as a nation, we come to terms honestly with our own history. We ought not to be afraid to learn about aspects of Australian history that perhaps do not reflect particularly well on the times, even taking into consideration, as the honourable member for La Trobe said, the social and political circumstances existing at that time. It is important that those matters be seriously addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The issue of rewriting textbooks was raised by the honourable member for La Trobe and, at the risk of repeating excessively a matter that I have raised elsewhere, let me say that in some cases school textbooks and other textbooks do have to be rewritten because they do not portray Aboriginal Australia in anything like an accurate way. They are simply not good history books. I think that view has been endorsed by many eminent Australian historians, not the least of whom was the late Professor Manning Clark. </PARA>
<PARA>  Turning to the contribution made by the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), I endorse virtually all of his contribution. I was particularly heartened by his concluding remarks about the Aboriginal education policy and his endorsement of the principles underlying that policy. However, I should not let pass his comments in relation to Coronation Hill and Aboriginal heritage issues. Although they were only brief comments, let me briefly say in reply that Aboriginal heritage issues are extremely difficult and sensitive political matters. All I would ask is that honourable members of this House from all sides pay due regard to Aboriginal heritage and spiritual values and give them no lesser respect than would be accorded to the deeply held beliefs of any other Australian who practises a faith or holds spiritual beliefs in relation to what are commonly regarded as non-Aboriginal religious philosophies. That question of respect is one that needs to be continually emphasised. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not believe there are any other matters that I have not addressed. Let me conclude by saying that I welcome the constructive and measured contributions made by honourable members from both sides of the House. I again make the point that the Aboriginal education policy is for the long haul. We have got to ensure continuing commitment not only by the national Government but also by State and Territory governments because it is absolutely true that addressing Aboriginal education disadvantage is one of the key prerequisites for an effective process of reconciliation. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Members of this House will not be surprised to know that there are various estimates which purport to represent the size of the so-called black economy. For example, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition believes that the size of the black economy in August of this year was $20 billion. In August he agreed with the Leader of the National Party who said, on 25 July:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The black economy, or cash economy, has now reached some $20 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>But in the same month, in August, the shadow Treasurer doubled his estimate. On 29 August the honourable member for Flinders said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, there's about $40 billion, we reckon.</PARA>
<PARA>Who reckons?  The honourable member for Farrer or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition?  He went on, amazingly, and said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think that's a pretty conservative figure.</PARA>
<PARA>Against what?  Strangely, also in August--a very strange month--Senator Margaret Reid was published as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>By definition, the size of the black economy is unknown.</PARA>
<PARA>If I am going to be forced to chose between these various sources on the grounds of veracity and reliability, members of this House will not be surprised to know that I am going to back Senator Reid because Senator Reid, as the Opposition Whip in the Senate, has demonstrated time and time again her uncanny arithmetical skills and we know that she can add two and two together.</PARA>
<PARA>  What has characterised this Government has been our absolute determination--translated into concrete policy action--to reclaim the Australian taxation system from the corporate creatures of the night. We resolved that we would reclaim the Australian taxation system for the Australian people from the commercial gipsies, tramps and thieves who were running it when the honourable members for Bennelong and Wentworth admittedly had some little responsibility for the tax system's operation.</PARA>
<PARA>  I will go through some of the reforms which this Government has put in place to ensure that we have a fairer, more efficient tax system. We introduced the capital gains tax, opposed by the Opposition, which still opposes it. We introduced the fringe benefits tax, opposed by the Opposition. We abolished the entertainment expenses as a tax deduction, opposed by the Opposition. We introduced the resource rent tax, opposed by the Opposition in 1987. We introduced dividend imputation, we taxed foreign income and we wiped out all the shelters. We put in substantiation requirements and the reforms to the prescribed payments system, we increased audit activity by the Tax Office and introduced the tax file number. These reforms have all acted to reduce evasion.</PARA>
<PARA>  Nearly every time these reforms were introduced, they were opposed by the Opposition. All this hard work by the Government has made the taxation system tighter, fairer and more equitable. Some figures have come out quite recently that show that total tax revenue as a proportion of GDP in Australia is now the second lowest in the OECD.</PARA>
<PARA>  I challenge the Leader of the Opposition in his speech to the Press Club on 25 September to identify how the Opposition would preserve the integrity of the taxation system, given its appalling track record and its commitment to a manifestly unfair and inefficient alternative package. The Leader of the Opposition will not because he cannot.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As I said a moment ago, this Government has cleaned up the tax system. In these last eight years the Opposition has been prepared only to oppose, to reject and to battle our attempts to make the tax system fairer and more efficient. I can assure this House of the Government's absolute commitment to an efficient tax administration and a progressive, fair and efficient taxation system--and our record proves it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Our hard work has cleaned out the taxation carpetbaggers who previously regarded paying tax as optional. I pick up the honourable gentleman's question because honourable members of this House will therefore be profoundly disturbed--or, more accurately, some members of this House will be profoundly disturbed--to learn that the tax minimisation industry is planning a comeback.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am aware of the seminar to which the honourable member refers. The covering letter is headlined `How to Minimise the Impact of a Consumption Tax'. It represents the worst type of get rich quick opportunism. It also represents a fundamental attack on the specious claims of the Opposition that a consumption tax would have those in the undefined black economy pay their share. I will read part of this covering letter to the House. It says that this seminar:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . will teach you how to minimise your tax liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>  This seminar . . . will prevent the administrative nightmare that a consumption tax will cause.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading `Have you considered how purchasing patterns will change?' it says:</PARA>
<PARA>  Companies and consumers will alter their buying habits. They will delay the purchase of goods whose prices will fall and speed up the purchase of goods and services whose prices will rise. You need to know what these effects will be, so that you can anticipate the needs of your market.</PARA>
<PARA>This means a dead weight loss. It is like the Libs carrying the Nats--a dead weight loss. The letter says that there will be an impressive array of speakers, including Sir Roger Douglas and others. Let us look at some of the topics: `Selling the benefits to business--how?; The costs of compliance (and the hidden costs); Avoiding an administrative nightmare; Anticipating market response to a price hike; and Overcoming customer resistance to your new prices' and--here is the best of the lot--`Reducing your exposure to a new consumption tax'. The boy from Bennelong will be back in business.</PARA>
<PARA>  As I said before to this House, under this Government Australians can be reassured that economic growth will not result because of a boom in tax avoidance and tax evasion. Sadly, that is not the case with the Opposition. I conclude with the words of Mr Neil Warren, senior lecturer in economics at the University of New South Wales:</PARA>
<PARA>A broad-based consumption tax should not be argued as a way to tax personal income tax avoiders and evaders--this is too tenuous.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the challenge for the Leader of the Opposition on 25 September--he will not face open press meetings but he is going to the National Press Club--is to answer how he will keep the carpetbaggers at bay. I will give the answer now: he will not, because he cannot.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I can assure the honourable gentlemen opposite that that is totally within the code of conduct. The basic point and thrust of the new federalism is that we live today in a society which is governed by a constitution drawn up 100 years ago by six reluctant colonies which knew that they had to come together because there were certain things that were required to be done that they were not able to do. They very reluctantly gave a number of powers to a new federation and kept as much as they could for themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I think the men--they were men; there were no women involved in those three constitutional conventions--did an honourable job. But they obviously were not able at that time, in the last decade of the nineteenth century, to put together a constitutional instrument which is entirely appropriate for the needs of an Australia in the last decade of the twentieth century and in a world which is so entirely different from that in which the Constitution was finally accepted in 1898.</PARA>
<PARA>  We have a position where there is a division of responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the States in a range of matters of very considerable importance to the citizens of this country--not only to the Commonwealth and the States, and I know this will be of interest to the honourable gentleman, but also, very importantly, to that tier of government which is too often overlooked, local government. Local government in a daily sense is always involved in providing services to the people of this country.</PARA>
<PARA>  My concept in the new federalism of calling the people together--the States and local government in the Special Premiers Conference--was to see constructively together whether there are ways in which we may be able to deliver cooperatively services and structure our financial relationships which will serve people better, without seeking to say, `This is a Commonwealth right, that is a State right, that is a local government right'. The only rights in the end that matter to me are the rights of the people of Australia and how can we best together deliver those rights.</PARA>
<PARA>   It is obviously the fact, as the honourable gentleman would know from his own extensive experience in the other levels of government, that there are areas of duplication and that if we sensibly talk together about how we may be able to get one area of government to do more than it is now, so one area hands over part of its responsibilities, it is very likely that services will be better delivered. Incidentally--but it is only an incidental objective of what I am about-- there may be some savings involved. But this is not a savings exercise. This is an exercise to deliver services better to the people of this country. That is what the conference has been about. Fortunately, of course, we already have so many runs on the board.</PARA>
<PARA>  I ask the honourable gentleman to recall what came out of the July Special Premiers Conference. We have the position now, as a result of this constructive approach, that when we meet a lot of preliminary work has already been done by our officials. We now have a National Rail Corporation. What is that going to mean? It is going to mean that for the first time in the history of this federation we can go and book some freight on a rail service on one side of Australia and have it sent to the other. We have never been able to do that before. We are going to have a national road commission, so that for the first time we are going to be----</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I hope the honourable member for North Sydney will not object to my saying this, but I discern from his demeanour that he is interested in my response. Without, of course, going to all the details of what has already been achieved, one of the problems we have in this country concerning environmental issues is this: there is a real concern at all levels of government about the environment. I do not say that we have a monopoly of concern about issues of the environment. There are concerns at the State government level, and the States feel that they have a responsibility to exercise powers to protect the environment for future generations. In their way, of course, so do local governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We are about seeing whether, as a result of discussions with the States and local government, we can get a greater degree of coordination in our approach so that those who are concerned with making decisions involving environmental considerations are hopefully not going to be faced with a situation where they have to deal with the Commonwealth, State and local governments. It would be much better if, through our cooperative discussion, we can have a situation where there is a degree of coordination.</PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, I say to the honourable member that the way we are doing that is this: we agreed at the meeting in July and recognised the fact that there were these nine groups meeting under the environmentally sustainable development process, or ESD--the States, the Commonwealth, the environmentalists, the mineral groups and the forestry groups. They are going to be giving their reports during the latter part of this year. We will not have time at the Special Premiers Conference in November finally to put our position following consideration of their reports, so we have agreed that we will get their reports, look at those matters raised and then have another Special Premiers Conference in the early part of next year, with the laudable, honourable objective of reaching a position where we can have an agreement which does not, from our point of view, involve any abrogation of the responsibilities that we feel we must discharge as a Commonwealth for protecting the environment but enables us to cooperate with the States, fully able to, and conscious that we will, discharge our own responsibilities to put in place a cooperative regime which will be better for everyone in this country--those concerned with development and those concerned with the environment.

There has been reference to this classic reply before, but in this context it should be stated again. When asked whether he would provide a guarantee that the rate would not increase, his answer--the classic answer--was, `No, I am saying that we will tell people in advance and give them the choice as to how they will vote one way or the other; I mean, obviously, you know, the future is the future; there are always things beyond our control'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. Is the Minister aware of claims that the abolition of the existing wholesale sales tax and the introduction of a value added type of tax would be of benefit to both Telecom Australia and Australian telephone users? Will the Minister explain how such a tax charge would affect Telecom and telephone users?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1110" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Previously in this House and over the weekend in a note written in the Forbes Advocate by one of the Opposition's members, the honourable member for Parkes, the Opposition has suggested that the abolition of the wholesale sales tax on Telecom would liberate $375m, which could then be made available to the general public through something like a $50 saving on their annual telephone bill. Indeed, when the Opposition went through the consumption tax issue across the board, it made great play of the fact that there is a trade-off for a reduction in the wholesale sales tax and an elimination of the tax in some areas in the process of introducing the consumption tax. When I had the opportunity to read the propositions put forward by the honourable member for Parkes, the real situation was more clearly outlined. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Under the coalition's tax reform proposals, including a goods and services tax, all the GST paid by Telecom on capital equipment purchases will be rebatable. That is, Telecom will get effectively a $375m boost to its capital equipment program.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what I said when I answered a question on this matter in the House the other week. Telecom's management will have available to it any particular course of action it so chooses in regard to dealing with that $375m. It is not obliged to pass it on to the consumer if it obtains that money. It may indeed choose to use it in exactly the way the honourable member for Parkes suggested that it should, that is, by putting it into its capital works program. Of course, all sorts of other implications are raised by that, because Telecom does not operate in an isolated financial environment. Even though the Opposition has said that it will privatise Telecom, it would be some years before Telecom were privatised to the point where it was off the public sector borrowing requirement. In all likelihood, the Opposition of the day--having seen that $375m go to Telecom--would choose simply to take it off Telecom's borrowings that year as its borrowings basically tend to go to its capital equipment program. What would result would be no savings for those people who are Telecom's subscribers and, in the end, no benefit for Telecom's capital works program.</PARA>
<PARA>  Having taken that $375m aside, the imposition of the consumption tax at a rate of 15 per cent has several effects. It has the effect of a $1.3 billion tax on Telecom's users. So far I have been using the $1.3 billion exclusively from Telecom, but sorrowfully over the last couple of weeks I have neglected to inform the House what it would mean for OTC. A VAT could conceivably collect an additional $225m from OTC. If the two figures are combined, we are talking about a $1.5 billion collection, at a rate of 15 per cent, from the Telecom user. As opposed to the $50 that would come off the bill of the average telephone user, this would add at least $205 per year to each subscriber's telephone bill--and that would be a modest estimate.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the end we do not know at what rate a consumption tax would be set, so in answering the honourable member's question I am unable to advise him fully as to what the implications would be. However, we do know what some of the Opposition's Liberal colleagues think it might be. An interesting interview on the John Laws program was held with Dr Metherell. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>And Eric Risstrom said last night, and no-one disputed it, that the tax--I think it is in Sweden--is now up to 25 or 27% on goods and services having started down at 1 or 2%. And I know from somebody coming back from Italy walked into my office yesterday and said to me that the GST or VAT, its equivalent in Europe. . . in Italy is now up to 19%. So, you know, I suppose the big doubt in my mind is the will that politicians of all political parties have to reduce government expenditure if they have in their pocket a new tax that allows them to actually increase taxation--that's my real doubt.</PARA>
<PARA>May well he have those doubts, because that is exactly what the agenda of the Opposition is. Nobody in this country can now seriously believe--and nobody does seriously believe--that the last word on the consumption tax will be the rate at which it is released by the Opposition when it eventually gets around to doing it sometime between now and Christmas. Sometime between now and Christmas the Opposition will produce a number. The number will be interesting and it will be capable of analysis, but the number will be merely that--a number--because what lies behind it is an ongoing intention by the Opposition to keep ramping up that tax. It is a launching pad for a massive take from ordinary Australians to benefit the wealthy members of this community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. In light of today's release of the Australian Bureau of Statistics dwelling commencement figures for the June quarter, which showed that the housing industry has indeed moved into recovery, can the Minister inform the House of the developments to further promote the objective of providing more affordable housing?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1112" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; HEALTH, HOUSING AND COMMUNITY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for her question, which concerned statistics released this morning by the ABS confirming that the housing recovery is under way and that commencements in the quarter have increased by 2.4 per cent over the March quarter. I might also note in passing that included in those figures was an increase in medium density housing in particular. Although this is an early figure, it is certainly consistent with the need that must be recognised to restructure the housing industry in this country, putting greater emphasis on medium density housing and providing a greater choice of housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Clearly, if we are going to be able to come out of the recession in terms of not only a strong recovery but also more affordable housing, it is important that the Commonwealth, together with the States and, importantly, local government, develop strategies that not only enable us to make housing more affordable and more accessible but also contribute to the task of building in this country cities which are more accessible and which display more equity.</PARA>
<PARA>  I refer to the latest evidence about housing recovery which is on track with the forecast of the Indicative Planning Council. Of course, against that we need to take account of the fact that the Opposition has made, during a very difficult period in housing, very little contribution to any serious policy debate. We have heard virtually nothing from the Opposition about partnership with the States or restructuring of the housing industry. Of course, we have heard something about the Opposition's taxation policies, the details of which still need to be announced. We know that a goods and services tax would have quite an impact on home purchase--indeed, pushing the costs of both purchase and renting through the roof.</PARA>
<PARA>  A 15 per cent tax--or would it be a 22 per cent tax?--on materials would push home purchase out of the reach of many families. It would erode savings and prolong the wait for many others. The tax would add to the already substantial costs of transacting home purchase. A 15 per cent tax would need to be added to bank loan charges, to agents' fees, to conveyancing costs, to stamp duties and to removal costs. This obscenity is illustrated by the comparison between the outcome of a prospective home buyer and the prospective buyer of a luxury car. On the equivalent price of a modest home or a Mercedes or BMW, say $100,000, the family seeking its new home would have to pay $115,000, not $100,000, while the luxury car buyer would pay only $85,000.</PARA>
<PARA>  That is an example of tory, conservative, equity. On the one hand, we make luxury vehicles more affordable and cheaper. On the other hand, effectively, we say to the new home buyer, `Let's make that more expensive'. Interestingly enough, some conservative politicians who are moving around the electorate are beginning to be asked the sorts of very specific questions that we are expecting the Leader of the Opposition to be able to answer. We have already heard one reference to Dr Metherell, who is taking the opportunity now to get back to the grassroots and talk to people. He is finding that people are asking some very interesting questions.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the interview referred to earlier he was asked about the difference between established and new houses. It was a question which he did not know the answer to, so he approached Senator Bronwyn Bishop. Senator Bishop was able, apparently, to satisfy Dr Metherell with an answer. As he said, she tried to give him an open and an honest answer. The answer that she was able to provide, although these details are not yet clear, was that if one was buying an established house there would be no 15 per cent, as in New Zealand, but for a new house the 15 per cent would apply.</PARA>
<PARA>  Extraordinarily, for Dr Metherell, now back in contact with his electorate, that raises a question of equity. I just conclude by quoting from Dr Metherell. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Now, O.K., that may answer the question but it raises a new question in my mind: how do I say to a young family going out to western Sydney, `You're going to pay a 15 per cent tax on a new house out there and if I sold a house in Frenchs Forest that's an established house, I don't pay the tax'.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Metherell continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Now that doesn't seem to me very equitable and very reasonable as a political proposition put to young families in western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the difference between the Government and the Opposition. In terms of Government housing policy, we are about making housing more affordable and more acceptable and we are about dealing with the problems of access in cities and responding to the needs of people. If people contrast our policy with that of the Opposition, whether it is in terms of BMWs over and against new houses or whether it is in terms of disability payments over and against certain types of luxury car, they will make a choice; they will have to live with that choice.</PARA>

The thrust of the articles is that there is competition and a lack of cooperation between the welfare agencies in Ipswich which is resulting in conflict and inefficiency. The welfare agencies the paper speaks about are places such as nursing homes, Skillshare units and any non-government agency.</PARA></TALK.START>

I want to reassure the Minister and the House that I was extensively quoting the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) when he made those remarks as Treasurer between June 1985 and August 1985.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- There is no doubt that what this country needs is growth, investment and jobs--things that this Government has not provided for a long time. There is no doubt that the country needs to go back to the business of creating wealth--new wealth created by new mines, new industry, new industrial relations arrangements and sensible cost saving proceedings at every level of Australian business and at every level of Australian life. Until we have made the changes that are necessary, we will not get a new sense of direction and excitement in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Not long ago at a lunch in Hobart the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), when addressing a business group and discussing the subject of Coronation Hill, said:</PARA>
<PARA>When Aboriginal people take a view that it would be sacrilegious desecration of a sacred site to proceed, they are entitled to have that taken as determining the issue. . . When it is a matter of whether something should proceed, that is only one amongst a number of issues. </PARA>
<PARA>In effect, he said that if Aboriginal people take the view that it would be sacrilegious desecration to proceed, that was the preclusive determinant. The Prime Minister is saying that it does not matter what venture one had in mind, whether it be mining, forestry, pulp mills, perhaps even farming--or will that be part of a `better farming' program in the future--and no matter whether that venture would produce more wealth, jobs or vitally needed investor confidence for future ventures, which we are so short of in this country, a group of Australians will have exclusive autonomy over a decision concerning development in Australia if they judge that they should have it. In this case he was talking about 300 Australians having exclusive autonomy if they judge that they should have it. That is what he said in Hobart on 26 June, so we can only assume that that is what he meant. We can imagine how much excitement that produced amongst those lunch guests. </PARA>
<PARA>  Can it possibly be true that the other Government members believe this? Do they believe all this nonsense? We know that the Prime Minister had submerged a Cabinet decision on the subject of Coronation Hill; but do Government members really support the view that a small group of Australians should have the preclusive determination of an investment of $2 billion or more?  I do not. Where, we might ask, are those staunch defenders of human rights, the rights of the human race in this country--the press, which always leaves the gallery during these debates on MPIs--whilst the Prime Minister has lost his senses? There has not been much commentary on this sad state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that the beliefs of the Jawoyn tribe, Christians or any other religious group should be respected, but not to the exclusion of all else. To ask us to swallow that this self- confessed agnostic who sits on the other side of the table really believes that he has embraced the spirit of Bula with Shi-ite fervour is just too much. In fact, if we say those two words together quickly enough, we will get a much closer approximation of what I think of the Prime Minister's latter-day conversion. If Government members do not think so, they are letting down this country, because it is a damn lot of nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA>  Combine this with the conservation--or should I say `preservation'--lobby and some of the bureaucratic delays that we have been having in this country for many a year now, and we can quite quickly arrive at a figure of $15 billion of investment not undertaken or delayed or locked up. Fifteen billion dollars is quite a lot of money. The investment that has not been undertaken must be much more than that because of the atmosphere of despair amongst those who wish to develop this country. That $15 billion worth of investment has been impounded or locked up. Looking at some of those investments, we see that in one case we had an investment of over $2 billion, seven investments of over $1 billion and 20- odd investments that add up to that sort of figure. </PARA>
<PARA>  I spend a little of my spare time--what little spare time we have--on wetlands and reafforestation projects; some of them commercial but not very successful. But that coalition of interests called Aboriginal rights and preservationists' whim simply has gone too far in this country. Altogether that combination has cost us at least $15 billion in investment; therefore, jobs directly employing tens of thousands of people have been opposed or delayed and, in some cases, simply shut down. So we have forgone the resultant $3 billion of income that Australians would have received from that--or, at a local level, $300 of household income per annum--let alone the indirect wealth it would have created.</PARA>
<PARA>  The second much talked about area is the cost of failing to implement reforms on the waterfront, in rail, in post and telecommunications, in assistance--although it is just starting--and the failure to contract out government services. What are the costs of being so uncompetitive?  The costs of not being competitive, as identified by the Industry Commission, include: transport, $6.7 billion; rail, $4 billion; post and telecommunications, $1.7 billion; contracting out not done by this Government, $3.4 billion; assistance reform not carried out by this Government, $3.7 billion; and electricity not done by this Government, $1.4 billion. If we had reformed our waterworks, as the Prime Minister had done not long ago, we could have saved another $1 billion. That alone would have provided a 7 per cent reduction in the level of prices in this country--in other words, in inflation--and produced thousands of extra jobs. The equation comes out at another $2,300 per household. Our running total is now $2,600 per household, per annum, income forgone. We then have to add the great cost of the accord--yes, the cost of the accord--because we can measure that cost these days. But before we measure that cost, I think we ought to look at somebody else's view of this tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have in my hand a document produced by Peter Hartley and Michael Porter of the Tasman Institute. They have called the article, `Treasurer Keating's Legacy.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Gap!  Where is his gap?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HT4">Mr McLACHLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The gap is coming in just a minute. There are several gaps to which I will refer. Let me repeat what they said about this legacy in the article in which they describe the Keating gap:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>At the end of the day, it is Keating's adherence to the Accord that must be held accountable for much of the unfinished business in micro-economic reform. The Accord is the classic example of Keating's deal-making, of centralism, of excluding individuals and groups of individuals from negotiating the terms of their own agreements to trade. </PARA>
<PARA>There is another comment:</PARA>
<PARA>The Accord gave the ACTU an effective veto over micro-economic reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>The third comment reads:</PARA>
<PARA>In the end, these deals also destroy many opportunities for growth in productive employment, opportunities and real wages. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what these gentlemen said. They also said that the accord, implemented with the ACTU, had provided those tragic results. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is incredible to think that just this week people associated with the ACTU who have been part of that accord, part of that disaster and part of that dereliction of duty to this country are now calling for pump-priming exercises. They are waiting at the pump to have it primed. They were sitting at a conference bemoaning the fact that unemployment is ravaging the country, and they caused a lot of it. They did that, and this Government did that, in that reactionary process. The fact of the matter is that this Government has become a reactionary government--a government of no ideas, no investment and no jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wonder whether people in this Government really think that the Business Council of Australia was wrong when it stated that there was another $20 billion to be picked up by making the labour market competitive. I have never heard one member of the Government refer to that figure. I have never heard anybody analyse it, say it was right, or say it was wrong. All I have heard is that the Government is far enough along the way towards arranging its industrial relations changes to the procedures that already exist so that the reforms will take place. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those reforms will not take place, and they are not taking place. Let me add them up: $22 billion for micro-economic reform; $14 billion for debt liabilities; $21 billion for industrial relations inefficiencies; $4 billion for the GST--it will be possible to pick up $4 billion if the Government wants to have a GST; and $3 billion for lost investment. The total is $64 billion in lost opportunities, minimum. That is $6,500 per household or 150,000 direct jobs not provided by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  Who causes all of this?  The Prime Minister, whose gap in logic is such that he can perpetrate the Bula nonsense and whose memory gap is such that he can perpetuate the quiet myth that corporate profits and profit share have been higher under Labor than at any other time, causes all of this. This assertion is not true; in fact, in gross operating services the share is higher. When company tax is added, it is still quite high; but when interest rates are added, it is on the way to rock bottom. That is the secret underlying Australia's economic disaster. It is, in fact, the Keating gap, as described in the document to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not memory failure about telephone calls to and from Mr Robert Holmes a Court; nor is it the gap between 44 and 66. It is the gap in inflation costs between us and the rest of the world between 1984 and 1990, and it consequentially becomes the gap in interest rates between us and the rest of the world. The inflation rates in the document are shown in orange and they are changing to red. If we examine what has really happened, we see that we have finished up with an enormous excess in interest rates which has devastated this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  Consequentially, it is the gap between our interest rates and those of the rest of the world that has broken half a nation and sent the other half reeling. This is the gap that has caused the Reserve Bank to say that Australia has $29 billion in non-performing debt, which is a fraction over the level of shareholders' funds; this is the gap that will cause much of that debt to be written off; this is the gap that has broken 100,000 businesses in the last 12 months, which will soon result in a million people being out of work. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are billions of dollars of investment opportunities out there for the taking. Investors are waiting for the right signals; they are waiting for people to make the types of decisions that will get them excited again--the types of decisions that they can trust; and they are waiting for the types of decisions that will give them the idea that whatever arrangements they make with a government, either at the State level or federally, will stick. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are even more billions of dollars waiting not only for future investment but to be saved and thus reinvested in the new wealth creating activity that I have just described. Is it $60 billion, or is it much more than that?  My guess is that the amount is much more than that. It is true that, if we give this country a chance, we will find out whether it is $60 billion or more than that. If the Government is not going to ring the changes, then the Opposition will. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-During Question Time today, evidence was given to show that the recovery process is well and truly under way. Without doubt, Australia is emerging from the recession. We are emerging in better shape because the macro-economic settings are right. Fiscal policy is structurally correct, and it has been clear in relation to wages policy that the accord has been essential in producing the current low levels of inflation. Inflation is presently running at record low levels--a fact that the Opposition never likes to acknowledge; nevertheless, it is true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In regard to monetary policy, I point out that interest rates are now down by 8.5 percentage points since their peak. Unemployment is this Government's major concern--of course it is, because by and large our people are suffering. As the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) has indicated, unemployment levels will always lag, but the numbers of unemployed will certainly come down and employment opportunities will grow in a sustainable way. </PARA>
<PARA>  We occasionally see members of the Opposition cry crocodile tears for the unemployed. One might well ask: what exactly does the Opposition have in mind for unemployed people?  It wants to chop the dole after nine months. Its cuts would undoubtedly lead to the destruction of labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us have a closer look at some of the Opposition's proposals. This matter of public importance calls for a non-inflationary strategy. What does that mean?  Are members of the Opposition talking about zero inflation?  If they are, how do they intend to achieve it?  Are they going to achieve it through monetary policy?  If they are, then interest rates will be higher for longer than they have ever been before. It should be remembered that this matter of public importance has been brought on by an Opposition that has opposed every drop in interest rates, including the most recent one. There is no doubt that this Opposition wants interest rates higher and that it wants them higher for longer. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look now at fiscal policy. Once upon a time, the Opposition had a policy to cut $3 billion off government expenditure. It has even said that the last Budget could have been balanced. That would have resulted in cuts of $4.7 billion. We are entitled to ask from this side of the House and from the wider community: where exactly would these cuts come from? They can only come from where the Opposition has flagged privatisation--privatisation of  social security,  to begin with. And how high would interest rates have to go with its 15 per cent to 22 per cent GST?</PARA>
<PARA>  Quite frankly, if one looks at the Opposition's policies, one sees regression running right through them: the consumption tax; the abolition of company tax; the abolition of the capital gains tax; the levying of income tax</PARA>
<PARA>by the States, for heaven's sake; zero wage increases, and that zero inflation target to be brought about by that draconian monetary policy, by education vouchers and by health vouchers; and no lump sums for workers until they are aged 65. That $4.7 billion cut in government spending will be levied mainly on the weak and the defenceless in the community. No Opposition in my time in parliament has ever campaigned on a more regressive policy than that. </PARA>
<PARA>  Returning briefly to the Opposition's GST--it will add to inflation, on some counts, by around 7 per cent. This is coming from an Opposition whose representative today is calling for a non-inflationary strategy. A GST will add to inflation and will not wash out of the system. Some proponents on the Opposition side have argued that a GST will boost national savings and thereby provide additional funds for investment. There is no proof for the claim that a GST will add to savings and release funds for investment. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which provides the evidence for that statement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The table shows net household savings as a percentage of disposable income for the OECD countries. The evidence from the examination of trends in saving ratios in other OECD countries, many of which have consumption taxes, shows no correlation between tax mix and savings. If one conducts a horizontal analysis--that is, examining one country over time, measuring savings ratios before and after the introduction of a consumption tax--no pattern of increase can be discerned. Alternatively, a vertical analysis-- that is, examining different countries with different tax mixes during a fixed period--also shows no evidence to support the hypothesis that a consumption tax increases savings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Looking at most of those countries, it is obvious that since the early 1970s there has been a downward trend in savings. The trend has been just as marked in countries which have had consumption taxes for the whole period. Sweden, for example, introduced a consumption tax in 1969. In 1974, it had net household savings of 5 per cent, but by 1990 that ratio was minus 0.2 per cent. Italy introduced its tax in 1973. Gross household savings in that country went from 26.3 per cent in 1974 to 15.1 per cent in 1990. So much for the argument that a GST will add to savings and so boost investment!</PARA>
<PARA>  As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said today, there are many people in the Opposition parties who are running from the idea of a GST at 100 miles an hour--or perhaps that should be 122 1/2 miles an hour. Certainly, the Nationals are in Western Australia; certainly the Nationals are in Queensland; certainly Wal Murray is in New South Wales--and a consumption tax is about the only thing that could get the Deputy Premier of New South Wales running, I can tell you. That tax expert from the New South Wales Opposition, Dr Terry Metherell, hates a consumption tax, and this is one instance of course in which he is right. </PARA>

<PARA>is a Budget which reinforces the Government's overall economic strategy of ensuring that the recovery in prospect in the short-term is converted into sustained medium-term growth . . . the fundamental objective of economic policy is to achieve strong but sustainable economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA>We want to build on the gains that have been made. We want to lock in recent gains which have been made against inflation; we want to reduce the current account deficit with a view to stabilising our external debt relative to GDP; and we want to promote sustainable reductions in the level of unemployment. Government policy is directed towards those ends of promoting a sustainable recovery in a non-inflationary environment because, with lower inflation, we should see better quality investment and we should see more of it. </PARA>
<PARA>  It would be foolish to attempt to attain these goals at the cost of an economic scorched earth policy, which, in many respects, is what the Opposition would seek to do. Those in our community who are least able to protect themselves would suffer most. The Treasurer is right when he says that achieving these goals requires a balance in economic policy. In the short term, our objective is to manage the recovery carefully. We need to coordinate those main arms of macro-economic policy to which I referred--fiscal, monetary and wages policy--so that the appropriate degree of stimulus can be delivered at the appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our balanced approach contrasts with that of our political opponents, who say that in the 1991-92 Budget there should have been no deficit. Apparently, they believe, and persist in the belief, that those outlays could have been cut by another $4.7 billion. As I mentioned earlier, I wonder where those cuts would have fallen? Who would have paid for them? Would it have been the pensioners? Would it have been the sick? It certainly would have been the unemployed, Aborigines, families and single parents. What an impact on the economy that would have made. In fact, such a prescription shows a remarkable disregard for the aspirations of ordinary Australians, with whom the honourable member for Barker mixes so infrequently. According to those economic models which the Opposition itself relies on, such a policy prescription would involve significant additional job losses--possibly up to 50,000 in the coming year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Barker has referred to the Government's policies by the descriptive term `anti-investment policies'. Let me go briefly to the recent history of investment in Australia. Private business investment as a share of our GDP reached record levels in the year 1989-90, when it was 13.2 per cent, compared with a long term average of 11.2 per cent, reflecting strong growth in both the traded and the non-traded sector investment since 1983-84, the year in which we came to office. Honourable members opposite should study Budget chart No. 4, which looks at investment performance since the early 1950s, before making too many comparisons with the past. </PARA>
<PARA>  Why has this investment occurred? I refer to some underlying reasons. There have been strong average growth rates over the second part of the 1980s, originally driven by domestic demand, and now we expect to be driven by export growth. Increasingly over those years, the profit share of GDP has increased, and also over those years we have experienced falling real unit labour costs, down by 10 per cent since the mid-1980s. There has been a greater recognised need for business to improve its competitiveness as tariffs have come down. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer briefly in the time I have remaining to an investment update. If the performance has been so bad, I would be interested in the comments of the supporting Opposition speaker on some of these examples of investments made recently or planned. In the food processing area we have: at Blayney in the central west of New South Wales a $25m investment by Nestle in a pet food plant; in Wodonga, Uncle Ben's pet food plant, a $130m investment; Kellogg at Botany, an investment of over $30m; and at Manildra, again in New South Wales, an investment of $40m. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the pulp and paper industry we have: Pratt Group's VisyBoard plant in Melbourne, an investment of $100m; tissue paper plants by Kimberly-Clark, an investment of $100m; and by Bowater in Victoria of $100m. In the chemicals industry: ICI has invested $100m in a polyethylene plant at Botany; Shell has an investment in its polypropylene plant at Clyde of $170m; and Altona Petro-Chemicals has investments in ethylene and polyethylene plants of $150m. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the area of basic metals, BHP has raw steel expansion plans worth $1.15 billion. As an example, there has been a $200m investment in a continuous caster at Whyalla. We have Alcoa's expansion to its alumina refinery in Western Australia worth $300m. There was Toyota's announcement in July of its decision to build a new car manufacturing plant at Altona in Melbourne. I refer to the portfolio Minister's press release of April 1991 expressing delight--well might he express delight--at the decision by the Boeing aeroplane company to sign contracts worth an estimated $455m with two Australian aerospace companies. It is the largest single order ever placed by an overseas company with the Australian aerospace industry.  It was announced earlier this year that $600m would be spent on the expansion of the Tomago smelter in the Hunter region. There have been further investments in the motor vehicle industry as well. Pacific Dunlop has said it will be entering the food processing industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  In other words, our record throughout this difficult period in investment gives every reason for us to look towards the future with optimism to see that we will come out of this recession with sustained, non-inflationary growth. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I was interested to listen to the delivery of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free). I never cease to be fascinated by listening to honourable members from the Government side. If we took what they said at face value we would think the country was going well. I do not know whether they ever get on a plane to travel out of Canberra and go to places such as Victoria to walk up and down the main streets of country towns to see what is going on but, from listening to those opposite we would think the country was going well, for heaven's sake!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There was no hint of reality in the delivery of the previous speaker. He spent most of the first half of his speech talking about how bad a goods and services tax is going to be. Again, there was no mention that the sales tax that the Government has been administering has tripled in the time it has been in office. It has gone from about $3.5 billion to about $10.5 billion, though it would be marginally below that now as a result of the recession. But there has not been a cent of compensation to the poor. The honourable member talked about the regressive nature of this tax, but there has not been one cent of compensation to the poor from a tax that the Government has tripled in the short few years it has been in office. I advise the honourable member that the goods and services tax will at least be an honest, fair and equitable tax. There will be full compensation to those minority groups which are disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA>  I travelled to New Zealand recently and spent a week there talking to groups right across the political spectrum. I did not meet one person--whether it be from the left, the centre or the right, or whether they be poor, rich or whatever--who wanted to go back to the system they had before. </PARA>

But getting back to the state that Australia is in today, by almost any criteria which are applied Australia is in an absolute mess--a stagnant mess--which is not what it should be in. The degree and the depth of this mess is almost entirely of the Government's making. Australia, even by the Government's own admission, is in a recession. If one talked to lots of groups out there, one would find they are saying Australia is in a depression. I can attest that that is what they are saying out in the countryside.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister has a lot to learn. We have almost a disinvestment policy in this country today. I would invite the Minister or any honourable member of the Government--I do not know whether they do these things--to walk into a shopping centre, particularly in a country town, and stand for a while and have a look around. They should not be fooled by the facade of activity they might see. I invite them to look a little closer, to examine the empty shopfronts that are in the shopping centres now. It is quite frightening. They will see in almost every shopping centre signs for a closing down sale in at least one or two businesses. If they stroll into the businesses that are still operating and talk to the owners, they will be told about the distress of trying to meet wage deadlines or trying to service overdraft commitments and things like that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If honourable members then look around outside the shopping centres they will see the unemployed youth drifting around aimlessly. There are plenty of them to see because one in every three in this country who now wants a job cannot get one--an horrific figure. Over and above that we have a phenomenon in this country that we have not seen for over half a century: the unemployed in the over 40-year- old group. They will be wandering around too, faces almost as vacant as the shopfronts that I was talking about earlier. They are expressionless and shattered. These people are wondering what they are going to do. They are waiting for the next election when they can vote this Government out of office. We have almost a million people in this country unemployed today and probably half as many again underemployed, working 15 or 20 hours a week, when they would work 35, 40 or more hours a week if they had the chance. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's answer to all this is to spend more money in job creation programs, and this sort of nonsense. It does not seem to be able to grasp that these people will not be employed properly and for a long period of time unless they get a genuine job. Implementing the programs the Government is trying to put in place costs money. Where does that money come from? It comes from increasing taxes. Increasing taxes ultimately puts someone else out of a job. So we have got a million or more people around Australia today whose dignity is stripped away. It is a tragedy, especially because there is no need for so much of this. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sure, times are tough in the world and, sure, there is a flatness in commodity prices, but much of what we are experiencing today is of the Government's own making. The opportunities that this Government has let slip, the project applications that have been refused, and the sensible solutions which have been suggested but ignored are a millstone around this Government's neck. </PARA>
<PARA>  What other country would hinder, let alone ban, the starting up of such major projects as the Wesley Vale pulp mill in Tasmania, the Coronation Hill mineral project in the Northern Territory that the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) referred to, or the third runway development at Sydney Airport? Why would the Government want to stop these projects, for heaven's sake? It is done for blatant, political reasons, all to do with keeping the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his job. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Barker has referred to $15 billion of investment that has slipped away and to the fact that the Industry Commission has identified $22 billion in micro-reform savings which is out there just going begging. I refer to two or three of these projects--firstly, the pulp mill in Tasmania. That was put on hold and stopped purely to get the greenie preferences at the last election. It mattered not that this pulp mill would have been the cleanest in the world. It matters not, now, that we have to buy these products from overseas mills that are less environmentally friendly than this one would have been in Tasmania, and it matters not that this value adding opportunity has been let go, with hundreds of jobs sacrificed and with Tasmania put in a worse position than it would otherwise have been in. </PARA>
<PARA>  What about Coronation Hill? Hundreds of millions of dollars profit slipped by there. There was the loss of hundreds of jobs--many of them Aboriginal jobs. So much for the compassion that this Government talks about here every day about workers in remote areas and about Aborigines. There is this affected sincerity that it exudes all the time----</PARA>

Everyone who has looked at that project rationally agrees that it should be built and should have been built years ago. It would cut the noise down; it would be safer; it would be more convenient; it would expand the capacity of the airport; and it would get jobs and the economy going down in that area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have listened for 25 minutes to the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) speak about this MPI. During those 25 minutes they have managed to identify three things they would do. For all of those ills which they identify and claim exist within the country, they have three programs that will rectify the problems--mine Coronation Hill, put in the Wesley Vale pulp mill and build a third runway at Sydney Airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I wish to say a couple of things about that before I speak about the MPI. The building of the third runway is a decision that the Government has made and, in spite of the misgivings that some members on both sides of the House have, it will, in fact, proceed. So far as Coronation Hill and Wesley Vale are concerned I thought it interesting that the shadow Minister for the Environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) was not here because, with his renewed Green credentials of the last couple of days I would have welcomed his contribution to that debate. I look forward to his contribution the next opportunity he has in this place to tell us what his view is on those two matters. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to spend some time speaking about the MPI. When I read the MPI I found it very interesting. It is a collection of cliches that look as if they have been picked up at a jargon jumble sale and put together for the purposes of today's debate. Instead of talking around the issue, I want to address a couple of those items that do impinge upon employment and investment in this country--things like interest rates, Budget policy, industrial relations, industry policy and national savings. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wish to start with interest rates because that is timely. It is not that long ago that we saw a substantial one per cent fall in interest rates. In fact, over the last 18 months we have seen interest rates come down by 8 1/2 per cent. On nearly every occasion that interest rates fell, members of the Opposition, including the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the shadow Treasurer, have attacked the Government. On the most recent occasion, when interest rates fell by one per cent, they failed to endorse it and have attacked it as being a decision that was made without economic merit. </PARA>
<PARA>  They should come clean with the people of this country. They should come clean with the Parliament. They should be able to stand up in here and tell us what their policy is on interest rates. At the end of 1990 when we started to bring interest rates down they attacked us; in 1991 when we brought interest rates down they attacked us; and, last week, when interest rates came down, they attacked us again. Their policy is to maintain a high interest rate regime--to squeeze the people of Australia harder, tighter and for longer than this Government would ever contemplate and longer than the people of Australia could tolerate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Home loan interest rates are now well below the old fixed rate level. Home loan interest rates are now available at 12 1/2 per cent, which is a lower level than they have been for nigh on a decade. That is an achievement which all people in this place should welcome but there has not been one word of praise from the Opposition, only criticism and attack that interest rates have fallen.  In spite of the fact that those things have happened and in spite of the fact that the long term interest rate is now lower than it has been for more than a decade, those in the Opposition have a policy that would maintain higher interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us turn to the Budget because the Budget is a key vehicle through which the economy can be stimulated and jobs created. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) has already referred to the Opposition's position on this. The Opposition maintains a policy of a balanced Budget this year. Last year, when we had a budgeted surplus, that was not good enough. Opposition members did not want to balance the Budget--they did not even want to accept the surplus that we had. Last year they advocated a $3 billion cut over and above the surplus that we had budgeted for. </PARA>
<PARA>  This year the Government has budgeted for a $4.7 billion deficit. The Opposition is now saying that $4.7 billion deficit should not occur and that there should be a balanced Budget. There are only two ways to do that: either generate another $4.7 billion worth of revenue--and that means taxes; or cut expenditure.  Members of the Opposition have failed throughout the period since the Budget was delivered to identify which of those two courses they prefer and to set out clearly for the Australian people what its policy is. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us make no mistake about it, a $4.7 billion cut will hurt ordinary Australians--it will hurt the people who are unemployed and it will hurt the people who are now in employment. The sorts of initiatives that we have introduced in this Budget go to issues such as Austudy--creating greater opportunities for Australians, young and old, to enter and re- enter the education system; and the family allowance supplement, where thousands more families will be able to receive that benefit of government payment. They are the sorts of provisions that those opposite want to cut, yet they parade themselves as in some way endeavouring to stimulate the economy and provide some assistance to those in our community who need it most. </PARA>
<PARA>  The real test comes with employment. Twelve months ago when the Opposition was parading its policies of reducing government spending the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research estimated the effects that a $2.1 billion reduction in recurrent expenditure would have on various aspects of our economy. I want to refer, importantly, to the area of employment.  I remind the House that it is a $2.1 billion cut which these projections are based on. The people opposite want us to take out of the Budget more than twice that in the current year. </PARA>
<PARA>  Had there been a $2.1 billion cut in government outlays for recurrent expenditure in the financial year just ended, the Institute forecast that unemployment in 1992 would rise by an additional 60,000 people and by 1993 it would rise by  80,000 people. Those opposite want to double that figure this year. The policies of the people opposite in this place would, in fact, put on the unemployment list within two years an additional 120,000 to 160,000 Australians. Those are the policies which the Opposition has announced in other places. These are the estimates of independent research on Opposition policies, yet members of the Opposition have the gall to stand here in this place on a matter of public importance with a jumble of jargon and fail to substantiate it with any comment in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will turn to industry policy. I am glad that it was the honourable member for Barker who moved this MPI because on an  earlier occasion I had the opportunity to refer to this article. I am pleased he is here because it is an article that mentions him. One of the key areas of industry policy development over the last decade has been the vehicle industry. Recently, the honourable member for Barker was featured in an article in the Bulletin magazine that looked at the Opposition's policy affecting the vehicle industry. The Bulletin magazine article was headlined, `Libs pull the wheels off the car plan'. The article went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's car-makers are running scared of a coalition victory in the next federal election. </PARA>
<PARA>What is the reason?  It goes on to explain that the honourable member for Barker addressed a Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries meeting and told it about the savage cuts he would make in the future industry plan and protection plan that this Government has put in place which is known, gradual and accepted by the industry and the trades union movement alike. The honourable member for Barker went to a meeting of those employers and managed to frighten the wits out of them. They do not want him and they do not want his policies either. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at the question of the pool of funds in Australia. One of the difficulties we have as a nation is the size of our population, the size of our domestic market and, partly as a factor of that, the size of the pool of funds that are here onshore to invest. One of the initiatives that this Government has taken, which is designed primarily to improve the quality of life of Australian citizens in retirement, is to promote and establish superannuation schemes for all. This is not just for the elite, not just for public servants and not just for the high fliers in the private sector who can get non-contributory superannuation where they do not pay a cent and the employer pays the lot. It used to be a good tax dodge once upon a time; that loophole has been closed. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have introduced a process whereby all Australians, irrespective of where they work, can reasonably expect to benefit from a superannuation scheme. One of the benefits of that is that it will provide a substantial pool of funds onshore here in Australia to be invested in Australia's future. It is an initiative which we all should applaud, though those in the Opposition do not. In 1986, when award superannuation was first introduced to cover everybody, the Opposition and its employer friends opposed it and said it would wreck the economy and they could not afford it. Some five or six years on we have introduced a guarantee levy in the Budget to ensure that all Australians are covered. The Opposition has again opposed it, saying, `We support the idea in principle but not now'. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition's position on economic management has been discredited time and again in this place. When it comes clean with the Australian people and puts its policies before the public it will reap the consequences of those policies, which aim to assist the privileged in our society at the cost of ordinary Australian wage and salary earners. </PARA>

<PARA>  That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Stage 3 Development of RAAF Base, Tindal, Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>Following parliamentary approval in 1984, RAAF base Tindal was redeveloped as a home base for 75 Squadron and it has been re-equipped with Hornet aircraft. Stage 1 of the development provided essential facilities consisting of operational, technical support and domestic facilities, aircraft pavements and associated engineering services. Construction began in 1984 and critical facilities were completed in time for flying operations to begin in October 1988. This stage is now substantially complete at a cost of approximately $251m. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second stage of development received parliamentary approval in 1988 and consists of the replacement of interim equipment, warehouse and general engineering workshop facilities and the augmentation of stage 1 facilities. Subsequent to parliamentary approval, stage 2 development was divided into three phases for programming reasons. The first phase is complete and the second phase is under construction. The third phase has been deferred. </PARA>
<PARA>  This motion now refers to stage 3 of the development and will involve the provision of air defence facilities, comprising the sector operational centre and No. 2 control and reporting unit headquarters, live-in accommodation associated with the projected personnel increases stemming from the air defence facilities, deployed squadron operational and technical facilities, aircraft pavements, aircraft shelters and associated engineering services. </PARA>
<PARA>  With the operational commissioning of the stage 1 facilities, RAAF base Tindal has become the major technical fighter base in northern Australia and is the focus of air operations in the north. However, the base can accommodate only a single squadron of Hornet aircraft and some transit aircraft, and the deployment of military aircraft is hampered by the lack of ordnance loading areas. This also presents some limitations on the use of the nearby air weapons range by deployed squadrons. </PARA>
<PARA>  The operational capability of the airfield needs to be enhanced. This is planned to be achieved by providing an additional dispersal area with the ordnance loading aprons and additional taxiways which will enhance aircraft traffic management and aircraft deployment capability. Relocation of No. 2 control and reporting units at Tindal accords with Defence's intention to transfer many of RAAF Darwin's functions to Tindal. It is planned to coordinate this with an air defence equipment replacement program currently scheduled for 1984. No further major development proposals for Tindal are foreseen at present. </PARA>
<PARA>  The estimate for these works is $53.5m at April 1991 prices. It is planned that the work will go to tender in March 1992, with completion by 1996. I table selected drawings of the proposed stage 3 development at RAAF base Tindal and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>In April 1989 the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works recommended to Parliament the construction of the stage 1 redevelopment facilities at CSIRO North Ryde at an estimated cost of $18 1/2m at August 1988 prices. CSIRO sought funds in the Budget context for this development to proceed. However, funds were not provided and it was decided that the project should be funded through rationalising CSIRO's property holdings at North Ryde. A review of the North Ryde site was undertaken and a redevelopment strategy proposed. The strategy involved the identification of staged development and release of certain lands for high technology business park purposes. The proceeds from the staged land releases would be used to consolidate CSIRO activities on the site and upgrade and replace substandard facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  The main elements of the proposed strategy are: a rationalisation and consolidation of the CSIRO accommodation at North Ryde; a progressive release of approximately 15.8 hectares of identified surplus land and up to 11 indicative development lots to create a science and technology park; the retention of principal CSIRO buildings in good condition to form the nucleus of the redevelopment in the divisional precincts; the provision for all of CSIRO's anticipated accommodation needs for the foreseeable future in retained existing buildings, upgraded as necessary, and state of the art new buildings; provision of controlled access to the site to address urgent safety issues; an orderly continuous redevelopment program anticipated to run some nine years, but the program to permit on-site research to proceed with little interruption; and the whole redevelopment is to be self-funding. The work will be undertaken for an out-turn cost of $101m and will be funded from the sale and/or lease of identified surplus land. </PARA>
<PARA>  To accelerate the construction timetable from 12 to 13 years down to nine years, the Government has provided a loan of $10m. The planned redevelopment represents a major opportunity for the CSIRO to provide good accommodation for its staff into the next century. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Parkville, Victoria--CSIRO Redevelopment. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1988, as a result of new research directions, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation redirected the activities of the former Division of Protein Chemistry towards the pharmaceutical and health care industries. As a result, the Division of Protein Chemistry was dissolved and the wool protein and leather research activities were relocated to more compatible facilities at Geelong and Clayton and the residual biomolecular research conducted at Parkville was strengthened through the transfer of related activities from CSIRO's campus at Clayton and by joining with the Division of Biotechnology at North Ryde to form the Division of Biomolecular Engineering. The amalgamation will allow the Parkville laboratory to focus on research for the pharmaceutical and health care industries with an emphasis on sophisticated computer based instrumentation and microanalytical techniques. </PARA>
<PARA>In line with these requirements, the CSIRO is now proposing to redevelop the Parkville site as a major research complex and to provide the headquarters for the Division of Biomolecular Engineering. The redeveloped facility will provide for 140 people and development works will be undertaken in three stages to satisfy client requirements that the site remain operational at all times. </PARA>
<PARA>The work will include: demolition of an old two-storey wing along the western boundary and construction of a new four-storey wing linked to the existing main laboratory; upgrading and refurbishing the existing main laboratory in the administration building to house administration amenities, research services and support units, including stores and workshops; and demolition of a portion of Mayfair, an old Victorian residence, and redevelopment of this area of the site as landscaped open space for increased staff recreation. </PARA>
<PARA>The project is estimated to take approximately four years to complete and will cost $12.25m at August 1991 prices. These funds have been programmed into CSIRO's capital investment plan. I table the supporting drawings and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On behalf of the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), who represents the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Stage 2 Development of HMAS Albatross, Nowra, New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA>Following Government approval in 1985 and 1986 to purchase the new Seahawk helicopters for the Royal Australian Navy, further development of the naval air station HMAS Albatross near Nowra, New South Wales, was prompted. The first stage of this development commenced in 1987 and it is now completed. </PARA>
<PARA>  This motion now refers to stage 2 of the development program. Stage 2 will involve the provision of a new building to house the command operations, communications and administration of the naval air station, and the provision of a new building to provide office facilities for both technical and administrative staff of Nos 723 and 817 squadrons. Upgrading of associated hangar annexes, high voltage reticulation and emergency power supplies will also be provided. </PARA>
<PARA>  At present the command operations, communications and administration functions are conducted from six widely separated buildings, two of which are temporary buildings of World War II design. Technical staff of Nos 723 and 817 squadrons operate from temporary and unsatisfactory accommodation. Squadron administration and aircrew operate from old corrugated iron and timber huts which are energy inefficient and noisy and which continually require repairs and maintenance. Critical upgrading of the high voltage reticulation system was undertaken in stage 1, but with the passage of time further works are now required. The central emergency power station upgrade will now provide a stand-by power supply to satisfy the current increased operational requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>  These proposed works will complete the current major development project at HMAS Albatross. The limit of cost estimates for these works is $9.9m at December 1990 prices. It is planned that the work will go to tender in September 1991, with completion of two new buildings expected by late 1992. It is expected that the project will create about 70 jobs in the Nowra area. </PARA>
<PARA>  In its report the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works determined that there is a need to construct buildings and associated engineering works at HMAS Albatross for the provision of facilities to accommodate support functions of the naval air station at Nowra to squadron staff and upgrading of high voltage electrical services and energy generation. The Committee agreed that these proposed works will be adequate to provide working accommodation and engineering services to support the functions of the naval air station at Nowra. The Committee recommended that as part of the stage 2 development of HMAS Albatross an energy audit should be undertaken to identify methods by which the use of electricity can be reduced. Consistent with this recommendation, the Committee also recommended that the buildings in the proposal requiring the provision of hot water should be provided with adequate solar hot water heaters. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Department of Defence accepts the recommendations in the Public Works Committee report and will comply with the specific issues raised. I thank the subcommittee for its support and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Opposition supports this motion, but I would like to make a couple of observations about one aspect and also draw on some of the comments that my colleague the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) made when referring to the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works that was tabled in the House last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  On the question of energy conservation, I think all honourable members would support the moves that are being made, but it is worth reiterating the point that I raised here last week on this very issue, that is, while using solar hot water heaters is certainly a worthy move in saving energy and will make some contribution to Australia's efforts to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gasses, it is worth making the observation, as the Public Works Committee did in its report, that this will increase the life cycle costs of these hot water services by about 70 per cent. That would be a very significant increase for householders who had to install the same type of equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>  I make that observation because I again draw to the attention of all honourable members that these are the sorts of difficulties that householders are facing when it comes to trying to look at ways and means of conserving energy. While it may be said that the Government should be leading the way and therefore the extra 70 per cent increase in costs is not unreasonable, it nonetheless does highlight the fact that it will cost more, and it would cost more for individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, I would like to talk about the points that were raised by my colleague the honourable member for Gilmore last week. In fact, HMAS Albatross is within his electorate. He pointed out that it has suffered quite badly over the last seven years because of the Government decision to scrap the fixed wing component of the Navy air arm. That in itself was probably difficult enough for people in the Nowra area to take, but the real insult that he drew attention to, and to which the attention of honourable members should be drawn yet again, is that the Government, in its haste to sell off the Navy's ability to defend itself with its fixed wing squadron, sold its Skyhawks--the A4s--to the New Zealanders at a fire sale price, but having done that the Government then found itself in the embarrassing position, a few years later, of having to lease them back at, as my colleague the honourable member for Gilmore pointed out, an annual lease rate that is not much different from the total capital sale price of the planes two years before. I really do think that the Government ought to be reminded of the stupidity of some of its decisions, and that was one. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nonetheless, I am sure all residents of the Shoalhaven area near HMAS Albatross will be pleased to hear of the work that is being undertaken and will look forward to seeing its completion. </PARA>

<PARA>  That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Redevelopment by the Defence Housing Authority of Seaward Village, Perth, Western Australia</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed work recommended by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works involves the redevelopment by the Defence Housing Authority of Seaward Village, Perth. The redevelopment is in line with the Government's commitment to improve housing for Defence families and will be undertaken in three stages at an estimated cost of $12.814m, with a completion target of 1994.   The redevelopment will replace 77 unsuitable and poor quality houses at Seaward Village, which is located on base adjacent to Campbell Barracks, the home of the Special Air Service regiment at Swanbourne, a coastal suburb of Perth. The scope of the works provides for the redevelopment of Seaward Village and its continued integration with the adjacent Seaview Heights Village of 28 good quality houses to be retained. </PARA>
<PARA>  Work will include the demolition or sale of the poor quality houses and the construction of good housing suitable for the Defence families involved. Existing substandard sewerage, stormwater drainage and water supply services are also to be replaced as part of the new subdivision works. </PARA>
<PARA>  In response to the Committee's recommendations, the Defence Housing Authority will follow the code of practice for the safe removal of asbestos during the demolition and removal or disposal of the houses. The Authority is also currently reviewing the Committee's recommendations regarding the installation of solar hot water heaters in all houses and will endeavour to establish reasons as to why constant maintenance is required with this type of water heater. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In supporting this motion I would again like to draw attention to a couple of points. The first is that this motion comes out of the reference that was reported back to the House on 17 April this year. While the delay has not been unreasonable, I note it is a bit different from the previous motion from the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin). In fact, that report was tabled here only last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We are talking about improving housing for Australian Defence Force personnel. As is rightly pointed out, this concerns the replacement of 77 substandard houses with 123 new houses. While it is commendable and welcome and I am sure that all of our Defence Force personnel would be very pleased to see that progress, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Cross report, which was tabled over four years ago, drew attention to the fact that, of the 23,000 houses that are provided for our Defence Force personnel, nearly half were substandard. So while the replacement of 77 is welcome, it is but a small move toward taking up what was clearly a very urgent problem identified by a parliamentary committee over four years ago--a problem which, at the time, had led to substantial increases in the resignation rate of our Defence Force personnel. </PARA>
<PARA>  While we do welcome this, I think the Government has been very tardy in addressing the problem of improving Defence Force personnel housing. I urge the Government, therefore, to have another look at the Cross report. It is over four years since it was tabled and it showed very clearly the problems that Defence Force personnel--the very fine men and women who are serving in our defence forces--have to tolerate with regard to the standard of housing provided for them. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also note that the Minister will examine further why the cost of using solar heating in the housing is not only considerably more expensive--70 per cent more, as I pointed out in the previous motion--but also that it needs continuing maintenance. I suspect that that is because the type of solar heating being used has a panel which moves with the sun and, therefore, would require some maintenance. Nonetheless, it again highlights the difficulty that private citizens with their own homes face when trying to make the decision about whether or not to put in solar hot water heating. </PARA>
<PARA>  I draw this to the attention of the Government because I think it is a matter that it will have to look at some time down the track. While the Government may set these targets for reducing greenhouse emissions, it also has to look at the practical aspects of these targets and what they mean to average citizens. Bearing in mind that citizens of Australia are now facing a very severe recession--one that the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), seemed to be quite proud that he had inflicted upon this nation--particularly during these times, I think it is worth reminding the Minister that in those circumstances it is rather difficult to be asking citizens of this nation to be following the same course as the Government in considering their new hot water services when it will cost them 70 per cent more. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yesterday the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) raised, as a matter of privilege, the question of whether a witness to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration may have misled that Committee. The essence of the honourable member's complaint was that a Mr Paddison, a senior executive of the State Bank of South Australia, had given a certain response to a question about non-performing loans and possible bank losses when appearing before the Committee on 30 April. The honourable member said that he had since received a document which indicated that, well before the evidence in question was given to the Committee, substantially higher estimates of non-performing loans and possible bank losses had been prepared at a senior level within the bank and notified to the bank's board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The honourable member has since made available to me a copy of a chart he received which he felt substantiated his concern that the Committee may have been misled. Whilst I have no means of knowing the authenticity of the document or the validity of any of the statements that have been made, on its face the document does appear to reveal a discrepancy between the response given by Mr Paddison on 30 April and projections on the same matters apparently known at senior levels within the bank.</PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst I would normally ask the Committee to consider the matter itself, I think at this stage the House might deal with it. Misleading a committee is certainly a traditional category of contempt and on the information available to me, although it is not a completely clear cut matter, I am prepared to accord precedence to a motion in respect of the matter raised by the honourable member for Mayo.</PARA>
<PARA>  Motion (by Mr Downer) agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the House refer to the Committee of Privileges the question of whether Mr Stephen Paddison of the State Bank of South Australia misled the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in an answer given to the Committee on 30 April this year in response to a question about non-performing loans and losses by the bank.</PARA>

<PARA>  Customs Tariff Proposal No. 7 (1991). </PARA>
<PARA>The tariff proposal which I have just tabled contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. The proposal extends the provisions of the Australian system of tariff preferences to Czechoslovakia and Namibia. The proposal has effect on and from 1 October 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government supports the action being taken by Western industrialised countries to encourage changes presently taking place in central Europe. We have already accorded preferential treatment to other countries of central Europe, most recently to Poland and Hungary. In view of the political and economic reforms which have also taken place in Czechoslovakia, we are now extending preferential treatment to that country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's decision to accord Namibia preferential status is consistent with Australia's long involvement in international efforts to assist Namibia and other southern African states to reduce their economic dependence on South Africa. Our action, in respect of both Czechoslovakia and Namibia, is consistent with measures already adopted, or being adopted, in other countries, such as the United States of America, and by the European Community. </PARA>
<PARA>  The measures in this proposal are contained in schedule 6 to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, which I will now introduce. This proposal will ensure that the measures are in place on 1 October and will avoid the necessity of waiting for passage of the legislation through Parliament before the preference measures can be implemented. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, which is now before the House, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Some of these amendments have previously been introduced as Customs Tariff Proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill are operative on and from 12 March 1991 and contain administrative amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Section 3 contains a change to section 14 of the principal Act to ensure that `free' is a rate of duty for the purposes of section 19 of the principal Act, which was amended by the Customs Tariff Amendment Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  Section 4 defines the developing country rate of duty for certain goods presently covered by quota arrangements which end in 1993. This is necessary to implement new preference arrangements for the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan Province and Singapore in respect of these goods. These preference arrangements have effect from 1 July 1992 and correct tariff changes contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  Section 13 amends paragraph 10(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff Amendment Act 1991 by inserting a reference to 1 July 1992. This amendment takes effect on 12 March this year and ensures the correct implementation of phasing rates of duty announced in the Government's industry statement. </PARA>
<PARA>  Schedule 1 provides a duty free rate for pre-tanned bovine and equine leather. This corrects an anomaly introduced at the time of conversion to the harmonised tariff and operates on and from 1 January 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>  Schedule 2 provides a free rate of duty for parts of wheelchairs. This results from a Government decision on the Industry Commission's report on aids and appliances for people with disabilities. Minor amendments are also made to two subheadings of chapter 90 following printing errors in the Customs Tariff Amendment Act 1991. This schedule operates on and from 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  Schedule 3 is operative on and from 12 March 1991. It implements phasing rates of duty for certain goods of 2204 and 2205, in accordance with the Government's industry statement. For technical reasons, these changes were not able to be implemented by the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991. Minor administrative changes are made to two subheadings of chapter 63 and to subitems 11A and 21V in schedule 5. </PARA>
<PARA>  Schedule 4, which is operative on and from 10 April 1991, contains a new additional note to chapter 20. This note defines orange juice to include products of oranges, regardless of methods of derivation. This amendment restores the intended rates of assistance for orange juice, following representations from the local citrus industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  Schedule 5 is operative on and from 1 July 1991. It contains administrative amendments to subheadings in chapters 7 and 17. Rates of duty for Canada are inserted in two subheadings of chapter 20. These amendments correct administrative oversights in the Customs Tariff Amendment Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  The rate of duty on aviation gasoline has been reduced by 0.321c per litre. This results from a decision by the Civil Aviation Authority to withdraw its rescue and firefighting service from capital city secondary airports. Part of the customs duty collected on aviation gasoline was regarded as an offset against the cost of providing this service. </PARA>
<PARA>  Minor amendments are made to note 1 and subnote 2(b) to chapter 43 to conform with changes to the harmonised nomenclature. Schedule 5 also implements measures to facilitate Australia's partial accession to the 1950 UNESCO Agreement, more commonly known as the Florence Agreement. The changes introduce free rates of duty for educational, scientific and cultural material. </PARA>
<PARA>  Schedule 6, which is operative on and from 1 October 1991, accords Czechoslovakia developing country status, as announced by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator  Button) on 14 August. The Government has also accorded this status to Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Schedule 7 is operative on and from 1 January 1992. It includes changes to various section and chapter notes, headings and interpretative rules in the harmonised nomenclature. Australia is a signatory to the Customs Cooperation Council Convention and under article 16 is obliged to implement periodic changes to the harmonised system. Some of the changes are substantial and the following consequential amendments have been introduced:</PARA>
<PARA>    a new subheading of heading 2106 has been created to maintain protective rates of duty for certain food preparations which have been reclassified;</PARA>
<PARA>    subheading 2818.10 has been split to maintain protective   rates for artificial corundum, not chemically defined; and</PARA>
<PARA>    additional note 2 to chapter 61, additional note 1 to chapter 62 and the additional note to chapter 95 have been omitted. The substance of these notes has been incorporated in other notes or headings of schedule 3. </PARA>
<PARA>Other changes are of an administrative nature only and have no effect on classification or duty rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  Schedule 8 will have effect on and from 14 days after this Bill receives royal assent, and contains the following changes:</PARA>
<PARA>    denatured ethyl alcohol is amended by removing the revenue component from the current duty rate. Excise duty applies only to potable spirits for human consumption. Denatured ethyl alcohol, or methylated spirits, is free from excise duty when produced in Australia. The inclusion of an excise equivalent duty in the customs tariff is therefore an anomaly, as only the protective element of the customs duty should be applicable. </PARA>
<PARA>    The amendment of this item will correct this anomaly and, together with associated administrative changes to the excise regulations, will streamline the import regime applicable to methylated spirits; and</PARA>
<PARA>.  other minor administrative changes which are consequential to amendments contained in previous Customs Tariff Amendment Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA>  Tariff changes to implement the terms of the Florence Agreement will involve a revenue loss of approximately $28m in 1991-92, $30m in 1992-93 and $32m in 1993-94. Customs duty forgone through the reduction of the duty rate for aviation gasoline is expected to be approximately $35,000 per annum. The inclusion of Czechoslovakia in the list of developing countries is expected to result in a revenue loss of around $1.7m per annum. The inclusion of Namibia will result in a loss of around $7,000 per annum. The initiative to reduce the duty rate for parts of wheelchairs is expected to cost less than $100,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>  Other changes contained in this Bill will have only minor revenue implications. Details of the amendments contained in this Bill have been included in an explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposes amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to incorporate into that Act two excise tariff proposals already tabled in Parliament. The first proposal relates to an increase in excise duty for naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG, and the second relates to a decrease in excise duty for gasoline for use in aircraft, or Avgas. </PARA>
<PARA>Liquefied Petroleum Gas</PARA>
<PARA>  Clause 4 of the Bill will increase the excise rate for LPG for the period 1 April 1991 to 1 July 1991 from $5.78 per kilolitre to $35.94 per kilolitre. The amount of excise duty payable on naturally occurring LPG is adjusted in April and October each year in accordance with this Government's and the previous Government's longstanding policy of calculating the excise duty on the basis of 60 per cent of the amount by which the realised price for naturally occurring LPG exceeds $147 per tonne. The realised price is calculated as a weighted average of the prices received from exports and local sale of LPG during, in this case, the six-month period from 1 September 1990 until 28 February 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  The increase in the excise rate effected by clause 4 reflects the higher export prices obtained for LPG during the relevant six- month period as a result of the Iraq-Kuwait conflict. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is noted that as from 1 July this year the excise on LPG has been replaced by a resource rent tax, under the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Act 1991 which amended the Petroleum Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987. Transitional arrangements in that Act provide that excise collected since 1 July 1990 on naturally occurring LPG is offset against the producer's tax liability under the resource rent tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Avgas</PARA>
<PARA>  Clause 3 of the Bill will decrease the excise duty on Avgas with effect from 1 July 1991, by reducing the rate of excise from 27.395c per litre to 27.074c per litre. The decrease is due to the withdrawal of the Civil Aviation Authority's rescue and firefighting service from capital city secondary airports.  When the Civil Aviation Authority was established on 1 July 1988, the Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Act provided for the payment to the Authority of that portion of the revenue from Avgas excise which had historically been attributed to the functions transferred to the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA>  Subsequently, the general aviation representative associations advised the Authority that they no longer required the rescue and firefighting service at capital city secondary airports. The capital city secondary airports are Archerfield in Brisbane, Bankstown in Sydney, Essendon and Moorabbin in Melbourne, Parafield in Adelaide and Jandakot in Perth. Accordingly, the Civil Aviation Authority Board decided to remove the service from those airports from 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  The CAA's decision to withdraw its rescue and firefighting services from the six secondary airports followed a comprehensive review of existing rescue and firefighting service arrangements which involved input from the aviation industry, local authorities, metropolitan fire brigades and the Federal Airports Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>  In view of the removal of the service the board requested that the rate of Avgas excise which had been calculated as an offset against the cost of providing the service be similarly reduced. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA>  A) Liquefied petroleum gas</PARA>
<PARA>  The increase in the excise rate for naturally occurring LPG is estimated to result in an increase of $9.4m in excise receipts for the three months commencing on 1 April 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  B) Gasoline for use in aircraft</PARA>
<PARA>  Nil. The reduction in the rate of excise and customs duty on gasoline for use in aircraft will reduce the Commonwealth revenue by approximately $340,000 for 1991-92. Money appropriated to the Civil Aviation Authority will reduce by that amount so therefore there will be no net financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend the Bill to the House and present its explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of the Government's 1991-92 budgetary measures, I bring before the House a Bill to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973. The Bill rectifies what has previously been a deficiency in the legislation that enabled Medicare benefits to be paid when a medical practitioner rendered a medical service outside the scope of that medical practitioner's limited or restricted State or Territory registration. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also includes a new provision which ensures that a patient is fully informed concerning the non-availability of Medicare entitlements before a medical service is rendered outside a medical practitioner's State or Territory registration. The Bill includes a provision which requires that a medical practitioner, before rendering a medical service outside that medical practitioner's State or Territory registration, will be required to give to the patient a notice advising that a Medicare benefit is not payable in respect of such a service. The Bill introduces a penalty provision where, if a medical practitioner who is required to so notify a patient fails to do so, then a penalty, set at a maximum of $2,000, may apply. </PARA>
<PARA>  Also included in the Bill is a discretion for the payment of Medicare benefits to ensure that patients are not disadvantaged by the proposed new arrangements. This will enable the payment of Medicare benefits for a medical service which is rendered by a medical practitioner outside that medical practitioner's State or Territory registration and where the medical practitioner fails to inform the patient that Medicare benefits are not payable. For example, such a provision would enable Medicare benefits to be paid where a medical practitioner acting outside that medical practitioner's State or Territory registration was required to provide an emergency service. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members will be aware that, for some time, the Government has been reviewing the key elements of the Medicare arrangements and, in particular, concerns related to excessive servicing by some medical practitioners. The Bill introduces a new penalty provision and new referral powers to a Medicare Participation Review Committee, which are considered necessary as deterrents to medical practitioners who render excessive services. </PARA>
<PARA>  These amendments are part of the Government's broad initiatives to control the costs of Medicare. Medical practitioners, under the current legislation, may be required to appear before a medical services committee of inquiry, which is a committee of peers, to justify the necessity of the medical services rendered. To the extent that a medical services committee of inquiry finds that the medical practitioner has excessively serviced, that medical practitioner may be required to repay such Medicare benefits to the Commonwealth or the Commonwealth may not be required to pay Medicare benefits for such medical services. The Bill introduces a penalty, in addition to the non-payment or repayment of Medicare benefits, equal to the value of the Medicare payments in respect of those services, which have been found by a medical services committee of inquiry to have been rendered excessively. </PARA>
<PARA>  The current legislation provides for the establishment of a Medicare Participation Review Committee. Such committees are empowered to review the continued participation of a medical practitioner in the Medicare arrangements, in certain circumstances, and may disqualify a medical practitioner from the Medicare arrangements for up to five years. The Bill introduces new provisions requiring that where a medical practitioner has been found to have rendered excessive services by a medical services committee of inquiry on two or more occasions, then such a medical practitioner will be referred to a Medicare Participation Review Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 1 November 1991 new Health Insurance (General Medical Services Table) Regulations will be implemented. From these regulations, it has been common practice to produce the Medicare benefits schedule, which is used by medical practitioners in relation to billing patients under Medicare. The Australian National Audit Office, Efficiency Audit Report No. 26 on the administration of the Medicare benefits schedule made four recommendations regarding presentational changes to the Medicare benefits schedule. The recommendations regarding the Medicare benefits schedule were, in substance, that it be restructured with more logical and appropriate headings to enable easier identification of the medical services items, and thus be more `user friendly'. </PARA>
<PARA>  To implement the changes, the Bill introduces two technical amendments. These amendments will exclude the restrictive references in the current legislation to the words `Parts' and `Divisions' to enable more appropriate terms to be used in dividing up the various medical services in the Health Insurance (General Medical Services Table) Regulations. These changes do not affect in any way the substance of the medical services that are itemised in the current Health Insurance (General Medical Services Table) Regulations. I commend the Bill to the House. I now present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill before the House provides for the establishment of the Hearing Services Authority from 1 July 1992. This Bill gives effect to Cabinet's decision of October last year that the National Acoustic Laboratories, NAL, hearing services program become a statutory authority, to be known as Australian Hearing Services. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will repeal the Acoustic Laboratories Act 1948 and amend section 9A of the National Health Act 1953, to bring the delivery of hearing services under one piece of legislation. Some may ask: what changes will eligible clients experience? I can assure them that eligible clients will experience enhanced quality, cost-effective, timely and relevant hearing services, both rehabilitation and hearing impairment prevention. </PARA>
<PARA>  The new legislation will require the Authority to consult with relevant government, business, commercial, industry, and consumer bodies in delivering services to eligible clients. There will be no change to eligibility under the new Act--the Authority will continue to provide hearing rehabilitation services to Department of Social Security pensioners with a pensioner health benefits card and their dependants, Veterans' Affairs pensioners, anyone under the age of 21 years, people referred by Australian defence forces, Comcare, the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service and the Australian Government Health Service. </PARA>
<PARA>  These services will include hearing loss assessment, the selection and fitting of appropriate hearing aids and devices and counselling at no charge to the client. It is only in respect of the repair and maintenance of hearing aids and devices and for the annual supply of batteries that clients, other than those in receipt of the family allowance supplement and children of eligible clients, will continue to be required to make a small contribution. The Department of Veterans' Affairs will cover veterans for this cost. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reorganisation of NAL as a statutory authority represents just one part of the reforms for the delivery of services to public interest clients who have a hearing impairment and who would, but for these services, not be able to afford the hearing aids and devices supplied by the private sector. It was for this, among other reasons, that the Government decided last year not to follow the Industry Commission's recommendation that the whole hearing services market be opened up to two-way competition. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members will be pleased to hear that considerable progress has been made with the joint venture between NAL and its commercial partner, Australian Hearing Aids, AHA. AHA is a joint venture between the Commonwealth NAL and AHA--which is a joint venture between Crystalaid Pty Ltd, a wholly owned Australian company, and Ascom, a Swiss communications consortium--for the design, development and supply of the third generation of programmable hearing aids to NAL's clients and for export markets in Asia, the United States and Europe. </PARA>
<PARA>  This arrangement was possible because of the high international regard for the National Acoustic Laboratories and the Government's hearing services program. It means that NAL will be able to supply world leading programmable hearing products to eligible clients from 1 January 1993. The establishment of NAL as a statutory authority underpins this arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the objectives of the Authority will be to participate, as far as is practicable, in promoting and establishing export markets for the jointly designed and developed hearing products. From this NAL stands to earn royalties from both the hearing aids and remote control units sold overseas. The Government has been guaranteed minimum royalties of $2.6m on all exports, with projected royalties of over $9m over the period of the contract. </PARA>
<PARA>  As with many government services, some may consider this scheme excessive in the current economic climate; however, when one considers that nearly one in every 10 Australians has a hearing impairment and that this ratio increases to one in every three people over the age of 65 years, this more than justifies the need for a readily accessible and affordable program to assist those people. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's NAL hearing services program employs a team of highly trained and caring people, including university trained audiologists, some of whom specialise in either paediatric or adult services, technicians and administrative staff to ensure that eligible clients receive the level of service they require to enable them to communicate effectively in their everyday life. These services are delivered through a network of over 100 permanent and visiting NAL hearing centres to ensure that all clients receive the same level of service across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  NAL provides a comprehensive hearing health care program which is aimed at improving the quality of life for many pensioners who could otherwise be cut off from everyday life. The services provided by NAL also target children to ensure that their early development and learning is not impeded by their hearing impairment. NAL currently sees some 200,000 hearing impaired people. Last financial year NAL assessed some 50,000 new pensioners, veterans and children and fitted a total of 80,069 hearing aids. NAL's technicians repair about 270,000 hearing aids and devices each year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill does not alter the delivery of services to NAL's traditional hearing impaired clients; it simply makes changes to the administrative and operational aspects of the program. The provision of hearing rehabilitation services to the traditional clients of NAL, including the fitting of appropriate hearing aids and devices, their maintenance and repair, as well as batteries, will continue to be provided by the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another of the Authority's major activities will be research into hearing loss, hearing assessment and rehabilitation, hearing loss prevention, and the effects of noise on people. A further activity for the Authority, which fits with its more commercial orientation, will be the hearing impairment prevention services provided by NAL. These activities fit well with the Government's overall objective of promoting better health in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>  The new organisational arrangements for the delivery of hearing services to eligible clients set out in this Bill will see the appointment of a board of management which will report directly to the Minister. Members of this board will be by ministerial appointment and will consist of representatives from business and consumer organisations as well as the General Manager of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>  The board of management of the Authority, in accordance with the legislation, will develop and operate under a corporate plan that sets the financial and operational targets for the Authority. As with all government bodies and programs, the Authority will have to perform against set targets and performance indicators. The day to day operations of the Authority will be managed by a general manager and the organisation will be restructured to facilitate these arrangements. The general manager will also be appointed by the Minister. Staff of the Authority will continue to be appointed and employed under the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Authority will continue to operate under a group 2 trust account, which was established on 1 July 1991. All moneys and payment of all expenditures and disbursements relating to the Authority's operations will pass through this account. The Authority will also be subject to the same reporting requirements in relation to estimates and receipts of expenditure for each financial year, as is any government body. Similarly, the Authority will be subject to the Audit Act and its reporting mechanisms, as with any statutory body. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under the new arrangements the Authority will continue to be primarily budget funded, with moneys being appropriated to the Authority by the Parliament. Although the Authority will be exempted from taxation, including payroll and sales tax, it will be required to pay customs duty, as it currently does. </PARA>
<PARA>  Provision is made in the Bill for the levying of charges for products, services and facilities. Such charges will be set by regulation, as is currently the case for any fees or charges levied by NAL. The Authority can enter into contractual arrangements for up to $1m without the approval of the Minister, but must have ministerial approval for any contract above this amount or for the sale or acquisition of property. </PARA>
<PARA>  The rights of clients are protected by the inclusion in the Bill of both independent internal review by the general manager and external review of decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal affecting the rights of clients, including the imposition of charges. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's endeavours to streamline the operations of NAL have already borne fruit, with the introduction of computer systems and dramatic reductions in waiting times in all hearing centres. As a statutory authority, NAL will have the flexibility to achieve further improvements in the cost and timeliness of its services, and as a bonus will have low cost, state-of-the-art hearing aids for Australians, together with technology transfer and export earnings. I commend this Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am continuing on from last night, when I was using this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) to discuss my responsibilities as shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs. I reached a point at which I was being somewhat negative; although, to put it in some context, I have talked about the direction I see in Aboriginal affairs--what is going right in the portfolio, what is going wrong in the portfolio, areas of program delivery, some bright spots and some not so bright spots.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  One of the gems that came up in the Budget Papers in Aboriginal affairs related to a program run by DASETT on Aboriginal public awareness of climatic change. The purpose of this program is to encourage and promote national strategies to minimise Aboriginal health problems due to climatic events. The need for this was said to be that Aboriginal communities are a high risk group in relation to the impact of the greenhouse effect. This is particularly interesting, because, as a doctor who had some interest in sun related skin disorders prior to coming into this place, I can tell the House that melanoma is absolutely unknown amongst Aboriginal people, as is basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma is so unusual as virtually not to be recorded in textbooks. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am not quite sure what this money is going to. It may be for house design in the Torres Strait--how to make houses on stilts. But, in an area in which there is such great need, it is very frustrating to find programs that seem to have slipped through without anyone ever engaging their brain and thinking about whether there actually is a need for them.   Another difficulty with Aboriginal affairs is that it is a portfolio which has a great deal of confrontation. Earlier today in this House we had a debate on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) spoke after me. I apologise to him for not being able to stay for his contribution, but I did catch it in my office. Anyone who listened to the honourable member for the Northern Territory would think that Aboriginal education in the Northern Territory was the worst in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the privileges I have as a member of this Parliament is serving on the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, which is currently undertaking an inquiry into Aboriginal language maintenance. During the course of that inquiry, the Committee has travelled extensively throughout northern Australia examining Aboriginal education, particularly bilingual education. I have to say that, although the Northern Territory Government's efforts may not be up to the standard considered desirable by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, the Northern Territory is leagues ahead of any other place in Australia in terms of its treatment of Aboriginal people. One only has to look over the border at the Kimberley district of Western Australia to find that in some places Aboriginal children are still being punished if they are caught speaking their own language in the playground. In contrast to that, the Northern Territory has some very innovative programs, innovative curricula development and bilingual education, which increase the school retention rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  The speech made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory really brought home to me how much confrontation is still associated with the Aboriginal affairs portfolio. Although he and I may often disagree on Aboriginal affairs, we confine our disagreements to this chamber. The difficulties arise because we carry so much political baggage and so much mistrust. This came home to me during the recent debate on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, which was the first major issue associated with Aboriginal affairs in a decade on which this Parliament spoke with a unanimous voice. </PARA>
<PARA>  Prior to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill being passed by the Parliament, I issued a press release stating that I had some concerns about the Council, and I still do. I was concerned that the Council may not be adequately focused and about its accountability. I formed those views after travelling around the country for six months, using the very best part of my working life during that period in an effort to persuade, argue, beg, plead and generally drum up support for the Minister's Bill. In the end, the Opposition supported the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  In spite of having expressed concerns in the most constructive way that I possibly could, my doing so led to a tirade of abusive letters from a wide range of people. One letter was written by the Australian Teachers Federation, saying, `How dare you run this thing off the tracks'. This correspondence came entirely from people who had contributed no input to the process over a period of months; yet they were prepared to criticise me on the basis of their fixed perceptions. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said, in the end result, the Opposition supported the Bill, and those concerns remain with me. However, the Opposition was prepared to pass the legislation and to approach the matter in a constructive way. The point I make is that it seems to be very difficult to have concerns about Aboriginal affairs without running the risk of suffering abuse for having honestly expressed them. I should add that, subsequently, I have engaged in correspondence with the Australian Teachers Federation. In the not too distant future, I hope to meet its representatives with a view to working out a basis of trust between us. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are also areas of hope in the Aboriginal affairs portfolio, and one is the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody which was released earlier this year by Commissioner Elliott Johnston. I wish to cite a few passages contained in the report because I believe the views expressed should move every Australian. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>The view propounded by this report is that the most significant contributing factor is the disadvantaged and unequal position in which Aboriginal people find themselves in the society--socially, economically and culturally. </PARA>
<PARA>. . .      . . .      . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The thrust of this report is that the elimination of disadvantage requires an end of domination and an empowerment of Aboriginal people; that control of their lives, of their communities must be returned to Aboriginal hands. </PARA>
<PARA>Commissioner Johnston went on to refer to the daily life of Aboriginal people and he expressed it in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>This petty tyranny, escalating to interference with the most fundamental of rights to practise ones own culture, ones own religion, to parent one's own children is deeply resented. </PARA>
<PARA>The resentment and bitterness are very real. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe it is a great pity that the Royal Commission's report is so lengthy. It comprises 11 volumes, which means that, almost certainly, it will not reach the audience it deserves. The very balanced and moderate treatment it gives to a very difficult and complex area is worthy of the attention of this House. To date, it has received bipartisan support in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  When I was given the job of shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), I was asked to consider where we might be in the next decade. Three things were very obvious to me. First of all, 1992 will be the 500th anniversary of Columbus landing on the east coast of the Americas. It will focus world attention on the whole colonisation process in the same way Australia's Bicentenary focused attention on our history. The year 1993 will be the United Nations International Year of Indigenous People. As a result of the breakdown of East-West tensions, the Helsinki human rights process will almost certainly become a process for establishing indigenous rights, which will focus international debate on Australia in an unprecedented way. I do not say that in the sense that this country will be held to ransom, because I do not hold very much to threats; rather, I say that as someone who desperately wants Australia to win in the international arena--in business, innovation and science. In the future, the debate on indigenous people will be an international one, driven internationally. If Australia is not seen to be addressing the legitimate and reasonable aspirations and hopes of Aboriginal people, this nation will find itself in an increasingly hostile environment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Having been the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs for nearly 18 months, I find it desperately disappointing that in some areas of Aboriginal affairs there is very strong evidence indicating that we are actually moving backwards. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) recognises this. His comments were reported in the Weekend Australian of 7 September:</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal adults had a life expectancy 20 years less than that of others and the gap was growing. </PARA>
<PARA>It is significant that the gap is growing, not narrowing:</PARA>
<PARA>The central theme of a textbook launched by Mr Tickner yesterday is that the general health and well-being of Aborigines is worse now than 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>In spite of this, the entire Aboriginal affairs debate is framed in terms of more of the same: that is, just a bit more money will fix it; just a bit more government involvement will fix it. That is in spite of the fact that what we are doing is in many cases sending things backwards. Australia already has the highest per capita expenditure on indigenous people in the world. We still seem to be looking at grand plans rather than realistic and achievable goals. </PARA>
<PARA>  The position was stated very well recently by the Australian of the Year, Professor Fred Hollows, who said, `Bugger the reconciliation. Just fix the leprosy'. I hope that reconciliation will have a significant effect, but I share the point of view expressed by Professor Hollows. It will mean nothing unless we can `fix the leprosy'. A focus on programs and on services on the ground--in other words, on outcomes, not just processes--has to be the way forward for Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, I sometimes have pangs of conscience. For the first time in my life, I have travelled extensively throughout rural and remote areas of Australia. I have been struck by the extent of rural poverty in this country. One cannot remove Aboriginal poverty from rural poverty. For example, a short while ago, I visited Cunnamulla in south-western Queensland and spoke to members of the local RSL. Someone came up to me and said, `I have lived here for 37 years. In all that time, only two kids from the local high school have gone on to tertiary studies'. A great deal is done to help Aboriginal people overcome their disadvantages, but not very much is done to help the people who live at Cunnamulla to overcome their disadvantages. I do not say that to suggest that less should be done for Aboriginal people. I am saying that if their problems are examined in isolation, without taking into account rural poverty generally, we miss the point. In the 18 months I have been the shadow Minister, I have not heard the issue of Aboriginal poverty raised in relation to rural poverty on even a single occasion. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some of the sting is going out of the Aboriginal affairs debate, which makes it a very worthwhile and fulfilling area on which to focus one's activity. It is an area that does not have any impact on the daily lives of the majority of Australians, yet it is an area that cannot be ignored, because it will not simply go away. If Australia, as a country, cares about national unity and about national cohesion, it will not be possible to have a group of people who are marginalised and who are not fully able to participate in Australian life. That is the challenge confronting Aboriginal affairs during the next decade. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It gives me great pleasure to support the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1991-92 and this year's Federal Budget. There was an editorial in the Australian newspaper of 21 August 1991 which accurately identified the lasting benefits of the 1991 Federal Budget for the people of Australia. The editorial made this comment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>An inflation rate that will remain at a 20-year low level and a prospective positive trade balance, which in turn will reduce the current account deficit further and bring the growth in foreign debt under control. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Historically, for a Labor government in the trough of a recession, with its attendant unemployment, this is a considerable achievement. But it is also what we would expect of this Government. This is a Government with experience and expertise, one that realises the danger of trying to reflate the economy at a stage when the stimulus already injected into it (through lower interest rates and higher public spending) is set to drag it into recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>Yes, indeed. The Hawke Government is a government with experience and expertise. This Budget has laid the groundwork for an inspiring and fighting recovery of the Australian economy. Its fundamental priority is the well-being of the Australian people and, when the Australian people are called upon to pronounce their verdict on the performance of the Hawke Government, I know that they will give their confident endorsement of this Government's historic mission of reform; that is, to provide competent and compassionate government for all of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The contrast between the positive programs contained in this Budget and the cold and heartless un-Australian policies of the Liberal and National parties could not be more stark. It is a contrast between an honest, credible and compassionate Labor Government and an Opposition which espouses the dark side of politics--the Liberal and National parties with their cynical and deceptive policies of unfairness, broken promises and spiralling taxes and charges. As the Prime Minister has said:</PARA>
<PARA>This budget aims to consolidate the work of its predecessors. Its aim is sustainable growth with low inflation. It is part of a continuing process toward structural reform and social justice. It continues the work--the task of the past eight years--of building an internationally competitive Australian economy. . . We are determined that this recovery will be different in character and quality from any merely cyclical recovery this country has seen in the past. We are determined that this recovery will unambiguously repay the pain of the recession with substantial and lasting gain. </PARA>
<PARA>The fundamental point about the Budget is that it is fiscally responsible. Because of the recession, outlays have jumped as a percentage of GDP; nevertheless, Budget outlays in 1991-92 as a percentage of GDP are 3 per cent lower than in the last year of the Liberal-National Party Government in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst the fight against inflation is of paramount importance, Australia's economic recovery as a result of this Budget will in time produce the urgently needed growth in jobs. Unquestionably, unemployment is one of the major concerns of the Government. That is why an enormous effort--$540m--is being devoted to improving labour market opportunities. For example, there was an increase of $199m for labour market programs this year alone--an increase of 63 per cent. Not only is there increased funding for job market and training programs, but also there has been a substantial increase in funding for TAFE and higher education. Although the Government is investing a huge amount of the nation's wealth in policies designed to ensure a rapid recovery in employment growth, there still remain other avenues for the Government to accelerate rapid recovery in the job market. This brings me to the issue of jobs programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the realities of Australian society over the many decades has been the fact that, in good times and bad, hundreds of thousands of Australians are unable to obtain work. The Liberal and National parties have been notoriously indifferent to the plight of the unemployed. They shunt them aside. The present Liberal-National Party Opposition has threatened to take away the unemployment benefits from persons who are unemployed for more than nine months. </PARA>
<PARA>  Past Australian Labor governments during periods of recession have initiated jobs programs designed to place the unemployed in productive work, not only for the benefit of the country but also for the self-esteem of the unemployed. For example, the Whitlam Government initiated the regional employment development scheme during the early 1970s, and the Hawke Government introduced the community employment program shortly after winning office in 1983. These programs made a solid and positive contribution towards relieving unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The United States has long experience in public job programs. There has been an enormous amount of academic research on the economic value of public job programs. An article in the US magazine Challenge, published in May-June 1991 by Sar Levitan and Frank Gallo of the George Washington University Centre for Social Policy Studies, described the value of job creation. They had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Public job creation serves four separate but overlapping needs: (1) The programs, of course, alleviate joblessness, hardship and poverty. (2) If sufficiently large, the expenditures can help the local or national economy emerge from a recession. (3) Providing jobs to able-bodied welfare recipients is a necessary complement to a welfare system, promoting the work ethic and self-sufficiency. (4) Jobs programs produce needed services that otherwise are neglected. Although precise estimates are lacking, the costs of jobs programs are mitigated if not outweighed by the benefits. The wages paid by jobs programs replace a portion of welfare disbursements and unemployment insurance. Subject to income taxes, the wages directly return money to government treasuries. The services and public works supplied through subsidised jobs provide useful and sometimes enduring benefits to society. Job programs in both the short and long runs reduce the likelihood of crime and welfare dependency. </PARA>
<PARA>  President Roosevelt succinctly stated the moral case for subsidised jobs in his 1944 economic bill of rights: `True individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. Necessitous men are not free men.'</PARA>
<PARA>The article went on:</PARA>
<PARA>The economic rationale for countercyclical public job creation is that market economies emerge slowly from downturns and that governmental spending accelerates recovery and may prevent lengthy stagnation. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe it imperative that the Hawke Government introduce a national public job creation scheme immediately. The community employment program was an outstanding success. In my own electorate of Herbert not only did it produce lasting benefits for the unemployed who participated in the program, but it also provided many excellent public works--for example: water reservoirs; roads; footpaths; bicycle tracks; sporting and recreation buildings; crown-of-thorns starfish surveys; public tree planting; and city beautification programs, just to name a few. The article by Levitan and Gallo recalls for me the many successes of the community employment program in my electorate. Writing of the US experience in job programs, Levitan and Gallo made this observation:</PARA>
<PARA>During the late 1970s, when poor youths aged sixteen to nineteen who had not completed high school were offered a guaranteed job, they responded en masse. In the seventeen communities that formed the basis for large-scale experiment to test this thesis, four of five eligible youths who learned of the program applied, and three-fifths of all eligible youth participated. The experiment increased the employment/population ratio of poor teens to 41 per cent, compared with 25 per cent in similar non-participating communities. The program was so potent that it raised the overall employment/population ratio of poor teenage blacks and Hispanics above that of poor whites. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall never forget one CEP project sponsored by the Uniting Church in my electorate. The Uniting Church had a holiday camp at Crystal Creek near Ingham and applied successfully for a CEP grant to upgrade the facilities at the camp. The church engaged a number of unemployed youths, some of whom were under 17 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA>  I recall the coordinator of the program telling me of the poor physical condition of many of the youths and of their despondent emotional state when they were initially employed. He told me that at the end of the program the youths had dramatically improved their physique and had acquired a fresh sense of confidence and ebullience. The church coordinator found it a painful experience when the project was complete, for he was obliged to terminate the employment of the youths. Nevertheless, up to 60 per cent of the long term unemployed in my electorate who participated in the community employment program were successful in obtaining permanent employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said earlier, the Federal Government is spending huge sums of money on education and training programs. Combined education and labour market assistance in this Budget has increased by more than $1 billion. This is for increased support for job market and training programs, TAFE, Aboriginal employment assistance, higher education, and workplace and adult literacy. More than $9.8 billion is allocated in this Budget for these activities. Commendable as these initiatives are, I believe that, unless large scale job creation programs are instituted, the successful graduates of education or training programs will not have the opportunity to utilise their newly acquired skills, to the extent that they otherwise could, if there are no job vacancies. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately for Australia, there are in this country self-styled economic experts who regard public job creation as a discredited idea. For example, the Liberal and National parties denigrate public job creation as a useful tool in assisting with economic recovery. Just as bad are those who regard public job creation with ambivalence. This Government is committed to the expansion and continuation of Skillshare programs and other job training programs. The Liberal and National parties are committed to abolishing Skillshare programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  The conservatives are quite specific as to where they intend to make substantial cuts in jobs creation and job subsidy schemes. The Liberal and National parties economic and tax policy, published in October 1989, described in chilling detail what they would do were they to obtain office in this country. The Liberal and National parties' policy on labour and employment states:</PARA>
<PARA>  The next Liberal/National Government will conduct a thorough review of all the Department's training and employment schemes. . . there will be less emphasis on job creation and job subsidy schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>  JOBSTART, a wage subsidy scheme which replaced several other schemes, will be phased out as soon as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA>  SKILLSHARE will also be phased out as soon as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unemployment benefits under the next Liberal/National Government will be provided for a maximum period of nine months. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry Training Support (ITS) Scheme will, in cooperation and consultation with employer groups, be phased out. The Liberal and National Parties strongly support industry efforts to upgrade workers' skills by providing training and retraining courses, but believe it is more appropriate for employers to accept the financial responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>  The CES demonstrably needs a massive overhaul. . . Its operations will be rationalised and some services will be privatised, for example, professional employment services. Other services will be contracted out and placed in the hands of State Governments, community and Church groups . . . Resulting cost savings are estimated to be up to 25 per cent of the total cost of operations, but additional savings are anticipated in later years. </PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal-National Party policy document then detailed the annual cuts it would make against the job schemes I have just mentioned: Jobstart, $85m; Skillshare, $61m; industry  training support scheme, $36m; new enterprise incentive scheme, $7m; Australian traineeship scheme, $15m; and the Com- monwealth Employment Service, $50m. This gives an annual total of $254m. Those figures are in 1989 dollar terms. </PARA>
<PARA>  These cuts which would be employed by the Liberal and National parties would destroy the combined efforts of thousands of dedicated and caring Australians to help the unemployed obtain work. But the fact is that employment opportunities must be available for the unemployed when they are job ready. It seems to be out of kilter that a nation can spend $9.8 billion on education and labour market assistance programs and not participate in job creation schemes. Job creation programs reduce unemployment and welfare payments. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fact that community employment programs accounted for a small fraction of the total unemployment at the time has caused some people to mistakenly underestimate the true value of the community employment program. Perhaps one of the reasons for this is the inadequacy of the reports on the accomplishments of the community employment program. In Australia we do not find the so-called experts spouting more than vague generalities about the accomplishments and failures of job programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have heard, and I am sure other members have heard, the mistaken assertion that the costs of job creation schemes are too onerous and therefore they should not be undertaken. But doing nothing is even more costly. The current budgetary deficit is mainly accounted for by the rapidly increasing income support payments and by falling tax revenues. I understand that higher employment benefits alone constituted 80 per cent of the real growth in Budget outlays this year. I urge the Government to act on this issue and act now. There is no shortage of job creation models, practical experience, both here and overseas, or indeed academic research work on the positive long term value of permanent job creation schemes. Levitan and Gallo make this additional observation:</PARA>
<PARA>  Society's work is never done and there is no shortage of useful work that job creation programs would supply. A jobs creation program can offer ample work opportunities to fulfil needs currently unmet by the market economy. The limited skills of the workers assisted in jobs programs could be readily matched with many functions. . . Jobs programs have made and can make a tangible difference in alleviating hardship, supplying valued services (including labour intensive public works), and promoting the work ethic. Past mistakes justify improving--not abjuring--further efforts. President Roosevelt put it best in defending similar New Deal initiatives: `Better the occasional faults of a government that lives in a spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference'. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me go on to record the fact that this Budget has been a wonderful boost to the well-being of Australian families. More than 200,000 families will benefit substantially from changes to the family payment system. For example, the family allowance supplement threshold will increase from $18,000 to $19,300. This initiative alone will make an extra 28,000 families eligible for the family allowance supplement. Another 81,000 families who are getting the part rate family assistance supplement will receive additional assistance. As a result of the increase in the threshold I referred to earlier, 109,000 families will be financially better off by $12 per week. The Government has altered the assets test arrangements to assist families, particularly in rural Australia, who have high assets but low incomes. I congratulate the Government on this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget is a fair Budget and, above all, fair to the Australian people. It is one that contains many benefits--for economic growth, for jobs, for welfare, for social programs, and for the recovery of the Australian economy. Together, the Hawke Government and the Australian people, sharing the distinct Australian qualities of strength, resilience, and commonsense, will bring Australia confidently through the whole process of national reconstruction and renewal and thereby equip Australia, in the words of the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to enter the 21st Century with a strong, competitive economy as the essential foundation for our national goals of a progressive, enlightened, just society, uniquely diverse, but unshakeably united. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wonder where the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) is when he describes this Budget as a wonderful boost for Australians. With an unemployment rate of 10.4 per cent predicted, I wonder what would not be a wonderful boost for Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The 1991 Budget is easily criticised and I do not think I can add much to this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1991-92 by dwelling on the particular deficiencies already highlighted. Instead, I would like to look at one or two issues that this Government and this Government's Budget have failed to address.</PARA>
<PARA>  I will first recount a conversation I had with a leading manufacturer which highlights part of my concern and the concern of my constituents about the present situation in Australia. The manufacturer was talking about Japanese investment in our country. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>They--the Japanese--want to invest here because we have cheap power, cheap labour and lower environmental standards than in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA>It sounds like something we might have said about emerging Asian countries three decades ago--cheap labour and low environmental standards. I believe we need Japanese investment in this country but if, indeed, these are the reasons why they invest here then I hang my head in shame. Australia--the nation that once had the highest standard of living in the world--is now a place to invest in because we have low environmental standards and cheap labour. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have two reflections on this unhappy comparison. The first I have already alluded to--that our standard of living is falling and we are falling behind the rest of the world as it moves forward. The second relates directly to the environmental issue. One would think that this Government that has so aligned itself politically and rhetorically with the environmental lobby would have a better than average environmental record. I was concerned enough about my manufacturer's analysis to go to the library to check on the Japanese environmental standards compared to our own. What I found was sobering. </PARA>
<PARA>  For instance, in Australia our per capita energy requirement is one-third greater than that of Japan. Per unit of GDP we have more than twice the carbon dioxide emissions from energy use than the Japanese and twice the per capita carbon dioxide emissions. Per unit of GDP our total emissions of greenhouse gases exceeded those of the Japanese by almost four times and per capita we exceeded them three times. Our municipal waste per capita was almost twice that of the Japanese. One good note was that our industrial waste was less than half theirs which, I suspect, reflects more our lack of industry than any particularly high standard of industrial waste control. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our nation's emissions control standards are not adequate. Frequently we work on annual hourly averages for many of our pollutants--that is, the hourly average taken over one year. For example, in Japan sulphur dioxide is not permitted to exceed 0.04 parts per million as a daily hourly average. In Australia we cannot exceed 0.02 parts per million on a per annum hourly average. One does not have to be an Einstein to realise that with a shutdown of many industries at night time, and the majority at the weekend, there is large scope for wild fluctuations that harm health and the environment, and that by the time we realise we have a problem it is not sooner but later. </PARA>
<PARA>  The statistics do not stop there. Japan still has 75 per cent of its native forests. Australia has destroyed 75 per cent of hers. Of total land area, 67 per cent of Japan is wooded and 14 per cent of Australia. Whereas 6.4 per cent of Japan has been designated a protected area, only 4.8 per cent of Australia has. On some issues we have a better environmental record than Japan. We do not slaughter as many dolphins and we have stopped killing whales. We import much less tropical timber. These are what may be described as sexy or vote winning issues. On the equally important, but less high profile, issues of pollution control Australia--which is not far from being, basically, an agrarian society--is worse off than one of the most highly industrialised countries in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  Care for the environment is basic to the survival of this country. What is needed is an overall strategy to protect our environment. That strategy needs to be an integral part of Government policy, not a quick fix solution to the more high profile issues. There is no indication from this Budget that in 1992 this Government will do any more than it has already done which is to pay lip service to populist issues and to pander to special interest groups. Neither the Budget nor Government policy has addressed the issue of the environmental needs of Australia as a whole, just as it has not addressed our major problems in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recently, I heard Australia described as an international orphan. It struck me as particularly apt. Culturally and historically we are part of Europe but, having been colonised by Europe, Australia has been cast adrift by it. We are excluded from the European Economic Community--we have only limited access to its markets--and we are brought to our knees by European subsidies which force us to sell our major exports at bargain basement prices. Culturally, we are part of Europe; geographically, we are part of no-man's-land. We may claim to be part of South East Asia but I am not sure we even believe it ourselves. Our values, our system of justice, our major religions, our culture and our linguistic skills remain European based. </PARA>
<PARA>  When our relationship with the rest of South East Asia is in the newspapers, more often than not it is because we have offended one or other of our South East Asian neighbours--the Malaysians, the Indonesians or the Singaporeans. Equally distressing, when we are not offending them we are currying favour or apologising for past misdemeanours in a way that I and many of my constituents find sycophantic and demeaning. Our relationship varies between the offensive and the fawning. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our economic location in an ever shrinking world, where economic blocs are being forged on the basis of cultural and historical links as well as geographical proximity, is in desperate need of resolution. I am aware of the efforts of the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) to overcome our trade problems. However, what I have not seen addressed--certainly not publicly--is the major question of how and, indeed, if, we can position ourselves for the new century in such a way that we can trade profitably and be accepted as part of South East Asia and the Pacific Rim without compromising either our identity or our heritage. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will add nothing to this debate on the Budget if I comment that this Government is in disarray. That is obvious. I want to point out, on behalf of my constituents, that this Government is so far off the track that it has not the will, energy or time to address the current problems let alone the fundamental structural problems of Australia's role and place in the world in the twenty-first century. Far from being a blueprint for the future, the 1991-92 Budget offers the people of Australia the prediction of nothing but worse to come. </PARA>
<PARA>  Several years ago we were aghast to learn the size of our net foreign debt. That debt has not shrunk; it has not stabilised. At $130.6 billion, it continues to grow. Now, in a betrayal of those people who elected it, this Government presides over an unemployment rate of 10 per cent, and the Budget predicts 10.4 per cent this year. The sad thing is that we are in danger of becoming numbed by the statistics and will fail to see the human misery they represent. </PARA>
<PARA>  The unemployment problem is the result of the current recession, but it does not stop there. For reasons related and unrelated to the recession, more people will lose their jobs in the next few years. Australia is facing enormous problems. As a solution to some of these problems we are likely to lose some of our older industries, hopefully--although not certainly--to be replaced by more profitable ones. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reduction of tariffs that has been started by this Government, and which will be hastened under a coalition government, is necessary for our long term survival. A country whose industries cannot stand alone without tariffs is on shaky economic ground. Tariffs exclude the possibility of export, as protected industries can rarely be competitive in the world market. They direct resources from possibly more efficient industries and, most importantly, they put up the prices of goods and services to the community. </PARA>
<PARA>  Consumers have the right to the cheapest goods available and the country that puts tariffs on goods of a superior quality--whether it is shoes, clothes or cars--is acting against the interests and welfare of its citizens. However, there is another side to the reduction of tariffs and that is the collapse of those industries that only survive because they are protected by the tariff system. Industries are not living things--they neither breathe nor bleed. However, those people who work in them are living, breathing beings and the demise of particular industries has profound and devastating effects on the men and women who lose their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  When industries collapse workers find they are unemployed. For many, this unemployment is not temporary and it is cruel to pretend it is.  Retraining is only an option for the young, the literate and the mentally agile. For those people who have grown into middle age with an industry, their options are negligible. They face the next 20, 30, 40 or even 50 years as pensioners of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The recession has already pushed hundreds and thousands of such men and women onto government welfare; the restructuring of industry will add thousands more. The economic implications are profound but so too are the personal implications. Tears for the unemployed have been shed so frequently in this House of late that I suspect they have become devalued. What the unemployed want is not sympathy and not compassion; they want jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unemployment is not something that we tack onto a person's life like a car or a house. It is an essential part of the being of a person, who or what he or she is. A person's occupation is fundamental to what he is and how he sees himself. By taking away a person's job we can destroy him or her as a person. When the unemployed have families, their failure--it is perceived as a failure--is transferred to their children. Children growing up in a household where one or both parents are unemployed have a totally different childhood from children who do not have unemployed parents. </PARA>
<PARA>  Earlier I provided some comparisons between the environmental record of Japan and Australia. Japan's unemployment rate is 3 per cent. Its youth unemployment is 5 per cent. We should compare that with our youth unemployment. With a 27 per cent youth unemployment, one in every three young people is unemployed. If the future of a country lies in its young people, what does that say about Australia's future?</PARA>
<PARA>  We can already see the consequences of unemployment. Honourable members should look at our crime, vandalism and graffiti statistics. In my area it has risen by 10 per cent in the last year. Members of the community are justifiably up in arms about the increase in youth crime but they have no right to be surprised. What do young people owe a society that has wiped them off? What do they owe a society that says, `Oops, sorry, you can't get a job, you don't have a future, you'll never own a house, you'll never be able to buy your children nice clothes or let them sleep in a home that is theirs'? If we do not offer a future to our young people in this society there is a danger that they will form a society of their own--one that does not obey our rules. If we destroy the hopes of young people they will retaliate by attacking the people who abandon them. I hope that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) are prepared for this, but I see no sign in the Budget or anywhere else that they are. </PARA>
<PARA>  What was needed in Australia was a Budget that showed us a new direction and that indicated this Government was going to stop doing deals with unions and was going to get behind business--not just big business, but the hundreds and thousands of small businesses which do not need job creation schemes to employ people but simply a chance to prosper in an efficient and healthy business climate. But the Government has not done this and it has done nothing to assist the one million unemployed whose lives have been devalued. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that it is not enough for us to provide our unemployed with welfare. I believe that governments and society have a responsibility to ensure that those who are unemployed and those who cannot get work have an alternative to being left alone with their welfare cheques and their frustration. I do not think the Government has the right to label unemployment as an economic necessity and walk away when that employment can render a person's whole life meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's answer to date has been more training. Training is part of it but what is the point of training courses if people already have skills or if there are not enough jobs at the end of the training courses? Young people in my electorate get a terrible feeling of futility as they enrol in yet one more course. </PARA>
<PARA>  Neither party in this House has a program of work for the dole--no longer, I suspect, because it is not fashionable to ask people who receive money from the state to contribute but because it is simply too expensive to run such schemes. What is the cost if we go on the way we are? In terms of human misery, it is probably incalculable. But economically the costs are also high and I do not think that this has been taken into account. Those who are out of work will lose their desire to work, they will lose their capacity to work and they will lose contact with those who do work. The Government will support them through their potential working years and on into old age and then we will probably support their children. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our young people are unemployed and yet at the same time organisations that contribute to our society are collapsing for want of volunteers. There are environmental projects that are never undertaken because of a lack of workers and there are thousands of elderly people who need help in maintaining their homes. I cannot believe it is beyond the ingenuity of this Government and of this Parliament to bring these areas together. If it is, then I suspect the prognosis for Australia is not good. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget has left me and many of my constituents with deep concerns about the future of this nation and the people who live here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to support the 1991-92 Budget. I will take this opportunity to comment on the Budget as it relates to my portfolio responsibility. This Budget has, once again, demonstrated the Government's strong commitment to science and technology. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that last year Commonwealth support for science and innovation showed an increase of 2.4 per cent in real terms over the previous year. This year, in the context of fiscal restraint, Commonwealth support for major science and innovation programs has risen from $2,422m to an estimated $2,607m. This represents a real increase of 4.3 per cent. I will repeat that figure: it represents an increase in real terms of 4.3 per cent. This is clearly a successful outcome for science and technology and has been recognised as such. Let me read the comments of the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies, a group representing 60,000 people working in Australia on science and technology:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The 4.3% increase for science and technology was unexpectedly good. </PARA>
<PARA>It noted that last year the Government achieved a 2.6 per cent increase and said, `We thought that was excellent. This year's result is even better'. I point out to honourable members that this is not a one-off increase; it is part of the Government's continuing strategy to develop Australia's science and technology system and to ensure that it better meets national needs. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has recognised the importance of science and technology since coming to office in 1983. Commonwealth support for science and innovation has increased 29 per cent in real terms since 1982-83. We have not only recognised the importance of science and technology in improving our national well-being and in helping develop internationally competitive industries; we have also done something about it. We have supported and strengthened our national science and technology effort. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn to some of the specific aspects of this year's Budget. The Government is to provide an immediate injection of $12m for CSIRO, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and the Australian Institute of Marine Science to enable these agencies to embark on a capital works restoration program. This program will include site development, building refurbishment, the upgrading and replacement of obsolete facilities and temporary buildings, and improved preventative maintenance. Total direct government support for the major research agencies will remain at the same real level in 1991-92 as in 1990-91. This is a real increase of 2.7 per cent for civil research agencies alone. This offsets a fall in funding for defence research and development, resulting from the Defence Force review. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition to its increased capital funding, the Australian Institute of Marine Science will be provided with $1.3m over three years. This will allow the Institute to conduct a more extensive investigation of factors adversely affecting the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget appropriation to CSIRO has increased in real terms by 3 per cent. The research agencies receive funds in addition to those appropriated directly. These external funds include additional Commonwealth support won competitively through special purpose grants schemes, as well as funds received from business and from earned revenue. External funding to CSIRO has increased rapidly over recent years. The total amount to be spent by CSIRO this year will be $635m, of which $441m will be direct appropriation funding. In this Budget the funds available through directed research grants schemes are to increase from $309m to $384m, a real increase of 20 per cent. These grant schemes support areas such as medical, rural, energy and industrial research. </PARA>
<PARA>  Support for research in the higher education sector will increase to an estimated $1,082m in 1991-92 from $987m in 1990-91. This represents a real increase of 6 per cent. The Australian Research Council funds, used to support university research, have increased in real terms by 37 per cent. Total support for industrial research, development and innovation, including both direct support through appropriations and the estimated costs to revenue forgone through the taxation concession for research and development, is expected to be $362m in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has demonstrated its continuing commitment to science and technology in the most practical way that it can--by providing the funding needed to develop Australia's science and technology system as one of the best in the world. We have done this, and our success should be measured not by what we have put into the system but by the results that have been obtained. These results show in a clear and unambiguous way that the Government's approach, its strategic framework for science and technology, has been successful. The achievements, the important discoveries, advances and commercial applications that have resulted from this expenditure, and the longer term realignment of our science and technology effort to meet national needs, more than justify our commitment to science and technology. </PARA>
<PARA>  I particularly draw the attention of honourable members to the sound performance of government research agencies in seeking to match their research directions more closely to national needs. The external funding targets set by government for a number of these agencies have certainly played a part in this, but the agencies have achieved a great deal themselves. Some members may be familiar with the priority setting mechanism which has been used within CSIRO. The work that CSIRO has carried out in this area has been a substantial achievement. </PARA>
<PARA>  One very dramatic indicator of the success of the Government's strategic framework for science and technology has been the impressive increase in the level of research conducted by industry. Over the whole of the past decade, Australia has had one of the strongest rates of increase in business research and development of any country in the OECD. Over the period 1981-82 to 1989-90, the average real rate of growth in business research and development expenditure has been about 14 per cent per year. The latest figures show that in 1989-90, despite the slowdown in business activity, total business enterprise research and development continued to increase, although at a slower rate. </PARA>
<PARA>  The growth in business expenditure on research and development has been accompanied by a growth of over 17 per cent a year in the number of overseas patent applications made by Australians. This rate in growth of patent applications to foreign countries is by far the highest growth rate of any country in the OECD, and it bodes well for future improvements in Australia's competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am not suggesting that there is no room for improvement. The Government is fully aware of the problems that continue to exist and is taking steps to overcome them. However, it cannot be denied that the progress made has been considerable. I now look forward to the opportunities which lie ahead. The Government will be taking, or continuing to act on, a number of initiatives over the coming year. The Government will shortly be receiving the recommendations of two task forces, which will identify impediments to the commercialisation of research and methods to improve our performance in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>  In December the Government will announce the results of the second selection round of the cooperative research centres initiative, a program that will inject $100m annually into leading edge research. </PARA>
<PARA>  Early in 1992 the winner of the prestigious Australia Prize for outstanding achievement in science and technology will be announced. Most importantly, however, in the first half of 1992 the Prime Minister will be tabling a White Paper on science and technology--the first such White Paper to be produced in Australia. The government intends that the White Paper will renew the sense of direction and purpose given by the 1989 statement Science and Technology for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The first stage in the preparation of the White Paper has already involved an unprecedented level of consultation with the representatives of all parts of the science and technology system, including the users of research. The White Paper will set strategic directions to guide Government decision making on science and technology into the future. It will cover all the key science and technology issues--such as major facilities and the balance of research funding--which have been dealt with in the past in a less coordinated fashion.</PARA>
<PARA>  The White Paper will not, as has on occasions been suggested by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), prescribe detailed priorities within which all agencies must operate. The Government eschewed this approach in its 1989 statement Science and Technology for Australia. Rather, the Government's approach will continue to be one of devolving much of the responsibility for detailed priority setting to the people best qualified to do it--the scientists themselves and those who will be using the research outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am sure that the honourable member for Gippsland, whose address to the National Science Forum Budget luncheon concentrated largely on an attempt to disparage the White Paper process, will in time come to understand and endorse the Government's approach to that process with the same belated alacrity with which last week he recognised the importance of achieving a highly skilled and suitably trained engineering work force in Australia. His contribution to the debate was no doubt enhanced by his reading of my speech to the 1991 engineering summit on this very matter some two months ago. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's White Paper will provide a clear statement of the context in which science and technology are being carried out and will identify the important factors that should and will influence the priority setting process at all levels. It will be concerned with creating an environment which ensures that decisions are made in the most effective way and that we reap the best possible return from our considerable investment in science and technology--whether the return be measured in economic, social or cultural terms. </PARA>
<PARA>  Throughout the 1980s, governments placed significant emphasis on maintaining excellence in scientific research while at the same time shifting the focus in educational and government research towards national goals. Government has also placed emphasis on lifting the level of private sector research and development. </PARA>
<PARA>  More recently much has been said about forging stronger linkages between researchers and research users and about the need to concentrate on commercial outcomes of research. One object of this approach has been to achieve a fundamental change in attitudes to the role of research, and researchers, in society. It has been largely successful; even the most conservative of academic institutions now turn their minds to the utility of the work that they are performing. </PARA>
<PARA>  The task now facing the Government is to capitalise on this mood: to ensure that research meets national goals and makes its contribution to Australia being internationally competitive and exporting the commercial applications of its scientific endeavour. The issues that the two task force reports, to which I have referred, will raise go beyond science and technology. They will include the availability of capital. Consideration must now be given as to how to make capital--both development and venture--more readily available to small, innovative Australian firms to facilitate their growth. In the past, attention has been drawn to cases where it was said Australia possessed significant competitive advantage but that required injections of capital were not forthcoming through the operation of the market. We must now find solutions to repairing the market's record in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA>  I look forward to vigorously pursuing that issue both as Minister for Science and Technology and as Minister Assisting the Treasurer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This evening I would like to talk about the brave new Australia Labor has created under our southern skies, a brave new world where one million people are out of work, where we have record numbers of businesses going out of business, where the rural sector is in crisis and where the sick are turned out of hospital beds or left to rot in hospital queues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This brave new Australia has just been subjected to another Commonwealth Budget in which nothing was announced that is likely to take us off the path towards which the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), predicted we would go--in other words, to the Third World status of a banana republic. </PARA>
<PARA>  This evening I wish to address specifically that part of the Government policy that most heavily impacts upon the lives of the less fortunate, those who are sick and require the services of our health care system. The 1991- 92 Budget contained significant implications for the Australian health system. For the first time since 1983 the Government has introduced major changes to Medicare and in so doing has come reluctantly to acknowledge the magnitude of the crisis facing our health care system. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at the much-vaunted creation of the Federal Labor Government--Medicare and its funding. On 27 February 1983 the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), defended his Party's proposed health plan, Medicare, as being viable, equitable and efficient. In 1983 Mr Hawke stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It will mean that nine out of 10 Australians will pay less for the health needs of themselves and their families. </PARA>
<PARA>Little time passed before that proportion was qualified to 75 per cent by the then shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), in the election campaign, then it was changed to most and now one could say only some. On 24 May 1983 the Minister for Health (Dr Blewett), as he then was, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of Medicare is the biggest step ever taken by an Australian Government to ensure that every Australian has the best and cheapest medical and hospital care. </PARA>
<PARA>On 24 August 1983, the Minister is quoted as saying that Medicare would be self-financing once there was an upturn in economic activity. He said that this hoped-for economic upturn would substantially expand levy revenue in the coming years. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>This should more than compensate for increasing health costs so I am confident that the 1 per cent levy will make Medicare totally self-financing in future years. </PARA>
<PARA>Even as late as 4 June 1987, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . under the Government's Medicare proposals, the people of Australia, particularly those most in need, are significantly better off, as we promised they would be. </PARA>
<PARA>But Max Walsh in the Bulletin in 1983 obviously had much more foresight than the Prime Minister, by predicting a cuckoo in the nest for the Prime Minister and the Labor Government. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Cuckoo is a strange bird. It leaves its egg in the nest of another bird. The unsuspecting surrogate mother tends to look after the cuckoo chick with affection. This is repaid by the greedy young cuckoo quietly disposing of the genuine offspring. Medicare is a big cuckoo. </PARA>
<PARA>Medicare expenditure has increased from $2,018.8m in 1983-84 to an expected $8,583.7m in 1991-92--an increase of over 325 per cent. Collection of the Medicare levy has increased from $365m in 1983-84 to what is expected to be $2.58 billion in 1991- 92--far short of the total Medicare cost. </PARA>
<PARA>  The decision by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Affairs (Mr Howe) that was brought down in the 1991 Budget to effectively introduce a $3.50 Medicare charge for bulk-billed services is an admission that the high price of Medicare is not being met. Even in February 1991, the Minister was saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has sought to manage an equitable approach to health insurance policy. It has been successful, it has been stable, it has resulted in the restraint of costs. </PARA>
<PARA>The $3.50 fee to be introduced in November will be increased to $5 next year and indexed thereafter. In addition, the Government has refused to rule out a further increase in the Medicare levy Australians pay, which currently stands at 1.25 per cent. The fact is that the levy has not covered the cost of Medicare. It does not even cover the cost of medical rebates under Medicare. In 1990 the Medicare levy raised $2.4 billion--a lesser contribution to health costs than the $2.7 billion provided by health funds. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the early 1980s more than half of Australia's population was privately insured. The Commonwealth Government's encouragement of this in the form of rebates for those privately insured helped keep the price of private insurance down. Between 1984 and 1987, subsidies to the privately insured were withdrawn and costs of over $500m were imposed on insurers. The stock market crash in 1987 and the recession we had to have further exacerbated the problem with two results: cuts in Commonwealth funding to the States; and less disposable income for those who had private insurance. The number of privately-insured people fell from 63 per cent of the population in 1984 to 44 per cent in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>  The result is that today almost four million more Australians rely solely on Medicare than in 1984. There are now more Australians relying on Medicare, there is a greater demand on public hospitals which are reeling from funding cuts, there is less revenue for private hospitals as there are fewer private patients, and there is less revenue in the whole health system. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at the first six years of Medicare. The total use of private medical services rose by 33.8 per cent from 112.7 million services in 1984-85 to 150.8 million services in 1989-90. Total fees charged rose by 77.7 per cent to $4,477.6m and Medicare benefits increased by 64.9 per cent to $3,738.8m. Medical service use per person increased by 23.2 per cent with the largest increase--42.6 per cent--in pathology. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Affairs claims that the $3.50 co- payment, dismantled bulk billing for medical services, and changes to rebates for pathology and radiology services will reduce over- servicing of medical services. But this must be looked at in light of a range of other factors that are inherent in our health system and need to be reformed. The introduction of the $3.50 fee, while acting as a price signal on doctor services, is likely to mean that doctors in poorer or rural areas will be disadvantaged and therefore should be compensated for an essential community service. </PARA>
<PARA>  Currently, rural areas are under-resourced and under-staffed. Fewer than 25 per cent of doctors choose to practice in rural areas and there are five times as many doctors in city electorates as there are in rural Australia. Initiatives must be taken to improve this deplorable situation. Under the $3.50 rebate scheme, doctors would be encouraged to spend less time with their patients and valuable counselling services would be lost. Doctors would no longer have the incentive to offer better services. Instead, they would have incentives to cut corners, reduce services and provide lowest common denominator services. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the problems for the Labor Government associated with the fee, if realised, is that it would mean the end of free universal health care in Australia--which of course was the raison d'etre for the introduction of Medicare in the first place. Mr Wilson, the Western Australian Minister for Health, said on 31 August this year that the Federal Budget provision of a $3.50 payment for visits to general practitioners would mean that more patients would instead visit already overburdened public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my electorate of Moore a local public hospital, Wanneroo Hospital, provides the only accident and emergency services in the northern corridor of Perth. The northern corridor of Perth makes up the fastest expanding residential region in Western Australia and the second fastest in the country. This year the number of infant deliveries will approximate 1,100 and show an increase of 130 per cent from the 1986-87 figure of 466, typifying the growth in population surrounding the hospital. </PARA>
<PARA>  Despite this overwhelming increase in population, Wanneroo Hospital--a medium- sized community-based hospital--has managed to decrease the number of accident and emergency admissions by 4 per cent from 15,600 in 1987-88 to 14,967 in 1990-91. This is largely due to the establishment of a number of general practice surgeries in the region which provide services for minor accidents that would otherwise require treatment at the Wanneroo Hospital outpatients clinic. </PARA>
<PARA>  The main point here is that the treatment is being carried out at the appropriate level. Wanneroo Hospital has managed to deflect people to the appropriate service delivery point and valuable resources can be allocated to those who need emergency attention. The Wanneroo Hospital has not received an increase in real term funding for three years and, in order to cope with the funding cuts, may be forced to restrict theatre use and/or close wards. </PARA>
<PARA>  The $3.50 charge that was brought down in the 1991-92 Budget is likely to encourage people back to outpatients clinics and to free `hospital Medicare'. Wanneroo Hospital simply could not cope if this became the trend. How long will it be before an admission charge in accident and emergency is introduced at public hospitals?  Only time will tell. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Western Australian Labor health Minister, Keith Wilson, said earlier this year that Federal general revenue and public hospital funding to Western Australia had declined in per capita terms by about 22 per cent since the introduction of Medicare. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Federal funding for hospitals had dwindled, while patient demand rose because of Medicare's promotion of free hospital care . . . Public hospitals are reaching the point where we can no longer hold the floodgates . . . We're already over-loaded in terms of surgery waiting lists . . . The Commonwealth is just making the position more impossible. </PARA>
<PARA>In my electorate, a number of constituent cases have been brought to me which tell the sorry story of how Medicare is hurting the people it was originally set up to help--the low income earner who has been forced onto the waiting lists for elective surgery for up to two years. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of my constituents, 70-year-old Mr Sid Dallas, is an aged pensioner. He is a diabetic who has had a number of heart bypass operations. He was diagnosed as requiring a cataract operation on his right eye over two years ago and was put on the waiting list then. On 23 July this year he was advised in writing of his admission to Royal Perth Hospital on 8 August 1991. On the morning of 8 August, and again at midday, Mr Dallas telephoned the hospital to check the schedule of his operation and was advised to come in to the hospital at 2 p.m. Mr Dallas took the lengthy bus trip to the hospital--it takes about 50 minutes from where he lives--and, on arrival, was admitted to his ward. After being examined by a doctor and being advised that his operation would take place the next day, Mr Dallas settled down to have his evening meal in the hospital. At about 5.30 p.m. Mr Dallas was visited again by a doctor who told him that the operation would not be going ahead the next day due to a shortage of staff and that he should go home. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Dallas asked why he had not been told of this earlier and was told that there was no adequate explanation. He was told to contact the hospital again on Monday, but with no guarantee that there would be a suitable time for his operation. Mr Dallas then walked away from the hospital incensed and disappointed. He walked to the bus station and took the 50-minute journey back to a shopping centre near his home. By this time he was becoming short of sugar and short of breath from anxiety about the way in which he had been treated. On arrival at the shopping centre where the bus took him, he intended to phone for a taxi but, because of the number of larrikins in the vicinity, he decided to walk home. After the 25-minute walk from the bus station on a cold evening, Mr Dallas arrived home; his wife was shocked and alarmed at his exhausted state. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the most recognised patient problems associated with hospital operations is the anxiety experienced by the patient before he is admitted. A patient goes through a huge amount of trauma before he even gets to the hospital. People are scared of operations. They are worried about being anaesthetised, about not waking up and about all the other problems associated with operations. When a patient goes all the way to hospital and is then told that he has to go home because, through no fault of his own, his operation will not go ahead, a great amount of stress is naturally experienced. At the whim of the hospital he will have to go through all the pre-operation trauma again for his next hospital visit. </PARA>
<PARA>  The message is that ultimately it is the people of Australia who are suffering from the declining standard in the provision of services. It is the low income earner, the man in the street on welfare benefits--the very person Medicare was introduced to help--who is staying sick under the Labor Government's health policy. The irony of this is quite incredible. The Royal Perth Hospital is reeling from this year's State Budget cut of about $6m in real terms. Western Australia's big public teaching hospitals will lose 3 per cent of their funding in real terms. To try to save money, the Royal Perth Hospital has wound back services on every fourth Friday in the month that will result in the further lengthening of waiting lists for elective services. </PARA>
<PARA>  Only recently, an 80-year-old woman lost two toes through gangrene after waiting for attention at the Royal Perth Hospital. This catastrophe could have been avoided but, because she had to wait for treatment, her toes had to be removed. The hospital system simply cannot cope with the enormous pressure suffered under Medicare. At the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, outpatient services on Fridays have been cut and even the internal pharmacy is closed, so no-one can buy drugs on Fridays. </PARA>
<PARA>  The cutbacks in hospital funding will encourage the treatment of private patients in public hospitals to the detriment of the low income earner as public hospitals scramble for limited funding. According to the Private Hospitals Association of Victoria, there is evidence that private patients seeking treatment in public hospitals are given preferential treatment, thus reducing their waiting time, and that, for financial reasons, public hospitals give priority to private patients who yield a higher return to the hospital. According to the APHA, between 1982-83 and 1988-89 the average waiting list in Victorian public hospitals grew by over 100 per cent, from 10,000 to 20,400. This situation is similar in all States. The Australian Private Hospitals Association estimates that there are 75,000 Australians at any one time awaiting admission to public hospitals. One can guarantee that most of these people could not afford private health insurance, let alone pay their own way to better health. </PARA>
<PARA>   According to the Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia Ltd, unless urgent action is taken now to reform the Australian health system, it is most unlikely that there will be an adequate financial base to meet the necessary costs that will face this nation and its population. A number of alternatives have been looked at, but what is overwhelmingly clear is that major reforms must be made to the financing of the health care system to encourage freedom of choice, economic rationalism, cost effectiveness and efficiency. A recent $8m scheme announced in the Western Australian State Budget involves both private and public hospitals submitting tenders for elective surgery, with the most cost effective program being accepted. However, the scheme is likely to reduce private health insurance further, as people who are currently privately insured see public patients having operations in private hospitals and realise that they could access the same service for free under Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA>  Already thousands of Australians have passed up private insurance for the `free' alternative--Medicare--which, according to Government rhetoric and Prime Minister Hawke, is accepted by 70 per cent of the community. They are led to believe that if Medicare is there then they can do without private health insurance. Health insurance premiums have increased as, increasingly, a higher proportion of those insured are sick or think they will need access to medical services at some time. Of course, this pushes up premiums, more healthy people drop out and the downward spiral continues. These days a significant proportion of people who could otherwise afford private health insurance are opting to take their chances with public health services and are not taking out insurance. They are prepared to pay if something goes wrong, but this means not only that public hospitals will neglect the poor at the expense of the paying wealthy, but also that valuable money that could be spent on private health insurance is lost to the general health system. </PARA>
<PARA>  ABS figures from last year show that a quarter of Australians who earned more than $800 a week were not privately insured. One- third of those who earned more than $600 a week were not insured, yet 650,000 Australians who earned less than $240 a week were insured. The answer must be to encourage those who can afford it to take out private health insurance and to put paid to the belief held by many Australians that the payment of 1.25 per cent of their taxable income is sufficient to provide them with benefits of 85 per cent of their doctor's bill and allow them access to a public hospital. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australians have an incredibly high doctor visit rate of 7.8 per year, compared with 6.4 in Canada and 5.3 in the United States. The hospital admission rate in Australia is 21.6 per cent, compared with 14.5 per cent in Canada and 14.7 per cent in the United States. According to the Australian Institute of Health, in 1987-88 health expenditure was $23.4 billion, or $1,415 for every Australian. However, very little debate has taken place on whether these expenses were necessary or desirable. Of course, the costs of this are a huge burden on the public purse. The obvious intent of the $3.50 co-payment or co-charge is to reduce over-servicing and over-usage which has been encouraged by the lack of any co-payment by the patient. The Rand health insurance experiment conducted in the United States between 1974 and 1977 concluded that co-payments resulted in a significant decline in total medical expenditure; a significant reduction in the number of episodes of care initiated by patients but no change in the type of care provided by doctors; a disproportionate effect upon services used by the poor and sick; and little overall impact on general or mental health. </PARA>
<PARA>  Obviously, the equity issue is of importance here, but the overall message is that patients should be made aware of the high cost of the health services they are utilising. If the Government offered incentives that induced 55 per cent of the public to take out private health insurance--an increase of only 10 to 11 per cent on present figures--Medicare outlays would fall, waiting lists would be reduced, private health funds could reduce premiums and become even more attractive to join, and, most importantly, the changes would make health care access quick and equitable. </PARA>
<PARA>  Federal and State funding arrangements should be reviewed. One alternative would be to allocate funding to hospitals and health services according to the services provided and procedures performed, with the aims of rewarding and promoting efficiency, providing fairer returns to hospitals and ensuring appropriate standards of clinical effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>  Medicare's main claim to fame--to provide free universal health care--is being challenged and will most likely be routed. In order for Australia's health care system to regain its footing, private health insurance must be encouraged for those who can afford it and in turn the injection of funds into the health sector via private insurance will contribute more to the standard of health services in Australia. This will contribute to the restoration of equity in health services so that the most needy can access adequate treatment with minimal waiting time. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-By largely limiting himself to doorstop interviews, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has managed to evince solidity and integrity. Admittedly, there were concerns about his grasp of reality and ideological rigidity. However, an intemperate Budget outburst and sneering references to those he perceived as vulnerable and unpopular have altered all that. A shameful tirade of cant and vindictive attacks is not excused by a lack of notes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As the world faces a multitude of patently obvious environmental problems--hazardous chemicals, carbon dioxide levels, depletion of the ozone layer--none of these impresses the Leader of the Opposition. In one of his few forays into specific itemised retrenchments in the Budget, he deplores the $20m for the World Bank environment commitment and attempts to demolish the long overdue Environmental Protection Agency. Not for him a growing concern about global survival; not for him the push for international protocols. </PARA>
<PARA>   The glorious statements of the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) quite recently in this House received scant attention from the Leader of the Opposition who dismisses those people interested in this field as the Green movement and a new breed of bureaucrats. Despite the Opposition's public adherence to the reconciliation process, Aboriginals are just too easy a target for conservative politicians. It was thus no surprise that those who laboured to improve their conditions were dismissed with a derogatory reference about `the Aboriginal heritage movement'. The horrendous health problems and declining life expectancy, the internationally spectacular incarceration levels and the poor educational retention rates are of no concern to the Leader of the Opposition when the alternative option is a cheap kick. </PARA>
<PARA>  Similarly, as the numbers of unemployed grow, family break-ups ensue and the homeless rise, we would expect some praise for those people out there trying to pick up the pieces. No, the best they get is the description `do gooders' and `community workers'-- apparently pejorative in the lexicon of the honourable member for Wentworth. This sits ill with the stream of crocodile tears for the unemployed and closing businesses. It sits ill with the derision of Labor's increased training programs and labour schemes--whether Job Search, the training and skills program, the self-employment assistance scheme or the employment access program. </PARA>
<PARA>  Despite the persistent denigration of job creation schemes by the Opposition, this time we are assured it is simply, `throwing a bit of money in the direction of training'. It ill becomes the Opposition to deride these efforts in the face of its heartless calls for an end to employment benefits after nine months. If the Leader of the Opposition is to be believed we also have decreasing standards of service in Medicare and ever decreasing standards of education. They also require neither increased expenditure nor community workers. </PARA>
<PARA>  Then we had the rather pitiful resort to little politician bashing--always a good standby. For that day and that day alone they were recipients of `fat salaries, fat superannuation and VIP aircraft and cars'. I have not noticed the honourable member for Wentworth advancing a boycott of conditions, calling for cutbacks or leading the charge for restraint on his back bench. Come to think of it, the Opposition is singularly unreceptive to the idea that anyone should share the sacrifice of restraint, bar wage and salary earners. Additionally, despite the historical, unrelenting attitude that any restrictions on overseas borrowings or regulation in the economy is anathema, we witness the use of Skase and another obviously identifiable entrepreneur as transitory targets. The Opposition Leader's unseemly references to the latter's private life typified a rather unsavoury performance. In a laughable curtsy to the John Birch brigade there was a passing reference to the supposed interference of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) regarding what books students could read. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, in a demonstration of unbridled hypocrisy, the Opposition Leader had the temerity temporarily to assail tax evasion. Obviously, the reference to the issue of favourable tax breaks for the wealthier in superannuation is simply a convenient political sideswipe at this laudatory government initiative. However, the comments on fringe benefits and negative gearing do not square with the historical record. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was interested to read the debates of 8 May 1986 when the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) led for the Opposition in a debate on fringe benefits. After hearing the Leader of the Opposition this week being so appalled at those people who cheat on fringe benefits, it was quite surprising to read the words of the leading Opposition spokesman in that debate in 1986. In that debate, the honourable member for Warringah said:</PARA>
<PARA>There are numerous other anomalies and difficulties with this appalling new business tax . . . We are totally opposed to this new payroll tax which will destroy investment and destroy employment. We will vote against it here . . . We will maintain our determination to oppose it both here and all around the countryside. </PARA>
<PARA>Just to show the lack of credibility of honourable members opposite in regard to their various projections for superannuation job losses, I was interested to read in the honourable member's speech his predictions on the number of jobs that would be lost as a result of the fringe benefits tax. He predicted that a $50m gain would cost 10,000 jobs in the motor industry alone. I do not think that the honourable member would repeat those predictions in this House today. </PARA>
<PARA>  In summary, the Budget performance of the Leader of the Opposition consisted of a boots and all attack on all and sundry who in any way could be held up as scapegoats. There were limited references to a call for a balanced Budget with scant reference to how it could conceivably be accomplished, whether by itemised revenue increases or drastic expenditure cuts. His credibility has been further eroded with the Opposition advocacy of $1 billion worth of extra road funding for Queensland, pork-barrelling for the rural sector and the imminence of National Party demands for Job Search and job training increases in the context of its conference's new found radicalism. </PARA>
<PARA>  What really was to be reduced in the throwaway suggestions about this Budget balance? Was it the national rail freight and related micro-economic reform or was it to be the family allowance assistance that spread to many more households in this Budget? Was it the much praised and more equitable child- care initiatives? Was it increased expenditure on the unemployed? We are all left wondering. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn now to some Budget initiatives. The honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) alone indicated endorsement of a nebulous national superannuation scheme and quite properly advocated prudential controls of funds. In all other respects the Opposition was limited to unsubstantiated allegations that superannuation is, to quote the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), simply a redirection of `the existing commitment people have to savings' and the predictable tunnel vision warnings of resultant job losses. There was absolutely no substantiation of the correlation of a decline in private savings and the onset of superannuation growth. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has moved to consolidate a degree of security for Australians as they age. This is more pressing as the reality of the dependency ratio and the ageing hits home. Without taking inflation into account, over the next 20 years age pension costs of $4,860m will increase by 120 per cent. Equally, by the year 2030 the number of citizens over 65 years will have risen from 11 1/2 per cent to 21 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Obviously, this is not an Australian phenomenon and the developed world faces problems typified in figures for the former West Germany. Between 1950 and 1980 the life expectancy of West German citizens rose from 66 years to 73 years. With a fertility rate drop from 2.1 per cent to 1.4 per cent, the dependency ratio is reaching crisis point. In the OECD as a whole the old age dependency rate will rise from 18.9 per cent in 1980 to 33.3 per cent in 2010.</PARA>
<PARA>  Turning to Australia again, the year 2011 will see the over 65-year-olds overtake in number those aged between 15 years and 24 years. In summary, our pension processes face increasing pressures. This is perhaps a contributing factor to the Opposition Leader's references to the broad brush statistic of PAYE contributions to social welfare moving from 68c to 86c in the dollar between 1982 and 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  As well as the abovementioned urgency of action on superannuation we had the widespread abuse of the existing system by some sectors of industry. This was despite the major gains made by the union movement and the Labor Government in its extension. When the Opposition tries to divert from its own scandalous record it is worth remembering that, when Labor was elected to government, of those people earning less than $200 a week a little over a quarter had superannuation, but for those people earning above $440 a week, nearly three-quarters had superannuation. So much for the Liberal's preoccupation with the issue of taxation preference for wealthy</PARA>
<PARA>superannuation contributors under Labor. They certainly found it relatively attractive under the previous regime. </PARA>
<PARA>  What have we witnessed in the interim? The proportion of workers reported by employers to have superannuation coverage has been augmented from 41.6 per cent in 1986- 87 to 66.8 per cent in 1989-90. Of note, the private sector has seen an explosion from 32 per cent to about 57 per cent. Of the estimated 4.8 million people who have an entitlement, more than 80 per cent have been receiving it. Nevertheless there have been sectors that have been notable for abuse and avoidance of responsibility. The motor industry, clerical, hospitality and textiles are amongst those industries. Thus in October 1990 departmental officers found that the hotel industry had 38 per cent compliance. After a drive it reached 70 per cent in March the following year. </PARA>
<PARA>  Excuses given by employers must leave some doubt as to their managerial skills. Thus in the same period a survey found that of those not paying, a massive 44.4 per cent allegedly did not know about superannuation and 17.2 per cent did not comprehend how it worked. This was despite constant Opposition harangues about the pernicious spread of superannuation. A very significant number of people in those industries did not seem to have picked up the message about superannuation. The range of measures by this Government is in the context of a 1991-92 wage outcome of 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  The superannuation moves recognise the greater difficulties for small business--those with payrolls of less than $500,000. This is accomplished by a more steady progress to the prescription of 9 per cent aimed for the year 2000, with the levels becoming equal in 1995-96. Given another 3 per cent superannuation sought through employees' contributions and tax cuts, this adds up to 12 per cent of earnings going into superannuation at the century's turn.</PARA>
<PARA>  Simultaneously, the Government has indicated that it will make overdue intervention into the regulation of these funds. The current practice of limited controls through the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act do not suffice. The threat of tax concession losses is not necessarily decisive. The gestures by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to promote incorporation spells a necessary first step. Being discussed quite openly is the exclusion of the dishonest and previously bankrupt capital assets requirements, greater revelations of the financial position of companies in their annual reports and more precise details at entry and exit. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, we have a package that cements the move to broader coverage, that amplifies prudential controls and ensures a process of enforcement by the Australian Taxation Office in regard to fee extraction with no deductibility--a firm ingredient for compliance, given the added calculation for superannuation earnings. Obviously, increasing amounts of money will lie with these funds--savings that would not otherwise pass to them. </PARA>
<PARA>  Methods must be found to ensure that financial packages are constructed to accomplish some adherence to national needs, whether in national infrastructure, research and development or encouragement of value added export and import substitution industries. Rhetoric about managers' ultimate responsibility to bring home the bacon for the funds will serve little purpose if this nation's trade balance and internal infrastructure deteriorate for lack of investment, conditioned by market failure. </PARA>
<PARA>  This brings me to the issue of the building better cities program, which will cost $800m over the next five years. It has been described by those opposite as `grand cities fantasies', `Alice in Wonderland', and the `mad cities program'. I prefer the view of the New South Wales Premier, Mr Greiner, who certainly has a better track record of electoral success than those opposite. He was a party to the Special Premiers Conference in June 1991, which concluded that this policy area is urgent; that there was a need for government cooperation; that the steady spread of urban sprawl had to be restricted; and that a more commercial orientation had to be given to some service delivery. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, in the post-Budget period he has gone further in distancing himself from the negative attacks of the Opposition; in fact, he lamented what he regarded as a low figure of $57m for 1991-92. Further strong support for the scheme has been provided by the Australian Council of Social Services, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Over the last two decades public sector investment has fallen by more than 20%. It is now at its lowest levels for at least 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it has been particularly concerned with a decline by half in public housing funding since 1986-87. Other speakers have cited some of the statistical backing for this urgent program. The public funding proportion of fringe land development in Sydney is at 54 per cent. There is a 2.2 : 1 ratio of fuel use when compared with a group of 12 European cities, including London, Paris and Frankfurt. It is also estimated that 67 per cent of Sydney's household growth over the next 40 years will be in the fringe areas that are costing so much to the public. Public transport use is one-fifth to one-half less than that of the 12 European cities.  Yet, to borrow an expression from one of the less reputable spiritual inspirations of those opposite, Spiro Agnew, these nabobs of negativism opposite can only squawk about the loony Left and mad cities plans. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another example of the public perception of the importance--even for the Opposition--of this area is that this Parliament's Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies has constructed a subcommittee to deal with the pattern of urban settlement. That typifies the realities of the agenda that is being set rather than the rhetoric of those opposite that is convenient in this debate. That investigation will look at the economic and environmental impact of human settlement, major determinants of settlement patterns, desirable growth, ecologically sustainable patterns, equity in provision, the interrelation of new infrastructure and urban consolidation. The Premier of New South Wales, the Premiers Conference, the Council of Social Service, and the Committee for Long Term Strategies have all seen a need for it. Yet it is decried by those opposite for political convenience. Frankly, Australia cannot afford that attitude. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is an attitude which certainly is dismissed, even under the Bush Administration in the United States. I will quote two people in the US who are aware of the infrastructure requirements. In the 1990 Economic Report of the President, Michael Boskin, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers said:</PARA>
<PARA>Inadequate government infrastructure can impede improvements in productivity growth. . . Taking advantage of productive opportunities to maintain and improve the infrastructure is an important part of federal, state, and local government policies to raise economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Equally, the Secretary of Transportation, Samuel Skinner, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It is intuitively apparent that some public investments--particularly those of infrastructure such as streets, highways, airports, and water and sewer systems--provide direct productive services and are complementary with private capital. Comparisons over time and across countries seem to indicate that some relationship may exist between additions to such capital and growth. </PARA>
<PARA>What is dismissed by those opposite as madness--the loony Left--is certainly being found to be a lot more interesting by the Bush Administration of the United States, as it perceives the failures of the deregulation period under the previous Administration. </PARA>
<PARA>  In a similar vein, looking at the United States, in March-April 1991 there was an article in Challenge by David Aschauer from a 1990 paper by the Economic Policy Institute. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The last decade has witnessed a third deficit--a deficit in spending on vitally needed public works--which is central to some of our most important long-term economic difficulties. . . our declining private profit rate on machinery and structures, our overall failure to invest adequately in our future, and our sluggish growth in productive efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>A one per cent increase in the stock infrastructure capital will raise productivity by 0.24 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the long run--in this case four or five years--the `crowding in' effect dominates and overall private investment is stimulated. Indeed, for every $1 increase in public investment, private investment rises by approximately 45c. </PARA>
<PARA>They are some of the indications of what other people with no axe to grind about the massive problems of urban expansion see as being required. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn now to the question of migration. I am pleased to support the increase in charges in this Budget. I think there has been deep concern in Australian society about the way in which the social security system in this country--including Medicare--has been threatened by recent arrivals. Unfortunately, in some countries they are able to obtain convenient doctors certificates. Five minutes after walking down the plank at Sydney airport they have congenital illnesses. </PARA>
<PARA>  A series of measures in this Budget will ensure that there is at least some protection from fraudulence or, in some cases, change of circumstances which mean that people cannot make commitments to support new settlers. As well as that, it will discourage a significant number of people who have no intention whatsoever of fulfilling those requirements but who know very well that they will be soon dependent on the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn to foreign aid, which has been a very controversial area. It is one of the few areas in which the Opposition has been able to get its act together and has been able to itemise as an area that can be attacked. This Budget sees a one per cent increase in real terms in foreign aid. That follows a deterioration since 1985-86 of 4.8 per cent. It represents a very positive advance on the situation in 1990-91 when the Australian Council for Overseas Aid declaimed the `rubbery figures' in the Budget that were centred around the 100 million contributions to the World Bank and the Asia Development Bank being held over. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget is very much appreciated. It represents a 10 per cent increase in aid to non-government organisations and $60m over four years to the environmental assistance program, which will deal with population, family planning, forestry, climate change and the World Bank global environment facility. It represents a significant trend away from previous downturns and recognises criticisms made by people such as the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, the Reverend Donald Robinson, last year, when he spoke of a broken promise to maintain aid levels and of promises with `expiry dates set for just after the election'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise this evening to contribute to the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1). This Budget fails the 850,000 people who are currently unemployed. It fails to give business any confidence to invest in the future and, in so doing, it fails to create jobs. It fails to address the real problems of Australia's worsening balance of payments figures and it fails Australian families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government's response to those areas of criticism has been to bring down a Budget which will mean that next year we will be $4.7 billion worse off than we are this year. Its response is to introduce a 5 per cent superannuation tax--a new tax on employment. The Government is set to bring in legislation which will increase fringe benefits tax--another tax on employment--and it will introduce an assets test on the family allowance, just to name a few of the areas that will impact on people's everyday lives. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was elected 18 months ago and, since then, I have taken a hands-on approach when travelling around my large electorate. Recently I was in the far south-west and was hoping that I could take members of my electorate some good news--unfortunately, I had to take them bad news. </PARA>
<PARA>  What I had to tell my constituents was that the Federal Government proposes to bring in an assets test on family allowances with a ceiling of $600,000. The artificial sweetener in the legislative package takes the form of the hardship provisions. I use the term `artificial sweetener' because the fine print of the legislation must be read. The fact of the matter is that this time last year an assets test did not apply to the family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>  The difficulty confronting people in rural Australia is that many of their assets are virtually worthless. They certainly are not saleable. `For sale' signs appear everywhere throughout rural Australia--and in the cities, for that matter--and it is very difficult to determine the worth of assets. There have been many instances in which people who are eligible for government assistance have had the value of their assets determined a year or so later by the Australian Valuation Office, resulting in their having to repay some of the government assistance they received. This has come as a particularly savage blow to families in rural areas who are suffering extreme financial hardship. </PARA>
<PARA>  What assistance has this Government provided for rural education?  In these extremely desperate times in rural Australia, I would have thought that the Government would increase the levels of assistance through Austudy and AIC. Alas, this did not happen. Unless this Government wakes up very soon, the kids from rural Australia will be the innocent victims of the recession that we `had to have'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Prior to the winter recess, the Opposition called for hardship provisions to be included in the eligibility criteria for Austudy. The hardship provisions that are attached to educational assistance really mean that applicants have to be at the stage of leaving the family farm under part C of rural adjustment, which means they are on the way out, on their way to the cities to find a job. They virtually have to be destitute to receive assistance. The hardship provision that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) assured the President of the National Farmers Federation he would fix up is absolutely worthless and does not go to the core of the problems experienced by rural families. As a result, because so many  parents who live in rural areas are unable to support their children while they are living away from home, it is likely they will be denied further education. </PARA>
<PARA>  What does the Government propose to do about decentralising Australia?  Over the next five years, the Government proposes to spend $800m on a better cities program. Surely the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is presently at the table, could have siphoned off some of that money to improve funding for roads throughout rural Australia. It might be all very well to talk about a better cities program; but what about decentralising the economy and decentralising Australia?  Everyone knows that the cities are overcrowded, but there is no overcrowding in my electorate, where the population of the largest town is 8,000. My electorate could do with a population boost. Some of that $800m could well have been directed to rural Australia instead of to the `golden triangle' to which I often refer--Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is the local councils throughout rural Australia that will lose out. They will have to go to their ratepayers and increase their rates to maintain the infrastructure and to keep the services of the men who have worked there for years and live in caravans for weeks on end while they are grading roads. I invite the Minister for Land Transport to accompany me on a trip to a place I visited two weeks ago, namely, Thargomindah in the Bulloo Shire, and I hope he takes me up on my offer. The shire council had hoped to receive main roads funding and additional funding in these difficult times, but the allocations have been withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA>  Projects that have been on the go for many years have had to be pigeonholed. However, one important project that will definitely go ahead is the bridge over Cooper Creek at Nappa Merrie, which will be funded by the local ratepayers. The Minister for Land Transport may smile, but it will be a very important bridge. The Bulloo Shire Council has decided to locate the bridge two miles upstream from the site of the very historic Burke and Wills `dig tree'. Presently, there is no road to the site of the bridge and there is no road going away from it. The importance of the bridge is illustrated by the fact that behind every sand dune there is a four-wheel- drive vehicle driven by a tourist bringing money into the inland. </PARA>
<PARA>  The bridge will be important in terms of not only tourism but also trade. During the wet season, the river floods and it is often four or five months before people can bring bullocks from the other side of the Cooper to the markets. So often during those five month periods potential trade is lost. I ask the Minister to come out there with me one day. </PARA>

What a wonderful trade route, what a wonderful inland development road, that would be. It would allow products to be moved and allow tourists to see the great outback.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  What did the Budget do in the area of health care? I ask the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) to look very critically at the proposal in respect of pathology services. It is proposed to introduce a licensing fee of $1,000 for pathology collection centres. In order to qualify for a transaction fee, which is designed to compensate for the reduction in the Commonwealth's refund on pathology tests, a pathology centre must process approximately 1,000 patients a month. The real issue here is the level of service provided in rural Australia. Although there are many pathology collection centres in my electorate, they do not process anywhere near 1,000 patients a month. I doubt whether there would be 1,000 patients a month through the entire electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government should think very carefully before it casts the net and says, `Let's rationalise the overservicing that is taking place in the pathology industry. Let's charge a fee of $1,000 and have a transaction levy that will transfer some of the debt'. I ask the Government to exempt pathology collection centres in rural Australia from that fee. If it does not do so, there will be a further deterioration in rural health. Although the present infrastructure does not pay, it is critical that we keep it, otherwise this expertise will drift to the cities and jobs will be lost. The sad fact is that, as a result of the introduction of this fee, there will be a deterioration in health services in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The March economic statement made many promises. The people of my electorate are looking to this Parliament to keep some of those promises by enacting legislation. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has referred to the exemption applying to oils and lubricants and the promise of an exemption on road vehicles that are used exclusively within the production premises, whether the activity is associated with mining or agriculture. The problem is that we have not seen that legislation yet. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is an urgent need for the legislation to which I have referred to be introduced into this Parliament as a matter of priority. Right now, many people throughout rural Australia are preparing land to grow crops this summer and mining companies are continually extracting minerals and coal to sell on overseas markets. These producers would welcome the relief afforded by an exemption from sales tax. It clearly is a tax on production while it remains. </PARA>
<PARA>  We only have to look at the plight of the woolgrower today compared with three years ago. We only have to look at the estimates from ABARE. God bless ABARE figures, though I criticise them all the time!  In 1989-90, those figures showed that the average cash operating surplus for a woolgrower was $45,000. For the coming year, 1991-92, ABARE estimates a woolgrower will receive a mere $300. Any tax impost that can be removed from producers' cost inputs will be welcome. If the Minister has any influence in that area, I ask him to ensure that that legislation comes into this House as a matter of urgency, because it would be very welcome in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me focus some attention on the environment. This year the Budget allocation for the environment increased by $19.6m. In real terms, that is an increase of 12.6 per cent. That is a good thing and I commend the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), who has been in an awful lot of trouble this week, for that increase. But if we look at the fine print, once again we will find that much of the increase is dedicated to the international arena. We should be putting our own house in order before we start to increase spending overseas. In this very difficult time, there is very little in this Budget to give Australian farmers any incentive to go out and do something in the area of land care. </PARA>
<PARA>  I ask the Minister responsible to consider some of the resolutions that were passed at the National Party conference at the weekend. I believe that they went a long way towards recognising the problems the rural sector and our farmers are going to be confronted with in the next few years. One of those resolutions, a very important one, was to implement a tax rebate or credit system for on-farm soil conservation. This would rectify the `profit before conservation' mentality of the current Government. To get any benefit from the current scheme, people have to be in profit to get the 100 per cent write-off for the cost incurred in the year of expenditure. If there were a tax credit or tax rebate scheme, it would be able to be passed on to a year when a profit did occur and it could be offset against tax in that year. I think that is a sensible approach. It encourages people in times when they do not have the cash to continue on with the land care which is necessary, and we certainly must continue to encourage that. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another important resolution was to reinstate direct Commonwealth funding for drought aid. There are difficulties in determining what a drought really means. For that matter, I inform the Minister that many people out in Thargomindah in the far west of Queensland, in my electorate, have to look up the dictionary to see what `bitumen' means, because we do not have any of that out there, as we will show him when he comes to see our bridge. But we do recognise what a cyclone is; we recognise what a flood is. I do not think it is too difficult for us to identify what drought is and what it does. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Darling Downs has just gone through the driest period in recorded history. The Darling Downs has records going back 100 years and has some of Australia's prime agricultural land; I believe it has some of the finest agricultural land in the Southern Hemisphere, for that matter. It has been devastated by drought, so I can really tell honourable members what a drought is. People are welcome to come out there and I will explain to anyone who wants to find out what the meaning of a drought is. It is there for all to see. Governments should recognise drought under the national disaster aid packages. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another area I would have liked to see the Government address in this Budget is the area of zone rebates. Zone rebates are a form of compensation for uncongenial climatic conditions, isolation and high costs of living. The Government has introduced, as part of the Budget package, a better cities program. What about a little bit of consideration for the people who live in the outback, in the remote parts of Australia--in the far flung parts of my electorate, for example?</PARA>
<PARA>  Let us compare the rebates people are receiving in Cunnamulla with those being received by people in Darwin. I do not say that people should not be receiving a zone rebate for living in Darwin. A single person there will receive a rebate of $270. Darwin is a city, the capital city of the Territory; it is located on an international air route and a domestic air route where each day many planes land. A single person in Cunnamulla, in the far south-west of Queensland, in my electorate, will receive a rebate of $45 per year. It is worthless; it means nothing. There is a huge inequity. For a married person who lives in Darwin the rebate is $1,247. A married person with two children who lives in Cunnamulla receives a rebate of $435. There is a huge inequity there. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that is an area that the Government must urgently look at if it wants to avoid a further drift to the cities, with resultant overcrowding. I believe the Government certainly recognises this by the fact that it has brought in the package of $800m for the better cities program. I ask the Minister to consider the inequities that exist and try to address them; we will keep some people in rural Australia if the zone rebates really reflect some of the costs and burdens that people suffer living out there. </PARA>
<PARA>  But there is a further disincentive which I believe this Government should address. It is a tax on production which I believe is quite unfair. Certainly, there is a diesel fuel rebate which applies to diesel machinery used in the area of mining or agriculture. But what is the difference between a diesel driven machine and a petrol driven machine?  Why can someone who has a petrol driven machine not receive the same rebate as the person who owns a diesel driven machine?</PARA>
<PARA>  Another inequity--and it is another tax which I believe is a tax on production--is avgas. Out in rural Australia, in many parts of my electorate, the aeroplane and helicopter are the means of mustering livestock. Properties use these forms of mustering almost exclusively. Yet when owners fuel these machines they have to pay fuel excise on the avgas they use. A typical example would be a cattle property in central Queensland, which would pay something like $700 per year in fuel excise on the avgas it consumes. That is an anomaly which I believe needs addressing, and I would have liked to have seen it addressed in this year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  My time is fast running out, but let me say that this Budget, which has been termed a Budget `towards a fairer Australia', really turns out to be a joke. Do the unemployed think this Budget will produce a fairer Australia? Do families think this Budget will produce a fairer Australia? (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This is the second to last Budget that this Government or any Labor government will for a very long time deliver in the national Parliament. The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) is the lone representative of the Government sitting on the Government benches; I understand that his own members are tired of supporting the Budget, because they have given up. They have dropped out of the lists, and well they might. As I look at the Minister representing the Labor Party in office in this national Parliament, I think of the retinue of State governments around Australia which, of course, are part of his organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This Government took office in 1983. It went through the expensive 1980s, getting into surplus Budgets and coming the full cycle with this Budget with a deficit of something over $4 billion. We see it following the same dismal path--though not to the same degree--as the State governments in the southern half of Australia. Let the Minister cast his mind for a minute to the first State Government that fell over--Victoria. Victoria is still in the depths of despair as its debt ridden State Administration unravels further deprivations on the taxpayer in that State. </PARA>
<PARA>  The royal commission in Western Australia is still at the height of its performance, bringing out day after day the defaults of the Western Australian Labor Party Government. We find enormous debts have been incurred as a result of State expenditure, with the Government paying over $300m for an empty paddock for the vision--the failed vision, the vision that never really got off the drawing boards--of a refinery. I turn to my own State of South Australia, the State we thought would escape these marauding Labor Party administrations. We find $2.3 billion of South Australian taxpayers' money has gone into the sinkhole of the failed State Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government is part of all this. The Opposition has looked at this Budget, but other people have looked at it too. The Parliamentary Library has prepared a compendium of reports written by the various notable reporters and newspapers of Australia soon after the Budget was brought down in this House. I must say that Mr Alan Ramsay in the Sydney Morning Herald was quite colourful in his description. He said, simply, to begin with:</PARA>
<PARA>This is a dreadful Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It's really the Bob Howe Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>The other gem that was included in his writing was that he really thought it was a `stop Keating Budget' or a `save Bob Budget'. Everything was subordinate--the welfare of Australians was subordinate to the survival of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It is pretty colourful stuff, but I think those of us who sit here and watch the Parliament from day to day and see the low standard of administration by the Government would agree wholeheartedly with it. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 21 August, Mr Max Walsh said:</PARA>
<PARA>This really is a bad Budget--dodgy, pork barrelling, and full of rubbery figures. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Australian Financial Review, the headline simply stated, `Why the economy went off the rails'. The Australian article was headed,`Levy a hidden trap in magic pudding', and said:</PARA>
<PARA>Paul Keating always had a belief in magic puddings and it seems that the legacy he left to John Kerin in yesterday's Budget was one of these. </PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on. One can find these quotes which convey the thoughts and appreciation of the Budget as seen by some of Australia's leading commentators. It is true that the newspapers can carry in more simple terms to the public the complexities of the Budget documents. They are indeed complex, as they have to be, as they involve the financial transactions of the national Government. But what is not complex to the community is the hurt that is being felt right across Australia. It is not a complex thing for the people in the street to know that their businesses are failing and they cannot see signs of recovery or the light at the end of this dark business tunnel. </PARA>
<PARA>  Employment is contracting and unemployment has risen far beyond that level of consistently unemployed who comprise the first 3 or 4 per cent of the figures. All of us today know highly qualified people who simply have no openings in their profession from which they can earn a living. </PARA>
<PARA>  In a street pretty close to me I had a young man who was sleeping in a motor car night after night in the same spot. One of the neighbours became worried about what he was up to. They phoned the local police station and were told, `Well, he has got to sleep somewhere; he is probably one of the 1,200 people sleeping in motor cars around Adelaide tonight'. This is the sort of economy, with hardship and heartbreak, that this Government is presiding over. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government has failed. It failed to recognise the precarious position of the Australian economy. It kept its interest rates too high for too long and forced Australians to the breaking point. It failed to link the consistently low commodity prices for Australia's primary and mining industries with the weaknesses in our economy of low productivity, high inflation and the inefficient structures that supported industry and commerce.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is rather laughable, but this Government now makes much of its intention to improve the efficiency of Australian rail services. How long has this Government been in office?  Seven years! Seven years too long, but it has suddenly discovered the inefficiencies in the Australian rail system. Anyone who has read the history of the Australian rail system would know that in the 1970s the South Australian Government sold the South Australian railways to the Federal Government. It is about the one policy decision of the Dunstan Government that I approved of because it put the union dominated, State owned railway system under the control of a national administration. It is a great compliment to Australian National that it has been able to do what it has in South Australia, creating the most efficient rail service in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  We can go back to the mid-1970s. Why did it take this Government so long, with all its talk of improving the infrastructure of Australia, to discover the simple truth that it had to take Australia's railways away from union domination?  It has not done it yet. It speaks of intention but it has not yet done it. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government began to fail badly in the middle 1980s--the expansive 1980s--when it ran hand in hand, often with its mates, in the expanding financial scene in Australia. I will never forget the times in the old House when Ministers of the Hawke Government were actively campaigning for and assisting Robert Holmes a Court in his attempt to take over the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd. What a tragedy it would have been for Australia if that takeover had succeeded, with that company broken into many pieces and dispersed to ownership around the world. Yet these Minsters were actively meeting with him and encouraging him in that takeover. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, we found out later that when the Holmes a Court companies failed because of their overexpensive, rather stupid--as we now know--approach to borrowing all that it needed to buy enterprises, Prime Minister Hawke's mates in the Western Australian Labor Government forked out hundreds of millions of dollars to help stabilise and save Robert Holmes a Court's companies from collapse. It purchased, via State Government instrumentalities, hundreds of millions of dollars of shares that he owned in BHP and property in the central business district of Perth. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was an utter disgrace. While it ran and continued to expand, this Government was willing to go on with him. It openly encouraged the very behaviour that has brought Australia to this deep contraction in its economic performance. As a nation, we face a great deal of shoal water ahead of us. It is a fact that the Labor States of Australia ran hardest of all, as I have already mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a great deal of desecration and economic litter across the southern half of Australia as three State governments stagger on to defeat at the next elections, but the people in those States are staggering even more under their failed economic management. My own State is in a very deep hole in relation to its economic progress. The Premier is able to look at the State Bank and say that it lost $2.3m. He will take that money out of taxpayers' funds and put the State in debt. That will put the children of the State in debt for the rest of their lives, paying off the debt of a bank which now has the audacity to send a circular to members of parliament to say that next year it will make a modest profit. What a twisting of the truth in the short term that is. </PARA>
<PARA>  The result is, of course, that the State governments of Australia are in a desperate plight and they cannot offer the services which are needed by their communities. They are cutting services. They cannot support new enterprise. It is one of the great tragedies of their administrations that they are no longer in possession of any funds to provide seed funds for new enterprises which States have, by and large, often done well in the past. They are instituting regimes of high taxation and there is a distinct lack of confidence in their economic performances. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we look at this national Government we find in its recent references to the overseas trade imbalance--the enormous debt that Australia has built up under this Government's administration--that it is already talking of stabilising the foreign debt. In fact, advisers to the Prime Minister in papers published last year indicated that their view--and this is the advice tendered to the Prime Minister by his own advisers--was that the overseas debt of Australia would be stabilised only when it was increasing at 2 1/2 per cent of GDP per annum. Yet now that it has got down to 4 per cent from over 6 per cent, this Government talks in terms of the debt being stabilised. What utter nonsense. It has got only half way, in the sense of the advice tendered to this Government by its own advisers. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I have said, we look forward to the fact that this is the second to last Budget of this Labor Government and the second to last Budget of any Labor government in this Parliament for a very long time to come, because this Labor Government will be judged, and there is no doubt what that judgment will be. </PARA>
<PARA>  Before I sit down I want to mention briefly a facility in my own State called Adelaide Radio. It is run by OTC and the funds to support it are provided by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. It has run for a long time on the basis of providing safety and communications--distress frequencies--to ships and boats at sea. Because the Commonwealth sees its responsibilities--and, in fact, its international responsibilities are only these--to be to provide frequencies for large vessels, and because new technical developments will allow the authorities to provide safety frequencies for large vessels from far fewer locations in Australia, it has decided to cut the number of stations around the coastline. The initial plan was to leave stations only at Darwin, Perth, Sydney and Townsville, cutting out Melbourne and Adelaide, and rely on the new technical efficiency to serve larger vessels. </PARA>
<PARA>  This will leave, as far as Adelaide is concerned, a huge gap in reliable, safety radio frequencies for small craft which, of course, do not have the expensive and modern technological equipment that larger vessels have.  The small boats generally relied on the lower band of frequencies in the HF band. I am told--I am not an expert myself--that this provides relatively low frequency communication within the high frequency band over about 200 nautical miles. The transmission is by ground effect whereas, of course, moving to the high frequencies it is by skip effect off the ionosphere. The reliable frequency for boats within this 200-mile limit is certainly within the lower frequencies, which will no longer be provided because the stations will not be there. </PARA>
<PARA>  Tasmania reacted very strongly and, because of the strength of that reaction and good representation from the Tasmanian Government, the Federal Government through its authorities decided to retain Melbourne Radio. That does not serve all that Tasmania requires but it is a great help. It still leaves South Australia out on a limb as far as the range of the lower frequencies within the HF band is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has caused a great deal of anguish among boat owners who operate within the Gulf of St Vincent and Spencer Gulf and around Kangaroo Island and further distances both sides on the South Australian coast. An Adelaide Radio task force has been formed and has written to the Premier setting this out clearly. Officials from the Maritime Safety Authority have attended meetings in Adelaide to explain the position and some little progress has been made in the sense that the meetings will provide a basis for some testings to be made over the next few months to really set out, in a technical sense, how deficient this procedure may be. </PARA>
<PARA>  I must say that I find it ironic that if Adelaide is not maintained it will be the only capital without this sort of service. We have an expanding area of use of the sea. All Australian coasts and ports have, of course. It is one of the facts of life as we go along that more and more people use the sea and more and more vessels venture further from their ports. We see new marinas and a whole host of new clubs generally making greater use of the sea for recreational as well as industrial purposes.  The people who have shown interest in South Australia include not only the pleasure boat owners through the various clubs but also the fishing industry through its associations, the rescue organisations and the commercial interests in cruise ships such as the Falie and the One and All. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the Minister for Marine and Harbours in South Australia has been approached on this matter, he has made sympathetic noises but I must say that his approach to the Federal Government has been almost negligible in putting a case for safety at sea in South Australia. I wanted to mention in these remarks on the Budget my support for the retention of Adelaide Radio and the fact that we will need a continued safety frequency which is available to small craft in the waters of South Australia without having to spend many thousands of dollars on equipment which would overcome that problem. I believe that South Australia should not be left as the one State capital without this lower frequency distress safety factor. </PARA>
<PARA>  I take pleasure in speaking to this Budget and, as I have said, I look forward to the tests that the Government will meet on it and the next and last Budget it will deliver next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As earlier speakers have indicated, we will not oppose the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1991- 92. That does not mean that we agree with its policy direction. In fact, like most commentators, we dispute its aims. I want to discuss some basic issues which received almost no attention in this widely condemned Budget. It does not mean that we agree with the spending priorities. It does not mean that we agree with the tax collection methods. It does not mean that we agree with the rates of taxes levied against the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I want to make a few comments on the tax system itself. The first is on its unnecessary complexity. Australia has thousands and thousands of pages of quite complex legislation. While this deplorable situation has been a bonanza for lawyers, it will ultimately contribute to the nation's impoverishment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The tax Act is now little more than a dead hand on our business community. A whole industry has developed to interpret this legislation and help people comply with taxation requirements. If this industry promoted business, not placed a dead hand on business, the growth in GDP would be enormous. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is another aspect of Australia's taxation system which is quite sinister and will forever hold the nation in its backward condition. It relates to what I call pre-profit taxes. Pre-profit taxes are built into each and every service and every article, but they are not shown in the cost to the customer. These taxes are insidious, yet governments, both State and Federal, continue to expand in size, number and complexity, subsidised by the citizens they purport to represent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at a few examples of pre-profit taxes. These are the Federal taxes and include wholesale sales tax, fringe benefits tax, the Medicare levy, occupational superannuation, the training levy and financial institutions duty. Add to them the States' pre-profit taxes--payroll tax, also financial institutions duty, taxes on the utilities that supply gas and electricity and the cost of licences and permits--and we find that all of them add up to something like 30 per cent of the cost of any service or manufactured article in Australia. What a millstone when companies have to compete internationally! If we could eliminate all or just some of these insidious taxes, our nation would become so much more competitive. This is what makes the goods and services tax so attractive; it can replace a whole lot of them. The goods and services tax was attractive to the Hawke Government in 1985, and it is still attractive to the coalition as part of our overall taxation reform. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are two primary problems in this country--the level of overseas debt and the queue of unemployed which would stretch from Melbourne to Sydney. Does this Bill address these problems in any way? Of course not! There is support for the unemployed, but there is not one item that will promote business so that genuine employment opportunities will follow. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is just over five years since the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), the man who once imagined himself to be the world's greatest Treasurer, announced that this country was in grave danger of joining the ranks of those unhappy nations the banana republics of South America and central America. At the time much was made of this warning. Indeed, in the hearts and minds of many Australians, the ex-Treasurer's words sounded an alarm similar to the impact of Thomas Jefferson's `Firebell in the Night' address, which concluded with the dire prediction that the institution of slavery would ultimately threaten the very existence of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA>  Like so many political leaders of the period leading up to the outbreak of the Civil War, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his former Treasurer have completely failed to deal with any of the fundamental problems that continue to confront the country. The tragedy of the last five years is the tragedy of lost opportunity and the absolute failure of leadership on the part of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia's gross domestic debt now stands at $165 billion. Servicing this debt costs 20c in every dollar of export income earned. I do not believe that the people of this nation want to see it reduced to banana republicanism. They do not want to live in a country that has lost control of its future. I believe they want to live in a country where they are free to make their own decisions about where they live, where their children go to school, which organisations they join or do not join and how they organise their working lives. Nor do they want to live in a country where Nanny State tells them what is good for them, directs their lives and restricts their freedoms, and, as Nanny State so often does, punishes them when they do not behave as Nanny State decrees they must. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no doubt that a major contributor to the sorry condition of the Australian economy is the abysmal state of industrial relations and the ball and chain of the Higgins legacies of the early part of this century. How can a government which claims such great concern for the ordinary working people of this country exhibit such a contempt for those whom it takes for granted as its natural constituents?  The answer is, of course, that the pampered middle class trendoids who captured the Australian Labor Party in the 1960s and 1970s and now claim it as their own could not care less about the plight of the unemployed, the farmers or the small business people groaning under the weight of a burdensome state. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia's archaic and inefficient system of industrial relations must surely stand as one of the greatest contributors to our growing inability to compete on international markets. Horrendous overseas debt and uncontrolled spending just add to this. What this country needed in 1986, and what it needs now, is a new approach to the way we work and how we are rewarded for our labours. We do not need more legislation, we do not need more rules and we do not need more Fabian inspired government imposts on hapless employers. Those who have been brought up in the Henry Bournes Higgins fairyland of just prices, comparative wage justice and the explicit preference for bankruptcy or voluntary liquidation rather than market-based wages continue to refuse, just as Higgins refused, to accept the realities of a world where the law of supply and demand holds sway. </PARA>
<PARA>  Much can be learnt from looking at the Higgins era, when realities were ignored. The Higgins era in Australia began in the early days of the Federation with the now defunct Sunshine Harvester Company. In applying for a tariff protection under a new Commonwealth Act, H.V. McKay's Sunshine Harvester Works had to obtain a certificate from Higgins's Arbitration Court that the wages paid in the Sunshine plant were fair and reasonable. To be given the opportunity of deciding what was fair and reasonable was pure joy for Higgins. He summoned the housewives of Sunshine and required them to provide him with details of their household budgets. In hindsight, it is most regrettable that they did not tell this nosy social engineer to mind his own business or, in the words of Voltaire, to go and cultivate his own garden. </PARA>
<PARA>  Instead we read in the `new province for law and order' of the Sunshine housewives' weekly shopping list for 1906, which, when added to Higgins's own ideas of what was required for the working man's extramural expenses, totalled 42 shillings. Precisely how a judge of his status and background could determine the extramural expenses of a working man remains a shrouded mystery. Yet his findings ultimately resulted in a mandatory increase in wages for unskilled labour of over 20 per cent. At that time Australia's pound was tied to the gold standard and inflation was zero, or even negative. It took the breaking of the nexus to gold and the inflation of the Great War to reduce the level of unemployment amongst the unskilled to the level which prevailed prior to the catastrophic Harvester judgment of 1907. </PARA>
<PARA>  The legacy of eight decades of labour market regulation and centralised wage fixing, coupled with increased power of the trade union movement and its quest for monopoly rents, has resulted in the gradual impoverishment of this country and its citizens. In the cloistered world of the labour market regulators, however, the notion of competition and the suggestion that employers and employees might actually be capable of sorting out their own affairs, strikes at the very heart of the system of industrial relations in this country, not to mention the privilege enjoyed by those who have gained membership of that unashamedly elitist club, the IR club. </PARA>
<PARA>  In these circumstances, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for people who have been conscientiously and painstakingly administering an extremely complex system of price controls--which is what the labour market regulators are doing, in effect--to admit that their activities are not merely pointless but positively harmful. </PARA>
<PARA>  In his great work of Australia's economic history written in 1930, Edward Shann remarked:</PARA>
<PARA>The arbitration courts have been led on, pushed on and drawn into an increasingly elaborate rule over industry very widely defined. </PARA>
<PARA>Men may be expected to discover and brood over anomalies when benevolent justice may thus be moved to essay their correction. But industry and commerce are very complicated, and one may, in recent years, mark a certain weariness in the economic titans of the court. </PARA>
<PARA>Since the publication of Shann's words, the number of titans has continued to multiply greatly and the regulation of labour is spread over many people. The consequences of their decision making, however, are really understood only by those in export or import competing businesses. The egg and spoon race of the domestic economy is no yardstick of economic efficiencies. If business is to compete effectively in the international marketplace, the ball and chain of regulation must be removed. The first step in achieving this is the reform of industrial relations. This means enterprise bargaining, freedom of association, the right to establish new unions and the opening up of the labour market to those who have been excluded for so long. </PARA>
<PARA>  While this incompetent Government fiddles at the edges of our problems, the people of Australia burn. As our society is engulfed by the worst recession since the Great Depression, the Prime Minister and his colleagues sit on their hands--the pathetic captives of the ACTU and the new class social engineers. We do not need more government regulation; we do not need more government spending; we need leadership and a new province for employment and prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA>  Unemployment is a grave problem and should be addressed. We should not just be giving support to the unemployed, as this Budget does. On Monday the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) made a quite pathetic attempt to criticise my appeal to the Government to introduce a moratorium on debt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I think the honourable member is right. Perhaps he does not care that many of the nation's farmers are being forced off their land. Perhaps he does not care that the number of bankruptcies in the small business sector has reached record levels and is increasing. However, as the headline in today's Australian suggests, even the ACTU is concerned about the rising numbers of jobless. The ACTU knows unemployment is getting dramatically worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Of course it is getting worse. It is the consequence of multitudes of business failures. A cynic might say that it is not the least bit surprising that the Government's mates at the ACTU are attempting to assume the moral high ground and appear in the guise of deeply concerned advocates for the unemployed. Could it be that the ACTU would like to see these jobs in non-union enterprises? In reality, we all know that the crocodile tears of the ACTU are a front for a much more destructive agenda. Its main worry at the moment is the declining base of union membership. </PARA>
<PARA>  As David Clark recently pointed out in the Australian Financial Review, less than a third of private sector workers are union members, and since 1986 only about 8 per cent of new employees in the private sector have joined unions. So where are most unionists in 1991? One does not need to be a Rhodes scholar to work out the answer--of course, they are in the public sector. And where, one might ask, do the ACTU mates want their 200,000 new jobs to be created? It is easy to guess--not on the farms or in the small business sector; certainly not. No, what Kelty and Co. want is a return to the good old days of pump priming and Keynesian solutions of leaf raking exercises and make work schemes, none of which will produce any wealth or any real jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, there can be no genuine increase in employment unless the nation's wealth creating sector is freed from unnecessary interference and allowed to get on with the job that it does best, which is creating jobs and prosperity. So again I ask the Government to introduce a moratorium on debt for farmers and small business people. Something must be done to halt the haemorrhaging of our wealth creating sector. In recent times the farmer and the small businessman has become an endangered species. Many are threatened with extermination, while others have already fallen victim to the onslaught of the recession we had to have, high interest rates, rapacious creditors and an over-regulated labour market, and a system which has completely failed to deal with the corporate crooks of the 1980s. Connell, Skase and Bondy still travel first class. </PARA>

But their hapless victims are relentlessly pursued by those same financial institutions which were only too willing to lend vast sums of customers' money to the phoney entrepreneurs of the 1980s. Unless appropriate action is taken now, there is no doubt that there will be an ever increasing number of bankruptcies, while the human tragedy of poverty and unemployment will continue to stand as a monument to the weakness of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Inevitably, the consequences of the current situation are continued and are undermining the living standards and the ability of Australia to compete on world markets. A thriving business sector is the lifeblood of our nation. It is our future. It is our children's future. Australia needs its mines, it needs its farms and it needs its businesses. If the Government is sincere in its desire to do something to help the unemployed, it will not resile from taking the hard decisions, nor will it be seduced by the superficial and self- interested solutions advanced by Kelty and his mates at the Swanston Street soviet. </PARA>
<PARA>  In calling for a moratorium on debt, I am not supporting greater government interference in the economy, except to halt the tragic outcome of failed policies. Indeed, the policies of interference have contributed almost totally to this sorry state. The deliberate policies of high interest rates, the recession we had to have, the failure to deal with the nation's grossly over-regulated labour market and trade union immunity from common law have directly contributed to the problems of today. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unemployment is already at about one million, costing some $10 billion a year to support. Instead of allowing the unemployment figure to reach two million--costing $20 billion--we should protect real jobs. I repeat my assertion: the Government acted to support unlisted property trusts; it should and must act to support a section of the economy five to 10 times bigger than unlisted property trusts. If action is not taken, two million unemployed in Australia is inevitable, as our business base is obliterated. At this point recovery would be all but impossible. With no business base to speak of, the possibilities for growth and expansion are limited to say the least. I hope my plea is not ignored. I appeal for immediate action. </PARA>
<PARA>  Attention to micro-economic reform was abandoned back in 1906. Micro-economic reform is now well overdue; even the Budget considers it essential. I ask: where is it?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Last Friday evening, after attending an early official function, my wife and I decided it was a good opportunity to relax at the cinema. In the Australian that day, in the section headed `Recommended films', on which we have been wont to rely as a guide to quality films, the first film mentioned was Thelma and Louise. It was described, inter alia, as `wildly entertaining', `feminist'--that did not faze us--with `some brilliantly photographed desert scenery'. The review concluded on the note: `A terrific film'. The classification was M, as it is for a wide range of films today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I wish to comment on this film in the context of the controversy over gun laws in the wake of the recent Strathfield Plaza shopping centre killings. A small handgun made its appearance early in the film, almost incidental to what was going on at that time--Thelma packing to go away for a fun weekend with her friend Louise. Before long the gun was used to shoot and kill a would-be rapist--a maybe justifiable homicide. Next, after some vivid shots of the loading, it was used to carry out an armed robbery--easy to do, no problems. And hear this: when asked how she managed it, the reply was, `You learn how to do it from the TV'. </PARA>
<PARA>  The gun was again pulled on a traffic policeman who flagged them down for speeding. The policeman's own gun was added to the Thelma/Louise arsenal and shots were fired to blast his radio out of action; whereupon--with perhaps a touch of farce--the traffic policeman was locked in the boot of his car with the boot lid penetrated by a few further shots. The guns came into play again in an episode with a road tanker driver and his load of petrol, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>  The pair ended up committing a series of crimes--murder; armed robbery, possibly robberies; malicious damage, wilfully destroying, as the spectacular effect of handgun fire, a large fuel-carrying semitrailer; and more--for which long prison sentences or even the electric chair may have been the outcome. But of course there is not the slightest suggestion of that to the largely teenage audience. Even the suicide at the end was not presented, or thought of, as such--it was just a car ride to oblivion; a sort of chariot ride through the sky, fading out long before anything like a fatal impact took place. </PARA>
<PARA>  What concerns me is the impact of this on impressionable minds. All this is presented as being easy;  all in a day's work--perhaps, in the early stages, a somewhat frustrating, bitterly disappointing day's work. It was presented in a totally amoral way with the focus on a gun, and then guns, and the power so conferred by those guns. </PARA>
<PARA>  Such movies--in the cinema, on video and on television--are sources of very powerful and stimulating images and messages; messages conveying an impression that violence is, at least, `okay' and, at best, `great' as a source of very high levels of excitement. The thrills are further related to the exercise of power; especially the ultimate form--the holding of the power of life and death over another person. </PARA>
<PARA>  That brings me to an aspect I want to stress, that is, whereas for days after the Strathfield massacre the newspapers carried front page stories with headlines printed inches high suggesting that guns must be banned, it was hard to find anything in print or hear anything said about the violence which is so realistic these days--the graphic, stimulating, so readily available, depiction of violence, and especially the power of the gun, that we are confronted with daily. </PARA>
<PARA>  As my colleague the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) said in this place the other day, this community--this country--is faced with a serious problem which is particularly threatening to the women and children of Australia. It is a problem distinct from, although undoubtedly exacerbated by, the unacceptably high level of unemployment and deprivation caused by the recession in this country. It is a serious problem which the country has barely begun to grapple with.</PARA>
<PARA>  As the honourable member pointed out from the basis of long experience, while the majority of people may be little affected--and I have a great belief in the moral fibre of my fellow Australians--that still leaves many people in our community who have a relatively low level of control over impulses to violence, sexual assault and so on and it only takes the final stimulus of a video or such like to spark them off to commit a serious crime. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our community has become a much more dangerous place and commonsense is enough to tell us that the impact and effects of violent videos, movies and publications are a major factor in the serious situation that confront us. No doubt, there must be merit in the film I described, but that only underlines the complexity of the issue. I join with my colleague in calling upon the men and women of Australia to rise up against this evil that strikes at the very heart of our society today and threatens a lesser and more dangerous society for our children to grow up in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have been perplexed by the insistence of the Liberal Party of Australia that it will, on the twenty-fifth of this month, announce its plans for the consumption tax. I was further perplexed by the fact that so many honourable members opposite intend to pursue this course, despite the obvious unpopularity of such a tax and the resistance they have encountered at every party meeting in getting it through. So I took the opportunity to publish a small pamphlet on the subject, pointing out what is wrong with a consumption tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Among other things, in the pamphlet I puzzle on the question as to why those opposite should want to introduce such an unpopular tax in such a climate which will ensure their defeat at the next election. Self-immolation may have been quite popular in other circumstances, but in this circumstance it seems so irrational that a former academic like myself has had to undertake research to find out why they should bother to do this. </PARA>
<PARA>  What do I find, Mr Deputy Speaker? I find that it is the case that many other rich countries have a consumption tax, but that Australia does not. However, we have a mix of indirect and direct taxes which are very similar to those of other OECD countries. Other arguments put forward include, for instance, the fact that a consumption tax will increase the nation's savings. I am very much in favour of improving the nation's savings and I am very happy to note that our superannuation scheme is producing precisely that effect. A consumption tax, however, will do nothing to improve the nation's savings.  I note that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) admitted as much on 13 April 1990 in the Sydney Morning Herald. He said that not only would it not increase the nation's savings; it would almost certainly reduce them.   Those opposite also argue that it might reduce tax avoidance. It is interesting that they should argue this when they wish to reduce those very labour reforms which have already reduced tax avoidance--such as capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax. In any case, the mere imposition of a consumption tax does not prevent the sale of goods and services at a discount when cash is tendered. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also find the argument that a consumption tax will be easier to administer. This, again, is fallacious. The wholesale sales tax is not costly to administer and involves only 75,000 taxpayers. The consumption tax would involve just about everybody who undertakes the sale or purchase of goods or services in this country being a tax collection agency for the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also need to take into account the social justice implications of such a consumption tax. The effect of it would be, essentially, to reduce the costs of luxuries which are presently taxed at a rate higher than 15 per cent--which is the rate at which the Liberals sometimes say they will introduce a consumption tax. Of course, often they say it will be at 22 per cent--it is difficult to be sure until the twenty-fifth. The cost of the necessities of life, which are presently exempt from wholesale tax, would go up by a similar amount. </PARA>
<PARA>  What would be the effect? We would have no way of compensating retirees who are living off their life savings for the reduction in the purchasing power of their savings that would result from this. For example, a 15 per cent consumption tax, with a big price rise of somewhere around 7 per cent, means a cut in the real value of the savings of superannuants and retirees who are living off their savings of 7 to 10 per cent--something they will never recover from. </PARA>
<PARA>  All of this is well known in the community. Eric Risstrom, the national director of the Australian Taxpayers Association, said that the purchasing power of superannuation, life insurance policies and savings would be ripped away. He added that the coalition would not win the next Federal election if it vowed to introduce a consumption tax. Another impeccable source--the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission--on 15 February 1991 expressed the gravest doubts about the equity or efficiency of expanding indirect taxation. In particular, it noted that a broad-based consumption tax, such as a goods and services tax, would impose more taxes on the poor. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to ask ourselves, against the logic that I have just presented, why the honourable gentlemen opposite wish to introduce a consumption tax. None of the arguments they have put forward work. We are left with two possibilities: one is that they wish to reward their yuppie supporters in the sub-branches of the leafy glades of the rich suburbs of our major capital cities with a big boost in income and that was the only thing they could think up; the other much more significant factor is that they have a political novice as a leader who is a hairshirt free market economist who has committed himself and, therefore, his party to a consumption tax. Therefore, all those politicians who do not want to argue for it will have to argue for it at the next election and go down, self-immolating, in flames. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am delighted to see that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) is at the table because what I have to say falls very much into his portfolio. Over the last couple of weeks I have received a number of letters from concerned professional photographers in my electorate about restrictions imposed in Uluru National Park. I would like to quote from one of those letters. It states, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>As a member of the Australian Institute of Professional Photography I wish to protest most strongly at the draconian restrictions governing the taking of non-advertising photographs in the Uluru National Park which have been progressively introduced since the hand over of Land Titles to the Aboriginal people in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA>  These restrictions have been implemented without any discussion whatsoever with the people they affect and without any inclusion in any Plan of Management document, the purpose of which is supposed to take into account input from the wider community before new rules and regulations are introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>  The latest Draft Plan of Management (June 1991), did not include any written guidelines concerning landscape or editorial photography. It simply stated that all photography could be within the guidelines issued, without seeking any input from the public and photographers in general, and without any thought for the livelihood of professional photographers. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst making it illegal for landscape and editorial photographers to photograph certain areas, these very same places are shown to the public (including Aboriginal people) in the Visitors Display Centre at Yulara. These photographs are enlarged to an enormous size for all to see and include images taken on top of Uluru. . . and until the middle of this year, the inside of the Olgas. These images have been on display since about 1984 when Yulara was opened. </PARA>
<PARA>  The wider implications of these restrictions have obviously not been thought through. Once established as guidelines for Uluru, the same procedures will almost certainly be applied in Kakadu, and then other National Parks in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am sure that you will agree that the restrictions place unacceptable restraints on the rights of individuals to appreciate and enjoy one of the most beautiful parts of Australia and also to help others to understand an area which is unique in global terms. The Olgas and Ayers Rock are a geological gift to the planet, and, as such, should be freely enjoyed by everyone. </PARA>
<PARA>  I, and my associate photographers, believe that the great majority of both the Olgas and Ayers Rock should be made available to ALL photographers and also that it is most unfair that the religious views of a minority group can be forced onto a majority who do not necessarily share these same views. </PARA>
<PARA>  In view of the above, I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to reverse these draconian regulations in order to create a fair and equitable situation for all concerned, and I look forward to a favourable reply. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply ask the Minister at the table to look into these matters and to advise the House and, hopefully, me of the rationale underlying these decisions. On the face of it, this letter and others highlight that some anomalies do indeed exist; they need to be addressed and, hopefully, corrected. I hope that the Minister will take these on board and pave the way for a more equitable outcome. On a separate subject, I cannot let the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) get away scot free on the question of a goods and services tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- Tonight I feel very sorry for the eight members of the Opposition on the other side of the House because they have been made the bunnies by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer). While they are sitting there trying to defend a goods and services tax--that is, a tax on food and clothes--and they do not know at what level it will be set, there is a hayseed from the Northern Territory, a CLP candidate, who does know the level of tax. He is one Arthur Palmer, who was interviewed today on radio. This young fellow said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . and I can assure you, and your listeners, that it will not be above 15 per cent and that's an assurance that I have directly from the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>He stated further:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I'm quite properly being briefed very extensively by both Peter Reith and Dr Hewson and also Tim Fischer, particularly Tim Fischer. </PARA>
<PARA>But the poor bunnies on the other side of the House who have to go out and wear this and tell their constituents how they will be better off by having a 15 per cent tax on all food, clothes and services do not know about it. One Arthur Palmer is obviously seen as a genius by the conservatives, because he has been given knowledge and information that no-one else on the other side of the House has. It just goes to show where the direction and continuity of those opposite is. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note that the National Party in particular is bitterly divided over the consumption tax, a tax that would force struggling farmers to the wall. It is ironic that people on the other side of the House get up and complain. Before I came into the House I did some quick sums. Bundaberg produces $135m worth of fruit and vegetables a year and honourable members opposite want to put a tax of 15 per cent, which is $20m, onto the backs of the farmers up there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Most of his former colleagues in Queensland are behind iron bars. I return to the real facts and the tax on food and clothing. I ask the honourable member for Groom to stand up in Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley and tell the farmers that he is going to take 15 per cent out of their incomes, because that is what will happen. It will happen for one very simple reason that surely even honourable members opposite can understand. If a housewife has $100 to spend on fruit and vegetables, whether it be over a week, a month or six weeks, and the Opposition puts a 15 per cent tax on those items, that 15 per cent will not go back into the pockets of the farmers; it will go back into Consolidated Revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Opposition will put a tax on fruit, vegetables and meat, items which are not taxed at the present time. These items are the very foundation of the staple diet that Australians need to exist and for their kids to develop. People will have to pay 15 per cent from the very minute that a child is born. Opposition members should tell the people with money in the bank that their money will be devalued by 15 per cent, because all their savings will lose 15 per cent the day the Opposition introduces a consumption tax. They should tell the people who want to buy a home that 15 per cent will be put on top of the cost of housing. Opposition members have the audacity to stand up in this House and say that they care about families and working men and women. They do not. They are butlers for the rich. All they want to do is reduce the revenue that comes from those people who can best afford to pay in this country and put the burden onto the backs of the working men and women of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are well aware, I regularly address this House on the difficulties being faced by my constituents and the dramatic effects that the depression is having on my electorate. It gives me no joy to address two new issues that further threaten my region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The first is the outrageous Budget decision of the Kirner Labor Government to close the Creswick hospital and convert it to a nursing home. The nursing home proposal comes after three years of discussions between the Health Department and the hospital regarding redevelopment plans that included an expanded, not reduced, role for the hospital. I believe that it is an absolute disgrace that hospital management, the Chief Executive Officer, Chris Ward, and the head of nursing, Maree Rodini, were not given any forewarning of the Budget decision. A meeting had been held some two or three weeks prior to the Budget and at no stage was there any mention of the proposal. The hospital board, the people of Creswick and I do not believe for one minute that the decision to close the hospital had not been made well prior to that meeting. In light of that, the pre-Budget maneuverings of the Health Department and the Minister are nothing short of deceitful and the Minister should immediately discontinue the closure plans. </PARA>
<PARA>  By way of background, it is important for the House to know that the redevelopment proposal was initiated by the Department in 1988, involving a role conversion from the then 36 acute beds to 10 acute and 20 nursing home beds. The redevelopment was also intended to include the retention of midwifery, the development of the day care centre, a community health component and retention of outpatient care. At the end of 1989 the then Health Minister, Caroline Hogg, visited the hospital and gave an assurance that funding would be received in the 1990-91 Budget. The Chief Executive Officer, Mr Chris Ward, has stated that prior to the commencement of the project in 1988, until 1 p.m. on Tuesday 27 August of this year, the hospital board and the Creswick community had been led to believe by the Department and the Ministers that the project was top priority. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some $182,282.15 has been spent on the redevelopment project and, on top of that, there has been an extraordinary amount of work put in by hospital board members, hospital staff and Health Department staff. The community of Creswick is justifiably outraged over these closure plans. The hospital board has decided to form an action subcommittee which consists of the president, Ernie Robinson, Maree Rodoni, Chris Ward and board members Colin Wrigley and Joan McMillan. At a public meeting in Creswick last Wednesday, nearly 1,000 people attended and showed their anger. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of great concern to me is a statement attributed to the regional director of the Central Highlands Wimmera Region at the meeting that Victoria could no longer afford the standard of health care that it has been used to. The statement is a tragic indictment of the State Labor Government and it is not surprising that bumper stickers are now being displayed bearing the slogan `Creswick Hospital--Shame Labor, you lied'. I attended the first crisis meeting held after the Budget announcement and the hospital board, the hospital staff and the people of the Creswick region know that they have my total and ongoing support. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other matter I wish to address in the time left to me this evening concerns the future of the Ballarat airport. The Government has been desperate to curtail ALOP funding, thereby throwing the sole responsibility for local airports back onto local government municipalities. I am the first to admit that some restructuring has been, and is, appropriate, but airports of regional importance such as those at Ballarat and Stawell have been lumped in with smaller airports whose regional importance is minimal. </PARA>
<PARA>  The latest move by the Government in this campaign of airport responsibility divestiture is the recent move by the Civil Aviation Authority in relation to licences. The CAA has now proposed that in order to hold a licence, airports must be used regularly by aircraft seating more than 30 passengers or be engaged in scheduled or chartered public transport operations. The catch-22 here is that, without a licence, the Federal Government subsidy--in the case of the Ballarat airport, to the tune of $50,000 plus capital works--is at risk. </PARA>
<PARA>  Councillor Barbara Hughes, the Shire President of the Shire of Ballarat, and Mr Rex Hollioake, the Shire Engineer, are naturally extremely concerned about the situation at the Ballarat airport. With only minimal usage by aeroplanes with a seating capacity of more than 30 and no charter service, the airport's future is grim under the proposed licensing conditions. Mr Hollioake has quite rightly described the proposal as another ploy to force the Ballarat airport out of its $50,000 subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Councillor Hughes and her council are enraged by the ploy and the dramatic effect that it will have on the airport's viability. This viability threat has significant implications for the region. A closure, for example, may deny air ambulance availability as well as aerial firefighting and aerial fire spotting capabilities. Both MAF-Air and Field Air have operated from the airport for some 30 years. Between them they employ 50 or 60 people. Regrettably, those jobs are very gravely at risk. </PARA>

I put it to honourable members opposite that we are seeking to introduce into Australia a completely new tax system which will be fair and equitable.</PARA></TALK.START>

Honourable members opposite are running scared on this issue simply because they know that this is the right decision to make for this country. If I take honourable members back to 1985 they will recall that both the Treasurer at the time, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) were running around this country saying that we should have a consumption tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to take the opportunity to respond briefly to the matter raised by the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). In doing so, I hope he will appreciate that in the short time available to me I can give only a preliminary response to the matters he has raised. These matters also fall within the portfolio of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), and I will be seeking further information from her in relation to the matters raised by the honourable member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I have received preliminary advice from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission that the protocols for the taking of commercial photographs in the Uluru National Park were developed following extensive consultations between the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which operates the park, the Mutitjulu community, representing the traditional owners who live in the park, and the board of management, which has responsibility for managing the park. I understand that those protocols are not of recent origin but have been in place for some time. I think they date back to 1987. I understand that those protocols are now under review as part of the latest proposal for a new five-year plan of management of the park, as set down in the original lease-back agreement.   I am aware also, from letters that I have received, that the Australian Institute of Professional Photography has been conducting what I think might be called a campaign to have these protocols altered, and that this campaign is particularly active in view of the fact that the new draft plan of management is being renegotiated. I am advised further that the introduction of the original prohibition was motivated, at least in part, by a concern among the Aboriginal community that photographs of certain places should not be seen by other Aboriginal people who have not gone through the level of tribal law that enables them to see those sites. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will make a number of other brief comments in concluding my preliminary advice to the honourable member. First of all, I appreciate that these concerns of Aboriginal people are not readily understood by non-Aboriginal Australians. They are concerns based on tribal and spiritual beliefs which are very different from the spiritual beliefs held by non- Aboriginal Australians. I recognise that it is legitimate for the Institute of Professional Photography to make its concerns known to the Parliament and to the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA>  The only additional comment I make is that obviously these are sensitive matters, and I only hope that, in drawing attention to concerns about the issues which are the subject matter of the campaign, the Institute will conduct itself in such a way so as not to diminish the respect that non-Aboriginal Australians ought to have for Aboriginal people. I hope that when honourable members raise these matters they can be dealt with in the most constructive manner possible. From what I heard of the remarks of the honourable member for Groom, I think that he couched his remarks in those terms. I will undertake to provide him with further information at the earliest available opportunity. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1183" SPEAKER="Griffiths The Hon A.G." NAMEID="0H4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GWYDIR">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr Griffiths</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) No former staff member of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy employed by Ernst and Young is involved in the independent consultancy which I have commissioned on AQIS' corporate form and management arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) AQIS provides inspectors on both full-time and part-time arrangements at export abattoirs, export boning rooms, domestic abattoirs and domestic type boning rooms cold stores and meat products establishments. For the week ended 11 June 1991 there were 311 of these establishments. Staffing levels and average staffing requirements vary from time to time according to seasonal and other variables etc.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) From 1 July 1990 to 17 May 1991, the total number of species processed in the categories nominated by the honourable member were:</PARA>
<PARA>  (a) pigs--3,443,896</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) sheep--17,269,560</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) goats--766,307</PARA>
<PARA>  (d) cattle--5,870,644</PARA>
<PARA>  To determine the average number of each species inspected per day by each inspector as requested by the honourable member, would entail a detailed examination of each shed, the type of species processed and the number of inspectors assigned to each shed. I am not persuaded that it would serve the public interest to devote the large staff resources necessary to undertake this task.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) Yes, there are occasions where meat establishments do require fewer inspectors than reside in the locality. This can occur as a result of fluctuations in throughput and seasonal differences. AQIS seeks to provide an effective and efficient service and relief staff are headquartered at some establishments to service those plants in that Region during times of authorised leave and during training of staff.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) AQIS has not solicited the views of particular organisations on the charging regime nor has it received any unsolicited expressions of complete satisfaction with the charging regime.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) AQIS has no information which would allow it to determine if the two veterinary officers who inspected carcasses at the Cowra abattoir on 16 April carried out full inspection procedures of the kind which AQIS inspectors are required to carry out by law.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) If the honourable member means by `quarantine inspection' the activity of meat inspection in the USA, that cost is met by the US administration except for overtime and non-core activities. Quarantine Inspection fees in the USA are currently borne by the government.</PARA>
<PARA>  (8) Government inspection and certification of meat and meat products for export is undertaken to meet the requirements of importing countries for access to their markets. It is the Government's view that the beneficiary of meat inspection in the export area is the export meat industry and consequently it should bear the cost of this service. Australia is not alone in requiring industry to pay for inspection services. Both New Zealand and Argentina have full cost recovery regimes in place, while the European Community has from 1 January 1991, required member countries to charge for inspection services. Rather than being placed at a competitive disadvantage, Australian meat exporters are advantaged by having an efficient and internationally respected organisation undertaking meat inspection, thereby guaranteeing access to world markets.</PARA>
<PARA>(9)          (A) 1987-88  (B) 1988-89  (C) 1989-90  (D) 1990-91</PARA>
<PARA>  (a)  The number of inspectors employed</PARA>
<PARA>      for the periods requested are as</PARA>
<PARA>      follows: (* average staffing levels)  *2021  *1946  *1852  *1720</PARA>
<PARA>  (b)  (i)  total salary paid to them  $51,685,548  $60,106,362  $63,887,040 $61,190,456</PARA>
<PARA>      (ii)  travel allow.  $2,640,590  $4,153,947  not id/fiable  not id/fiable</PARA>
<PARA>  (c)  Sum in inspection fees recovered</PARA>
<PARA>      from the meat industry  $49,925,000  $52,186,801  $54,373,339 $65,630,000</PARA>
<PARA>  (10) Higher chain speeds and longer production runs now call for scientifically based process controls and statistically based feed back on quality performance. AQIS has been progressively utilising statistically based risk assessment and quality assurance techniques for inspection regimes including meat, since 1987 to ensure that only products conforming to prescribed specifications and stringent regulatory requirements, reach the end of the production line.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable Member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The 13th World Congress of the International Organisation of Consumer Unions (IOCU) in July 1991 considered the following motion:</PARA>
<PARA>    `Irradiation as a method of reducing food borne disease has not yet been proved to be sufficiently safe, especially for long term use. It is yet to be demonstrated satisfactorily that irradiation would contribute significantly to the reduction of food borne diseases, to improvement in the world supply of foods, or to the economic benefit of exporting countries as claimed by the proponents of the process.</PARA>
<PARA>    `There is currently no simple and economical way of detecting whether food has been irradiated and there can therefore be no guarantee that labelling requirements are being met, or would be properly observed. Irradiation has been used illegally as a means of treating contaminated food that was unsafe for human consumption and there are insufficient safeguards against its misuse, and the possibilities of re-irradiation.</PARA>
<PARA>    `Irradiation is a costly process that would raise the cost of food and its extensive use would increase the risks of accidents at the plants and during any transportation of nuclear materials.'</PARA>

<PARA>    REAFFIRMED its opposition to the use of irradiation and its commitment to a moratorium on the process until the outstanding safety questions are satisfactorily answered and the need for its use demonstrated;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The National Rail Corporation (NRC) will be incorporated under the Companies Code as a strictly commercial corporation at arms-length from government. It will prepare its accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Operational and commercial matters such as accounting systems will be a matter for the commercial judgement of the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Operational matters such as investment decisions, sources of financing and the relative margins on various services, products and corridors will be commercial matters for the NRC Board and management to determine, in the same way as would any privately owned corporation established under the Companies Code.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) The relationship between the Governments who are shareholders of the NRC and the corporation is determined by the provisions of the Companies Code and the Articles of Association. In keeping with the commercial model adopted, the shareholders' role is limited to strategic oversight, through approval of the Corporate Plan, and does not extend to operational issues such as pricing. It is also worth noting in this context that Directors of the NRC will be required, under the Companies Code provisions, to act in the interests of all shareholders. The NRC also will be subject to the laws of the Commonwealth and relevant states, on the same basis as any privately owned company.</PARA>
