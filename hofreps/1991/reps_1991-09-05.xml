<TITLE>Petition Against Government Funding of Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned Australian citizens shows that:</PARA>
<PARA>    Every abortion kills an unborn human baby. More unborn Australians are killed every year (80,000) than the Australian death toll for the whole of World War II (30,000).</PARA>
<PARA>    Australia's population is aging. Our live birth rate is below replacement level.</PARA>
<PARA>    About 98 percent of abortions in Australia are performed for non-medical reasons (see SA Health Commission statistics).</PARA>
<PARA>    Post abortion depression is a silent epidemic and is linked with the growing incidence of child abuse by mothers who have previously had abortions.</PARA>
<PARA>    The Australian Government should not fund the killing of future Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA>    Mothers with problem pregnancies need positive help to carry their babies to full term.</PARA>
<PARA>    Your petitioners therefore pray that your Honourable House will:</PARA>
<PARA>    pass the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 1990, and</PARA>
<PARA>  help pregnant women with problems to continue their pregnancies.</PARA>
<PARA>  And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA>  The petition of the undersigned respectfully shows:</PARA>

<PARA>  The petition of the undersigned shows the very deep concern of people in the community against the proposed AIDEX exhibition of weapons of war in our country.

Particularly at this time when our planet's environment is in a parlous condition and demands statesman-like leadership to the world on its rehabilitation. We therefore ask that:-</PARA>
<PARA>  The Exhibition to take place be one which shows instead the ways in which we aim to overcome the dangers to our world from poisoned soil, air and water by high-lighting the need for tree-planting, solar-powered homes, electric cars, etc. as a means of attacking the global warming and other hazards to our fragile environment.</PARA>

<PARA>  The Petition of the certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their deep concern that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child:</PARA>

<TITLE>Brisbane Airport Task Force</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA>  We, the undersigned petitioners, reject the final report of the Brisbane Airport Task Force, because it failed in its basic charter to "minimise the impact of aircraft noise on surround communities."</PARA>
<PARA>  It failed to recommend their own conclusions that an extended Cross Runway would "significantly reduce aircraft noise" and that an extended cross runway could operate as the "main or supplementary runway", which, along with the Main Runway would enable 80% or more planes to go in and out over Moreton Bay, as promised. Although it rejected these solutions because the cost would be $105 million, it recommended that a further Parallel Runway be built at a cost of $395 million (today's price) which could escalate to double or more in 15 to 20 years, thus forcing north and southside citizens to suffer increasing aircraft noise with no end in sight.</PARA>
<PARA>  We urgently request that money be made available for an extended Cross Runway as the most cost effective and practical solution to Brisbane Airport noise and safety.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This special report to Parliament essentially comprises two letters written to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) from the Committee. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, as part of its terms of reference, has determined that where necessary and appropriate it will provide advice to the Minister on matters where, for reasons of urgency or otherwise, it is not practicable to await the tabling of a report to Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Often issues of concern to the Committee arise during the course of an inquiry. However, sometimes issues not the subject of specific inquiry are considered and, if it is decided that further consideration is warranted by the Minister and his Department and possible amendment required, the Committee has agreed that it will notify the Minister accordingly. The Committee has further determined that any such letters of advice will be tabled in Parliament at the earliest opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>  Prior to July 1991, only one such letter had been transmitted to the Minister. This was included in the report to Parliament called Change of Status tabled in May of this year. That letter included a number of recommendations relating to the Committee's inquiry into change of status on marriage or de facto grounds, recommendations which the Committee was concerned to put to the Minister prior to a deadline of 30 November 1990 and before it was possible to finalise its report on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA>  This special report includes two letters of advice, one on the current refugee- humanitarian arrangements and one relating to a number of other issues. The former arose out of the Committee's current inquiry into the refugee-humanitarian arrangements and the latter was prompted by correspondence to the Committee, direct references from the Minister's office and a consideration of issues arising from decisions of the Immigration Review Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>  The major issues dealt with in the second of the two letters include: the section 121 aggregation procedure; the balance of family test; certain requirements relating to the family extended eligibility temporary entry permit; special need relatives; and the complexity of the immigration legal system. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the last point I must emphasise the continuing difficulties experienced by everyone who comes into contact with the immigration process as a result of the very complex nature of the system. The Committee is of the view that this problem must be rectified before the regulatory process is properly workable. I thank the members of the Committee and the staff and I commend the report to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- Thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. What needs to be understood is that this special report is before us because there is a great deal of urgency attached to the issues raised and that to leave these matters without their being addressed would certainly not be in the national interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The first letter to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), which deals with the evidence taken to this point in time in relation to the refugee and humanitarian inquiry, deals with one particular aspect of an issue that is of the utmost importance to this nation at this time. It arises because the fact is that the whole question of refugee determination and related humanitarian issues is leading to a situation where our ability to effectively control entry to this country is severely at risk. It needs to be understood that this report is written against that background.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee raised with the Minister certain very positive initiatives that might be undertaken to get to the point where applications for refugee status are promptly dealt with--that claims, where they exist, are promptly put before the Department and that there are certain time limits involved in relation to that; that the Government provide advice and counsel to those so that they are able to meet deadlines; and that border claimants--boat people particularly--be given priority in assessment of their claims. We indicated that there ought to be a time limit for dealing with boat people of about three months, that a target time should be set. </PARA>
<PARA>  Why these recommendations? The reason is very clear. At this time, we have over 300 undocumented arrivals in Australia that have been languishing in camps for something like 18 months. To this point in time their claims have not been dealt with. We know that there are some people who have come to Australia later in time after the first arrivals who are clutching in their hands letters stating, `Look, we have got here safely. We are in Australia now. Our immediate needs have been met and our children are receiving some education in English and nothing seems to be happening. Nobody is sending us back--it looks all right'. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fact is that that is the message that is going out right now. It is occasioned by a far greater risk. At this time, we have 17,500 people in Australia who are making claims for refugee status. That probably understates the size of the problem. Even with all the additional resources, such as the 300 additional staff to undertake this processing, that the Minister has been able to muster out of the Government and all the advice attached to the estimates that have now been given to us associated with this Budget, the Government will be able to deal with only 3,000 cases through all stages of processing. That means that, as each person presses the claim and presses the Government, the time that it takes to process claimants for refugee status will extend. The prospect is that the processing will take probably five to seven years. That sends out a message to people who are anxious to stay here--that all they have to do is put in a claim for refugee status and wait out the time. </PARA>
<PARA>  Then there is the absorption argument that we have heard before in this House: after people have been here for five or six years, it is unreasonable to send them back; it is unreasonable because they have come to rely upon the support of family and communities; it is unreasonable because their children have been receiving an education in English and they have become absorbed into the Australian community. We are dealing with a very major problem about our ability to control or own borders. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not mean to be alarmist about these things because it is not my style in relation to handling immigration questions. At some point in time, unless the right decisions are taken and these matters are dealt with quickly, resolutely, sensitively and sensibly, acknowledging our commitments under the international covenants, we run the risk that one day somebody will commandeer a larger vessel and arrive in Darwin and we will have numbers of a size that we just cannot manage. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is what happened recently in Italy. The Italians showed that they had no resolve and that they were not handling these issues in relation to their own border. They had thousands of people. We have all seen what has happened. It is not impossible to imagine that that could happen in Australia today. That is the warning that I have been sounding to this Government. It is the warning that I have been giving every day that I get the opportunity. The fact is that we are at this time out of control in relation to our ability to handle our own border arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am not without ideas in relation to how these things can be handled. The other day I wrote to the Chairman of Radio Australia, Mr Richard Broinowski. It seemed to me that this question of the way in which we deal with refugee matters is not clearly understood. It seems to me that it would be perfectly proper and appropriate for Australia to have Khmer language programs in which accurate information about people's entitlements, the testing that is undertaken and the claims that they have to substantiate are put clearly before them so that they know that it is not an easy path and so that they know they will be returned if they are not bona fide. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am told that putting in place on Radio Australia a program in Khmer where this accurate information could be provided again is not a priority for this Government. Radio Australia does not have the funds to be able to undertake this task. It is more important that we have language programs in French, German and other European languages rather than addressing an immediate and pressing problem in our own region right now. </PARA>
<PARA>  This report is part of the bipartisan effort to give the Minister advice. I note, positively, that in relation to the recommendations on time limits the Minister did act. In relation to the recommendations in regard to providing, particularly to legal aid commissions and refugee and advice case work services, I noticed that additional funds were provided in the Budget. I commend the Minister for taking up those recommendations from the Committee as promptly as he did, this letter having been sent to him a little while ago. </PARA>
<PARA>  Likewise, the second letter deals with amendments to the Migration Act and regulations that we have suggested to the Minister might be helpful. The letter deals with specific areas of detail--the aggregation question in section 121; the application of the balance of family test; the extended eligibility of temporary entry permits in family situations; special need relatives; and the complexity of the Migration Act and scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee remains concerned about the failure of the Government to address this question promptly. We have been promised for over 12 months that there would be a redraft of the regulatory scheme in order to simplify it and make it understandable. Regrettably, to date we have seen no sign of those new proposed regulations. While we are still tinkering at the edges, the fact is that enormous technical difficulties are being presented day by day. People appear before the Immigration Review Tribunal to present their cases. The circumstances are understood. However, the Tribunal is unhappy. I think most of us would be equally concerned in terms of some of the decisions that are taken. For instance, we have made recommendations in relation to the balance of family test. In particular, we have addressed the issue of aged parents who might be sponsored by relatives in Australia. The way in which step-children are counted along with children of a marriage can, in certain circumstances, lead to hardship. This matter needs to be addressed by this Government. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the House take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak about report No. 310 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts entitled Business Migration Program. I think this report of the Public Accounts Committee is probably unique. It was tabled in the Parliament on 21 June this year with a number of very significant recommendations, the foremost being that the business migration program should be abolished. That action was actually taken by the Government on 25 July. So the major recommendation of the Committee was accepted by the Government and acted upon between 21 June and 25 July. </PARA>
<PARA>  The accredited agents scheme, which has been abolished, was introduced on 1 July 1988. The scheme was designed as a self- financing means of providing counselling services and assessment of applications for business migrants. Its principal purpose, I suppose, was to give the Government a measure of control over the activities of private sector consultants who were assisting business migrants with their applications for settlement in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  It became very evident from the evidence presented to the Committee that there were a great many shortcomings in that scheme. The evidence identified two concerns in particular about the operations of subagents. The Committee felt that this arrangement had a significant impact on the selection of business migrants. The subagencies operated outside Australia, were owned and operated by foreign nationals and were beyond the control of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other concern was the reliance that accredited agents in Australia placed on the subagencies to assist in the generation of business migration applications just to maintain the viability of the agencies. We very quickly came to the conclusion that the BMP was very vulnerable to abuse. That vulnerability was exploited in two main ways: first, by the use of illicit means such as false and forged documentation to obtain a business migration program visa; and, secondly, by the agents' focus on selling the BMP to applicants rather than concentrating on assessing the applicants' backgrounds and suitability for migration under that program. So what we had was a distortion in the way the program operated in that it sought not to benefit Australia as such but to benefit the individual migrants who were seeking to come here. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was also interesting to look at the source countries because, obviously, the business migration program had as its objective to obtain business migrants from all over the world. Looking at the countries from which business migrants came for the period July 1982 to March 1990, we find that 32.29 per cent came from Hong Kong, 15.33 per cent from Taiwan, 12.04 per cent from Malaysia, 5.57 per cent from Indonesia, 4.78 per cent from Singapore, and 4.5 per cent from South Korea. So a total of approximately 75 per cent of all business migrants who came here under this program came from the South East Asian area, with particular emphasis on Hong Kong and Taiwan, which accounted for nearly 50 per cent of all business migrants coming here. </PARA>
<PARA>  The major recommendation, apart from the abolition of the old scheme, was that there should, in fact, be a positive response and that a new scheme should be introduced. We recommended that the migration program should continue to have a category of entry which recognised business and entrepreneurial skills as eligible criteria for entry to Australia, because we believe that it is absolutely essential that we maintain the flow of entrepreneurs to this country--that we maintain the flow of migrants who can make a contribution in more than one way. There was a public perception--whether it be true or false--that a great many of the migrants coming here are going to be drains on our economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The positive thing about the recommendation of the Committee was that we are seeking to have a new scheme of business and entrepreneurial skills. The primary purpose of this entry category would be to introduce to this country migrants who would actually establish a business in Australia. It was quite obvious in the evaluation of the previous scheme that, while money came in, there was not a great deal of action taken in actually starting new businesses. Money came in and, of course, there were allegations that money went out again, too--that there was laundering of money. There is some evidence--not a great deal--to suggest that that is true, but not only of business migrants. This has been happening with other migrants as well. So there is definitely a need to tighten up and to make sure that Australia, in bringing business migrants in, actually receives--to coin a phrase--value for money. </PARA>
<PARA>  We recommended that there should be a category of entry that recognises business skills as criteria for entry to Australia, that that category of entry should be based on the assessment of business skills developed to replace the business migration program and that, first and foremost, the establishment of a business in Australia should be one of the major objectives of this category of migration. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also thought that it was appropriate that there should be a separate points test for the age qualification. For any migrant coming to Australia there is a table of points. In age it starts at 18 to 29 years and in that age group people get 30 points. If one was 50 years or more one would get zero points for age. I point out to the House that, if the Prime Minister were to be assessed as a migrant coming to Australia, while he would undoubtedly get points for language skills, he would get zero points for age. When assessing this new provision which the Committee has recommended, I think we have to make allowance and give credit for experience and for wisdom. It is all too common in our society to denigrate knowledge--we tend to throw experience out the window. So I was very pleased, personally, that the Committee made the recommendation that there should be a separate points test for age qualification. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also note that in the Australian Financial Review of 27 August this year there was a story headed, `Migration agents call for government regulation'. In that story Australian migration agents indicated that they would urge the Federal Government to regulate their industry under new rules prepared for business migration. Such a step should be followed. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we are going to have a new form of accreditation, we have to be a little more careful and stringent in appointing agents. The national president of the Australian Migration Consultants Association, Mr John Gillespie, said that his Association would suggest that the Government issue licences to agents after taking into account their competence and standing, and that only those licensed agents could accept fees from prospective migrants and lodge claims. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have grave doubts about that system. I base those doubts on having seen prospective migrants in my electorate who have paid fees of $3,000 to some people just to fill in a form which could be filled in by my staff for nothing. If we are going to have a licensing scheme for agents it is essential that it provide control for the benefit not only of the prospective migrant but also for Australia as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I support and welcome the report on the business migration program by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I congratulate the Committee members for the work they have done on this program. The report was long overdue. Over a number of years there have been allegations and suggestions about the potential abuse of the business migration program. It is unfortunate that the warnings about the operation of the program were ignored and that in the end the whole program had to be abolished. Had the problems concerning the business migration program been taken up and had amendments been put in place to fix up some of them, it may have been possible to retain the program rather than end up in the situation we are in now where the whole program has been abolished.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Way back in 1986 the Caucus immigration committee was presented with evidence about problems concerning the business migration program. At that time we were assured by the Department of Immigration that these problems were under control and that many of the alleged malpractices were not taking place. The matter was again raised in 1988 in the Caucus immigration committee, and again further assurances were sought from and given by the Department. As this report proves, those assurances were insufficient. No amendments were made to try to deal with some of the obviously critical areas. Clearly, the most critical area has been capital being transferred into Australia as part of a supposedly genuine application for business migration. That capital has not been invested in a genuine business but has been taken out of Australia. The same capital has then been used to bring either a second or a third person into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the Department was asked whether it was possible to put into place procedures which would control this matter, it said it was not. Of course, the ultimate upshot of that meant that as more people, even reputable agents, came to see that the Government was not checking on this issue and was not following it through, it became clear that more and more people could apply under business migration. I am not saying that those people did not bring any money at all, but if they could not bring the full amount, there were ways and means of bringing in lesser amounts and, therefore, the actual legislative purpose of the program was not achieved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The honourable member opposite will have an opportunity to have his say later. In 1982 the program was brought in. I am referring to the regulatory requirements in relation to the program, if honourable members opposite want to be technical about that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  With respect to the question of what we do from now on, I welcome the new category of entry on the basis of business and managerial skills. But it is very important that we get this new category right.  It is very important, for example, that we do not make the new category so stringent that we actually exclude people who do have significant amounts of capital and entrepreneurial skill, on the basis of over-rigidly enforcing other criteria which we might wish to enforce in other cases of independent migrants. I think it is one thing if a person simply has a skill but no capital and no entrepreneurial experience; we might bring that person in and, in that case, the age qualification may be highly relevant. But it is quite another thing to say to someone who has been a successful businessman and who is over 45 years of age that he is to get zero points because of his age, even though he has all this entrepreneurial skill and he has very significant capital. If the program is not looked at carefully, that may undermine its purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is the objective that we are aiming at? It is to bring people to Australia who can contribute significant amounts of capital and who do have the managerial and entrepreneurial skills to set up enterprises here and to make a contribution to Australia. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-And, therefore, to create jobs, as the honourable member says. One of the impertinent things that have been said about this program is that it has been a total disaster, that there have been no successes. That is not correct. All of the surveys indicate that there have been significant successes, and there have been a significant number of entrepreneurs who have come here and who have set up companies. Some of them have been very successful. In fact, some of them have given employment to a large number of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We should recognise that this country does lack entrepreneurial and managerial skills. There is still a lack in that area, especially when we are talking about our competitiveness in world terms. We can learn from bringing some significant individuals who have trained in these areas into in Australia. They should be welcome here, especially when they bring capital to establish their enterprises. It is important that we take a broad-minded view about how the criteria are going to apply in relation to this new category so that we are not going to exclude people who do have that potential contribution. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, in relation to that, I want to say a word of caution about the English language skills criteria. It is clear that there are some people who have insufficient English language skills but have entrepreneurial skills, so we have to balance that with some requirement in the English language area. If there is a proven entrepreneur who wants to come to Australia, we have to be ensured that that person is given adequate training in the English language so that we do not lose his particular skill simply because he does not have sufficient knowledge of the English language. I think this matter has to be handled sensitively so that we do not lose someone or some persons who might be prepared to bring to Australia millions of dollars of investment simply because that person's or those persons' English language skills level is insufficient. We should not simply say, `Your level is insufficient; forget it'. We should say, `Let us see what we can do to assist you in relation to the English language requirement so that we can in fact gain from your skills and from your potential capital investment'. </PARA>
<PARA>  In overall terms, therefore, let us hope that we have learned from the lessons of the past in terms of the abuse of the program. One thing we have learned is that if we introduce any kind of business migration program and make it clear that agents are able to come in, charge lots of money, offer quick solutions and ways of getting around the law, as has happened with some agents--I do not say it has happened with the majority, but it has with some--then we will get into trouble. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) mentioned in a previous debate that many people who failed to succeed in change of status applications when they were here as visitors or students have now decided to make applications for refugee status. One of the most outrageous aspects of this problem has been the fact that some immigration agents have been openly advertising to people and saying, `If you really want to stay in Australia we can help you by making a refugee application'. That is a further example of where the use of agents in the immigration area can certainly be a real difficulty. We have to tighten up in this area where agents are assisting people with immigration applications, but we especially need a tightening with refugee applications. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I take the opportunity, firstly, to congratulate the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on its report. I thank the Committee for it. As a former member of that Committee, I am pleased that the Committee has again demonstrated its capacity to report fearlessly on the views that it has formed about government administration. In this case the Committee accurately records the failure of the Government over time to effectively administer the business migration scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  On behalf of the Opposition, as its shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, I had from time to time drawn attention to many of the shortcomings which I had identified and which I know the Committee picked up in its report. I have been at pains, on behalf of the Opposition, to mention that it was certainly our view that the baby should not be thrown out with the bath water and that there were important objectives which the scheme, properly administered, could achieve. The fact is that the scheme as it was administered was severely flawed because of decisions taken by Ministers under the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The most outrageous decision that was taken was to appoint accredited agents. That decision was taken by former Minister Young under this Government. It was a decision that ignored every basic tenet of agency and ethics. The Government had a fear that, if people were appointed agents of the Government, they might do a Khemlani and go and represent themselves as people who could do all sorts of other things. The Government said, `We are not going to have agents of the Government; we are going to make them agents of the person who wants to come here'. What is a person who employs an agent to get him into Australia going to expect? He expects his agent to act in his interests. There is no ethical position, there is no consideration given to what lawyers regard as their obligation to the court, their obligation to clients built up over a long period--there is nothing of that nature. We had a government that was prepared to license over 300 people. Those who wanted to come along and be a business migration agent accredited by the Government were given a licence. That situation was not going to work. It never could. </PARA>
<PARA>  What we had from the Committee was a damning indictment of the way in which that scheme was administered, the way in which accredited agency arrangements worked, and the Committee's principal recommendation was that that part of the scheme ought to be thrown to one side. The Committee did recommend an alternative--firstly, that the business migration scheme as it presently operated should be scrapped and that a new business skills entry arrangement should be put in place, and that it should be points tested. The Committee obviously had very comprehensive evidence from the Department as to how that could be done. It seems clear to me, from the evidence that was made available, that the Committee's recommendation could have been put in place immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>  What did this Minister do? He scrapped the scheme and gave everybody two weeks notice to put in their present applications. What an outrageous proposition! We know it is flawed--we know the administration has been flawed--but he said to all the world, `I am going to scrap the scheme in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, but I am giving you two more weeks to get all your applications in'. Then he said, `I am not ready to put the new scheme in place; that will have to come six months down the track'. He should have made the announcement that the scheme was scrapped immediately that he received the report. He had the material, developed by his Department, upon which the new points system could have been put in place immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>  The message that has gone abroad is that business migration to Australia is a stop-start program. To the serious business migrants, the message is, `Do not look at Australia'. Our interest has been sold short again. The Public Accounts Committee has done the job, but the Government has failed. The Government failed in relation to the administration of the scheme, the Public Accounts Committee tells us, and the Government's record since the Public Accounts Committee reported demonstrates that it has no capacity to make the correct decisions in this important area of responsibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --In considering the report on the business migration program of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I quote from my discussion paper Immigration and Consensus:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In 1983 a program had been introduced designed to attract business migrants. Its introduction and subsequent justification is almost a classic case of the colonial mentality in action. Given that locals were considered second rate we had to import business people. In January 1988, under Mick Young as Minister, the prevailing belief in deregulation and the deification of the market saw the administration of the program virtually handed over to private enterprise middle men whose driving motivation was the profits they could make. They, at one and the same time, were employed and paid by prospective migrants, mainly from Hong Kong and Taiwan, and also entrusted by the Government to decide which migrants gained entry to Australia! When rumours of mismanagement arose, the bulk of the media relied on the testimony of these middle men and others in the immigration industry. They, of course, including representatives from the Immigration Department, claimed the scheme was working well and did not hesitate to smear critics as racist. The Business Migration Program became a byword as a massive rort, but for years nothing was done about it. Finally this year the all party Federal Public Accounts Committee was directed to investigate the program. </PARA>
<PARA>  In The Australian of April 25 this year the Australian Federal Police stated in a submission to the Committee that it was concerned that: "individuals are arriving in Australia under the Business Migration Program by using funds provided by organised crime. It is thought that the funds are then recycled and used to fund further immigrants under the BMP. It is also suspected that the scheme is being used to launder money by known criminal groups which lend the immigrants the money required for the scheme. No apparent checks are made to ensure that the funds for the BMP are kept and used within Australia." The AFP believes that Triad crime gangs are using the scheme to help them relocate to Australia before Hong Kong is taken over by the People's Republic of China. About 10,000 business migrants and 30,000 dependants have entered Australia under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Tax Office noted that in 1987 the Immigration Department had given it a list of names of 100 successful business migration applicants, but had been unable to provide any other personal information. The Tax Office could trace only seven of the migrants and only two of those had lodged tax returns. Despite evidence such as this, the Immigration Department continued to claim that the program was working well right up until the Committee delivered its report on June 21. The report was a scathing indictment of the Business Migration Program and also stands as an indictment of the integrity and professional competence of the Immigration Department itself. The Committee said that the program was flawed from the start, had been "disastrously" mismanaged and called for its abolition. </PARA>
<PARA>In spite of this, the Secretary to the Immigration Department, Chris Conybeare, subsequently claimed in letters to newspapers that the scheme had not been so bad after all and that any new scheme would be based on what he called the success of the old. What does it take before the Immigration Department and other immigration advocates face up to their failures?</PARA>
<PARA>  Further, given that the power elite are so desperately afraid of how Australia is perceived in Asia--sections of the press continue to harp on this--it is interesting to note that the scheme became a standing joke among the Hong Kong business community. Far from increasing our prestige in Asia it, along with the education for export fiasco, has significantly diminished it. Australia has gained a reputation for mismanagement and confusion in dealing with Asian countries and it seems to be sadly lacking in confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is true that the business migration scheme has been scrapped, but there will be some new business scheme put in its place in line with the belief in skilled immigration among the elite. This means that in considering the business migration program the whole rationale behind skills immigration has to be considered. If Australia is ever to be anything other than a colonial dumping ground, it must train its own people. In doing so it must cut the intake of skilled workers as a matter of long term policy to ensure that employers, with government assistance where necessary, make the commitment to training. Immigration can be used to supplement skills shortages. There may be, under these circumstances, openings for a small number of business people who have been rigorously selected. </PARA>
<PARA>  Apart from locals losing opportunities for training, our unthinking cargo cult commitment to skilled immigration has also meant an oversupply of skills in some areas. The Budget Papers acknowledge that over-servicing by GPs is caused by the oversupply of doctors. The AMA recognises that this oversupply is caused largely by the immigration of doctors, and it is rightly concerned about it. Like engineers, whom we are continuing to import--(Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to compliment previous speakers, and also the Public Accounts Committee for the splendid work it has done on the business migration program. The Public Accounts Committee dealt with three basic areas, namely, the business migration program, the accredited agents scheme, and a proposal it developed for business skills migration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Committee found that there was criminal activity involved in the business migration program, but not to a large degree, nor on an organised basis. The Committee was certain that individuals had used this program to gain entry to Australia. It is interesting to note that, during the period the scheme was being developed, large numbers of community leaders of ethnic groups, particularly those from Asia, raised with me and the Minister their concern that this was not a scheme with integrity. In fact, 82 per cent of the participants in the business migration scheme are of Asian origin. That should have been enough to alert the Government that it needed to monitor and evaluate the program. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee looked at the proposition that funds were being recycled--that people were paying $500,000 to buy their way into Australia under the business migration program and then sending that money back, without making an investment here, for somebody else to use in the chain. There was no necessity for compliance or monitoring established by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee also examined the transfer of capital and the necessity to monitor whether or not capital was actually transferred in the business migration program. The recommendation of the Committee is that there be an assessment after two years to make sure that capital has been transferred. It was scathing in its attack on the accredited agent scheme. I would like to refer to statements I made on behalf of the Opposition at the time. On 5 November 1987 I said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition is extremely concerned about the Government's proposal to introduce private sector processing for Business Migrants from January 1, 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>I also said:</PARA>
<PARA>We are not against the private sector playing a significant role in the Business Migration Program nor the opportunity to expand the program, however, we must not get into the situation where we hand over our sovereign rights. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been all downhill since then. Successive Ministers, one after another, have failed to acknowledge the weaknesses of the business migration scheme, and in fact used to launch regularly into attacks on members of the Opposition for daring to question their integrity by pointing out obvious weaknesses. On 30 August 1988, the then Minister, Mr Hurford, was quoted in the House of Representatives by Mr Holding as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>To date, no single example has been produced in respect of that practice--</PARA>
<PARA>that business migration is being used as a method of buying one's way into Australia--</PARA>
<PARA>and that there are inadequate safeguards, and that in some cases the funds involved are the proceeds of illegal activities such as prostitution and drugs . . . To date there certainly has been no evidence to substantiate some of the wild assertions that have been made . . . It should be pointed out that business migrants are selected on the basis of their successful business background. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, Hurford is wrong; the whole bunch of them are wrong. The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), on behalf of the Government Caucus committee, endorsed the whole lot. Government members sat there and attacked the Opposition, and now we have one of the prime committees of the Parliament saying that this is a shambles. A bipartisan committee has pointed out that the Government, year after year, disclaimed any responsibility for the business migration program, and now it has been found that there has been criminal activity, that there has been a recycling of funds, that nobody can find many of the so-called business migrants who are supposed to have come here and invested in Australia, and that there has been, in some instances, no transfer of capital. </PARA>
<PARA>  I understand that the Taxation Office, out of a list of 100 so-called business migrants, could find only two. The very highest estimate that I have seen of legitimate participation in this program is 25 per cent. We have had a program running now for four years which has been inadequate and not monitored, and the Government has denied that it is inadequate. The Government stands condemned on this part of its migration program, as it does on the rest. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA>  Controversy grows about the benefits of immigration, the acceptable level of immigration, the place of origin of immigrants, the language that they speak, the colour of their skin, the god they worship, their health, their education, their social class and so on. Because of public unease about immigration, governments strive to achieve immigration policies which will take the heat out of the issue; immigration policies with which no-one can argue; policies which will please everyone and get sensational immigration stories off the front page. The business migration program seemed to fit into that category. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was thought that no-one would question the correctness of a scheme which provided great economic benefit to Australia by allowing wealth and business skills to migrate in order to boost our technological knowledge, to boost our exports and to boost our employment opportunities. The business migration program was not a failure, but we found it was not the unqualified success that we had hoped it might have been. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many BMP success stories can be told; but despite the successes, things such as program monitoring, post-settlement service, the accreditation scheme, criminal involvement and a few other problems, such as the laundering of money, seriously flawed a worthwhile concept. The business migration program inquiry was long and demanding. Many days were spent in quite a few capital cities of Australia on public hearings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Absolutely, it will do nobody any good. It does not matter whether it is the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) or the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It is a great tragedy that there are one million people in Australia at this moment who cannot find jobs, and the Government shows very little concern for them. I was interested to go back and have a look at a particular quote by the Prime Minister on an MPI on 4 December last year. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The truth is this: unemployment will not reach double digits. </PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment figures are to come out for this month in a few days time. I wonder whether the Government is prepared to commit itself to what the Prime Minister told this Parliament only about eight months ago when he said--this is the truth, from the Hansard of 4 December--that unemployment will not reach double digits. Yet in the Budget we see the Government estimating that unemployment will go to 10.75 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  One would think that the Government would show some genuine concern for the people who are unemployed. In this regard, I went back to the proposal for Newstart to have a look at what was said at that time. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have to find out why people are having difficulty in finding work. </PARA>
<PARA>They are having difficulty finding work because there are no jobs there, not because they are untrained or do not have the skills. What are the unemployed being trained to do in many of the training schemes which are now in place? They are being trained to be better keyboard operators. What do we find amongst the unemployed people? Hundreds of people with keyboard skills. So we are training more people to be unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  It does not matter which areas we look at, we find that there are unemployed people with skills, but the Government has the concept that it should bring in the people who do not have any skills, train them and they will then get jobs. The reality is that that is not working. I have a particular concern for people who are 45, 50 or even 60 years of age who are looking for a job. I wrote to the Minister and requested that he allow some of these more senior people in our community--they are very able and skilled people--to do some voluntary work in a school or in a nursing home for one or two days to fulfil the Newstart agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me illustrate the type of people I am referring to. A widow, aged 48, has a family of four children. One or two may still reside at home. She goes to a government department and is asked, `What new career would you like to take up?'. She has never been in employment before, is quite an able person and has managed her family well. She would like to contribute but she says, `I have already knocked on the doors of 50 employers and they all tell me the same thing, "There is no job here for you"'. Yet the Government is forcing these people to do these things when they would voluntary go down to----</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Government is forcing these people to do these sorts of things and I believe that is demeaning to them. They are willing to go down to the local primary school, sit in a classroom and help young people learn to read. It was only this week that the Government talked about literacy, yet there are people out in the community who could help in a very practical way at the coalface. I say to the Government, `Look at these people more compassionately. Allow them to select the types of jobs for which they already have the skills and the capacity to go and help. They do not need retraining'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Let me give another illustration. A leading carpenter, aged 57, has been in charge of over 50 men. He goes to the counter and is told, `On 1 July you have to show that you have either been downtown and knocked on a lot of doors and you are continuing to do that or that you will undertake some training program'. He says to me, `Over the last four or five years I have already done several training programs and it made no difference. The CES has not rung me in the last five years to offer me a job. When I go in there they say that I am too old'. Yet on 1 July 1991 this person is being asked at the counter, `What new career are you going to take up?'. I think that is very demeaning for these citizens of Australia. That person could go out and do voluntary work at a sheltered workshop or could do some repair work at the local recreation centre. He would be very happy to go and do it voluntarily. The Government should allow these people to do it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) has invited me to read the letter which I wrote to the Minister. I think that is a good idea. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>To meet the needs of the unemployed greater choice should be afforded to the more senior unemployed, many of whom would find positions to work in the community whilst unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the essence of my letter. These are some of the comments I got back:</PARA>
<PARA>However, establishing such a scheme would be prohibitively expensive and the coordination of all the participants involved would make such a program very complex and expensive to administer. </PARA>
<PARA>I was not asking for some grandiose scheme at all. But it shows the ideology of the Government--it does not want people out there working in the community for their unemployment benefits, because the ACTU will not allow them to do it. We see it time and time again: while there is a need out there in the community, the Australian Government is locked in with its union mates and will not face up to the changing realities of people's lives. The reply continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it would have to contain a vocational training component providing skills which would be applicable to other employment. . . This approach makes more sense than a community work scheme from the community's point of view and from the point of view of unemployed people themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>What utter rot. People out there are saying to me that they want to go out and do the work, they want to contribute the skills that they have, they want to be effective participants, but the Government scheme will not allow them to do it. I ask the honourable member who is going to respond, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, to get up and say whether these people will be allowed voluntarily to go out and do community work.(Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I certainly respond with an unequivocal yes. People should be allowed to go out and do voluntary community work, and they are allowed to. In fact, I would like to think that this is a fairly harmless motion which, if it were not for the wording, could be supported. It is a harmless motion if the two days community work is an option for the Newstart client. The trouble with some of these contributions from Opposition members is that there is an innuendo that it ought to be compulsory. These people have the option now. If they have been jobless for less than 12 months and more than three months and are aged, say, between 16 and 18, they can have not just two days of voluntary community work but 20 days if they so choose. If, like the people that the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) has just mentioned, they are aged 55 years or over, they can have six months--two lots of 65 days of community work. It is available to them; it just has to be proposed by the client.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Batemans Bay RSL veterans' group, for instance, has offered voluntary help schemes to the CES, which it is very interested in. I thoroughly endorse the idea of people being available in the schools, and that is up to the schools. But if a voluntary work proposal is put forward by an unemployed person to the CES, that has to be looked at. If the CES feels that it is going to help the person, if that person is older, or if it will enhance the employment prospects of someone who is younger, then there is no doubt that it will be accepted. It certainly would be accepted if the spirit of the scheme were adopted. </PARA>
<PARA>  But if the option is for the CES to say, `Look, you do that two days community work or you will not get an allowance', then the motion is a bad one because really what it is doing is requiring people to work for two days per week for the dole. That seemed all right to me perhaps 10 years ago, but I happened to be in London and saw how the Thatcher scheme worked in that regard. Along the Thames people were working; they were supposed to be cleaning up the river. There was an absolute lack of discipline. There was argument amongst the people. Only two out of the 10 people that I saw there were doing anything. It was obviously demeaning for them. It produced counter-hostility, with people particularly protecting their integrity by being belligerent. In other words, their self-esteem had dropped because of the type of scheme that it was. Working for benefits or an allowance compulsorily requires an infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>  Opposition members have said that we do not need much extra money, but we do. I can recall schemes being offered to local government. They said, `Don't just give us people on the dole unless you are prepared to give us people who are going to be full time, unless you are prepared to provide overalls and boots, unless you are prepared to provide funds for a supervisor, unless you are prepared to provide insurance--which is extremely costly--and unless you are prepared to give us extra equipment that we can give them to use'. It just does not work and it is costly. </PARA>
<PARA>  The community employment program, which was a great scheme, was costly. But working for the dole costs more. Penny Lockwood, the chairman of Queanbeyan Skillshare, has told me that working for the dole costs twice as much as the dole itself. Including government administration and everything, I believe it would cost more than a weekly wage. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, there are areas in which this sort of thing can be done. For instance, the community development employment project for Aboriginals can be introduced voluntarily by the community. That is actually being done but it is being done outside that sort of environment. It has to be voluntary. The person has to be interested in doing the work. It also has to be done in conjunction with the CES. </PARA>
<PARA>  Work for the dole is expensive and inefficient. The whole concept of the dole has been abolished and has been replaced by an allowance which is subject to an agreement between the client and the CES. </PARA>
<PARA>  The motion also assumes that the option of two days community work will give greater recognition to the worth of the unemployed. That shows that the Opposition has gone nowhere since it was decisively tossed out of office in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>  We then had the wage pause, which was a bit better than the regional employment development scheme under the Whitlam Government because it gave women opportunities. The only thing wrong with it was that it was considered in conjunction with a cut in wages for workers and pensioners throughout Australia. Other than that, it was a bit of an advance. But those opposite have not advanced one bit since 1983. The Hawke Government introduced the community employment scheme, which was good but costly. But quite often people were left with nothing after three months involvement in the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have now woken up. We have pretty good leadership, not only in the Federal Government but also in community groups, in State governments and in local government. We have realised that our primary aim is to fulfil the needs of the trading and service industries as much as possible. It is all very well to hark back, as people do, to the worthwhile work done by Roosevelt and to the work done in Australia during the Depression when people were made to build roads and bridges and were given what they called the susso. But that is now unsuitable because there is very little room in the Australian work force for people who do not have any skills; there are no jobs for them. And it is quite ridiculous to ask a local government to give people picks and shovels when it wants them to use sophisticated equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to train people. We certainly can put people into award jobs, perhaps even with wage subsidies. Time and again it is drawn to our attention that the Opposition does not read the reports that come forward. The Finn report, an inquiry by the Education Council Review Committee into young people's participation in post-compulsory education, talked about the needs of these people and what we should be concentrating on. We should not be looking to find some stopgap measure for two days a week but rather looking at people's need for mathematics. I can recall a girl leaving in tears because she could not do basic arithmetic in the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  Scientific and technological understanding, cultural understanding, problem solving, and language and communication should all start in primary school. I strongly support the recommendation of the honourable member for Braddon that older people should be allowed to go to schools and tutor people. I know one young lad who cannot go to school for more than an hour or two a day because he is difficult to manage. If he were to have one to one teaching with an older person it would make a lot of difference to his life. So I strongly support that. </PARA>
<PARA>  People need to be able to speak English; quite often migrants cannot. So language and communication is important. We are beginning to realise that personal and interpersonal characteristics are extremely important. It will be a delicate process. That is why the Australian Council of Social Service and others are worried about it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe we will come to a good result, because it is important how people appear when they present themselves for a job. It is important that they have self-esteem and that their interrelationships with other people are reasonably sophisticated so that they can get on with other people. </PARA>
<PARA>  The real problem today is to bridge that gap between the high number of unemployed people and the jobs that are, and will certainly be, available as this country, along with other countries, pulls out of the present recession. We need to have people ready to take those jobs, whether they involve keyboard skills or a whole range of skills. We need people with self-esteem and social skills so that they can take those jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the moment there is a fairly low number of unemployed people who have even the semi-skills required for the work force. It is extremely important that we bridge that gap. That is what we are all about. We will not do it with measures like shunting people out--locking them out for a couple of days from the opportunities that can be made available. Sure, we have a lot to do to get that training right. We have a lot to do to get that training properly directed. We have a lot to do to assist people to develop their personal characteristics. But that is a far better and more productive exercise than shunting people out of the opportunities that should be available into dead-end activities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am delighted to have this opportunity today to second the motion moved by the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), because Newstart clearly is a failure. It is nothing but one more centralised Labor Government initiative--the big brother approach--to try to answer the lengthening dole queues of unemployment for which this Government has no answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I would not propose to this House that the solution to the question of unemployment today is simple. Certainly there are many complex issues that need to be addressed. There are many initiatives that we need to take in order to change the whole nature of our economy, to allow us once again to go back and approach the 1940s, the 1950s and the early 1960s when Australia had full employment. It will be difficult. Training is an important aspect of allowing us to regain our culture, and allowing full employment for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, the dole queues in my electorate of La Trobe are particularly devastating. There is a CES office next door to my electorate office. From memory, unemployment in the past 12 months has increased by something like 294 per cent--the largest increase in any electorate in the whole of Australia. I should like to draw to the attention of the House one small example of this Government's callous disregard for the unemployed in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>  A very enthusiastic young man walked into our electorate office last week, a clean-cut young man aged in his early twenties. Prior to July 1991 he had been unemployed for some six months, but he did manage to work for about 10 weeks at some point during the past nine months. The young man did not have particularly high skills, nor was he exceedingly well qualified. But he certainly was unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  He wanted to work and he was actively looking for work. He had proven his desire for work and his willingness to work by taking a temporary job for 10 weeks. My young constituent, whom we will call John, had just come from the local CES office where he had found on the job board just the sort of job that he could do. It was a cleaning job for which he had the appropriate experience and qualifications. John proceeded to take a job card straight to the CES officer in the hope that he could obtain an interview and, very quickly, employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Guess what happened? This Government's special kind of assistance for the unemployed really played a cruel trick of fate on John. He could not be considered for the cleaning job; he was not eligible because he had not been unemployed long enough. </PARA>

So this whole issue of training is an issue which, as a member of this House, I will address again and again and again.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- The wording of this motion demands careful analysis because it contains assumptions which do not stand up under scrutiny, and it dresses up a discredited policy in the clothes of compassion. I take on board the comments of the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). I believe that he is sincere in what he says; nevertheless, the motion is indeed a misleading motion. For instance, the apparently simple request that the Government give greater recognition to the work of the unemployed implies that the Government does not already give the maximum recognition to the work of that particular group of people in our community--and that is not true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This implication is, in fact, belied by the facts which bear testimony to the assiduousness with which our Government has addressed the needs of unemployed people in terms of their incomes, their self-esteem and their opportunities for education, training and jobs. We have consistently increased the budgetary allocations in the employment, education and training portfolio with the needs of unemployed people very much in mind. </PARA>
<PARA>  The motion also calls for greater choice of Newstart activity agreements, including the option of two days community work for Newstart payment. Unfortunately, this request is only a thinly disguised re-run of the work for the dole concept with which the Opposition parties have been so closely associated for so very long. It is, in fact, a plea for cheap labour, which shows little understanding of the breadth of options which are available to unemployed people under the Newstart program. These agreements are meant to be tailored to the needs of each individual and each individual's abilities. As mentioned by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), individuals can already undertake elements of community work if that is the best option for them. </PARA>
<PARA>  As far as community work in general is concerned, I totally support proposals aimed at providing jobs for unemployed people through community projects of substance as well as elements of work experience; especially, though, those that are financed by capital works brought forward to achieve publicly necessary infrastructure in local government areas and so forth, which is happening with some State Budgets at this very moment. However, such projects must pay an acceptable and appropriate wage to the people employed and must not be undertaken in the expectation of obtaining cheap labour. I believe that the Government has gone a long way in terms of wage subsidies to assist people who are currently unemployed to obtain work and to assist community groups with worthwhile objectives for whom unemployed people can work at a slightly lower wage than otherwise would be the case. </PARA>
<PARA>  The motion before the House does nothing to highlight the coalition's avowed intention to cut everybody off the unemployment benefit after nine months. It does nothing to acquaint the people of Australia with the coalition's reluctance to maintain support for the wide range of labour market programs contained within our Government's active employment strategy. The truth is that those opposite have no intention of pursuing policies that will assist unemployed people into jobs through economic reconstruction, training, education or progressive skills acquisition. This motion is therefore window- dressing--but their policy shop is, at best, empty and, at worst, uncaring. </PARA>
<PARA>  As is obvious from the comments of the honourable member for Braddon, the Opposition continues to support the concept of work for the dole, albeit not necessarily compulsorily. This motion is therefore an example of deceptive rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our Government, however, does recognise the worth of the unemployed. It recognises that worth by providing each person with an opportunity to develop, improve and to build on his or her existing abilities and interests with a view to obtaining and maintaining meaningful paid work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- Like most Australians, I have a great appreciation of sport and of sportsmen and sportswomen. The contribution of sport to this country is well documented--we are a sports- loving nation. I therefore accept that there are very good intentions behind the motion and I hope that my contribution this morning will be seen as positive. I accept the assurances of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) that there are no partisan political objectives behind this motion. I concur with the sentiments of the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) that there is not a lot of disagreement between members of this Parliament on the need for funding for sport. The difficulties arise when we must decide on the method of funding and the question of priority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The reality facing Australia is that we are embedded in the worst recession since the Great Depression. Nearly one million Australians are out of work, small businesses are facing the greatest crisis in 60 years, and Australia has a foreign debt which is totally unacceptable. For eight years we have had a Federal government which has applied bandaid solutions when major surgery has been required. Indeed, it took a long time for Government members to admit that Australia is in severe economic recession. In such times, the Federal Government must be very careful about how it allocates public money. In tough times--and these are exceptionally tough times--we must get our priorities right and be very careful about how taxpayers' dollars are spent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Like all honourable members, I am constantly being approached by community groups seeking Federal assistance for very worthy causes, and in most cases I am pleased to support these causes. As the local Federal member, I am willing to make representations on behalf of these community groups. It is then for the relevant Minister to make a decision regarding merit and priority, and we as local members must accept that there is a limited budget and that the Federal Government cannot be expected to fund everything. I suggest that this is the flaw in the motion moved by the honourable member for Moreton. It has merit, but there are limited dollars to go around. </PARA>
<PARA>  Undoubtedly, there is a role for the Federal Government in the funding of sport. At the same time, there is a funding role for State governments and for local government, and all tiers of government must establish priorities and expenditure levels based on need and merit. To this end, I advocate that the primary role for the Federal Government must be the development of sporting excellence, and Australia's participation and contribution in international competition. This is a fair and reasonable position for a national government to assume. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think that some honourable members forget that we are members of a federal parliament. We are not members of State legislatures or local councils. The Federal Parliament has a limited role. Its powers are limited by the Australian Constitution and residual powers and responsibilities remain with the States. I am not aware of any constitutional provisions giving this Parliament power or a role in the funding and administration of regional and community sport. I am well aware that the role and power of the Commonwealth has been constantly expanding since 1901, but that does not mean that we have to continue that trend. </PARA>
<PARA>  Rather than seeking to expand the role of the Federal Government in the funding and administration of sport, I would advocate that it is time to return some of these functions to the States and to local government and that the Federal Government should concentrate its efforts on the promotion and development of sporting excellence and international competition. The development of further community sporting facilities should not be the concern of the Federal Government--there are unfortunately more serious issues deserving of our consideration and attention. </PARA>
<PARA>  The showpiece of Australian sport surely is our performance at the Olympic and Commonwealth Games and at the various world championships. For a relatively small nation, our performances over the years have been outstanding, and Australian pride and nationalism have greatly benefited from the fine performances of our athletes. To this end, successive Australian governments have made significant contributions to Australia's sporting missions at numerous Olympic and Commonwealth Games. More recently, the Australian Institute of Sport has become the focus of Federal attention, and as a nation we have reaped the benefits of this fine sporting institution. This is a valid role for the Federal Government and there would be bipartisan support in this House for the continuation of such programs and expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>  The difficulties and divisions arise when it is suggested that the Commonwealth's role should be extended to finance regional and community sport. This suggestion is flawed because it presumes that a Commonwealth bureaucracy would be capable of administering and allocating Federal funding fairly and equitably to sporting bodies across Australia. The allocation of funds would be determined by a central Commonwealth bureaucracy, and this causes me great concern. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, in speaking to this motion, I have the benefit of knowing what decisions were contained in the 1991-92 Budget. The honourable member for Moreton did not have the benefit of this knowledge when he presented this motion to the House on 18 April 1991. My reading of the Budget, as it applies to sport and recreation, suggests that the honourable member for Moreton should not be unhappy with his lot. The Government has decided to provide an additional $30m over three years and to continue the community recreation and sporting facilities program. This will amount to some $10.6m, including a carry-over of $2.6m in 1991-92. It is also important to note that the Government has made a significant commitment of $150m if Sydney's bid for the Olympic Games in the year 2000 is successful. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget Statement for 1991-92 made the observation that over the last decade, outlays in sport and recreation have increased in real terms by about 109 per cent, and this includes significant increases in funding for sports development, community recreation and sporting facilities. In 1991-92, outlays on sport and recreation will increase by $7.8m to $78.6m, a real increase of about 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Earlier in my comments I suggested that too little recognition is given to the fact that this country is in the depths of a very serious recession. The Australian taxpayer is already overburdened and as a nation we continue to live beyond our means. The motion before this House has been presented with the best of intentions, but economic reality tells us that there are insufficient funds in the coffers and that it is time for us to put away the chequebook. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- I am pleased that the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), who has just resumed his seat, at least gave credit to the Government for the Budget initiative, but I was amazed at some of the comments that he made. He seemed to say that at times when there are economic difficulties we should not get involved in sport, recreation and cultural pursuits. I think that is an amazing claim; it shows an enormous degree of ignorance as to the importance of those three areas when it comes to the economic viability of any nation. It amazes me that he would put forward such a proposition. He obviously does not understand the importance of the bricks and mortar aspects of the sports industry and the cultural industries, and the advantages to a local community when someone builds a facility, whether it be a stadium of some note or some sort of athletics field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Isaacs obviously does not understand the important contribution that is made in dollar terms to transport and travel. One can add tourism to that and also the enormous amounts of money that are paid to insurance companies across this nation that come back to sporting and recreational pursuits. One can add the salaries, the coaches, the advertising, the importance of sporting and cultural pursuits for television, the repairs and maintenance of equipment and human beings, and the health consequences. It comes back again to regional and parochial advantages. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would suggest to the honourable member that he is wrong when he runs the line which says, `When things are tough economically, put aside those other issues'. I believe the motion that we are debating here today, which was introduced in April, is very timely. The honourable member made the point that the Government has acted on the proposal put forward at that time by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson). What he was putting forward at that time mirrored the aspirations at least of the members of the Government. I am surprised that the honourable member for Isaacs, who has resumed his seat, has not grasped the importance of what is in this Budget. I wonder whether he will go out to his groups and say to them, `Don't bother to apply because this is untimely. You don't have these things in times of economic recession'. We will see how many applications come from his electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>  My electorate has already been told of the program's importance and this very day we are sending out copies of the application information so that people can get ready for 6 December, which is the deadline date. We are explaining exactly what people can do and how important this project is. It is important. It is an extension of what this Government has done through its previous sports and recreational programs, but it has gone further: it has added the cultural areas, something that members of the Government kept saying to Ministers in the past, including to Senator Richardson and the present Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly). She needs to be commended for including cultural pursuits in this program. It is an excellent idea and it will be applauded, just as it was applauded when the 382 organisations throughout this nation were able to access the $13m previously allocated. </PARA>
<PARA>  There will be another $8m allocated for the rest of this financial year, starting from December; another $12m in the following year; and then another $10m. It is money well spent. It is money that is going into local areas to ensure that projects can be completed. It will ensure that new facilities can be undertaken, that facilities can be improved and, more importantly, that there can be coordination between local authorities and State and Territory governments, because that is what this is about. It is the Federal Government giving a lead, putting its money where its policies are and saying to the States, the local authorities and the community, `There will be $30m available to you over the next three years to ensure that you, the citizens of your area, benefit'. It surprises me that the honourable member for Isaacs has not come out applauding what is happening here. I thought he would have. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are some controls--and so there ought to be. The Federal Government is saying that this time around it is prepared to give up to 100 per cent funding for projects that are worth no more than $50,000. After that, it has got to be dollar for dollar. There is also a limit of $250,000 on the sorts of projects that can be funded; that is responsible. If the Government has only $8m to give away in one year, then obviously it will not give it away in lots of $1m; it will want to spread it out as widely as it can to areas where there is a proven need or demand. That is what this is about. It is going to ensure that those who have the initiative at a community level--be they sporting groups, recreation groups or cultural groups--can now apply to this Government and say, `We need this money. Here is the need. Here is the demand. We have also raised some money, so we are making a contribution. Please support us'. That is what the Minister and the Hawke Government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a flow on from the Whitlam era. Honourable members will remember that under Whitlam we had the CALF program, the community and leisure facilities program. It has been Labor governments that have taken the initiative. It has been Labor governments that have realised the economic importance of ensuring that the quality of life of all Australians is continually improved by cultural, recreational and sporting pursuits. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the Fraser Government came into power in 1975, it dropped the program. We had a gap, a void, for all those years, which was a great pity, because many organisations suffered during that time. Regional areas and small areas suffered because they did not have the dollars. I am sure the honourable member for Isaacs and other honourable members realise how difficult it is to raise that first $5,000 or $6,000 to get a project off the ground. But the real problem is finding the final dollars to finish it. </PARA>
<PARA>  In Emu Park, an area in my electorate, the community raised almost $90,000 for a swimming pool, and yet summer after summer people could not use it because it was never completed. The Hawke Government went in there and said, `Okay. Let us do a deal with the local authority and the community', and $30,000 was given. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Country Women's Association had tennis courts in a place called Thangool. It could not get them completed because the contractor went broke and the work that he did was substandard. This Government, at the request of the CWA, said, `Look, here is $20,000. Finish it'. There would only be a few hundred people in the Thangool area, but they then had an excellent facility. At a place called St Lawrence, it received $8,000 for a tennis court. That money was applauded by everybody, regardless of political persuasion. I too applaud what this Government is doing. I believe the applause is warranted and timely. </PARA>
<PARA>  I agree that we have to be careful about too much Federal involvement, because this ought to be a coordinated activity at the State, local and Federal levels. There is never enough money for all applications. We found that with the thousands of applications that came in last time. We need to be very careful to ensure that we are not involved in duplication. We need, where possible, to promote multi- purpose centres as we see in some of the new mining towns in my electorate and throughout Queensland. We need to use those existing facilities in a better way. There are halls and schools that are under-used, schools that are only used for limited hours during the day and halls that are used sometimes once or twice a week. We need to look at what we have got and say, `Let's expand, let's be more efficient, let's maximise this usage'. However, as I said, let us not get involved in duplication. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think we ought to come up with a coordinated activity. I would like to see future funding programs have this State and local government involvement. Let us strike some percentages; 20 per cent from the local authority, 30 per cent from the State and 50 per cent from the Commonwealth. Let us give priority to those types of schemes that involve that coordination and that three-way cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also need better planning. There are cities in which there is a swimming pool for the community, yet the school does not have one. It seems to me that we ought to re-think this at a local authority level, as many authorities are doing, and build those facilities, be they swimming pools, squash courts or athletic grounds, so that the schools take advantage of them. It has happened in all sorts of areas in my electorate.  Again we need to make sure that they are multi-purpose facilities, that we do get the advantages for education users as well as the general community. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also think there is a need for a special program for isolated and regional Australia. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would understand that there are many people out there in regional and isolated Australia who never get these opportunities. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon), as a representative of the Northern Territory, would understand that problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are kids who could really make it to the top but never get that edge. I advocate that we get further involved as a Federal Government and give some sort of catalyst by way of dollars to ensure that an experiment that we tried in the electorate of Capricornia last year with the backing of teachers and the Education Department is emulated right across Australia. We went to six or seven small schools, little one-teacher schools and two- teacher schools, and asked the parents and citizens associations to pick the four or five best. We then got the railway unions through their institute at a place called Coppabella to provide the facilities and the P and Cs from the Nebo and Coppabella schools to look after the grounds. The teachers gave of their time and the kids came in for a crash clinic for three days. It was an unbelievable success, backed by the unions, backed by the Education Department and backed by the community. We need to do that sort of thing right across regional and isolated Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we are going to do any more by extending what we are doing already as a Federal Government, let us look at that. Let us get the local authorities, the States and the Commonwealth together to look after those young people out there in isolated Australia to ensure that they get the chance. There are kids out there who could be champions but never get that edge. They never get that extra bit of training that lifts them above the average. I believe that the experiment that took place at Coppabella last year, backed by the trade union movement, the railways and the education department, was a supreme success and ought to be taken up and used as a model for the whole of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --I support this motion and I support the principle behind the Budget allocation. I might say that that is about the only thing in the Budget that gave anyone on this side of the House any joy, I suspect. I am going to speak about this, but I really want to address the comments made by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I would have hoped that even the remnants of the Labor Party in the 1990s would not have the gall to discuss the Whitlam years and would not have the gall to discuss what effect that had on the Fraser Government. I think the honourable member for Capricornia is a fairly intelligent, sensible man, but I was amazed to hear him defend the Whitlam years. Then we got a bit more Urenesque in the building better cities program. I really thought that that part of the Labor Party had died a sudden death, but it reappears in this House from time to time. Heaven help us if we ever get back to the Whitlam years!</PARA>
<PARA>  I do not know whether the honourable member for Capricornia has read the guidelines. I notice he is sending them out only today. I sent all of mine out last week; perhaps my office is just highly efficient. Guideline No. 3.4 makes specific reference to communities in rural areas. I am extremely pleased that the Government has shown that initiative to protect rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  We cannot often get Government members or Ministers to come into rural areas. We get them occasionally for functions. For the last 18 months I have been trying to get the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)--the temporary Prime Minister--to come to Ballarat. He does not have the intestinal fortitude to show himself there. If he actually came to the electorate, he would see why we need these sorts of programs. Quite frankly, the way that centres such as Ballarat are going we are going to need community recreation and cultural halls from one end of the electorate to the other, because going to recreation and cultural halls will be all that people will be able to do. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government will not address, and this Budget did not address, the problem of regional Australia. The Government did not even address metropolitan Australia, and we are sinking further and further into the mire. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer back to the guidelines. I am concerned that, generally, the value of land will not be considered as part of the total program cost. In rural and regional centres that is often a significant component. The seed that gets these projects up and running is offers of land from people who are prepared to donate portions of their property or land, which may have been held in the family for many years. I think that should be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are at least three organisations in my electorate which I know are going to take advantage of this $8m. I would like to see the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) specifically direct the Department that the majority of these funds should go into regional rural centres, which is where they are most desperately needed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Stan and Con Litras, who are good friends of mine from the Hellenic Greek Orthodox community, came in to see me the other day. They have got a Greek community hall in Humffray Street, Ballarat, and they urgently need some extra funds to complete some work. Geoff McManus is doing a terrific job for the Napoleons Recreation Reserve Committee, which is desperately seeking funds under this allocation. It missed out last time and I am extremely hopeful that it will be able to obtain funds now. I also received a phone call from Irene Crebbin, who works for the Barnstorm Theatre in Ballarat. It is a terrific group, which is doing an enormous amount of work with school children. It is looking to buy the old Ballarat East library building. </PARA>
<PARA>  This, again, brings me to the guidelines. I have some concerns that funding will be available only for the design and construction of the facility and will not be provided for feasibility studies. I hope there is some flexibility in that, because the theatre wants to go into the old Ballarat East library. This requires a significant feasibility study. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn back briefly to the Budget. There are a lot of people in the gallery today. I will quickly go through what this Government has done. Let us not forget that we do not have just the Prime Minister; we have also the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who has been slinking around this place for the last month. He is not prepared to bob his head up. He and the Prime Minister are the duo which has caused the problems that we have at the moment--the worst depression since the 1930s. But oh, no, the member for Blaxland slips in quietly during Question Time and slinks out again. He is wandering around the corridors doing his numbers. He is responsible, with the Prime Minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) in his address to the House today emphasised in a very telling way the importance of community sporting facilities and the crucial role that the Federal government can play in coordinating the roles of State and local government. I am very pleased to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), which calls on the Government to develop programs dealing with local sporting community facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The development of elite sporting centres for excellence and assistance for improving the infrastructure of community facilities are not separate issues. They should, in my view, always be considered together. They are interdependent. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no doubt, in my opinion, that the exposure to choices of participatory sport to children in the age range of 7 to 12 significantly determines the success or otherwise of all our future athletes and provides the foundation for a healthy lifestyle for all Australians. Implicit in that statement is the quality and the sensitivity of coaches, role models and the encouragement offered by family and community members. </PARA>
<PARA>  For many young Australian children their first exposure to sport comes when they attend their local primary school. In the past, primary schools generally have only offered participation to the few in traditional sporting facilities on a fairly ad hoc basis. Today that participation is not exclusive, yet questions could be raised as to its effectiveness when there is a general absence of specialist teachers in physical education in our nation's primary schools--state and private. With the many tasks expected of primary teachers it is not feasible that without additional teacher resources much will be achieved in that very crucial foundation school sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  I point out to honourable members that a primary teacher probably works about 900 person hours a week; a secondary teacher about 400; a TAFE lecturer, 150 hours plus; and a higher education lecturer, 150 hours minus. So, in many ways, the expectations of primary teachers in physical education is unreal. For sport to be successful and to cater for elite athletes, a strong foundation must be built. For too long in this country we have had an attitude of the quick fix--piling in resources at the top and forgetting about the real needs of the beginnings. For example, we would not build a house with fragile foundations and paper walls and then put in chandeliers. Yet when it comes to tackling issues of whatever description we often fall for the trap of `chandelier thinking'. </PARA>
<PARA>  The role of the Commonwealth is to coordinate the roles of State and local government and community activity in sport. We should have decentralised sporting centres of excellence to allow athletes of whatever age to live near their home or to be able to live in their own State. However, community sporting centres play a much more important role than simply a setting off point for future elite athletes. In those community centres sporting skills are realised and attained. Often children are exposed to role models in the form of encouraging and sympathetic adults and peers who in a subtle, informal, yet very effective way, provide opportunities for many children to build their confidence, self-esteem and acceptance within the community. Is that not what this motion is really about--the building of confidence in Australia's young people?</PARA>
<PARA>  The most important skills that young people gain are the subjects: confidence one, confidence two and confidence three. Once they have majored in confidence our young people are capable of anything. Once confidence is gained, people do not run away from problems; they find solutions and they work their way through them. It is the development of courage on the inside, not the brash cockiness and bravado on the outside. Community sporting centres provide real opportunities for our young to find their way in the world and to be the very best in their chosen field. It may be at an elitist sporting centre but it may be as an artisan, engineer or whatever. The most important result is a confident young Australian prepared to play a positive role in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA>  I note that I have a few seconds left. Perhaps I could mention the role of the greatest participatory sport in Australia--netball which, for many years, has been offered, and has acted, on very few resources. In my electorate of Port Adelaide, Ruby Oakey, a woman in her 80s, has assisted thousands of young women in that sport who have been responsible citizens in the electorate. I have great pleasure in supporting the motion moved by the honourable member for Moreton. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA>  That the House:</PARA>
<PARA>(1)  congratulates Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on finally regaining their independence from the Soviet Union;</PARA>
<PARA>(2)  welcomes President Gorbachev's acknowledgment that the Baltic States have a right to independence;</PARA>
<PARA>(3)  calls upon the Soviet Government to expedite its formal recognition of the independence of the Baltic States and rapidly withdraw its remaining troops and paramilitary personnel from the Republics; and</PARA>
<PARA>(4)  urges the Australian Government to examine ways of supporting the reconstruction of the economies of the Republics. </PARA>
<PARA>As the events in recent weeks have overtaken the appropriateness of the content of the original motion that I placed on the Notice Paper some weeks ago, I take this opportunity to put this amended motion before the House. </PARA>
<PARA>  We all know that the recent events in the Soviet Union have given rise to historic changes in the political, social, economic and strategic landscape of eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. One of the consequences of these changes has been the regaining of independence by the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania after 52 years of illegal annexation by the Soviet Union under the terms of the notorious Ribbentrop-Molotov pact of 23 August 1939. </PARA>
<PARA>  But their independence has come at a cost. When the new Lithuanian Parliament declared unilateral independence from the Soviet Union in March last year, economic sanctions were imposed against the republic and were later lifted only when the Lithuanian Government suspended its independence declaration. We can all remember those matters; I raised them in a motion in the House at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 1 March and 1 April 1990, respectively, Estonia and Latvia also declared their independence, to take place only after a period of transition. In early January 1991, when most of us were absorbed by the horrors of the Gulf War, Soviet troops occupied a number of public buildings in Lithuania and Latvia. On 12 January, Soviet troops occupied a broadcasting centre in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Tragically, at least 13 people died and many hundreds were wounded as a result of this illegal occupation. Killings have occurred also in Latvia where the Soviet military seized a government building. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 19 August, after the communist hardliners had removed President Gorbachev from power, Soviet forces stormed television stations, blocked harbours and seized strategic sites as the Moscow backed hardliners declared that they were taking control of the secessionist republics. I think we all watched in horror as those events unfolded. The courage, patience and quiet resolve of the Baltic peoples have been demonstrated time and time again over the years. Under extreme provocation the Baltic people have deplored the use of violence and have resisted the use of military retaliation to press their legitimate claims. </PARA>
<PARA>  Undoubtedly, the determined resistance of the Baltic and the other Soviet republics contributed to the failure of the communist coup, which in turn led to their independence. I can recall the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>  You can't run a country with the KGB, the Communist Party and the Army--you need the people. </PARA>
<PARA>After that abortive coup, many of us look back with hindsight and consider those events. We are glad to see that the comment from Douglas Hurd was true, but the fact is that the KGB, the Communist Party and the army went very close to pulling it off. I must say that one of the real fears that I have is that we have been lulled into a false sense of security. In part, if they had been resolute enough, determined enough, determined to take enough lives, determined to suspend all of the communications and determined to deny Yeltsin and the leaderships of the other republics the opportunity to speak, we might well be discussing today a motion of a very different character. I must say that I am undoubtedly pleased at the way in which events have unfolded, but I think we have to be very much on our guard that we do not see these circumstances as justifying an absence on our part of vigilance and continued concern. </PARA>
<PARA>  The people of the Baltics are to be congratulated on regaining their independence. It was one of the quirks of history which found us commemorating the anniversary of the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact so shortly after it looked like there would once again be a military army occupying the Baltic States. For that reason I took a particular interest in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  I proposed, in my original motion, that we express concern about the events that had occurred just in advance of and during that military takeover in which there was a tragic loss of life. It was then appropriate that the anniversary of that pact fell at a time when we were reminded so poignantly of the ease with which democratic aspirations could be undermined and destroyed, with these events taking place in the Baltic states. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important to acknowledge President Gorbachev's statement that the Baltic states have a right to independence. We must call upon the Soviet Union, as we do in this motion, to expedite its formal recognition of the independence of the Baltic states and to withdraw its remaining troops. </PARA>
<PARA>  But the fact is that there are signs, even now, that events are further changing. We may see recognition by the Soviet Union of the independence of each of the Baltic states. Reports overnight suggested that President Gorbachev may in fact recognise that that Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, about which we have so frequently commented, was an illegal annexation--thus the three states are entitled to their independence--and that the Soviet Union recognises this is the case. </PARA>
<PARA>  Notwithstanding the recognition that Australia and each of the other major Western powers--save the initial hesitancy of the United States of America--has accorded the Baltic states, the Baltics live in the shadow of an omnipresent threat to their sovereignty until the Soviet Union says it also accepts the reality of this situation. </PARA>
<PARA>  We, in the Opposition, have put many motions to the Senate and to this House demanding that the Soviet Union give the Baltic people their freedom. In the spirit in which this motion is proposed, I congratulate the Government on recognising the Baltic republics. It was a little time coming. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that he hoped that Australia would be one of the first countries to recognise the Baltics, but in the end we followed well after most of the Nordic countries and well after much of Europe and Canada. </PARA>

<PARA>  A moment ago the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) said that we recognised the Baltic states after the Europeans did; he should get his facts right. The fact is that Australia recognised the Baltic states before the European countries, before the European Community. I challenge him to contradict that point. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a person who has been involved for a long time in this struggle for the recognition of the independence and sovereignty of the Baltic states, I take exception to the honourable member's comments that, in fact, we came to this rather late, and only when it became political. What nonsense! It is very easy for the Opposition to make comments; it is another thing for the Australian Labor Party, which is in government, which has the actual responsibility of governing and making determinations and decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>  If one looks at how this process came about, one sees that one of the most significant things has been the fact that the Australian Labor Party passed a resolution at its national conference in June this year in support of the independence and sovereignty of the Baltic states. That went far beyond the fact that the Hawke Government has never recognised the incorporation of the Baltic states into the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA>  We went beyond that point in the national conference this year. We recognised the events and called for Australia to recognise the independence of the Baltic states and to call on the Soviet President, Mr Gorbachev, to go further in the recognition of the independence of the Baltic states. The latest news is that he will exercise his powers as President of the Soviet Union and finally disown the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. That is a very important development. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition's motion does not in any way signal the important fact that Australia was one of the first countries to do this. This gave great heart to the Baltic people. I would have hoped that that would have been incorporated into the motion. The fact that it has not been incorporated into the motion is a glaring omission. </PARA>
<PARA>  The most important thing that has happened for the Baltic people in Australia in many years has been the act of recognition by Australia of their independence, which as I said gave heart to and in fact encouraged other countries around the world. It was certainly the first Anglo-Saxon country and one of the first countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to do so. So to suggest that Australia and the Australian Labor Government have not been forward in this matter is a nonsense. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There is no reference to this. Imagine having a motion on the Baltic states and ignoring the most important fact that this Parliament, this Government, was one of the first to acknowledge their independence; ignoring the act of recognition by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) of their independence. I was very moved by the wonderful work of the Baltic people of Australia, especially the work done by the Baltic Council of Australia in Victoria and its Chairman, Valda Liepens.   Three days before Australia's recognition, on the fifty-second anniversary of the infamous pact, I was proud to be amongst those who attended a vigil outside the arts centre in Melbourne. That vigil was to express solidarity, as was the lighting of bonfires throughout the three Baltic nations on that same day. As happened in medieval times, these bonfires signalled to the world the very real danger that the Baltic states still faced. As we know, there was a coup in the Soviet Union at that time. The conservative forces were ready to reinvade the Baltic states. Fortunately, the Soviet coup collapsed and within days Australia recognised the independence of the Baltic states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The work of the Baltic Council and many people from our great Baltic communities--the Estonians, the Latvians and the Lithuanians, who for many years have wanted independence--has finally come to fruition. It was a very emotional moment and after the recognition was announced, I was proud to attend meetings of both the Lithuanian and Latvian communities--I will soon be attending an Estonian function--which celebrated their independence. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those people--not the politicians--are the ones who deserve our congratulations for their persistence over many years in what has been a just cause. Why has it been a just cause? Because the Baltic states were forcibly incorporated by the infamous Molotov- Ribbentrop pact between Stalin and Hitler. Those three nations are culturally different, and proud of it. They do not hate the Russians. They do not have anything against Russians as such, but they are a culturally different people from Russians. Their cultures are more akin to those of that region of Europe than they are to the Russian culture. </PARA>
<PARA>  Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have persisted with their claim that they were very hard done by. The whole international community should feel ashamed that action was not taken earlier to pressure Mr Gorbachev and others to grant those states their independence, because they are not the same as the other states of the Soviet Union; they are completely different. They were forcibly incorporated, and that was a gross violation of human rights which should have been reversed many years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is better late than never, as they say in life. A very important act has been carried out. It has provided a symbol for many other people around the world who are oppressed and who are forcibly prevented from undertaking acts of self-determination. It is time that we in the international community recognised that, simply because as a result of some war some superpower decides to draw boundary lines on a map and forcibly incorporate people into that boundary, it does not follow that that constitutes a natural nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  We must recognise that if we are serious about human rights one of the fundamental human rights is that of self-determination. The Baltic peoples satisfy all of the conditions for being separate nations. They have done so from the beginning. It is a shame that this matter was not dealt with by the international community much earlier. It is amazing that the United States still has not recognised the Baltic states, and I hope that it does so as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>  Several of the superpowers are having trouble coming to grips with the fundamental principle of self-determination. That principle must be respected in relation not only to the Baltic people but also to many other groups around the world that have a clear claim and who have been forcibly incorporated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --It is with a great deal of pleasure that I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) which congratulates Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on finally regaining their independence from the Soviet Union. Most honourable members know how the Baltic states were annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. A grubby deal was done by Hitler and Stalin, both renowned butchers of this century. It is something that the Baltic states have had to live with for many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  When the Soviets took over the Baltic states it is alleged that an average of 60,000 people from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania died. Many of those people were taken as captives into the gulags and were never heard of again. I recently took a trip to eastern Europe, and I believe that some of those people may even still be there if they have been fortunate enough, or unfortunate enough, to survive. </PARA>
<PARA>  I visited Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Poland. When one speaks to the people in those countries one is amazed at the great load that has been lifted from their shoulders. I say to the young people in the gallery that we in Australia are not really aware of the meaning of freedom and democracy. They are a precious flower that should be guarded very strongly. Given what is happening in the Soviet Union and other places today, young Australians should closely study the history of those countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  On returning to Australia from eastern Europe, and knowing how wonderful those people felt, we heard of the Communist coup in Russia. It seemed that once again the conservative forces were going to take over. I was terrified to think of what this would mean to those people whom I had met in eastern Europe if this were to happen again. I was terrified to think of what would happen to their families, work, freedoms--in fact every facet of their lives. All of that would be affected. I doubted whether they could take it. If a Communist coup had happened again, heaven knows what would have happened as far as revolutions and counter-revolutions were concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>  When I was a young boy, I met a fellow called John. He was the first Baltic person I met. He had come from Lithuania. At the age of 10 years, he told me stories of murder. His father had been killed by the Russians. At the age of 10 years he was able to tell me that his mother and sisters were raped by whatever armies were going through that particular part of the country at the time. He was in Australia and he finished up in an orphanage because he had no father to look after him. </PARA>
<PARA>  That was my first experience of someone from the Baltic states. From that time onwards we know that the Baltic people here in Australia have made a tremendous contribution. We know that the Baltic states were perhaps better treated than some of the other satellite states of Russia in that they had more food and better opportunities because they were close to the Scandinavian countries where news would come from. </PARA>
<PARA>  By 1950 a lot of the resistance to the Soviet invasion had almost ceased because the KGB and the Soviet Government had ruled supreme. But in recent years there was a movement in the Baltic states. The flame of freedom was never extinguished, and the movement developed. Now we see countries all over the world recognising the Baltic states and their freedom. Lithuania has borne the brunt of the problems with the Soviet Union, but now there is great joy in those states as we see them being recognised by other countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  I congratulate the Baltic Council of Australia on the work it has done in trying to impress upon our Government the need for us to recognise the independence of the Baltic states. I should like to say to John, my friend of many years ago, `I hope you have had a good life in Australia. I hope things have gone well for you. I am so pleased for you and the country of Lithuania which holds your heritage'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It gives me great pleasure to rise to congratulate Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on gaining their independence from the Soviet Union; to welcome Gorbachev's acknowledgment of the independence of the Baltic states--a right which they have; to call upon the Soviet Government to expedite its formal recognition of the independence of these three states; and to urge the Australian Government to examine ways to support the reconstruction of their economies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Since I became the member for Adelaide, I have attended a number of rallies and spoken at a number of rallies on behalf the three Baltic nations, many people from which live in my electorate. After the motion was passed at our Australian Labor Party convention in June urging the recognition of Lithuania, I wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>During the last 18 months Lithuania's democratically elected government has declared its independence but been recognised, I believe only by Iceland. At critical moments when the Gorbachev leadership's utility to the West are in evidence--at the outset of the Gulf War, when Gorbachev received his Nobel Prize, and during the recent Moscow summit--Lithuania has been subjected to repression and killings by Soviet special forces . . . I write to ask you two things. Could we make diplomatic inquiries to the Soviet government about its future intentions with respect to the Baltic states and the level of repression it regards as appropriate? And could you also provide me with a public statement concerning Australia's current policy towards those states of the Soviet Union pursuing independence by democratic means. </PARA>
<PARA>Shortly after I sent that letter, before the Foreign Minister could reply, the fortunately abortive coup took place in the Soviet Union, which spurred me to then write to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is well beyond the time when Australia should recognise the sovereignty of Lithuania, and I urge you to take steps to rectify our current foreign policy with regard to this State. I would suggest that we look to extending this recognition to the other Baltic States of Latvia and Estonia at some time soon. </PARA>
<PARA>A couple of days after that, on 27 August, I was pleased to note that the Prime Minister announced that the Government had decided on that date to establish full diplomatic relations with the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. I was very pleased to note this early recognition by the Australian Government. I was able to take these messages, together with the letters that I had written to the Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister, to a rally that had already been organised for Saturday, 31 August, on the steps of the South Australian Parliament House situated on North Terrace. That was last Saturday. I explained what I had tried to do. I read out the Prime Minister's statement of recognition and the hundreds of people not only from the Baltic states but also from other nations still held captive by the Soviet empire passed the following resolution unanimously. I assured them I would bring it to this House and read it out, which I now propose to do:</PARA>
<PARA>The Baltic communities of South Australia wish to express their gratitude to the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. Bob Hawke as being among the first leaders of english speaking countries to recognise the de facto independence of Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian States. </PARA>
<PARA>Of considerable significance for Baltic communities in South Australia is the fact that diplomatic recognition by Australia of Baltic States came ahead of the European Community and United States confirming its leading role--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Australian Government's leading role--</PARA>
<PARA>in human and national rights. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Governments of the independent Baltic States are facing enormous challenges in restoring damaged environment as well as rebuilding the economy after fifty years of Soviet occupation and mismanagement, generous economic assistance and cultural exchange should be made available to the people and governments of the Baltic States. </PARA>
<PARA>They conclude:</PARA>
<PARA>The Baltic communities of South Australia also wish to express their gratitude to the Opposition for their support, and all friends in parliament for numerous resolutions promoting the independence of the Baltic States. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I should say that this coming Saturday, at 11.30 on the steps of Parliament House of South Australia, North Terrace, Adelaide, there will be a rally held by the Ukrainian community of South Australia to seek a similar movement towards independence by the Ukrainian state. I will be attending that rally and will be speaking there in the same terms as I have to the Baltic peoples. Essentially what I will say will be this: when the Ukrainian state has control of the population, control of the territory and is capable of entering into diplomatic relations and foreign relations with other states, I will be urging on our Government that we undertake exactly the same course of action as we have recently taken with respect to the Baltic nations, that is, entering into diplomatic relations with the sovereign state of the Ukraine. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a great pleasure to be able again to present to this Parliament the Flags Amendment Bill. This is the 1991 version, the same as the 1990 one. In fact, this is the fourth time that the coalition parties have presented this Bill to the House of Representatives. It really behoves the Government to take up the challenge this time and accept this Bill and to allow it to be passed. It has already been passed in the Senate six years ago on a motion by my colleague Senator Durack, and I find it extraordinary that a Government that continues to claim that it supports the Australian flag is not prepared to support a Bill which does nothing more than allow the Australian people to have a say in whether or not they maintain this flag. I have formally moved the second reading of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As I say, it is extraordinary that the Government, which professes to support the Australian flag and, in fact, uses parts of it in its own logo, is not prepared to allow the people of Australia the right to have a say in whether at any time they wish to keep the Australian flag or change it. All this Bill does is to say that any suggestion of changing the Australian flag should be put to a referendum of the Australian people. It does nothing more, yet on every occasion when this is brought to the House the Government refuses to allow the matter to be voted upon. One can only ask the question: what is it hiding; why is the Government not prepared to take the Australian people into its confidence and to show them that it is serious about the fact that any proposals to change the Australian flag have to be voted on at a referendum? I cannot for the life of me see why the Government is refusing to take up that challenge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  So again we present this Bill, and again I call upon the Government to respond in a positive manner, to accept the Bill as it is and to allow its passage through this chamber to complement what has already happened in the Senate. In that way, we will then be able to allow the people of Australia to have a say in any proposals to change. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note that the last time this was debated, namely, last year, the Government accused the Opposition, of all things, of taking up valuable time of the House. I found that quite extraordinary because it is entirely in the Government's hands. As I say, this is the fourth time we have put this Bill up. If the Government were serious about its supposed support for the Australian flag, it would allow the whole matter to proceed forthwith.</PARA>
<PARA>  It also is very interesting to note that until 1988 the Labor Party had as part of its platform the abolition of the existing Australian flag. Then in 1988, it just quietly slipped off the platform. One wonders what was really going on. But I still think we have to ask where the Government's sincerity is, because clearly there are a lot of doubts. The fact that this Bill has had to be re-presented in itself shows that we have very grave doubts about the Labor Party's sincerity on the matter of supporting the current Australian flag. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note that a senior member of the Government in another place, Senator Evans, was quoted in Hansard in 1981 in his disparaging remarks about the Australian flag, which are well known but worth repeating here, as having said:</PARA>
<PARA>We can do. . . better than the present undistinguished and undistinctive bit of cloth which we have inherited from our colonial past and which manifestly does not set anybody's pulse racing in the community at large, except, perhaps, the occasional Returned Services League blimp or a proportion of the tory back bench opposite. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an extremely insulting statement from Senator Evans. It is one that shows total lack of understanding of the people of Australia, and lack of understanding of the contribution that so many have made to this country, particularly in the name of our Australian flag. I guess that highlights why we continue to doubt the sincerity of the Labor Government in its continuing refusal to accept this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are presenting this again to give the Government the opportunity to change, the opportunity to actually take up this challenge and the opportunity to show that this Labor Party does in fact have the chance to support the Australian flag, as indeed another leader of the Labor Party did in years gone by. I think it is worth reminding honourable members opposite of just what one of their former leaders, Mr Arthur Calwell--a great leader of the Labor Party--said in 1953 when the Flags Act was introduced by the Menzies Government. It is worth noting that the Act was signed personally by Queen Elizabeth II. In supporting the Government, the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Calwell, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Every nation needs a symbol of its unity. . . It is true that a flag is merely a piece of bunting, but it is also true that it is something round which the whole nation can be rallied. . . Now that we are to have a national flag, let us give it pre-eminence on all occasions. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are fine words from the leader of the Labor Party of the day. I think those sentiments ought to be brought home to honourable members opposite, who should again be asked why they fail to support what is a very basic amendment? I refer honourable members to section 9 of the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian National Flag declared by section 3 shall not be altered except in accordance with a proposal to alter that flag that has been:</PARA>
<PARA>  (a)  submitted in each State and Territory to the electors qualified to vote for the election of members of the House of Representatives; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (b)  approved by a majority of all the electors voting. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very straightforward and I welcome the support of my colleague the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), who is seconding this Bill. I therefore call upon the Government to take up the challenge and allow this Bill to pass through the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There are two questions here. One concerns a mechanism that would be invoked to either assist or deny change to a symbol of Australia--that is, the Australian flag; the second question concerns the credence that one gives to the current Australian flag. I want to distinguish both elements, because I find it is difficult to accept the proposition of using the mechanism of a referendum in order to get change. We know that it is difficult to put a positive point of view to the Australian people--in order, for instance, to change the Constitution--and get it up successfully. The very mechanism of a referendum is one that is very difficult to use to produce change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If one wants to use the mechanism of a referendum in order to stop change, then it is almost certain it will have that effect. The use of a referendum to stop change in Australia is almost certain to succeed. That is the difficulty I have about using the mechanism of a referendum on potential changes to the flag, which would almost certainly mean there would be no changes to the flag. That is the difficulty I have with the Bill and why I will not support it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at how changes take place. I am thinking back to the Whitlam era. In that great Labor Government's period we got used to very simple terms such as the `Australian Government'. We moved away from the older term of `Commonwealth', even though `Commonwealth' referred to the Commonwealth of Australia and not to the Commonwealth of Nations--that British notion. Whitlam's very use of the language helped to mature this nation, because he used the term `Australia'-- `Australian Commonwealth', `Australian Government'. I think even the cups and saucers in this place used to carry the insignia `Commonwealth Government' and it was changed to `Australian Government'. I know that some honourable members opposite refuse to eat their food off plates which have `Australian Government' on them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is true. A couple of the honourable member's mates refuse to eat their meals off plates with `Australian Government' on them. Perhaps the honourable members are no longer here; they may have been tossed out at some previous election. But the story is certainly true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Whitlam was elected with a clear notion that he wanted to make Australia a prouder country, a more mature country, and he did that by introducing new language and so on. To try to lock in a current symbol of the nation is, I think, folly. The nation does need to make up its own mind, but one cannot put in an absolute blocker on one's ability to make that change. </PARA>
<PARA>  During the many times that I have explained the symbolism of the current Australian flag to school children in my electorate I have always regarded the flag as a map of Australia's history. Of course, we were discovered and then later populated by the British, and it is fair that at this point in our history we retain the Union Jack, because it is an accurate description of our history. Then, of course, with the blue background, there is the notion of moving from the British Isles, across the sea, to discover this great land in the southern ocean symbolised by the Southern Cross. </PARA>
<PARA>  Thus the symbolism of the current flag is absolutely accurate in terms of describing our history. When I am talking to school children, I go on to ask them whether that description--now, in a sense, a couple of hundred years old--will be relevant 50 years down the track. I see the Australian flag as being on a scroll where, over time, the relevance of British institutions and the notion of discovery will lessen, the flag will roll on and the Union Jack will eventually slide off the flag. It will need to be replaced by other symbols of Australia, circa 2050 or whenever. </PARA>
<PARA>  There will come a time when a very large number of Australian people will probably seek more relevant symbols for Australia at that time, and we must not seek to stop them achieving those new symbols by using this device which we know is very heavily weighted against change. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not like the device and I want to encourage debate about the notion of the flag as it exists today. Of course, I am very proud of our flag. As I have mentioned, it is a very accurate description of where we have come from. We have the seven-point star, the star of the Commonwealth of Australia, which indicates the notion of bringing six States together, the extra point symbolising the Commonwealth itself. All these things are entirely accurate and are an appropriate description of Australia today, but they may not always be so. It may not always be that the Australian people will wish to have the flag exactly as it is today. In time we may well want that scroll to roll on; we may well desire the change. </PARA>

<PARA>  At the moment I cannot give an alternative mechanism that would satisfy both the mover of the Bill and me as to how we might achieve change with a complete consensus of the Australian people. I am not quite sure. For instance, one could not simply put a series of flags to the Australian people and have a series of questions on a referendum. That would be a dog's breakfast. It would be difficult if we were to put half a dozen flags before the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>  Remember that in about 1903 the current Australian flag was designed in a competition, probably worldwide, for which the prize was, I think, #200. It was never put to a referendum. One of the successful entrants was a Kiwi. A New Zealander and a couple of Australians were equally successful in designing the current Australian flag. There was no referendum--there was a prize; like a lottery. We have a fascination with lotteries and prizes in this country--free, new, whoopee, terrific. We did that back in 1903. It is strange to say that from time to time since then the flag has changed--in minor ways--again without reference to the people. </PARA>

<PARA>  Let us not confuse the question. Our flag was drawn up by means of a competition. It was judged by governments--not at that time by the Australian people. It has been changed consequently, but not through the will of the people, and--as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Price), who is at the table, indicated--so have other important symbols of Australia such as our currency. To all of a sudden halt what is now a tradition of drawing up and then changing the flag by using a most conservative mechanism--that is, a referendum--would fly in the face of almost 90 years of tradition. Ninety years of tradition would dictate that the Australian flag is a moving target; it has changed from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want all those school children whom I address to think about changes they might want to make.

The Flags Amendment Bill is not about preventing change--and I want to remind him about that and to make that point strongly; it is merely about setting in place the process for change and establishing a methodology for change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We were reminded by the honourable member for Petrie about the Whitlam years. Most Australians are still horrified to be reminded about the Whitlam years because many of the valued institutions and values that existed in our society at the time were changed. Changes were imposed on us from above, often insensitively, and, with the value of hindsight, I think, ill-advisedly. With great enthusiasm, the people of Australia eventually threw the Whitlam Government out on its ear and Malcolm Fraser came in with the biggest majority in history and maintained that majority through to the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), who is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and who is at the table, interjected--with some levity, I take it--that we had changed the currency and we did not have to have a referendum for that. I take that interjection seriously because it completely downgrades the importance of this issue. We cannot compare the Australian flag, and the tradition that it represents, with the Australian currency. It is not a matter of changing the quid for the dollar in this case. Many Australians have died to preserve what this flag represents. Australian sportsmen have served with distinction underneath this flag, and they have been inspired by it. </PARA>
<PARA>  This private member's Bill seeks to ensure that the flag, because of the tradition it represents for many Australians, is not changed lightly or without the fullest consideration of the implications of change. The ultimate decision for such a profound change ought to rest directly with the Australian people, not even with the Parliament. I do not say this lightly: I say it because perhaps we cannot trust parliaments. That is probably a terrible thing to say, but the Whitlam experience showed us that we cannot trust Parliament. To be even-handed, I hesitate to say that it is only the honourable member for Chifley's Party that we do not trust. The point is that we believe that even the Parliament should not make such a profound change to a cherished tradition without reference to the Australian people by a referendum. </PARA>
<PARA>  Having said that--and in fairness to what the honourable member for Petrie said, I took the point of his contribution--I believe that it ought to be said that I, and perhaps many others who support the Bill, do not necessarily believe that the flag should remain forever. The honourable member for Petrie is right about that. It may well be that a persuasive case could be made for change, because he is right--things do change over time. </PARA>
<PARA>  It should be recognised that many countries have made changes to their flags but, in my view, we do not want to make change without a clear indication from every individual Australian that there should be such a change. There must be good reasons for change. I suspect that sometimes we are tempted in this place to make change for the sake of change, but unfortunately some people have little respect for tradition; and there is a big difference between nostalgia and tradition. If we tear down or destroy tradition, we tear apart the very fabric of our society. I suspect that perhaps that is what some honourable members on the other side of this place want to do. </PARA>
<PARA>  Perhaps the time to change the flag will come, but this Bill seeks to put in place a process or a methodology for change, and the question that the Australian people ought to be asked in that situation is, `Do you want a change?'. Let us not muddy the water about giving them different designs to choose from. The fundamental question that this Bill seeks to entrench is that the Australian people will be asked that question at a referendum: every individual Australian will be asked, before any change is made, `Do you want change?'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- My comments will be brief but, I hope, to the point. I say at the outset that I have some difficulty in understanding the necessity for this legislation. Whilst I do not oppose it in its form, I find the necessity of it quite unwarranted. There are many areas of legislation that pass through this place and become law that also, I believe, are unwarranted. I believe that the educative process is the way to approach this, as it is in many other areas of legislation. I believe we are putting into place legislation which could inhibit the respect of our Australian standard: the national flag. When we look at the situation where the law enforcers in our community have legislation in place which they have to act upon, would that not focus more for those who wish to express their views against our national flag? I just pose that question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  No-one to whom I have listened has mentioned the basis or make-up of our national flag. I have no difficulty with it, but I note that no-one on the opposite side who has spoken has mentioned the presence of the Union Jack. I have some difficulty with the presence of the Union Jack. I do not really see that in this day and age the presence of it has anything to do with the nation of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said on innumerable occasions that there will be no change to the Australian flag without a referendum. I do not see that as being a problem. Personally, I would not like to see it changed without the consent, the feeling and the views of the majority of Australians--</PARA>

They have a sickening record of that. The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) has not been here very long. If he has enough time up there on the Gold Coast he should look in the history books and he will see the Opposition's record on referendums. The Opposition cannot even get its tourism industry going up there--the Government has got it up and running in Cairns and it is leading Australia in its recovery--let alone talk about the standard of the Australian flag.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Those opposite muddy the waters and mislead the Australian public, as they have always done, on the voting of referendums. This piece of legislation is useless. The Opposition's record speaks for itself. The putting into place of regulatory sanctions could, in the long run, be counterproductive. There is no doubt of that in my mind. </PARA>
<PARA>  Quite frankly, as one trained in `legalese', I find the Flags Amendment Bill to be a very vague piece of legislation; in fact, the preamble is certainly not met by the contents of the Bill. The last part of the preamble is not even enshrined in the legislation. Whilst I have no difficulty with the legislation per se, I believe it could have been better drafted. It really is not necessary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave --There were a lot of red herrings in the speech of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler). He spoke about tourism, which was getting off the track. I will put the honourable member's mind at ease. He accused us of going out and muddying the water over referendums. That would not be the case here. We will not go to the Australian people and misrepresent the question. We are saying this is such a cherished tradition that we would not want to see the flag changed without every Australian being asked, `Do you want to change the flag?'. What is wrong with that? We can only suspect the motivation of those opposite if they do not agree to this proposition. Why would they want to impose such a fundamental change on the Australian people? The honourable member for Leichhardt has said that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) intends--he does not have very much time left; we ought to recognise that his days are numbered--to change the Australian flag. I take that as a serious affront, as a direct threat to the traditions that I cherish.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The abject failure of the Hawke Labor Gover- nment and the Australian Taxation Office, the ATO, in redressing extensive abuse of interest withholding tax--appropriately called the `out of harbour schemes' by Mrs Barbara Smith of the Phillip Institute of Technology in Melbourne, who has consistently and courageously researched this subject in great depth--is a matter of continuing disgrace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As I said in my grievance speech on 7 March this year, estimates of the revenue lost to the Commonwealth through these schemes vary significantly, but it has been estimated that up to $1 billion a year in tax is being avoided or evaded through these schemes. Furthermore, the Martin Committee report entitled Follow the Yellow Brick Road, tabled in this House on 18 April last, concluded among other things on page XI:</PARA>
<PARA>That specific measures aimed at countering the withholding tax arrangements identified during the inquiry are both warranted and necessary in order to reinforce existing anti-avoidance measures available to the ATO. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the Committee said on page XV:</PARA>
<PARA>The low priority accorded to the withholding tax area by the ATO was evident from the absence of administrative controls which are now being implemented by the ATO. </PARA>
<PARA>It was further stated on the same page:</PARA>
<PARA>In the view of the Committee, the lack of administrative controls in this area has been an important factor contributing to the continued abuse of the withholding tax provisions through non-resident beneficiary and other tax avoidance/evasion arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been ample time for the Government to study the exhaustive findings and recommendations of the Martin Committee, so it is more than reasonable to have expected action in this last Federal Budget to stop this blatant loss of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not only did reform not eventuate but a regressive step was actually taken, as correctly reported in the lead item of the Fagin column in the Sydney Sun-Herald of 1 September. As background to this backward move, I point out to the House that Budget Paper No. 1, on page 4.21, states:</PARA>
<PARA>Revenue from withholding tax was $901 million in 1990-91, 13.4 per cent below the Budget estimate. The estimate for 1991-92 is $1,100 million, an increase of 22.1 per cent on 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>This apparent increase comes about because the interest withholding tax collected at 10 per cent on interest paid to non-residents has quite surreptitiously had included under its head of revenue the resident withholding tax, an entirely separate tax collected at the top marginal rate of 48.25 per cent on the interest of resident bank accounts where a tax file number has not been quoted. Mrs Barbara Smith is aptly quoted as saying in the Fagin column that this `bears all the hallmarks of creative accounting'. In fact, it is difficult not to believe that this is a deliberate measure aimed at confusing the Parliament and ensuring that no further analysis of non-resident interest withholding tax and thus quantification of interest paid to non-residents will be possible. </PARA>
<PARA>  Odd as this change might be, it must also be added that it is only the latest in a series of strange events that have occurred in the formulation and administration of tax policy since the Hawke Labor Government was first elected in March 1983. Why, for instance, was section 14 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, relating to the annual report, amended in May 1983 to take effect from 18 July 1983, from a precise requirement in the former section 14(2) that, `the Commissioner shall draw attention to any breaches or evasions of this Act', to a more bland wording that effectively allowed the Commissioner of Taxation to discontinue the publishing of the names of tax defaulters in the annual report?</PARA>
<PARA>  More recently, what lay behind the extraordinary allegations in the media in April of this year that tax file numbers were being sold as part of a tax fraud racket? The subsequent conviction in a Sydney court on 30 April of an illegal immigrant on nine charges relating to misuse of another person's tax file number and other tax related offences still left unanswered questions about this bizarre episode. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn now to the most disquieting matter I wish to raise in respect of taxation policy and administration, and that is the role performed over time by Mr Mark Leibler. In my grievance speech of 7 March, I referred at length to Mr Leibler's representations in 1986 to a senior level of the ATO, which resulted in the withdrawal of 700 standard letters sent out by the Melbourne branch of the ATO to trustees of schemes taking advantage of withholding tax arrangements. In essence, those letters questioned the legitimacy of arrangements made and required `prompt payment of the full amount of tax assessed'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Leibler is well-known as a senior partner in the Melbourne city law firm of Arnold Bloch Leibler and is a taxation lawyer of long standing. I am sure the House will be most interested to know that Mr Leibler has for some years also been a member of the Commissioner of Taxation's advisory panel, the national tax liaison group and the capital gains tax subcommittee. In addition, it must be pointed out that Mr Leibler is the only non-ATO person to sit on all three of these key tax advisory bodies. It quite clearly places him in a position of enormous influence. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would also suggest, given Mr Leibler's record over an extended period, that it puts him in a position of acute conflict of interest and potentially compromises the integrity of the ATO. Let us look at some aspects of Mr Leibler's most interesting history over the past decade. In a Melbourne Age report of 5 June 1982 concerning the McCabe-Lafranchi report on tax avoidance, Mr Leibler was reported as being director or secretary of seven companies that went to the bottom of the harbour. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 10 December 1985, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the AAT, in the case of Arnold Bloch Leibler and Co. and the Federal Commissioner of Taxation, determined that the entire text of ATO procedures manuals sought by Arnold Bloch Leibler were exempt documents as their release would jeopardise the effectiveness of ATO procedures. Yet, incredibly, the ATO had already granted Arnold Bloch Leibler access to 90 per cent of the procedure manuals, guides and other documents sought. </PARA>
<PARA>  Furthermore, within a month of Mr Leibler's appointment to the Commissioner's advisory panel in May 1989, Arnold Bloch Leibler instructed for the taxpayer against the Commissioner before the AAT in a case involving sham transactions of money never remitted to overseas beneficiaries. Not long after a vicious attack on ATO operational staff by Mr Leibler in the Age of 26 September 1990, Mr John Thorburn, one of the best ATO auditors in Melbourne on offshore tax avoidance, was moved elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Leibler accused the Martin Committee of conducting a witch-hunt, yet an Age report of 18 April 1991 pointed out that he has been frequently quoted as advising two of the 15 companies identified as major users of tax havens by the Martin Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>  Undoubtedly, one of Mr Leibler's most extraordinary acts was writing a letter to shareholders as chairman of the companies Numinous Nos. 3, 4 and 5. The letter, which was enclosed with the notice of the annual general meeting, read in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Your directors believe that they have solved the problem of potential capital gains tax on vendors' gains and this enhances the appeal of the public shelf company concept. </PARA>
<PARA>This letter is written by the same man who then and now advises the ATO on capital gains tax matters as a member of the capital gains tax subcommittee. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is clear that the time has arrived for a major public inquiry into the management, administration and operational effectiveness of the Australian Taxation Office by a principal committee of this Parliament such as the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Moreover, such an inquiry should closely examine the membership of ATO advisory bodies and their relationship with the ATO. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, I seek leave to table details of the AAT cases I referred to and also the letters concerning companies Numinous Nos. 3, 4 and 5. I have already shown these documents to the Minister at the table. </PARA>
<PARA>  Leave granted. </PARA>

It is misconstrued because in a sense we have made a number of announcements whilst we, the Commonwealth, are still in negotiation with the State governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Everyone would acknowledge that we ought to hold as a principle the fact that there ought to be a greater choice of housing in Australia; that is, that we cannot continue to build three- bedroom houses on a quarter-acre block because in a sense that leaves out those people who cannot afford it or who do not need that style of housing. We would also acknowledge that our very low density cities, our sprawling cities, are particularly energy wasteful and polluting and that, by and large, because we have to travel such very large distances in order to perform daily functions such as travelling to work or to the shops or whatever, there is built in a locational disadvantage to those who have to locate at the fringes of a city. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is also this question of fairness; that is, whether people have sufficient physical access to the sorts of services that people, say, in the middle and inner suburbs have access to but those in the outer suburbs do not. There is a corpus of concerns that arise where Australian citizens do not have equal access to services or, as a group, are energy wasteful in terms of the degree of travel they have to undertake just in order to lead their daily lives. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think it is fit and proper that the Commonwealth have a concern for these matters, especially with respect to the efficiency of cities as well as to the fairness aspects. However, the question arises: how does the Commonwealth intervene? That is one that I am happy to talk about because the Commonwealth is literally still negotiating those sorts of matters. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am chairing a subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies that is looking at the patterns of urban development. We want to concentrate particularly on the mechanisms that will create change in Australian cities. For instance, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) has already announced that there will be some money for capital works which will most likely be used for demonstration projects to be built on Commonwealth land, probably in our major cities. These would be mainly along the styles, I would guess, of medium density developments whereby we could demonstrate that there are alternative ways to house people very happily and suit their needs, a bit more cheaply, closer to the city and much closer to existing arms of public transport. I applaud that. I think that is the decent and proper thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, more powerful mechanisms to change the rules of play may be available to the Commonwealth and these, of course, are the politically more difficult ones. For instance, are we going to change the relative costs of different sorts of housing? I understand that the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce has reported that the cost of building a medium density unit as opposed to a stand-alone house is often higher, but for quite artificial reasons. Often it is because not sufficient land has been released to medium density housing by local governments, although that--for instance, in Adelaide, where I was last week--is hotly contested. Often it is because there is a distinct prejudice against the whole notion of medium density housing, so local governments purposely slow down the building of such developments, and of course those residents who live on the quarter-acre block do not want next to them a medium density housing development. So, there is a prejudice against that type of development. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a third element, that is, the awards under which builders pay their wage rates differ between building a single house as opposed to a two- or three-storey medium density development. We have to look seriously at whether we are artificially raising prices of a certain form of housing in Australia as opposed to our more common and much loved stand-alone house. </PARA>

Much as I love my house on its quarter-acre block--it is possibly a bit more in Brisbane because land is a lot cheaper there--I certainly would not want to buy an alternative medium density house somewhere in the city if it was dearer. If I had to give up my beautiful backyard and it was going to be as costly to buy a unit, however pretty and delightful it was, I would not do it. There would have to be a significant differential in price for me to make the shift.

Perhaps in 15 or 20 years time, when my children move on, my partner and I will not want such a house as we have now. We may be looking for something that is more appropriate to us. We will not care about tending the garden and we will not need as many rooms--in fact, I am sure we will be upset and distraught because the kids have run away and left us, and we are looking for alternative accommodation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Will there be enough of this accommodation, and will the price differential be enough? I am not that fussed about money because I am paid very well, but there are those who have to be very careful about selling one property and buying another.  Presumably, if we can make this alternative available whereby, as one reaches an age where the kids move on, there is a significant enough price differential, I will want to buy into accommodation that suits me better--just two bedrooms or the one rather than three or four. I do not have a three or four-bedroom house, but I am just making a comparison. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to look significantly at those mechanisms that will really count every time there is a purchase of a house. Of course, those mechanisms will be far more powerful than the Commonwealth spending money on a demonstration project. As I said, I think we need the demonstrations but we may also need to change some of the rules of play. </PARA>
<PARA>  The cost of movement within Australia by individual motor cars is really quite cheap, much as constituents would not agree with me on that. At some stage, the Commonwealth will have to bite the bullet on the issue of whether or not there ought to be a carbon tax--that is, a tax on all sorts of burnable fuels that are not renewable--in order that we make sure we get the best use out of those fuels. Again, it would not be readily supported by people. It is the cost of moving around by means of individual transport which is the very cause of low density cities. It is possible to commute 40 or 50 kilometres because petrol and cars are relatively cheap. If we are fair dinkum about changing the rules of play, we would have to seriously debate the cost to the individual of moving around. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we want people to make more acute locational decisions, it will concentrate the mind very readily if it becomes more expensive to travel around in individual cars. Of course, the danger of that is the distributional effects. We would not want to harm those people who live great distances from the city and do not have a great deal of income. We are not looking to tax them. We need devices whereby people will be far more aware about their locational decisions and the consequences of them. Only by those means are we going to rearrange our cities sufficiently so that we get some decent efficiencies and save some of the very wasteful costs that we now have on the public works and infrastructure in Australian cities. That is what the Common- wealth is in the middle of discovering. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My grievance concerns the state of the mining industry in Australia and, in particular, the condition of it in Western Australia. My concerns are confirmed by a consulting geophysicist in my electorate. My constituent points out that he has both undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications in his field. He has some 30 years experience in geophysics, mainly in the area of mineral exploration. For the past 13 years this man has been the proprietor of his own registered company, once employing two other people. The firm has a considerable amount of computing equipment and other capital items.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As he himself has pointed out, one would expect such a person to be drawing an income in the vicinity of at least $50,000 a year before tax, even making allowances for the impact of the recession we had to have. However, this chap's earnings in recent years were only half that amount. In the 1989-90 financial year his income was something like $25,000, on a turnover of $48,800. Last tax year he managed to draw an income of only $20,000 on the basis of a turnover of $40,000. During 1990 he estimates that he had two days work a week throughout the year. He has not had any paid work since May of this year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The man concerned cannot qualify for Jobsearch allowance while he is nominally employed by his own company. To qualify for a benefit of that sort he would need to give up his company and his considerable personal investment in its development over many years. He joins some 500 geologists out of work in Perth at the present time. Job advertisements for geologists in Western Australia invariably rate 100 or more applicants for each position. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mineral exploration expenditure has fallen considerably in Australia in recent years. From a peak in 1987-88 of $799.2m, mineral exploration expenditure has fallen to $607.5m in 1989-90 and a similar amount in the last financial year. Contributing factors to the exploration slump include the stock market crash of 1987, which has since discouraged speculative investment of the type which mineral exploration embodies. The introduction of a gold tax has obviously not invigorated the goldmining industry. Various changes to companies law have made the establishment of new enterprises more difficult and much more costly. </PARA>
<PARA>  A number of decisions by the Federal Government, such as that over Coronation Hill, have created uncertainty and undermined investor confidence. A new tax ruling has disallowed the deductibility of the cost of airborne surveying outside leases held by an exploration company. Previously, Western Australia and Queensland benefited from the practice of mining companies flying over large areas in order to select sites for leases, which was not permitted in other States. This tax ruling ignores the realities of mineral exploration which requires the study of geology, geochemistry and geophysics of large tracts of land in order to choose an area with potential for mineralisation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The result of all these factors and others depressing the mining industry will be a brain drain of geologists and others with related qualifications to overseas countries, or to other vocations where their qualifications might be usefully applied. Exploration companies are increasingly focusing their attention overseas due, in part, to the unfavourable environment in Australia at the present time. BHP has extensive activities in Chile--most notably the Escondia copper mine--and MIM is also beginning to explore there. CRA operates in the Philippines and Indonesia. Western Mining Corporation Ltd has operations in the United States, Canada, Liberia and Chile and is expanding those overseas operations. Obviously, the profits from these ventures will be repatriated to Australia, but we lose out on the employment and activity that would result if these operations were conducted in Australia to a much greater extent than they are now able to. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia has fallen from the position of the leading minerals explorer to around thirteenth place over a number of years. Chile is the leading explorer at the present time, which may be somewhat surprising. Australia is thus experiencing a relative decline as an explorer for minerals to the long term detriment of mining activity in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The current vogue amongst policy makers and others in Australia is to increase the level of value added production in our secondary industries. The focus on value added production looks to manufacturing in order to boost our production of traded as opposed to non-traded goods and thereby improve our export performance. It seems that primary industries, such as mining and the various service industries, are considered to be of inferior value in making a contribution to our future economic development. Increased value added production is something to be valued in itself, but it should not occur at the expense of the development of those industries in which we have a comparative advantage. </PARA>
<PARA>  In terms of international competitiveness and increasing our production of traded goods, developing those areas in which we have a comparative advantage will be more important than looking for value added production in the areas in which we are less competitive. Mining is one of the industries in which we have traditionally had a comparative advantage, and this is something we should continue to nurture. </PARA>
<PARA>  It also happens that there is significant scope for Australia to add value to our mining activities through the secondary processing of our minerals prior to export. Adding value and developing our natural advantages need not be mutually exclusive activities. As with any other industry, this involves creating a favourable economic climate with as few distortions and disincentives as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>  No-one needs reminding that the current economic climate is not a favourable one, but this climate is not simply the result of a monetary policy induced cyclical downturn. Even before the recession there were numerous obstacles in the way of Australian industry, including the mining industry, which need to be swept away before we can make further progress in the development of those industries. The situations on the waterfront and with coastal shipping are obvious obstacles in the way of the mining industry and the exports it can generate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our taxation system and, specifically, the various imposts on the mining industry, as such, create numerous problems which inhibit our economic development. The Australian labour market is not really a market at all but more like a rationing system for jobs, where the price for labour is set by a central authority with no regard to the circumstances of the individual workplace. Many of our product markets are sclerotic and in urgent need of micro-economic reform. Our government business enterprises need to be fully privatised before they will deliver productivity comparable to that in the private sector.   Extracting this country from recession is only the first of many challenges that confront the nation. We are also faced with the massive task of overhauling decades of economic inefficiency and underproductive government activity. While this situation continues to exist, we see, through the various approving agencies, paralysis by analysis. No industry in Australia is more affected by that than the mining industry, particularly in Western Australia. All the talk in the world is not going to change that. It is time for this Government to take action and, where necessary, to take action in cooperation with the governments of the various States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On 3 June this year, the report of the Task Force to Review the Operation and Planning of Brisbane Airport was presented to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Bob Collins. This report, I am sorry to say, did not meet with the satisfaction of the community members of the task force and certainly does not have the support of a large section of my electorate. This is evidenced by the presentation this morning in this place of petitions signed by over 1,900 citizens of Brisbane rejecting the findings of the task force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In presenting the report and subsequent recommendations, the task force appears to have failed to consider its basic purpose for existence. I must explain to members of the House a brief recent history of Brisbane Airport and its noise problem. The whole problem was caused by the very poor decision of the Fraser Government to locate the new Brisbane Airport at the mouth of the Brisbane River. No reasonable impact studies were done on the likely noise implications for Brisbane residents and a lot of false claims were made about its effects. In fact, when the airport plan was developed in the late 1970s, my friend, colleague and neighbour, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys), put in a minority report opposing the development plan. He knew then what the problems would be. </PARA>
<PARA>  The matter was further compounded when the Liberal Government cut back on the original airport development plan by reducing the length of the cross runway, preventing its use as the major runway and forcing the majority of flights to take off and land over the city. The people of Brisbane were sold a pup by the Liberals when they were told that aircraft noise would reduce considerably or disappear entirely in all areas of Brisbane when the new runway was commissioned. </PARA>
<PARA>  The construction of the new airport did not reduce noise disruption, but it has largely transferred the problem from one side of the city to the other--thus the inception of the Brisbane Airport task force. Within days of the airport's opening, hundreds of complaints from southside residents poured in. My colleagues the honourable member for Griffith and the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) have worked very hard to have positive action taken to alleviate the noise problems since the airport's opening. Many measures that have been implemented have improved the situation, but the basic problem will always remain because of the original short-sighted decision of the Fraser Liberal Government to locate the airport at the mouth of the river. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since my election in March of last year, I have also taken up the cause for my constituents who have been affected by aircraft noise. Brisbane's residents had been advised by the Department of Civil Aviation when the new airport was developed that the majority of aircraft--between 80 and 90 per cent--would take off and land over Moreton Bay. This, however, is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA>  I obtained figures from the Civil Aviation Authority which show that only approximately 55 per cent of planes take off and land over Moreton Bay. In June this year, the figure was 54 per cent and in July it was 56 per cent. The conclusion that more than 80 per cent of planes would take off and land over the Bay was based on the false assumption that there would be two main runway alignments: that is, a north-west/south-east runway, which they call the 14/32 runway, and a north/south runway, which is called the 01/19 runway. That was the original plan for the airport, but it was dramatically cut back in 1981 when the length of the 14/32 cross runway was reduced. Only 55 per cent of planes take off over the bay because the 14/32 runway is not long enough or wide enough to take large aircraft over the bay. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1989, after much pressure from my colleagues and the community, the Brisbane Airport task force was set up. However, the task force was flawed from the start, both in its composition and in its terms of reference. The terms of reference were contradictory in nature and the composition of the committee severely limited the effectiveness of community representation. The terms of reference were:</PARA>
<PARA>The Task Force will review and make recommendations on the operation and planning of Brisbane Airport to minimise the impact of aircraft noise on surrounding communities while still providing an airport that will meet Brisbane's needs into the future. </PARA>
<PARA>The Task Force is to take the following guidelines into account during the course of the review:</PARA>
<PARA>  - The airport is to remain curfew free. </PARA>
<PARA>  - The airport is expected to meet Brisbane's future aviation needs. </PARA>
<PARA>  - Additional runways would only be provided when justified by capacity levels. </PARA>
<PARA>This final point was the crunch clause of the terms of reference that tied the committee's hands and prevented it from recommending early action on lengthening the cross runway to enable greater use of flight paths over the bay. Further, the terms of reference stated:</PARA>
<PARA>In carrying out the task public involvement will be maximised by close liaison with community groups, industry and State and local government. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee did contain three community representatives, one nominated by each of my colleagues from the seats of Griffith, Bowman and Lilley. Unfortunately, the seat of Moreton was not represented on the task force because of the failure of the previous member for Moreton to fight for the interests of his constituents. The total committee consisted of 13 members, of whom 10 were departmental, local government and airline company representatives and only three were from the community. </PARA>
<PARA>  Protecting vested interests and covering up for past failures and very poor decisions, rather than responding in a meaningful way to the concerns of residents reflected in the views of the community representatives, became paramount in the work of this group. The three community representatives were continually out-voted and out-manoeuvred by the Department-airline coalition. It is little wonder, then, that each of the community representatives contributed dissenting reports to the final report of the task force. </PARA>
<PARA>  Despite the fact that the first paragraph of the task force's terms of reference identified that noise was the major issue, the task force has quite clearly provided no relief from aircraft noise for the long suffering residents south of the Brisbane River. The task force has recommended the construction of a runway parallel to the main 01/19 runway, which is causing the noise problems at present. The task force opted for this rather than a cross runway, despite the fact that the task force has stated in its report:</PARA>
<PARA>Noise impact is greater--</PARA>
<PARA>for the parallel runway--</PARA>
<PARA>than for the alternative 14/32 cross runway development. </PARA>
<PARA>Even to the casual observer this must be a clear breach of the terms of reference which had been set. The recommendation to construct a parallel runway clearly did not take due consideration of the task force's terms of reference. Such a plan would prove to be a total disaster for the whole city of Brisbane and cannot, in fact must not, proceed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The only proposal which will not adversely affect densely populated suburbs is the extension of the cross runway. The task force has clearly failed to minimise noise for Brisbane residents--one of its prime reasons for existence. In doing so, the task force ignored the evidence provided. </PARA>
<PARA>  In a submission to the federal Public Works Committee in October 1979 on the planning of the airport, the Civil Air Operations Officers Association of Australia stated:</PARA>
<PARA>A north-west, south-east runway alignment allows aircraft to operate from the north mostly over water. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, the most common wind in Brisbane during bad weather is a south-westerly--thus the need for a two-runway system. At the same time, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, in a submission to the inquiry, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Runway 14/32--you approach from the sea and take off over the sea. Unless we can point out to you the total disaster this airport is going to be without a cross runway I think we have failed. </PARA>
<PARA>How true those words proved to be for southside residents. The Fraser Liberal Government ignored this advice and the task force has compounded this crime. </PARA>
<PARA>  The task force also had the option of shifting landing beacons in order to alter flight paths and divert them away from homes and over the bay. The task force has ignored the option of placing a flight navigation beacon on or near Stradbroke Island, which would have put flight paths over Moreton Bay and not over homes. </PARA>
<PARA>  At present there is a flight navigation beacon located at Colmslie near the bay and at Laravale near Beaudesert. This means that when guided landings and take offs are required--that is, at night or when the weather is unfavourable--planes must fly over homes and over suburbs in my electorate stretching from Tarragindi and Ekibin to Camp Hill, Coorparoo, Greenslopes and Annerley. This practice effectively means that planes do not fly over the bay. It deliberately takes them over densely populated areas. The task force ignored the relocation of the flight navigation beacons to the bay, which would have avoided the problems of noise for most households. </PARA>
<PARA>  If not addressed now, the problem of aircraft noise will only become worse. The eastern suburbs are one of the fastest growing areas of the city. I look forward to continuing to work closely with my colleagues, and in particular with the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, to find better ways to deal with the aircraft noise issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- In recent weeks, and particularly during the past week, there has been a great deal of public debate regarding gun laws in Australia. A number of differing perspectives have been articulated within the context of that debate. This debate follows the recent Strathfield Plaza shopping centre killings in suburban Sydney in which eight people died and a number of others were injured. We are all well aware of the tragedy associated with that event. Many people, particularly those who were involved in this horrendous occurrence, were moved to tears. The Premier of New South Wales, the Hon. Nick Greiner, yesterday described those killings as `one massacre too many'. Indeed, he was right--nobody would disagree with that. Today's Sydney Morning Herald carries a report that Mr Greiner will announce today the composition of a bipartisan committee to report on the State's gun laws. Mr Greiner said that there was agreement within the State Parliament to produce `cleaner and tougher gun laws that are enforceable'. In addition to this, the New South Wales Government has undertaken to agree immediately to a moratorium or a cooling off period--however temporary that may be--while this serious matter of gun control is looked at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  My personal view, of course, is one of sympathy with the basic principle that has been proposed. But, of course, I am opposed to any moves that will result in the disarming of the ordinary people. One of the themes of the former communist manifesto in respect of gaining control was the importance of disarming the people to make them weaker. But the action that is being taken is very necessary. No Australian, and certainly nobody in this House, would disagree with the absolute necessity to review the whole situation and for a moratorium to be put in place. I applaud all those initiatives and I am sure that all in this House would agree that a sensible, well thought out strategy is desperately needed. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is, however, a far greater threat to the well-being of our fellow Australians, in particular our women and children--a threat that is far worse, I believe, than the weapons currently under debate. One of the things that prompted me to get up and speak this afternoon is the fact that for days after the massacre at Strathfield all our newspapers carried front page stories with headlines printed three inches high suggesting that guns must be banned. </PARA>
<PARA>  Research has shown that the person responsible for the Strathfield massacre had been subjected to the sort of diet of violent videos and publications that we know are part and parcel of such a tragic scene. Yet, even though the headlines said that guns must be banned, it was hard to find anything in print that suggested that something should be done about the violent videos et cetera that we are confronted with daily on our television, through various video outlets and in theatres. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that a loaded gun which has a much greater potential for destruction is being held at our heads. I refer to the violent and hard-core pornographic videos and literature that are readily available in our communities. I will direct a few of my comments along those lines today. I can speak from vast experience in this field. Before I entered Parliament for 17 years I was involved in criminology--not as a criminal, of course, but as someone who dealt with those who perpetrated many horrendous crimes in this nation. For 11 years before coming into Parliament I was chief superintendent of a large institution to which all the inmates committed by the courts of New South Wales were juveniles. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is clear evidence coming from courts around the country that the ways in which crimes of violence are now committed have greatly changed. We are faced with a very serious problem, and I think it is a problem that the community has not fully grappled with. If it had, there would be a lot more activity within local communities with regard to the effect that these videos are having on certain people in our communities who have this low control over impulses. The majority of people, of course, do not have that problem. But there are many people in our community who have a very serious problem with regard to controlling their impulses, and it only takes a violent video of some kind or a hard-core pornographic video or piece of literature to spark them off along the way to a quite dastardly crime. </PARA>
<PARA>  The time has come for this House to stop brushing aside this very serious problem that confronts us which, as I suggested earlier, is really a very large, dangerous loaded gun that is pointed at the heads of our women and children, in particular, in this great nation in which we live. Ten years ago a man could leave home in the morning, say goodbye to his wife and not worry about the doors and windows. Today, when a man leaves home he suggests that his wife makes sure that all the doors are locked and the deadlocks fastened, and that she is very careful about whom she opens the door to. The situation has changed dramatically; our community has become a very dangerous place. It is largely due--and we do not need any research to back this up, although there is voluminous research coming out now--to the impact and effects of violent videos, movies, literature and hard pornographic material on those in our community who are less able to control their impulses. We have a very serious situation indeed. </PARA>
<PARA>   A Melbourne barrister by the name of Mr Richard Read--he is now, and has been for the last 12 years, a prosecutor in the courts in Melbourne--has become very concerned about the many criminal activities in Victoria. He has become so perturbed about the need to come to grips with this problem that he has now gone on a public speaking campaign in strategic areas to bring before the community the awareness that it needs to have with regard to the effects of these influences upon it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend him for the action that he has taken. In some of the cases that come before him which he finds quite distressing--as, indeed, do I--he puts forward a very good case for all parliaments to sit up and take notice. In this House it is very easy to brush the issue aside and say, `Look, let's just leave it idly there and not make too much of a fuss about it. We don't want to be branded as wowsers in this regard'. Really, it does not matter whether one is the president of the world society of atheists or the Pope, commonsense tells us that we have a very grievous problem here that is far worse than the guns that we are debating so much about at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have a problem that no-one seems to be taking any notice of. I call upon all the people of Australia--particularly the women of Australia--to rise up against this tide of hard- core pornography that is overwhelming us. We have taken no responsibility here in this Parliament. Two Senate select committees and a joint select committee have said that we should do something about the pornography that our country is awash with.(Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish to continue the theme of the remarks I was making yesterday in the Budget debate by saying that one of the areas in which we are most likely to notice the polarisation of debate in Australia between the neo-conservatives on the Opposition side and the Labor Party is industry policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Industry policy ought to be the central focus of most of our thinking. Too often it is sidelined and commented on only incidentally in discussions of macro-economic matters. When it is all brought to a proper place and into perspective, we have to realise that what we make and do in this country is essentially what sustains the economic viability of our economy. Without our Government having a clear grasp of what it is seeking to achieve in terms of industry policy, we will be likely to fritter away what advantages we obtain from macro-economic settings being in their correct place. </PARA>
<PARA>   I would say the starting point has to be the statements made earlier this year by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in the document Building a Competitive Australia. Those initiatives--including the establishment of additional funding for the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, the changes in tariff levels and major initiatives in establishing cooperative research centres to improve the amount and quality of research and development--are not going to be matched by the Opposition. Indeed, the comments of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in his reply to the Budget indicate that he would, indeed, draw back from the commitments made in March in the document Building a Competitive Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>   The Opposition spokesman for industry matters, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), is even more inclined to ignore industry policy and be committed to simplistic notions of a level playing field--notions which no longer do Australia any favours. </PARA>
<PARA>   However, if we move past Building a Competitive Australia--taking it as a document which sets out landmark achievements--and look beyond it, one of the areas where we need to look, most importantly, is how we get into our mix of industry policy an appropriate mechanism for funding the commercialisation of research and development. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this country we probably now have some of the most exciting research and development anywhere in the world. The CSIRO, cooperative research centres and universities are all active players in bringing forward a constructive and exciting intellectual work which needs to be assessed commercially and, once that assessment is done, developed and marketed. But in Australia the gap is at the commercialisation end. We do well at research and reasonably well at development to a prototype stage, but we do appallingly badly at commercialising it. With the decline of the management investment companies and the failure of the second board to fully establish itself on the stock market and now, if the stock market has its way, its eventual abolition, we are going to have grave difficulties in funding research and development--in capitalising it. </PARA>
<PARA>  For that reason, the Government has been looking, quite properly, at ways in which additional work can be funded. One of the arguments I have advanced in the Labor Caucus and publicly to the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia is that we should look to superannuation funds to play a responsible part in funding this commercialisation of research and development by seeking from them a commitment to spend not less than one per cent of their invested funds in that area. </PARA>
<PARA>  It seems to me that, given the enormous tax advantages that are inherent in our arrangements for superannuation, a mutual benefit to Australia can be obtained. Firstly, the funds themselves ought to be investing in this area, as pension funds in comparable countries make similar investments in this area. Most importantly, the long term sustainability of Australia's living standards will not be enhanced unless investment managers take aboard their responsibility in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>  There have, however, been fairly negative responses from the superannuation industry. I must say that I find it very difficult to understand the superannuation industry's suggestion, coming as it does from an industry that so frequently made bad investment decisions about the property market and about other matters during the frenetic period of the 1980s, that it would be irresponsible of it to invest one per cent of its members' funds in such projects,. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think there is no doubt that a small, but not insubstantial, investment in the development of commercialisation of research and development ought to be in the investment profiles of any substantial fund. But that is a matter which I think the Government still has to address, either voluntarily or through means that involve legislation, to see that funds do manage their investments, not only in the short term with regard to their obligations to their members to increase the return to those members, but also to the long term benefit of this country, so that the jobs that eventually fund the superannuation schemes can be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also draw the attention of members of the House to an alternative mechanism that might be available for funding the commercialisation of research and development. The mechanism, called tax exempt special savings accounts, was developed in Great Britain. The tax exempt special savings accounts were introduced by John Major, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, as a mechanism for increasing domestic savings in the United Kingdom. With relatively small amendment, it could be made an appropriate vehicle for requiring or allowing investment in research and development. </PARA>
<PARA>  I can explain the scheme briefly. What happens in the United Kingdom is that investors are permitted to place up to #9,000 over a five-year period into accounts which carry interest. Provided they maintain those accounts for five years, they are permitted to take the profits without paying tax on those earnings. That is, of course, enormously popular because one of the effects of the tax system in our country and the United Kingdom is that there is no inflationary component to compensate for capital gains on interest. Bank interest is, therefore, one of the least well-treated forms of earnings. So there was a very large surge of investment into these accounts. </PARA>
<PARA>  It would be a relatively minor adjustment to the scheme to require the investment holders of tax exempt special savings accounts to invest a fixed proportion of such funds, perhaps 40 or 50 per cent, into earmarked investments which would have TESSA approval and which would be related to the commercialisation of research and development. I commend these ideas to the Government for further investigation. I believe that we need to work strongly to increase our infrastructure expenditure in this country and to look towards long term strategies designed to improve our industrial capacity and not simply rely on the market.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --I wish to address the House today on the siting of the information processing centre of the Australian Securities Commission, as raised by the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Riggall) during the adjournment debate last night. Leaving aside the gratuitous insults added by the honourable member, the issue is indeed a difficult one for all of the parties concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In becoming involved in the issue of the location of the IPC, I have sought a limited goal based on a concern I had with a matter of public administration. Specifically, I simply sought to have assessed an alternative adjacent site in the city of Sale which only relatively recently became available on the basis of its prospects for providing a better commercial return for the Commonwealth. The twin office block facilities site was made available as a result of the decision by Esso to relocate its main administrative functions to Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>  In bringing this prospective alternative site to the attention of the ASC and others, I have not sought to overturn a tendering process which had been legally concluded and wound up. The fact of the matter is that there was still some brief time to look again at the figures and the costings applying to the alternative adjacent sites in Traralgon and Sale before the relevant agreements were finalised and commitments entered into. Nor did I seek to prejudge or influence the outcome of an evaluation of the alternative site. It is a matter of record that I have always stood happily to accept the umpire's decision in this matter, based, as I think it should be, on commercial considerations alone. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will not labour the detailed history of the process which resulted in the proposal to site the ASC's data processing centre at Traralgon. As a result of a national tender carried out by the Commonwealth, the State of Victoria won the right in late 1989 to establish the IPC. Presumably, this right was conferred on the State because it was able to provide the best commercial proposition for the Commonwealth. The Victorian State Government then proceeded to make arrangements to develop the IPC site in the city of Traralgon. The proposed greenfield development was to incorporate an assistance package in the order of $4m to be transferred from the State Government to the ASC to maintain the terms in which the Victorian Government had won the initial tender. </PARA>
<PARA>  As best I know, no formal legal or commercial agreements have, as yet, been entered into with developers. Again, so far as I understand, no binding agreements have been entered into between the State Government and the ASC regarding the legal obligations of the parties regarding the planned transfer of the funds which constitute the assistance package. Admittedly, however, the ASC had identified a preferred tender for a site and was well advanced in its thinking about the establishment of the IPC. It must also then be admitted that the prospective alternative site offered by the Esso facilities has entered into calculations late in proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>  I fully recognise this has caused disruption to administrative processes dealing with the establishment of the data processing centre. It is a matter of unavoidable regret that the timing of developments on all fronts could not have been more fortuitous than it has been. But in respect of the integrity of the commercial processes which should guide the development of the processing centre, this is hardly a cause for failing to give due consideration to the cost and benefit offered by the Esso Sale site. </PARA>
<PARA>  Again I emphasise that this is all I have sought in this matter--due consideration alone of the commercial advantages of a nearby site. In seeking to set this process in motion, I was acting on data compiled by parties which demonstrated, on the basis of various assumptions, that the alternative site in Sale would accrue savings to the ASC in the order of $50m on the basis of a 25-year lease option and, I stress, a 25-year period. Given the scope of these claimed savings, it was obvious that they had to be tested against the facts of the case. </PARA>
<PARA>  Indeed, I think it would have been a source of considerable community concern if the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) had failed to investigate practical opportunities for savings of taxpayers' moneys on this scale. Such a test, however, could come about only if the ASC showed a willingness, at the very least, to visit the Esso site in Sale and conduct a close analysis of the commercial opportunities it provided. It behoves a public body to be seen to be entirely unrelenting in its efforts to ensure taxpayers' resources are used efficiently and with an eye to the best return on outlays. Moreover, it falls as a particularly heavy responsibility on the shoulders of such a body as the ASC which must be seen to be scrupulously transparent and open in dealings of this nature. As I said, I have sought to have the claimed projected savings offered by the Esso site closely costed by the ASC in the context of its own proposed development package for Traralgon and on the basis of whether the facilities suited its needs. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have always been aware that other cost issues are associated with the possibility of reconsideration of the Sale site. Amongst these must be a realistic assessment of the impact of the labour force employed to work within the data processing centre; the cost of refurbishing the Esso office blocks to meet the ASC's specifications; and the actual terms of the lease cycle to which the ASC wished to be committed. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was, however, a matter of considerable concern to me that in order to prompt such a course on the part of the ASC I found it necessary to raise the matters publicly. It is a matter of record that the ASC had rejected invitations by the city of Sale and others to visit the Esso facilities and conduct an audit of its commercial advantages on the basis of a reviewed lease package. </PARA>
<PARA>  Approaches by local business and community bodies, as well as by the city of Sale and groups such as the Sale development group, were unable to attract the interest of the ASC. To these approaches the Chairman of the ASC, Mr Tony Hartnell, claimed that the issue was virtually beyond renegotiation. Regardless of this, he also claimed he was not free to act unilaterally but needed the consent of the Victorian State Government to investigate the commercial prospects of an alternative site. Events seem to have proven otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the last two weeks the ASC has finally taken on its responsibility to at least scrutinise the Esso facilities and evaluate the commercial advantages of the available lease options. I am not familiar with the details of the costings involved in these respects. Indeed, I have no interest in investigating them in any personal or direct way. It has been my role to act as a broker between the parties to ensure that they have all had the opportunity to meet finally and conduct a complete inquiry into the relevant matters. As to the outcomes, that is a market based issue in which I wish to have no role. </PARA>
<PARA>  Again, in the relocation of the IPC to Sale I realise there are possibly external costs involved beyond the terms of the lease--the costs of refurbishment and so forth. However, I trust the ASC will provide Esso and those acting on its behalf with the opportunity to address these extra potential costs in constructing their options for a lease package. Presumably this process is already in action. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also add that I am concerned with the Victorian State Government's assistance package in respect of the development of the IPC site. The ASC has claimed that it would be forced to reimburse the Victorian State Government to the value of the assistance package if it should choose to relocate to a nearby, more commercially advantageous site. I am anxious to ensure that the assistance package is based on commercial principles and seeks the best return for public outlays. This concern is consistent with my position on the necessity to at least review the commercial viability of the Esso office site.</PARA>
<PARA>  Accordingly, I find it difficult to accept that the assistance package is targeted to a site specific location and cannot be transferred to a viable, more commercially advantageous adjacent site, should one become available. In this regard I find to be of further concern claims by the ASC that, should commercial determinations require it to elect for the Sale site, it would be required to repay the State Government to the full value of the assistance package. In effect, such a policy position suggests that commercial outcomes and net savings concerns are not relevant factors to concluding developments in which public resources are involved. To be frank, I consider this to be a questionable administrative practice, one which ought to be of concern to the community. In this regard, I also feel that the integrity of the ASC could be impugned if the arrangements it has entered into with the State Government are not seen to be commercially driven and transparent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Notwithstanding this, I am delighted that the ASC has conceded, after some modest pressure, that it does carry an obligation to the public to investigate the commercial viability of the Sale site. I only hope it sees through the entire process in a thorough and comprehensive manner. I trust that the ASC will demonstrate the same commitment to exhaustive and searching procedures which characterise its statutory duties. The matter should not be left under any sort of cloud. </PARA>
<PARA>  If there are costs associated with external matters upon which the decision on the location case of the IPC will turn, I hope these will be made public. I hope they are carefully accounted for and presented to those who are charged with presenting the Sale lease package for consideration. If, when all courses of practical action have been pursued, there is no considerable net gain in the transfer of the data centre to Sale, the matter should be put to rest--the ASC will have been seen to have done its duty and public confidence in the Commission's commitment to the public interest will be satisfied. So, if in some quarters there is a bit of high drama in these matters, it is because the ASC is just catching up on its responsibilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I joined the Australian Labor Party because I saw it as the only party which stood for social justice and equity, because it was the only party with vision. I am proud to say that this year's Budget will, in time, be recognised for its visionary outlook. The changes concerning superannuation and the building better cities program will be seen as great achievements of this Labor Government. The impact of these decisions will not be immediate, but will be realised in years to come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I wish to concentrate my remarks on the building better cities program. As is customary, the Opposition has done nothing but deride and totally oppose the whole concept behind the better cities proposals. This should not come as a surprise to anyone, as the Opposition is totally bereft of vision and is purely reactionary. </PARA>
<PARA>  A close look at the history books will reveal that the Labor Party, at Federal and State levels, has been the party which has had the courage to make visionary decisions. The Snowy Mountains River scheme, World Heritage listing of the Franklin River and Kakadu National Park, Medicare, the provision of legal aid, the Opera House, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, greater access to higher education and the better incomes and retirement policy are but some of Labor's initiatives. They are now recognised as great achievements yet were, and in some instances still are, bitterly opposed by our conservative opponents. </PARA>
<PARA>  The vehement opposition expressed by the coalition only reinforces my belief in the greatness of the building better cities program, which combines the twin Labor objectives of social justice and vision. It aims at improving the quality of life of urban and suburban Australians by improving their surrounding environment. The fact is that the majority of the population spends most of its time--both work and leisure--in the cities and suburbs. By improving our cities we will, in fact, be improving the living and working conditions of the majority of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  Well might we ask ourselves why the coalition is opposed to this basic concept. The answer is simple. Studies have shown that residents in the western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne suffer from a lack of services and opportunities. The coalition does not want money spent on the people of western Sydney and Melbourne because it wants to continue extending privileges and benefits to its friends on the north shore and in eastern suburbs. </PARA>
<PARA>  The better cities program recognises the disadvantages faced by people living in the western suburbs. It is an attempt to improve the infrastructure of our cities and to promote a greater quality of life and increased opportunities for millions of Australians. The benefits will be many and varied. The Australian dream of the quarter acre block has led to an ever expanding urban sprawl and all the problems associated with it. Often, there is a lack of essential services and opportunities for people on the suburban fringe. Housing costs have soared, making home ownership difficult, while people have to travel long distances to their place of work. </PARA>
<PARA>  The problem of transport is a real one for the people of the western suburbs. Hours are spent each day commuting to and from work on overcrowded trains and roads. As a result, pollution levels are dangerously high. It is no coincidence that the incidence of asthma is greatest in western Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA>  By identifying the problems of our cities and targeting resources to overcoming these problems, we will be ensuring that the disadvantages associated with geography are overcome. The commitment of this Government to provide money for the University of Western Sydney is but one example of addressing the needs faced by the people in western Sydney. The building better cities program will link all levels of government to provide a coordinated approach to build on and improve the existing infrastructure of our cities. In time, it will redress the inequalities which currently exist by providing millions of Australians with opportunities previously denied. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am proud to be part of a government that is committed to social justice and vision. The building better cities program will be recognised as a great statement and the snake oil</PARA>
<PARA>salesmen in the coalition will be exposed for the frauds and charlatans that they are. </PARA>

There has been considerable speculation, perhaps understandably, that good things come to those who wait. Apparently Peter Hartcher, the Sydney Morning Herald Canberra bureau chief, just cannot wait. In his piece in today's Herald he is guilty not so much of speculation, but of pure conjecture. More, it is absolute fantasy; it is a fairytale; it is blatant and comprehensive rubbish. Not a single source is given by Mr Hartcher for his story. Indeed, there cannot be any source because none of those named by Mr Hartcher as being the inner Cabinet were contacted by him.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I think it is entirely appropriate that I raise a matter of deep concern to me when the Minister for Local Government (Ms Fatin) is at the table. One of the biggest problems in Australia today is the big drift of people from regional and country areas to the cities. The social ramifications for the towns in decline are horrific. Many of these smaller towns are becoming ghost towns. I am delighted that my representation to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on this matter seems to have borne fruit. I advocated that at the Special Premiers Conference all the State Premiers, the Prime Minister and local government should have some input into seeing how we can redress this obvious dilemma. I think it is imperative to look at things such as zone allowances, tax allowances and a number of other things that we can do to redress this obvious problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There is a real problem for local councils and governments at a time when we have high unemployment, which everybody here acknowledges. Such unemployment is very tragic indeed.

The responsibility that has been placed on the press--and I might say that 99.9 per cent of the time it accepts that responsibility--is to report the truth and not report fiction. I think it is a serious reflection on the whole Press Gallery to see in today's Sydney Morning Herald comments attributed to that paper's Bureau Chief with regard to the GST and the so-called deals done between the leadership team.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I am extremely disappointed to have to raise this matter. I have a great deal of respect for the Press Gallery. But I really think Mr Hartcher has overstepped any bounds of reasonableness. The other day he gave us the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), as the next leader. But that Minister is still trying to find out where the shoelaces are on elastic-sided boots, so he is hardly likely to be the next Prime Minister.   Mr Hartcher should accept his responsibility as Bureau Chief. He should not report the tripe that was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald today.

But today I want to draw the attention of this House to the deplorable headline `Resurrect the death penalty' which appeared in last week's Mornington Leader.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Mornington is a bayside suburb in Victoria in the electorate of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). It is near where my parents live and I thank them for drawing this to my attention. Apparently, some crazy right wing fascist group on the peninsula has called for the return of the death penalty and will be holding a public meeting on 11 September in an attempt to gain support for its stance. One wonders whether one would have to bring one's own hooded bed sheets to be allowed into the meeting!</PARA>
<PARA>  None of this would or should be taken seriously if it were not for a State Liberal MP, Robin Cooper, who has not only backed the group but also called for the return of the lash. What sort of society do we live in when we have supposedly responsible elected members of parliament making such ludicrous, outlandish statements without any reference at all to the underlying reasons for crime and appropriate, realistic programs for crime prevention?</PARA>
<PARA>  It is also interesting to note that the group supported by Mr Cooper is considering running candidates at the next election against MPs who do not support its stand. I wonder whether this type of knee-jerk nonsense has the approval of the shadow Treasurer. If hanging and the lash are to become Liberal Party policy in Victoria, I am sure we will see more and more Victorians moving to the more progressive and enlightened State of Queensland.</PARA>

<PARA>  At the weekend, I had the pleasure of attending the opening of a new hotel in my electorate--the new Kooralbyn Resort Hotel, which is situated in a rural area some distance south of a country town called Beaudesert. The Kooralbyn resort itself has existed for over 10 years. It is a characteristically Australian resort where one can enjoy such pleasures as billy tea and damper and all sorts of outdoor sports. </PARA>
<PARA>  Approximately four years ago this resort was bought by Japanese financial interests, which led to the predictable outcry about Japanese investment in Australia, particularly in respect of such a uniquely Australian hotel and resort. I am pleased to say that the Japanese investors in this case have done an absolutely superb job with this new hotel. They have built a beautiful hotel in the bush which is environmentally friendly. They have pioneered a method of manufacturing pressed earth aggregate which uses clay from the area, so the resultant three-level hotel is not sticking out like a sore thumb, as one would expect. In fact, it blends in beautifully with the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Japanese investment has established a multi- million dollar asset in the area which is totally accepted by the locals. Those investors have shown themselves to be very good local citizens in their support of endeavours in the Beaudesert region and, indeed, in their support of the general Gold Coast tourism effort.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for Grey for what is a very important question. I remind him that yesterday the Treasurer quite properly pointed out to this House that the processes that were followed were the totally normal and appropriate processes when the Board of the Reserve Bank is to consider the issue of monetary policy. The Reserve Bank Board held its normal monthly meeting and considered the evidence and analysis before it. On the basis of its consideration, there was a unanimous decision, with the agreement of the Government. The Board decided to reduce the official rates by one per cent. As was pointed out also by my colleague the Treasurer, the Governor of the Reserve Bank--the Bank is under specific statute--made a speech which made the Reserve Bank's view very clear. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There is no great science in determining the magnitude of reductions, but the Bank believes that the one percentage point cut is consistent with maintaining the downward momentum of inflation and does not risk re-igniting demand pressures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. As I came into the House today there was a bit of a debate about taxation and then some more chiacking about the honourable member for Blaxland. Let us see what was achieved with tax by this Government and why some of the attacks about what the honourable member for Blaxland said some time ago were nonsense when we have changed things completely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  When we came into government we inherited a taxation system that was in disrepair and disrepute. The top personal rate is now 47 per cent; in 1983 it was 60 per cent. The bottom rate is now 21 per cent; in 1983 it was 30 per cent. The company tax rate is now 39 per cent; in 1983 it was 46 per cent. The effective rate of company taxation in 1983 was an astonishing 78.4 per cent. We have reformed the taxation system in this country. Of course, the Opposition opposed every bit of reform, including capital gains, fringe benefits and entertainment expenses. It did nothing for business. The introduction of dividend imputation means that the effective rate of company tax has reduced. The bias against equity investment has been corrected.</PARA>

The fact is that the overwhelming evidence from overseas is that a consumption tax would have no impact on the level of national savings. That is what the evidence shows quite clearly. Indeed, in many countries the level of national savings has fallen. Interestingly enough, the Leader of the Opposition conceded this fact when he was talking about it--not this year, but in 1990. This is what he had to say in an interview.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>. . . even if you did have a 15 per cent across-the- board consumption tax with all those political advantages it may only make a marginal effect on savings.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said in 1990. That is a different story from what he tells now. This is what he had to say on 25 July this year. He was asked to sum up the essential rationale for a consumption tax. The interviewer said to the Leader of the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA>You've got three sentences, no more: explain what a consumption tax is.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition, the man who had said in 1990 that it would have no impact on savings, responded:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, a consumption tax is a broad-based tax on expenditure. The principal purpose in a country like Australia, which spends too much and imports too much, if you like, is to change people's expenditure and savings patterns, to encourage people to spend less and to save more and to use the tax system as an essential element of that.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, when asked in July this year what was the essential rationale for a consumption tax, the whole rationale given was that it would increase savings. The evidence is that it will not. The contradictions between what the Leader of the Opposition said in 1990 and in 1991 are absolutely breathtaking. As we on this side of the House have been saying, it is about time the Opposition really came clean on what it has in mind in regard to the consumption tax and what is its hidden agenda.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I thank him for his concise and indeed revealing answer to my question yesterday. I ask a follow-up question on behalf of a constituent of mine. His name is Ray and he is a mango farmer. Farm incomes are down and his projected taxable income for this year is about $13,000. I ask: what would be the effect of a broad-based consumption tax for Ray? What initiatives has the Government taken to address the problem of low incomes for farm families?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="775" SPEAKER="Crean The Hon S.F." NAMEID="DT4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HOTHAM" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I met Ray when I visited that area with the honourable member for Kennedy last week to talk about the future of the horticultural industry because the honourable member for Groom suggested doing so. The mango producers up there are a great success story. But let me come to the question. Yesterday when I answered the question about the impact of the goods and services tax on farm families I indicated that, apart from the detail that the Opposition had not come up with, the reality and the reason why the Government opposed a goods and services tax was that it was both inflationary and regressive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Yesterday I said it was regressive, particularly for low income families, only in the knowledge that the Opposition was proposing a goods and services tax across-the-board. I find out today, from reading the Sydney Morning Herald, that not only does the proposal contemplate the level of that tax being 22 per cent but also it contemplates not just a goods and services tax but a flat tax rate as well.</PARA>
<PARA>  A goods and services tax itself is regressive because it imposes the same level of tax on everyone according to expenditure, not income. But a flat rate tax is even more regressive because it also taxes people at the same rate regardless of the level of income. So what we have is the great double that is really going to sink into further depression those people on farms who have very low incomes at the moment. The reason it is regressive is that people on low incomes consume everything that they earn.</PARA>
<PARA>  Let us take the example of a person on $13,000 a year. If we have a 22 per cent goods and services tax and a 30 per cent flat rate tax, do Opposition members know what happens to Ray the mango farmer on $13,000 a year? He becomes $4,000 worse off as a result of their initiative. Do they know how many people earn the same level of income expected this year as Ray? Half the farm families in this country--33,000! The Opposition's measures are going to slug them with even more taxation. I will go further on the point, because the Treasurer alluded to this and it shows the unfairness of the situation. It is no wonder that the National Party is having second thoughts about what this great consumption tax package means. Do Opposition members know what people on an income of $100,000 get out of the package? They get $9,000 plus. For a person on $13,000, it is minus $4,000; at average weekly earnings, it is something like minus $3,000; and the $100,000 league gains substantially. What sort of a compensation package is that?</PARA>
<PARA>  In any event, even if they do not accept that argument--and I would ask them to go away and at least do some sensible figuring rather than the stuff they have churned out in the last couple of weeks--how is their compensation package going to accommodate those people who are on negative incomes or not paying any tax at all? I ask the Leader of the National Party: how does he propose to do that? I ask him to come forward with his proposal because the fact of the matter is that 40 per cent of broad acre farmers in this country will not pay tax next year. Where is their compensation package? They will put an impost of 15 per cent more on them.</PARA>
<PARA>  As to that part of the honourable member's question which asks what this Government has done in relation to the circumstance of this particular example, I said yesterday that under our proposal and under the March economic statement all direct inputs which are taxed through the wholesale sales tax will have an exemption on that component for people on the farm. All direct inputs will be exempt, including any freight component that attracts that tax. So do not give us this rubbish that no input relief has been given.

In addition, because of the plight of the farm sector we have given specific income relief through RAS, through extending the family allowance supplement, through specific sectoral initiatives for the wool and wheat industries in particular and, in the case of the mango growers, through the innovative agricultural marketing program. That is a scheme which has resulted in that industry being able to get off its feet through a grant that this Government has made and export to the tune of a significant amount of dollars for this country and their incomes.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>

The growers expect to export $2 1/2m of fresh mangoes this year, rising to over $5m in later years. The honourable member for Groom ought to get the detail of this and himself go back and talk to the horticulturalists, as I have done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Finally, the Government has provided a $4.3m package of assistance for regional and economic development in this country.

Exemptions will be extended to all goods used by goods producers, mainly in pre-production, production-related and post-production activities.

The fact of the matter is that that particular proposition is in the ether. What would be the impact of a 22 per cent tax? A telephone connection fee would increase by $55.66. The maximum connection fee for rural and remote area customers would be taxed at an increased rate which would produce a change of $330.22. Business loan rentals under that set of taxation arrangements would increase by $64.23. Residential line rentals would increase by $34.21; and local calls, if prices remained at the current level, would be taxed at 5.3c for every local call.

He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I am also impressed to see that you do keep in touch with other parts of the electorate, and having two soup kitchens is a very nice touch.</PARA>
<PARA>The rest of his speech to this particular gathering endorsed programs that had been implemented by successive governments in New Zealand, referring also to their economic consequences.</PARA>
<PARA>  The other people in the electorate who will be able to approach soup kitchens will be people such as pensioners and the poor. Because we have a very high penetration rate of telephone services, they will have an opportunity to pay for their visits to the soup kitchens. Under the Opposition, they will be able to pay for those through the taxation arrangements, if soup kitchens are publicly provided. They will be paying an extra 5.3c for every telephone call; and I think that an extra 5.3c on their calls will pay for a large number of new soup kitchens.</PARA>
<PARA>  What a tragedy the view of the Leader of the Opposition is; it comes from somebody who approaches politics on the basis: `I flash in and I flash out. I make a pile; I come into politics. I turn the place upside-down; I disappear. I am not committed'. There are people in this place who are committed to a lifetime in politics; there are people in this place who are committed to a lifetime of public service. When one is committed to a lifetime of public service, one can adopt no other position. If there is any decency in those opposite, they will maintain their compassion for those in this country least able to protect themselves.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Let us just get to the core of this issue on tax. It is quite obvious that the Opposition is not opposed to putting a tax on goods. It intends to put a tax on goods and services--on all goods and all services. That means the price of bread and milk and eggs goes up; the price of a Mercedes comes down. That is what it is all about. The wholesale sales tax currently in place is also on goods, but at the wholesale level, not the retail level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  So what are the differences? We tax some goods including luxury goods, and exempt necessities. The Opposition would put a 15 or 22 per cent tax on all goods and services, and the 70 per cent of goods on supermarket shelves not now taxed would be taxed for the first time. A 20 per cent wholesale sales tax is less than a 15 per cent retail sales tax in most cases. It depends on the retail margin.</PARA>
<PARA>  So go out there, Opposition, tell the people that luxuries are going to be taxed at a lower rate and that all goods and services are going to be taxed for the first time; tell the people how they will love it. While it is at it, the Opposition can convince the people that the moment this is in place it is not going to be put up, such as has occurred in every other country that has one. The Opposition can explain what this will do for inflation in this country and explain how people on pensions and the lower paid are going to be compensated. Answer Eric Risstrom. How is the Opposition going to compensate a person on $23,000 a year, when to compensate him it will have to give a 64 per cent cut in tax. Go out there and tell them--tell them the Opposition is going to take the tax off luxuries and it is going to tax the necessities.</PARA>

They were made by an ILO committee of experts on the application of conventions and recommendations.

<PARA>  In May this year the committee made what is known as a direct request to the Australian Government in which it found that the existing state of Australian industrial law, including the common law, section 45D of the Trade Practices Act and the New South Wales Essential Services Act, was incompatible with the freedom of association standards set out in ILO conventions and called on the governments of Australia and New South Wales to bring the law into conformity.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Government is concerned by those findings. It puts us in breach of our international obligations, which we accepted when we ratified those conventions. If we do not amend our law we will be subject to a report to an ILO conference pointing out Australia's non-conformity with its obligations; that is, we will be internationally exposed and criticised for not adhering to our obligations under international law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The questioner also asked me about a Government response. The Government is intending to respond to this situation. That response is being developed by the Minister for Industrial Relations and will be considered by the Government later this year. Another part of the Government's response is absolute horror at the reaction of the Liberal Party spokesman in relation to these findings. In New South Wales the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Fay, said he could not accept the ILO's strong criticism of the State legislation. He said that ILO conventions were designed mainly for Third World countries and had little relevance to Australia. In regard to these comments, let me say that ratification of ILO conventions is undertaken only after all the States agree, and New South Wales agreed to ratification of the relevant conventions at the time of the Askin Government in 1971.</PARA>
<PARA>  As for their being of little relevance to Australia and mainly for Third World countries, let me say that it is mighty relevant to us if we ratify conventions but then do not adhere and so are in breach of our international obligations. The conventions are not just for Third World countries. All major developed countries are members of the ILO, which is an agency of the United Nations, and most developing countries are also members. Over 100 countries have ratified these conventions.</PARA>
<PARA>  The third point I would make about Mr Fay's comments is that when the Greiner Government was putting its legislation before the New South Wales Parliament I, as the then Minister for Industrial Relations, in May 1988 wrote to Mr Greiner, pointed out that this legislation may well put us in breach of ILO conventions and asked him not to go ahead and put us in such breach. He wrote back saying New South Wales did not accept that it would be in breach, and went ahead with the legislation. Now he has been found to be in breach, his Minister says, `Well, who cares about the ILO; it does not matter'. What an incredible reaction.</PARA>
<PARA>  Worse than that is the reaction of the Opposition spokesman on industrial relations in this House. His remarks are just about beyond belief. In the Melbourne Herald-Sun on Tuesday of this week, he is quoted as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>  A coalition Government could cut ties with the International Labour Organisation because of the body's `foolish observations' of Australia, the Opposition industrial relations spokesman, Mr Howard said yesterday. Mr Howard told the Herald-Sun the Opposition was not interested in gratuitous advice from the organisation, a UN agency. `I am disassociating the Opposition from the ILO. In Government, we would examine our association with the ILO'.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>`It does not understand the Australian scene'.</PARA>
<PARA>  Opposition members--Hear, hear!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I note with great interest all the idiotic `Hear, hears' from the other side. Let me say that those remarks by the Opposition spokesman and all those `Hear, hears' that we just had reflect exceedingly badly on the Opposition, and on the Opposition spokesman in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Australia is a foundation member of the ILO and it has hitherto had the across-the- board support of governments and oppositions throughout the period that we have been members--since 1927. However, now Australia has been found to be in breach of its obligations under international law, the Opposition members are effectively saying, `Who cares', and making insulting remarks about that body. Yet in other circumstances, of course, they like to parade themselves as bastions of supporters of the law. So it is an interesting dichotomy of approach.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister for Industrial Relations has made a detailed response to the honourable member for Bennelong's comments, and I am not going to go through the detail of all of that except to note that withdrawing from the ILO--which he says the Opposition is contemplating--would not avoid our obligations under the conventions. They would have to be denounced, and the opportunity to do that comes up every 10 years. The next opportunity is in the year 2000. So we would have to wait until 2000 or 2001 before we could do it. We would continue in complete breach of our obligations in that time--assuming, of course, that the Opposition is in a position to do anything about it, which it will not be.</PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, I am quite shocked that the Opposition spokesman should be so dismissive of the ILO. He has previously shown a great interest in it. He has been to its last two international conferences in Geneva, and I assume that, now he has such contempt for the organisation, he will not be going any more. He has a unique opportunity this afternoon to explain first hand to the ILO in what contempt the Opposition holds it, because the Director-General of the ILO, its chief executive officer, is in Australia. In fact, he is in Canberra and he is up in the gallery at the present time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I know that the honourable gentleman is among those who have taken a special interest in this issue. I particularly commend him for his efforts, along with others, to establish in this place a bipartisan parliamentarians group to address these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Australia was among the first countries to acknowledge that the democratic wishes of the people of Slovenia and Croatia for independence must be respected. The principal challenge now is to ensure that the future of Yugoslavia's constituent republics can evolve peacefully and with proper acknowledgment of the rights and the interests of minorities in those areas. Against this background, we strongly condemn the use of force between Serbians and Croatians in Croatia, and in particular the unwarranted actions of the Yugoslav army against Croatia.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Ambassador in Belgrade has put our views directly to the Government in Belgrade. We are especially concerned that recent Yugoslav army action seems directed not just at control of Serbian majority areas in Croatia, but it seems to be directed at strategic objectives throughout the republic. We have supported, and we will continue to support wholeheartedly, the efforts of the European Community and the CSCE to mediate a cease-fire and a settlement. We will be deeply disappointed if the breaches of the cease-fire overnight, to which the honourable gentleman referred in his question, prevent the convening of the peace conference scheduled for the weekend.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am glad to say and to convey to the honourable gentleman that the latest information we have suggests that the conference will go ahead. We certainly hope that is the case, and we wish it well. We have been consulting closely with those who are defying and obstructing the European endeavours to understand that behind the Europeans stands the world community.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is obviously too early yet to say that the efforts of the Europeans will not succeed, but it is not too early to make it clear that should the European effort not succeed, Australia would not be prepared to let it rest there, to stand back and let the tragic conflict continue. In those circumstances, we would want to see the matter taken up by the United Nations. I am sure that many other countries would agree with us in that situation.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am glad to see that the Europeans have already taken steps to keep the Security Council informed of the situation. I know the honourable gentleman will be pleased to hear that the Australian Ambassador at the United Nations in New York has been instructed to liaise actively with other missions there on this issue. At this stage we are not proposing any specific United Nations action, and we do not overlook the difficulties that this specific situation presents to the United Nations, a fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, made clear in the Senate this morning.</PARA>
<PARA>  Obviously, the question of recognition of Croatia and Slovenia is very much on our minds. In addressing it we have had to give close consideration to the internationally recognised criteria which must be applied and which I have previously spelled out in this place. We must also consider the effect that recognition would have on the situation in Yugoslavia itself and on the European efforts to find a settlement. I have said that, when the circumstances permit, we will be among the first to recognise Croatia and Slovenia, and I am glad to repeat that undertaking in this place.</PARA>
<PARA>  I know that this is an issue of great concern to the communities in Australia, a fact which is very much in the mind of the honourable gentleman who asked me this question, and very much in the minds of many honourable members. I can say to the honourable gentleman, as I think he knows, that I have spoken to representatives of those communities over recent months on a reasonably regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA>  I hope that I would have the support of all honourable members of this place when I say that our Yugoslav communities, representing all the diversities of Yugoslavia itself, have shown, I believe, marvellous restraint in these very difficult times. I say to them directly that we sympathise with the anxiety they feel and we applaud the responsibility they have shown. I am sure that I speak for all honourable members when I say that we are proud of them all, and we urge them to maintain their restraint in what I fear may be even more difficult days ahead.</PARA>
<PARA>  I finish my answer to the honourable gentleman and to the House by informing the House that today the Government has agreed to contribute $100,000 in response to a special Red Cross appeal for emergency relief for those afflicted by the fighting in Yugoslavia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am aware that after the Budget the Opposition has been calling for a tighter fiscal policy. That call was repeated yesterday in a press release issued by the Leader of the Opposition, to which the Prime Minister referred earlier in Question Time today. That deplorable press release, which attacks the Governor of the Reserve Bank in an unprecedented way, also has another aspect to it which is extraordinary, and that is that essentially it says that there should not have been an easing of monetary policy; there should not have been a cut in interest rates announced by the Reserve Bank or by the Treasurer on Tuesday. They are the two clear messages: those opposite do not like the Governor of the Reserve Bank; and interest rates should not have been cut.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I found it a rather amazing revelation that the Opposition was really saying somewhat obliquely in this press release that it was against any cut in interest rates. The heading of the press release talks about the Budget strategy and forecast, but the message that is right through this press release is that it was most inappropriate for interest rates to have been cut without a change in other aspects of macro-economic policy, in particular, fiscal policy.</PARA>
<PARA>  The whole thrust of what the Leader of the Opposition was saying yesterday was that we must change other arms of policy, particularly fiscal policy, if we are going to have any reduction in interest rates. So the starting point for consideration of the Opposition's policy is that, with the current stance of fiscal policy, it is absolutely against any reduction in interest rates. All businesses and all home buyers in Australia should understand that given the current settings of macro-economic policy in the Budget, the Opposition says that there should not have been a cut in interest rates. That is absolutely what it says. It also says----</PARA>

In relation to fiscal policy, those opposite are saying that we can only have a cut in interest rates if we do not have an easing in fiscal policy. In other words, they are saying there has been an easing in fiscal policy. In the context of this Budget there was no net new expenditure, so there was no easing on that front. The only discretionary easing was the tax cuts, which, as we have already seen from their previous press statements, they say we should not have had. But how much further would they go in saying that we should not have an easing of fiscal policy?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If the movement from the $8 billion surplus that we budgeted for last year to the $4.7 billion deficit this year is regarded as the easing of policy, would they go right back to the $8 billion? Is that what they are saying? Are they saying that the easing of fiscal policy is all of that amount, and that we should have had a $13 billion turnaround in the outcome by massive cuts in government expenditure and increases in taxes? Is that what is being said? Or would they only go back to the $2 billion that was the outcome for last year?

In the last 20 years there has been one year in which we have had an inflation rate below the level of our major trading partners.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Today, immediately following Question Time in the Senate, Western Australian senator Senator Crichton- Browne made some remarks which made reference to me and to an alleged incident with Mr Ken Colbung, Chairperson of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. If left uncorrected, the remarks could leave an impression which is totally false and misleading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Firstly, it was suggested by Senator Crichton-Browne that I had been asked to open the open day at the Institute held yesterday and that I had accepted and then declined. This is false and no such invitation was ever extended to me. </PARA>
<PARA>  On Friday last, an invitation was faxed to my ministerial office inviting myself and my staff to join the open day `for some stage during the day'. This fax was subsequently confirmed by the hard copy which arrived on Monday this week. I was not able to attend the open day, owing to the late notice and the fact that I had already explicitly obtained leave from the Parliament to open the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Centre at the ACT College of TAFE and had accepted this engagement some weeks ago. I did ask two of my staff members to represent me at the Institute open day and they did so. </PARA>
<PARA>  During the course of Tuesday afternoon of this week a message was left in my office that the Chairperson of the Institute council, Mr Colbung, wished to see me. At my express request, my staff contacted Mr Colbung to invite him to Parliament House to meet me as requested at the first available opportunity that night. At no time--I repeat, at no time--was Mr Colbung asked to leave my office by either myself or my staff, and any suggestion to the contrary by Senator Crichton-Browne is absolutely without foundation. </PARA>

<PARA>  Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In November 1989, as Minister for Social Security, I made my first major statement to the Parliament on the Government's disability reform agenda. Today's statement reports on the Government's achievements since that time and brings into focus Labor's vision for the ongoing reform of disability services, and the crucial role the strategy occupies in the broader struggle for fairness, for expanded opportunities, and for better communities for all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Labor vision of a socially just society is one where all Australians can share equitably in the distribution of resources, especially employment opportunities. In a society that revolves around the activities of production and consumption, those who are denied participation in the work force are fundamentally marginalised. It is the Government's belief that, by enabling people with disabilities to participate fully in society, benefits accrue not only to the individual and his or her family, but also to employers, the economy, and ultimately society as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>  The package of new labour market and income support arrangements, known as the disability reform package and introduced in the 1990 Budget, is one demonstration of the Government's response to implementing practical measures for full and active integration of people with disabilities into the labour market. The package is built on earlier Government initiatives in the provision of support for people with disabilities; it involves an active system of payment and support for people with disabilities, and links new disability support pension recipients with appropriate vocational training, rehabilitation and employment placement services. The disability reform package will bring into sharper focus the special needs of clients with disabilities and is an outstanding illustration of the Government's broad approach to reform. </PARA>
<PARA>  Building on the foundation of the disability reform package, the Government is now turning its attention to tackling the next stage of the reform process--overcoming the barriers that exist in the workplace for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  To achieve workplace reform, however, will require fundamental changes in attitudes and practices. The Government is undertaking a number of key initiatives in order to facilitate this change. The development of a new wages system specifically designed to open up employment opportunities for people with more severe disabilities is one example. This system will provide an effective system of measurement of the skills of workers with disabilities and will have important implications for extending employment opportunities for a group of people in the community who are currently unable to obtain employment because of their severe level of disability. </PARA>
<PARA>  Attitudinal changes in employers, the general community, and indeed people with disabilities themselves, have also been identified as essential to ensure the successful integration of people with disabilities into the open labour market; an exciting workplace initiative to address this need for attitudinal change involves raising the level of awareness of employers and workers about the capacities, and largely untapped potential, of people with disabilities through a broad based communication strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>  As identified by Ms Chris Ronalds, in her discussion paper, National Employment Initiatives for People with Disabilities, access to employment and other opportunities by people with disabilities should be regarded as a fundamental right with the full support of the law. The introduction of national, comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation for people with disabilities would secure them the same rights and opportunities as are enjoyed by Australians generally. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is well advanced in planning for the introduction of such legislation. I have no doubt that this initiative will be regarded as having far-reaching implications for all people with disabilities. It also signifies a major step forward in legislative reforms for disadvantaged Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another unprecedented step forward in the Government's disability reform agenda is the rationalisation of the provision of disability services between the Commonwealth and State and Territory governments. By clearly delineating areas of responsibility and eliminating duplication and gaps in the provision of services, both levels of government will be able to better and more equitably target their resources to those with the greatest need of support, removing duplication at the same time as eliminating gaps in the provision of services. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the Special Premiers Conference in July, all States and Territories signed the Commonwealth-State disability agreement which defines new Commonwealth and State government roles in relation to the provision of disability services. The agreement requires that each State and Territory enact legislation complementary to the Federal Government's Disability Services Act prior to the agreement's taking effect in that State, with the result that the quality of disability service provision Australia-wide will improve markedly once the agreement is implemented. </PARA>
<PARA>  The new arrangements give responsibility for employment services to the Federal Government in recognition of its national responsibility for both employment services and the income security system; while the States will assume responsibility for accommodation and other support services in recognition of their traditional role in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>  The significance of the Commonwealth- State disability agreement is enormous. It marks a turning point in the provision of more efficient service delivery for people with disabilities and signifies a new era in Commonwealth-State cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA>  One challenge that arises from both the Commonwealth-State disability agreement, and more broadly across the disability reform agenda, is the need for all levels of government to gain improved knowledge about individuals with disabilities and their specific needs. With this knowledge, governments can direct program funds to where they are most needed, and programs and services can be shaped to suit the needs of individuals--rather than shaping individuals to suit existing support infrastructures. </PARA>
<PARA>  Two new approaches to the administration and planning processes in my Department's disability services program will be crucial in realising the potential efficiencies of the Commonwealth-State disability agreement: the adoption of a needs based planning approach, which will address the unequal distribution of disability services across regions and social groups, and identify areas of highest unmet need; and the introduction of a consumer focused funding approach wherein funds will be directed through service providers to provide an agreed type and level of support for individual consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>  Over the next decade, the vastly improved information base that these new approaches will engender--in tandem with the efficiency gains of the Commonwealth-State disability agreement--will produce more effective use of program dollars and better targeting to those most in need, as well as increasing the accountability of the disability services program in relation to improved outcomes for individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have outlined here only some of the Government's initiatives in the area of disability reform: there has also been considerable progress achieved in the crucial area of enhancing consumer rights since 1989, details of which are documented in my accompanying tabling statement. </PARA>
<PARA>  All told, the combination of initiatives undertaken by the Government since 1983 has produced an integrated and coordinated system of supports that are becoming increasingly responsive to the needs of people with disabilities. Changes to the income support arrangements, and improved training and employment opportunities for people with disabilities; the concerted effort to tackle attitudinal barriers across society and enhance consumer rights in disability services; the development of more equitable and accountable methods of determining funding in relation to individual need; and the rationalisation of Commonwealth-State relations in the provision of disability services will all ensure that Labor's vision of a socially just society--where people with disabilities share equally in society's resources and are able to make choices that will fully develop their potential--becomes more tangible with every passing day. </PARA>
<PARA>  To conclude, it is imperative that, as we approach the end of the United Nations Decade of the Disabled, we ensure that the process of reform is an ongoing one that engenders irreversible changes in the lives of people with disabilities. I now table the full statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave --In speaking to this ministerial statement by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) on social justice for people with disabilities, may I say, particularly as the shadow Minister and, I believe, on behalf of the coalition, that we believe that the subject of people with disabilities should be bipartisan and above politics. We share with the Government a vision for social justice not only for the present but well into the future. So talk about social justice should not be the monopoly of any person or any party in this place. What we have to do is to ensure that those people who suffer grave disadvantages within our society have every right to the same opportunities as other people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In the course of the last two to three months we have laid on the table of this House our problems and grievances with the present implementation. In 1986 the Disability Services Bill came into both Houses and became legislation with the full approval of people from both sides of the Parliament and from right around Australia. What we have done in the intervening period is to look at the Act and see what some of the difficulties are. Whilst it is the purest of spirits that moves us within these places, sometimes those purest of spirits get mixed up in the Department and do not filter down to those people with the needs. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will refer to a few of the aspects of the statement that the Minister has just tabled. I thank him for the opportunity to have perused this for the few hours that I have had it. Whilst I will not go into detail on the major tabling statement, I just want to pick up on a few comments in the Minister's speech itself. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are looking at the programs that the Government has implemented over the last 12 months to 24 months. The Minister refers to such things as the disabilities reform package, but I must reiterate that we had some initial complaints about the legislation. It was forced into this House under guillotine with little opportunity for debate. It now seems that it would have been desirable to have had that debate as, following discussion in the Senate, there are now over 100 amendments. My point is that, if we are to get proper legislation for people with disabilities, we want to make sure that it is accurate and will carry out the task that it is supposed to perform. After a delay and the carrying out of a survey, over 100 amendments will be made to this legislation. I believe things could have been done better. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is pushing towards the goal of giving disadvantaged people every opportunity. I recognise the potential for the devolution of accommodation services to the States and employment to the Commonwealth, but the Government has made a fundamental error of judgment in assuming that all people with disabilities have the same degree of disability and can participate equally in the workplace. The big issue in the community at the moment is whether sheltered workshops will be allowed to continue for those people who cannot have access to full employment in the workplace. There are one million people unemployed at this stage, and most of them would be described as able-bodied, so it is difficult to see how people with disabilities will get an equal opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think it is reasonable to draw the Minister's attention to our private member's Bill, in which we do ask for certain things--including a wider choice of programs so that those people who will not be able to participate in the work force are not left out in the cold without any social justice, probably to return to the homes whence they came. We need to emphasise the statement by the Minister that sheltered workshops will be continued. The transition date of 1992--which cannot be met with the funds available--should be extended. We must also look at recreation and living skills for those same people. If we are going to have social justice, this is a very important part of social justice--not just for the people with that need, but also for their parents and relatives at home who are looking after them. I think it is a very important ingredient in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to recognise the great work being done in the disability services area by carers and advocates right across the broad spectrum of Australia. I believe in their own way they are giving the best quality of service that they can and that it is comparable to what is available anywhere else in the world. I also include in that people who are the advocates for them; but, more importantly, I say with a degree of sincerity that the consumers have also played their part. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another area that the Government is looking at is the devolution of responsibilities. People within the field want to know of any savings that will eventually come about with the stopping of wasting and duplication, and whether those funds saved will be returned to those people with disabilities. Perhaps it is a question which I should direct to the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), because he is in control of the purse strings. There is a need for more funds within the disability services area, and perhaps these can be generated from within the savings that have been mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA>   There are some tremendously dedicated people within the industry who should be consulted on the minimum wage for employees with disabilities. I mention just one organisation of people, the Disabled Workers Union in Perth, Western Australia, which is affiliated with the Trades and Labour Council. I believe that some of the work of these smaller unions and groups has not been noted in the past. I believe that they would give a tremendous insight by way of practical demonstration of what is happening and what is required. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also mention in connection with consultation the consumer focus funding approach, which was implemented on 1 July this year. As I understand it, consultations are usually had, reports are then drawn up, recommendations are made, and then the Government implements them. As far as I know, the consultations are still being finalised. In those consultations the carers and consumers alike have indicated grave concerns about the concept. In spite of this, the program was implemented on 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the moment, the program is wallowing around without any direction or guidelines within the Department. I believe that when we talk about consultation, as the Minister's statement does, we should talk about meaningful consultations where people can be listened to and their concerns observed so that the final recommendations and actions thereon reflect what has really been put forward in that consultative process. While I have not had much input into the present consultations with Ms Ronalds, I can only say the first round of consultations on aged care left a lot to be desired from the point of view of talking to people who are prepared to listen. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I have said, a lot of this information is from the past, and it also is associated with present policy and direction; but I believe that it is up to all of us here to ensure that this social justice is delivered in the manner in which it should be. As I said in the course of my address, there have been severe doubts about where that social justice has been delivered by the Department itself and about the manner of its implementation. I know that the Minister has read the grievance debate speeches that we made here a couple of months ago and I just refer them to him for his further reading on this subject. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-When the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) inherited the job of Treasurer back in June of this year, he inherited Australia in the grip of the worst recession for 60 years. At that stage, we had witnessed four negative quarters of growth out of the last six, unemployment over 9 per cent and heading towards 10 per cent, and a massive foreign debt of $130 billion, climbing month in and month out at $1 billion a time. To say that the new Treasurer had a huge job in front of him was an accurate reflection of the huge mess he had inherited from his predecessor. He knew it and everybody in the country knew it. For that reason, most people were prepared to give him a fair go, to give him an opportunity to come to grips with Australia's basic problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  But one would have to say that for the last three months this Treasurer has bumbled and stumbled and fumbled his way around in the economic management of this country to such a degree that when he and the Prime Minister fronted up to the Midday Show with Ray Martin, just a week or so ago, the band played a tune--it was the Laurel and Hardy theme. It would be funny if it were not so tragic, if there were not 831,000 people out of work, if businesses were not being closed from one end of the country to the other, and if Australian families were not under such considerable stress. </PARA>
<PARA>  The people of Australia are desperate for a clear sign that the Government that they elected to office 18 months or so ago is going to face up to the problems that Australia has and provide some decisive leadership about the future direction of Australia. The people of Australia just want some action. They do not want a Treasurer who has reluctance written all over his face. They do not want a Treasurer who will only hazard a guess when he is asked what our immediate economic prospects are. They want a Treasurer who is going to get on with the job of making this country more productive and more competitive so that people can have a better prospect of getting a job and higher living standards in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  We all know that this country has major economic problems and we have a huge challenge in front of us. We are crying out for a Treasurer who can display a grasp of the situation, a sense of where we are going. We have a Treasurer who is bumping into light posts and falling over chairs just like Laurel and Hardy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Today I will focus on some of the mixed messages--I am being very kind to the Treasurer in my choice of words--that we have had from this Treasurer on key policy issues since he first reluctantly took hold of the economic levers three short months ago. I do so to ram home the point that he has to get a grip on himself, get a grip on policy, make some clear assessments of where Australia is and start to set a path for the months ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we take the Treasurer's assessments of where the Australian economy has been and where it is now, he is all over the place. In June he said that things were coming good. A few days later he said that we are in a recession. He was then asked where we are going. He said, `Your guess is as good as mine'. Then he said that we were in a depression. During the last MPI he told us that we were in a depression. A month or so later he said that the outlook was strongly positive. This week, just to underscore the uncertainty in his own mind, in his press conference on the interest rate we got not one, not two, but three assessments of where we are. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The decision will underpin the recovery underway . . .</PARA>
<PARA>A few sentences later he said that it is not under way, it is in prospect, and that the economy is now on the turn. Which of all these different assessments is the right one? Are we in a recession? Does the Treasurer really think that we are in a depression? Does he think that our prospects are only prospects or does he think that things are on the turn? It is important that he comes to a clear assessment of where we are so he has a firm base upon which some of the big policy decisions can be made. </PARA>
<PARA>  We should look at interest rates. On 20 August the Treasurer had a very interesting tete-a-tete with Michelle Grattan on interest rates. He was asked, `What is your view on interest rates? Do you still stand on your views of a few weeks ago?'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, we are taking an overall medium term look . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Michelle said to him:</PARA>
<PARA>But John, you did say a lot more than that. </PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Not at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer did say a lot more. We should look at the record. At one stage he had just come from his latest briefing from Treasury and he was all revved up on interest rates. Strong and resolute, on ABC radio he said that there was `still a lot of response coming through' from the cuts to interest rates over the last 18 months. Critically, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, there is simply no need to pump prime. </PARA>
<PARA>He backed that up a couple of days later when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Further easing now would not affect the economy until 1992, when the recovery should be well under way--a case of too much, too late. </PARA>
<PARA>He supported that. He said that he had advice from Treasury and the Reserve Bank and that if their advice had been that now was the appropriate time to ease monetary policy, that would have happened. He was strong and firm on monetary policy. Five days later we get the great back-flip after a bit of political pressure on the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). He gives the Treasurer the wink and the nod, and the Treasurer is all over the place trying to substantiate his position on interest rates and monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Treasurer should give the House and the Australian population a clear and concise statement of exactly what is his view on monetary policy. What role does he think monetary policy has, as one of the levers which he as Treasurer must employ in the management of this economy? If the Treasurer was not rolled on Monday on the interest rate issue--he was extraordinarily defensive in his announcement of this change, feeling the pressure of criticism before it had even arrived--he should explain to the House what changed between this week and last week. What additional data persuaded him that what he said last week was wrong? If there are data, if he has something substantial, today he should give us the information and the solid facts. Perhaps a clue is to be found in the comments made yesterday by Mr Fraser of the Reserve Bank when he said that the fall in business investment is particularly worrying. Is it particularly worrying to the Treasurer and, if so, on what basis is he concerned? We should take another key area--wages and superannuation. The other day at the Press Club the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>Superannuation will turn us into a nation of savers. </PARA>
<PARA>That is just plain wrong. If the Treasurer wants to counteract that, I invite him to do so. When he stands he should give us a substantial argument to back up his proposition. I say that he is wrong. I say that with his superannuation proposal he will throw people out of work and boost inflation; all he will do is take the savings out of one pocket and put them into the tax concession pocket of superannuation. He is not going to boost national savings. The truth is that national savings have been falling and the Treasurer has no policy response for that. </PARA>
<PARA>  We should look at some of the Treasurer's statements on wages policy. This really is a doozey. When we get a Labor Federal Treasurer walking into wage-tax trade-offs like a bull in a china shop, we really know that he is in trouble. Again, he had a briefing from Treasury. He was all revved up as to what the right line was. He was absolutely honest at the Press Club on 21 August when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe there is little room for further tax cuts, particularly as part of wage/tax trade-offs for the life of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I just don't think wage/tax trade-offs are affordable in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>The Canberra Times told the story a couple of days later when it reported:</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer, John Kerin, took less than 24 hours to retreat from his declaration that there would be no tax cuts, especially wage-tax trade-offs with the ACTU, during this term of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Kerin said in Sydney yesterday that he was only talking about 1991-92 and `certainly 1992-93 is not something I am shutting out of my mind'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is just not true. It is on the public record. The Treasurer did a back-flip. He had political pressure applied to him again and he turned as quickly as the phone call came in from the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>  This whole edifice, including the superannuation issue, leads to further unemployment. If the Treasurer is the honest John he claims to be, why does he not table the Treasury data that have been provided to him which show the unemployment effects of his decision--and throw in for good measure the CPI effects. The fact is that the Treasurer is not prepared to release the data. He is not being as frank as he ought to be on that key issue. </PARA>
<PARA>  We should look at unemployment. We can hear the theme from Laurel and Hardy through each one of these key issues, including unemployment. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>We certainly will have unemployment of the levels of around 8, 9 or 10 per cent for the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Treasurer: which is it? There is a big difference between 8 per cent and 10 per cent for people who are going to be thrown onto the unemployment scrap heap as a result of his policy. A few days after that he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We believe we'll be getting below 10 per cent by about this time last year, next year sorry,--</PARA>
<PARA>being sorry is not much help--</PARA>
<PARA>and then it will continue. </PARA>
<PARA>What did the Treasurer mean by that? What did he mean by `it will continue'? What is his assessment on unemployment? Where are we going? He should make that assessment and then give us a policy prescription to meet it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) is responsible for Medicare, but this Medicare decision is one of the central planks in the Treasurer's Budget. Some $167m in the first year is blowing out to a cost to the Budget of something like $700m. In the Age this morning there is a headline that says `Medicare fee: Howe fights on'. The Age says that the Minister is sticking to the line. The Treasurer's name ought to be up there in lights as well. The Treasurer should be sticking to the line and sticking to the Budget. Instead, on the very day that the Treasurer released the Budget he was backing off on the Medicare decision. At his press conference he said:</PARA>
<PARA>A Labor Government would prefer not to touch Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a central plank. He ought to have made it quite clear that he stood behind that decision and that he is prepared to fight for it. Instead we have seen the Government shove one of the central planks of a key policy issue off to a committee comprising three backbenchers. As with investment and unemployment, all the assumptions in the Treasurer's Budget are unravelling in front of our very eyes. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Treasurer was playing with fire on the question of superannuation on property trusts and the redemptions freeze policy that he introduced. It was a doozey. He was reported as saying that he could guarantee that investors in frozen property trusts would get their money back under the new arrangements. His minders worked awfully fast on that one; so they should. He is about to claim the title of the Rob Jolly of Federal politics. </PARA>
<PARA>  It would be fair to say that the Treasurer has to come to grips with some new issues, but on the matter of Coronation Hill, for example, the Treasurer was the Minister responsible in that era. He knew what was at stake. His public position was quite clear prior to the decision being made. At that time he said, `I think it has become a very important issue; I think we should give it the go ahead'. That was a clear endorsement. However, in his first week as Treasurer he sat in the Cabinet room, on a critical issue nominated by him, and just allowed himself to be rolled, as the Prime Minister moved on yet another one of his shady deals. All these embarrassing gaffes, all these sudden about- faces and all these misleading answers spell just one word--confusion. John, honestly, you are a personable character, I like some of your jokes--</PARA>

In the midst of all this turmoil the country looks desperately to the Treasurer to provide some sense of leadership, some sense of resolve to find the pathway out of the recession.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The title of the matter of public importance today was almost totally ignored by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). The only point that he possibly made referred to Medicare. I want to assure all honourable members that, regardless of the outcome of the examination of the Medicare co-payment by a Federal parliamentary Labor Party committee, there will be no change to the Government's fiscal stance. As set out in the Budget, the Commonwealth's fiscal strategy sets the basis for a steady and sustainable recovery and for future job growth. This, of course, contrasts with the confusion in the Opposition on fiscal matters. All that the Opposition appears to believe is that there should be large cuts in government expenditure, regardless of the consequences for employment or for future economic growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This matter of public importance is breathtaking for its opportunism, cynicism and disregard for the strategic development of economic policy under this Government and also for its cynical misrepresentation of the Budget brought down by the Government on 20 August. The Deputy Leader said something about wanting a more productive, more competitive economy. That is what we have been on about for eight years. This MPI is opportunistic because it ignores the hollowness and emptiness of the Opposition's response. It is cynical because members of the Opposition do not even pretend to have a set of answers that would respond in a categorical way to the task of rebuilding growth and lowering inflation. They want to add to inflation. While we are getting on with the business of making responsible decisions, the shadow Treasurer is getting on with the task of saying, `Wait till Christmas'. Which Christmas? Christmas is always coming. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition's disregard for economic policy is best highlighted by the venal attack of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on the Governor of the Reserve Bank, in which he claimed that Mr Fraser had condoned an easing of monetary policy that `will simply underwrite the wages deal which his masters have cooked up with the ACTU'. That is just contemptible ideological claptrap.</PARA>
<PARA>  In addressing the matter of public importance we need to background it against figures just released today showing, from a survey of job vacancies, increases for the first time since the peak in September 1989. I would certainly caution honourable members, as I always do members of the press, that this is just another partial indicator and needs to be kept in perspective. As I continually emphasise, working on one figure does not make an economic body builder. Nevertheless, the tentative signs of recovery and economic good health are with us. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addressing this matter of public importance, let me explain the objectives of economic policy and the process of economic policy for the beginners on the benches opposite. It is critically important for us all to understand these points. Any trained chimpanzee can get up and say, `Tighter fiscal policy. Cut, cut, cut. Lower interest rates. No support for the unemployed'. I could train a lower primate to get that lesson down pat in just a few short weeks. I note, just in passing, that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has got that message down pat. </PARA>
<PARA>  The task, however, for governments is to put policy into place, to work through the political, economic and cultural processes in order to get decent policy up. That is a lesson that should be scorched into the Opposition. The Fraser years--those years of maladjustment--demonstrated the difference between rhetoric and actual results. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) comes in here each day blackened by the blank sheet which was his list of achievements during the Fraser years. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government now has in train the most ambitious economic reform program ever seen in this country. Secretly members of the Opposition are just a bit envious. They know that under this Government taxation has been completely reformed; they know that superannuation is the right thing to do; and they know that reforms to our rail system, our roads, our electricity system and to our system of government regulations and rules are exactly the right things to do. Members opposite are just sitting there and are secretly terrified of the reforms and the process of reform that are in place. Secretly they hope for a continuation of low economic growth. Secretly, like the honourable member for Bennelong, they believe that such times will suit them. </PARA>
<PARA>  I can tell the House that the economy will improve; unemployment will come down; employment will grow; growth will again drive investment and an expansion of exports;</PARA>
<PARA>the current account deficit will stabilise and inflation will be kept under control; and the Australian economy, Australian industry, and Australian workers will all benefit from an industry structure that is more efficient, more competitive and more flexible, because of the reforms that we have put in place. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me turn to the process of reform, because there is a fabulous misconception around that the pure world of the computer driven economist opposite just drops out of the sky. It is not the case. Reform has to be negotiated past the rocks of special interest groups and the hard places of political and constitutional realities. In order to do this we need a process for reform. That is exactly what this Government has established. The 12 March statement set in train the process for reform of our private industries; the 12 March statement outlined the program of reform to tariffs and to business inputs and depreciation; and, further, the 12 March statement outlined the necessary steps to ease the adjustment costs for individuals. That is why so much emphasis has been placed on workplace training and that is why so much emphasis has been placed on increasing the skills of Australians. In short, the 12 March statement underpins the reform of our private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government acknowledges, however, that the public sector has to change too. That is why the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) established the Special Premiers Conference, and that is why, for the first time in the history of this country, the Commonwealth, the States and local government are working to make government services and government instrumentalities better. Impartial commentators agree that if all governments can hold their nerve on the Special Premiers Conference process, which the Prime Minister has initiated, we have the greatest chance since Federation to make far-reaching improvements in the operation of governments and the delivery of services in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  After the March statement and the Special Premiers Conference process, the third leg of this crucial and integrated economic trifecta for this year was the Budget. In the Budget we exceeded even the toughest expectations laid on us. I do not need to reiterate the difficult circumstances in which we had to frame the Budget. However, I remind the House again that we saved $50m and all new policy was paid for from savings. In other words, we saved $50m from this time last year in terms of our expenditure. That was disciplined budget making and disciplined spending, and in this year all new policy has been gained from savings. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even within such tight constraints as these we still succeeded in achieving real reform. The changes to our retirement incomes policy and the significant improvements in payments to low income families are reforms of great significance. We have initiated major reforms for our cities and continued the industry reform progress in the March statement. We have continued to provide increased support for labour market training and for environmental issues. We have done all this but still maintained the structural integrity of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  Compare all this with the apparent agenda of the Opposition. Last year, in an environment where we were expecting a surplus of $8 billion, its prescription was to cut. Do I have to read it? It is the same old stuff. Last year, the Sydney Morning Herald said:</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Hewson said the Government had not gone far enough in cutting spending, especially welfare expenses. </PARA>
<PARA>The headlines were `Budget not tough enough--Hewson', `Budget avoids tough choices'. All the time it is chop, chop, chop, cut, cut, cut. It is the only thing the Opposition knows. The Opposition's only motivation is political. It has no concern for what is appropriate. It has no understanding of the processes required to get good policy into place. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition never has a constructive suggestion and is bereft of detail in a few areas where it claims to have alternatives. The Opposition still has no health policy. It still has no details of a consumption tax. The absolute gutlessness of the Opposition has been demonstrated over the years by its failure to bring out alternative policies. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even something as important as the new tax, which the Opposition is hell-bent on imposing on the Australian people, is so far nothing but a string of allegations, without details, about what the tax will do for, to or against people--mainly against. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members should listen to the string of ideological cliches from the Opposition. The Opposition wants a totally deregulated wages system, nil inflation, nil tariffs, a nil deficit, nil change in interest rates and constant cuts in government spending. This ideology is parroted as if the economy has no people, as if there are no politics and no State governments, and as if the rest of the world does not exist. For every political problem, the Opposition believes there is an economic equation of absolute and proven veracity. It is nothing more than theory and has its basis in synthetic models and market ideology. </PARA>
<PARA>  The real world has little to do with short term theory or doctrine, and the perceptions of the financial markets are not everything. Real economic activity, real production and real growth come from investment. One cannot build a factory before morning tea on day one of a turn in an economic cycle. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also tried somehow to get the question of interest rates into his proposition that the Budget was unravelling. Is the Opposition seriously saying that there should be no interest rate changes at all? Is it seriously saying that the only interest rate changes should be at Budget time? If the Opposition is saying the latter, it could say that the Budget has unravelled a bit. But that is absolute nonsense. Changes to monetary policy and interest rates are made continually through any one particular year. The only thing that is unravelling is the Opposition's confidence in its ability to sell a new, regressive, unfair tax to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn now to look at some of the other nonsense in the statement by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He said something about pump priming, as if the interest rate issue was about pump priming. The reference to pump priming was entirely about spending beyond the cyclical effects of unemployment and the downturn--the recession--on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition wants me to say whether I was rolled on interest rates. Of course I was not rolled. We followed due process. I emphasise that we worked on the basis of accumulated evidence.   The Reserve Bank Board did not meet in August and data was coming through the whole time. If the honourable gentleman cannot read that data, I am very sorry for him. I can give him the full litany of all the factors that went into the decision of the Government and the Reserve Bank. The Governor of the Reserve Bank put paid to all the snide remarks, cynicism and nonsense from the Opposition about this. Really, the story has died. When the truth has come out, the only person who believes his own baloney is the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  There was also reference to superannuation. There are well-refereed studies that show that superannuation at the level we intend introducing it, phased in over the years, will certainly add to savings. The Opposition has also discovered a new model--the Murphy model. I have had a look at the Murphy model; it is in the library now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes. It is in the library now. Anyone can have a look at it. The whole problem of the Murphy model is that it is relatively small. It has about 20 behavioural equations. It uses quarterly data and embodies long run design features, which include optimising behaviour by producers and consumers and balanced, steady state growth. It is also extremely user friendly. It has been increasingly adopted in the financial community as a tool for exploring the impact of policy and other exogenous shocks on the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  But models are models. If we compare this model with the McGibbon Sax Global model called MSG2 and factor in a cut in government spending, we get totally different results with the Murphy model from those with the other model. There are lots and lots of models around. One can plug in any figure one likes--this one was given to me by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition--and get whatever level of unemployment one wants. When the Opposition cites models as if there is some inherent veracity in all of this, it is having itself on. </PARA>
<PARA>  Somehow the issue of Coronation Hill got into this. I do not know how that has anything to do with the alleged unravelling of this Budget. There is no unravelling at all in this Budget. Last year, we saved $50m between the time we brought the Budget down and now. Now, with a Budget of $101.5 billion, again we have done the job, and we will continue doing it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have to begin by disagreeing with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) on one thing. He likened the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) to Laurel and Hardy, but it is more appropriate to liken him to Basil Fawlty. He has the height of Basil Fawlty and he has that commitment to good lines; he loves to give us all a laugh. For example, one of the good lines I thought he used in his speech was that for eight years the Government has been on about a more productive and competitive economy. We have the worst recession we have had for 60 years!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  He also said that our taxation system is completely reformed. We have a taxation system which is older than computer technology, older than television technology. We have one of the most old-fashioned taxation systems in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Treasurer attacks us for not having produced yet the details of our goods and services tax and tax reform proposals. We had the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), on the other hand, waxing lyrical in Question Time about all the great changes and improvements that have been achieved in the wholesale sales tax legislation. But the Government has not yet introduced the legislation to make those changes, or even drafted it. We have heard a very curious but, if I may say so to the Treasurer, very amusing response to a matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, the Treasurer criticised and attacked the Murphy model. What he says about economic models may be all very well, except that his own Department's modelling is based entirely on the Murphy model. It must be remembered that the Treasury projections, continually quoted by the Treasurer, come from the Murphy model. </PARA>
<PARA>  Like Basil Fawlty, the Treasurer is always one for a good laugh, a good line. But the Australian economy, to continue with the analogy of Basil Fawlty, is like the hotel Fawlty Towers--full of rats, bad food, beds that do not work, doors that fall off their hinges and so on. And there is Basil Fawlty rushing around, excusing himself, pretending that everything works, and using lots of cover-up lines. Honourable members would remember it all from the wonderful Fawlty Towers programs. The Treasurer, in his approach to the economy, is exactly like that. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is said--I note that this has also been said by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders--the Treasurer is an honest man. He is an honest bungler; there is no doubt about that. He honestly does not know what he is doing. He is the man who, when he answers questions, stands up and says, `The Treasurer'--then there is silence--`that's me', so that we are reminded who the Treasurer of this country is. It is a true statement, but not a very inspiring statement. He is the man who says to journalists--the Peter Hartchers of the world; young, struggling journalists, trying to get a story, digging around no matter how false the story is--on projections for the economic outlook, `Your guess is as good as mine'. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is worth reflecting on whose guess is as good as his, there being a whole array of journalists with microphones, television cameras and so on. Their guess is as good as the guess of the man who has the resources of the Treasury behind him, the Murphy model to back him up and, presumably, is meant to be the chief economic manager of this country--that is, him. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have a Treasurer whose first act 2 1/2 months after he became the Treasurer was to introduce his Budget. The question is whether it was his Budget, whether his first great act was indeed his own act. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said:</PARA>
<PARA>Discussion of the Budget should have nothing to do with the leadership--</PARA>
<PARA>ho hum--</PARA>
<PARA>because the Budget strategy was essentially set when Paul Keating was the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite 2 1/2 months beavering away with the Murphy model and trying to understand how economics work, the Treasurer did nothing. Certainly he did nothing because, at a time when Australia faces--as we all, I think, know now--its worst recession for 60 years, we ended up with vacuous verbiage on Budget day, honest in its vacuousness. </PARA>
<PARA>  What did the Budget do to reduce the foreign debt? What did the Budget do to address the balance of payments crisis? What did the Budget do to make Australia internationally competitive? What did it do to stimulate investment in our economy? It predicted that investment would decline over this financial year by 10 1/2 per cent. Where was the coherent industrial relations and wages strategy in the Budget? Where were the details of micro-economic reform?</PARA>
<PARA>  I do not remember how long the Budget Speech lasted. It seemed hours, but it was probably only 20 minutes. There was nothing in it at all of any substance that addressed those issues. That is not to say there was nothing in it at all. There was the `mad cities' proposal which the Treasurer initially opposed--we all know he opposed it--saying that it was vague and impractical. Later on, the `mad cities' proposal having been announced and the Treasurer having been rolled, he said he wanted to turn office blocks into houses. So we have the concept of Pitt Street, Collins Street or whatever in Sydney or Melbourne being refurbished with a mass of welfare housing or high income housing. I am not sure what he has in mind. This is apparently the Treasurer's vision of the `mad cities' plan. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Treasurer has a proposal in the Budget, which is apparently the former Treasurer's proposal, for an increase in superannuation payments to 5 per cent by 1994-95. If we use the Murphy model, if we use the models that are being used in the Treasury and that the Treasurer's projections are based on, by 1994-95 we will have 100,000 people thrown out of work because of this brilliant superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third initiative in the Budget is to correct the balance of payments problems, I suppose; to resolve our foreign debt crisis; to try to recover the terrible state of our economy; to get nearly one million Australians back to work. We now hear that the Medicare charge of $3.50 is, after all, too difficult. Presumably, this review is one step towards the increase in the Medicare levy. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) promised at the last election that that would not happen. He will not reiterate his promise. Goodness knows what other promises are now inoperative as a result of the last election. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we address the general approach of the Treasurer--there is not much more to say than this about his general approach--the reality is that he just does not know what is going on. We can see that from his attempts to answer questions during Question Time. He made a very interesting speech to the Irish-Australian Chamber of Commerce on 1 August. By then he had been the Treasurer for two months. He revealed his great style, his flair when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>This is the first real chance I have had since becoming Treasurer to give my own speech--</PARA>
<PARA>Two months later, the first chance? To continue:</PARA>
<PARA>Up till now, advisers, minders and officials have been telling me that I must talk about things like fiscal and monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Goodness me, fancy a Treasurer talking about things like fiscal and monetary policy! What a big surprise! As we well know, when the Treasurer stumbles into those topics he finds them very hard to handle, despite the claim--which, I must admit, I am finding increasingly hard to believe and think should be investigated--that he has an economics degree. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at some of the comments he made about the Budget surplus. On 5 June 1991, he was quoted in the Canberra Times as saying that it was `very important that we maintain a structural surplus'. On 20 August he was asked by a journalist:</PARA>
<PARA>Do you know. . .whether the Budget is in structural surplus or deficit or on balance?</PARA>
<PARA>He replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I would say it is slightly in deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>That is funny, because only a couple of months earlier he was saying it was very important that we maintain a structural surplus and it had gone into structural deficit. In other words, either he believes that his own policy has failed or else he takes the view that when a journalist gives three options, if one option is chosen, there is a chance in three of getting the right answer. I suspect the truth is that he opted for the latter strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, there was the great interest rate debacle. Let us try to remember that the Labor Party deliberately pushed up interest rates in order to resolve the balance of payments crisis. We should never forget that. We still have a balance of payments deficit of $1 billion a month or more. The argument of members of the Labor Party is: if that is the case, it is not a very good time to bring down interest rates. They thought that they had created all the pain by increasing interest rates to resolve the balance of payments crisis. But the funny thing is that without it being resolved the Government is now rushing to reduce interest rates. It has admitted now that its own policy is a complete failure or it has just decided--this is, of course, the real truth--that it is going to sprint to try to keep the present Prime Minister in a position of leadership. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at what the Treasurer has said on interest rates. Soon after the Budget he started off by saying that interest rates could not be reduced; that they would not be reduced; and that the economic circumstances were not right for them to be reduced. Finally, he reverses all that under the pressure of leadership. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, we have a Treasurer who, sadly, at one of the most serious times in Australia's economic history, just does not have a clue what is going on. Putting Basil Fawlty in charge of a national economy and the livelihoods of 17 million people is not a funny thing. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am happy to assist Opposition members in unravelling the Government's economic policy, because I realise they are economically illiterate and economically bankrupt. As the coalition has no credible economic policies, I can well understand its envy of a government which has clear policy aims and objectives. There is no denying that Australia is in the midst of a recession, a phenomenon currently affecting most Western economies. As a member of the international economic community, Australia is not isolated from the trends of other economies. It is, however, interesting to compare statistics of this recession and the recession that the Australian Labor Party inherited from the coalition when it formed government in 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In 1983, the Government inherited a taxation system in disrepair and disrepute. In 1983, the top personal marginal rate of tax was 60c in the dollar. Under this Government's economic policies, which the coalition finds so hard to understand, that rate is now 47c in the dollar. In 1983, the bottom personal marginal tax rate was 30c in the dollar. This rate is now down to 21c in the dollar--once again, an achievement beyond the comprehension of the economic pygmies of the Opposition. In 1983, company tax was 46c in the dollar. It is now 39c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me continue to unravel. The Government has been able to achieve such reductions in the level of personal income tax by raising revenue from a number of other sources and making the tax system more equitable. The introduction of the capital gains tax, still bitterly opposed by the Opposition, has been a source of considerable revenue for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1990-91 the capital gains tax is expected to raise $631m. The Opposition is quite proud to say publicly that in the unlikely event of it winning government, it will abolish the capital gains tax. The question must then be asked: where will it raise the revenue lost from its abolition? It is not too hard to find the answer. The pay as you earn worker will again be asked to subsidise the rich friends of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA>  Who was it that strongly objected to the introduction of the fringe benefits tax? The Opposition was concerned that its rich business friends might actually have to pay for their lunch. It argued that Australian business would be crippled by the imposition of this unjust tax, because the smoked salmon, lobster and wine would be replaced by tuna, Perkins paste and cordial and business confidence would be lost. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fact is that the fringe benefits tax has raised in excess of $1.26 billion. Like the capital gains tax, it is both just and equitable. It targets those who can afford to pay. Let the Ferrari driving Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) explain to a factory worker who takes his lunch to work in a brown paper bag why he should be happy to subsidise the business lunch. The reason the coalition is so bitterly opposed to the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax is that it means its friends and supporters will have less money to polish their silver spoons. </PARA>
<PARA>  I can understand why a Party which has presided over the biggest tax rorts in Australian history needs help in understanding the policies of a government which stopped bottom of the harbour rorts. Labor's economic policies have made the tax system fairer for all Australians, and it is for this reason that the privileged sons of the aristocracy and the squattocracy are so bitterly opposed and resentful. </PARA>
<PARA>  One may well ask: what is the Opposition's solution? A balanced Budget and the introduction of a consumption tax. It is obvious that the Opposition knows nothing about economics. It is equally obvious that it knows nothing about history. </PARA>
<PARA>  I must admit that I thought I was in a time warp when I heard the Leader of the Opposition say, in his reply to the Budget, that the Government should have balanced the Budget. What a fine speech it was--full of sound and fury, long on rhetoric and short on detail. It really showed that the Leader of the Opposition has inherited a new title: that of the shadow--completely lacking in substance. </PARA>
<PARA>  I thought I was hearing the ghost of Sir Otto Niemeyer, the representative of the Bank of England, sent to Australia in the Great Depression of the 1930s. It was Sir Otto's economic advice of a balanced Budget--now totally rejected--that contributed to prolonging the economic difficulties of the Great Depression. It is obvious that the good doctor's remedies will only make the economy worse. At Question Time today the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) quite rightly pointed out that the core of the Opposition's program means only one thing; that is, a spiv led, computer driven recovery. It is wrong in economics, it is wrong in equity and it is wrong in fact. </PARA>
<PARA>  What will be the effects of the consumption tax--the Opposition's great recipe--on low income earners and the elderly? It will mean more inequality and more injustice. The consumption tax is a recipe for disaster. It attacks the poor and the disadvantaged members of the community. Its effects on inflation are well-known. One only has to look at the New Zealand economy to see the effects on inflation of a goods and services tax. What will the impact of a consumption tax be on unemployment? A consumption tax and a balanced Budget will only lengthen the dole queue. The reason we have all the empty words and the rhetoric--without the substance--coming from the Opposition is that it has no substance. It truly is the shadow Government, completely lacking in substance. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government will be remembered for the long term vision of the superannuation policy that has been brought down in this Budget--a recognition of where Australia is heading in the next century. What does the Leader of the Opposition say? On 18 August 1991, in a doorstop interview, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I don't believe that occupational superannuation makes any sense in a country like Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's November 1990 statement on micro-economic reform outlined changes to take place in the provision of telecommunications services in Australia. As part of these reforms, Aussat Pty Ltd will be sold to form the basis of the second carrier. A number of regulatory changes have recently been made by the Parliament to create a competitive environment for the second telecommunications carrier and new owner of Aussat. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commonwealth's 100 per cent share- holding in Aussat is to be sold and general telecommunications and public mobile licences awarded. Once ownership of the shares is transferred, Aussat will cease to be a government business enterprise. Accordingly, the Aussat Act 1984 will need to be repealed and a number of consequential provisions will need to be put in place so that the sale can be completed. After the sale, Aussat will be a privately owned company and subject to the laws that presently govern the corporate operations of such companies in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Consequential provisions are also required to extinguish Aussat's tax losses, to empower the Treasurer to give an explicit Commonwealth guarantee to Aussat's borrowings up to the point of sale, to appropriate funds to pay out those borrowings prior to the sale and to remove Aussat from future coverage of other Commonwealth legislation such as the Archives Act. Under section 80 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, a company may offset prior year losses against future income to reduce taxable income and income tax liability until such time as the accumulated losses have been used up. </PARA>
<PARA>  Aussat's accumulated and projected trading losses to 30 June 1991 provide a potential future income tax benefit to a purchaser. While it is normal practice to sell an entity with any tax losses, doing so in this case would clearly have budgetary implications in future years. From a budgetary viewpoint, therefore, it is desirable that they be removed. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the matter of Aussat's borrowings, in the period leading up to the sale, Aussat will continue to fund its operations from both revenues and borrowings. It is essential therefore that the viability of the borrowing program is maintained until it is paid out by the Commonwealth. Because of Aussat's high gearing, investor support of its borrowing program in the lead-up to the sale is heavily reliant on Commonwealth expressions of support for Aussat. Paying out the debt prior to the sale will have a twofold effect. Firstly, it will reassure lenders in the period prior to the pay-out and, secondly, it will facilitate the orderly sale of the company. </PARA>
<PARA>  The appropriation provided for in the Bill is set at an estimated maximum amount allowing for contingencies such as the impact of variable interest rates applying to Aussat's borrowings between now and when they are paid out, the possible pay-out of one or both of Aussat's leveraged satellite leases as well as its commercial paper borrowings and any slippages in the timing of the pay-out due to factors relating to the sale itself. The figure is $800m, but the Bill provides for the actual appropriation to be set at an outturn figure below the maximum. The need to pay out the leveraged leases will not be known until the bidders, the banks and the Commonwealth decide as part of the sale negotiations how the satellite leases are to be treated. The amount of the debt pay-out will ultimately affect the price received for Aussat. </PARA>
<PARA>  The explicit guarantee is required to support the restructuring of Aussat's borrowings in preparation for pay-out. Just prior to pay-out Aussat will consolidate its borrowings into a single credit instrument with the Common- wealth Bank to facilitate the logistics of pay- out. For its part, because of its very large exposure to Aussat through this arrangement, the Commonwealth Bank has quite reasonably requested that the Commonwealth guarantee the credit instrument up to the point of sale. The Bill provides for the guarantee to cease at the point of sale. The Bill also makes minor amendments to other Commonwealth legislation consequential upon the repeal of the Aussat Act 1984 and, in respect of other telecommunications legislation in particular, to correct drafting anomalies and to clarify the technical operation of some of the provisions of that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  As indicated above, this Bill provides for a maximum of $800m which can be paid to Aussat in the form of additional share or loan capital. The amount actually paid will be determined by movements in interest rates between now and the time of pay-out, the timing of the actual pay-out and the treatment of the satellite leveraged leases. It is neither possible nor desirable to predict what the incoming sale proceeds will be, as this will be determined in the sale negotiation process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- Last night in the House I expressed my pleasure at the fact that, since my raising of the need for the flood mitigation works in Lismore to be undertaken, the New South Wales Government has seen fit to raise the priority of this project in its submissions to the Federal Government under the Federal water resources assistance program. In anticipation of the successful completion of the consultation process, the New South Wales Government had sought and was given Commonwealth funds to allow the commencement of works during 1991-92.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The news which flowed from the Budget is the best news that the Government could give to the city of Lismore. It has been my No. 1 priority, and I do not mind admitting to the House how excited I felt when the announcement was made. It is just the news that we need to get things moving up in Lismore. A prosperous city, which Lismore is, will attract investment and break the cycle of unemployment for many. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another aspect of the Budget which will impact positively on the far north coast of New South Wales is the increased funding of some $199m for labour market programs, which will bring the Commonwealth moneys made avail-able for such programs to a total of $514m. It will also provide further increases for vocational training, such as apprenticeships, TAFE and Skillshare programs--that is, real training for real jobs, which is the real need of the Richmond electorate, where the industry base is so small. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is often asserted that Federal programs cannot deliver the goods on the ground because of the supposed isolation of Canberra from the real world. I want to pay tribute to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) for the way in which Commonwealth programs have built into them the flexibility to allow them to respond to local labour market conditions. It is clear that what suits the needs of, for example, north Sydney might not suit the needs of the unemployed on the north coast, at Byron Bay, the Tweed or Tyagarah. </PARA>
<PARA>  In terms of labour market programs, no-one will change the face of the Richmond electorate and the imbalance in its industry base overnight. However, a number of strategies have been developed locally, underscored here by Budget initiatives which attempt to face the region's problems squarely. The first is the formation of what can only be described as a hard-nosed committee of people representing successful businesses, manufacturing and union interests from the region to examine the possibilities of the region on an industry by industry basis. That committee, called the Northern Rivers Regional Development Committee, was set up under the office of labour market adjustment program. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have already described to this House the initiative of the people who set up the Norply mill in Kyogle. That initiative provided an example of value adding which we could all learn from. That operation is a fine example of what this nation must do over and over again. It is vital for the expansion of manufacturing within the Richmond electorate. Past practices of using our resources without value adding has meant that we have had a low return for what should have been a very valuable product. In Kyogle potentially valuable veneer was peeled from logs and sent away to be sold for a pittance. Today that same operation, through the perseverance and the foresight of people in the community --and helped by State and Federal programs--uses the veneer in a process to provide valuable plywood. A bonus was the creation of over 80 jobs which would have disappeared if the mill had closed. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the tasks of the OLMA committee is to identify and, where possible, foster similar value adding opportunities throughout this region. At the same time, training and skilling programs, whether conducted under the auspices of CES, DEET, Skillshare or TAFE, seek to respond to local needs. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have used the term `stung to desperation' to describe how many of the unemployed in the electorate of Richmond feel about finding a job. However, like tackling flooding in the city of Lismore, turning around the legacy of the past on the north coast will not happen overnight. Nevertheless a beginning has been made to look seriously at applying what I have termed `the Kyogle syndrome' to the problem of our industry base on the north coast. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the end of this month the first exchange of information between the three tiers of government and private enterprise within the Richmond electorate will take place. From that exchange we hope will emerge some real commitment for the region to work together to ensure that the lack of a substantial industry base is not just accepted and handed on to our children and their children. </PARA>
<PARA>  The approach of this Government in dealing with problems for individuals who are unemployed contrasts starkly with the position embraced on the other side of the House, where, after nine months, recipients of social security payments would be cast adrift without any care for their future. That is the compassion which the Opposition parties would show to those who live on the New South Wales north coast, where unemployment even in good times far outstrips the jobs available. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me now turn the attention of the House to changes to the superannuation and retirement incomes policy. This Government has set a target to boost employer support for superannuation to 9 per cent of earnings by the year 2000. While honourable members on the opposite side of the House decry this move and attempt to portray it as one which will bring about the collapse of the Western world, let us look closely at the benefits. When this Government came to office in 1983, less than 25 per cent of the Australian population were covered by superannuation schemes. That figure has now risen, and probably something like 70 per cent of the population have some sort of superannuation scheme. The present move is well on the way to ensuring that, by the year 2000, every worker in this nation will be in such a scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  The obvious benefits to Australia have been spelt out by the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) and by other members on this side of the House. I want to draw the attention of honourable members to one unheralded benefit: more and more people upon retiring are choosing to move out of places such as Sydney and relocate to places such as the north coast of New South Wales. In that situation, the quality of life for those citizens is enhanced. The provisions of this Budget in relation to superannuation and retirement incomes policy will provide more and more Australians, upon retirement, with choices because the disposable income will allow them greater flexibility in making decisions about where and how they live. </PARA>
<PARA>  I draw the attention of honourable members to just one of the many health initiatives contained in this Budget. I refer to the Government allocation of some $22.4m to improve the effectiveness and reliability of cervical cancer screening in a new four-year program which will target at-risk women. Many women, including older women, Aboriginal women, women from a non- English speaking background, and women from isolated rural areas are at present infrequently or never screened. Over half of the 1,040 cases of cervical cancer diagnosed annually could be prevented by a more effective national screening program. The cervical cancer screening program will be welcomed by all women. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my own electorate of Richmond this program will join the mammography unit being set up at Lismore and the osteoporosis clinic being established to provide services for women. While it is important for all women to have these services, it is especially significant to the quality of life of women who live on the far north coast of New South Wales that these services should be available within the region. I give an undertaking to the women in the Richmond electorate that I will work to bring the benefits of this Government initiative to the Richmond electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to refer to two other aspects of this Budget which will impact positively for the benefit of us all. The Budget maintains support for the design, construction and operation of the Australian pavilion at Expo 92 to be held in Seville, Spain, from April to October 1992. A key objective of Australia's participation at Expo 92 is to promote Australia as a tourist destination to the estimated 4.5 million visitors who will pass through the Australian pavilion during the Expo. The Australian pavilion's exhibits and programs will target the high priority, high growth European markets. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another ambassador for Australia to the Seville Expo will come from the Richmond electorate.  Spain's Expo 92 will have a kangaroo pub--an outback pub operated by Australian businessmen. The pub looks like a woolshed with an iron roof and a windmill outside it, and is expected to serve 30,000 drinks a day with Australian seafood and steaks. The 1,400 square metre pub will be in the centre of the 215 hectare Expo site in the national pavilion area. The pub will provide many of the visitors with their first experience of Australian lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA>  The tourism industry means a lot to this nation, and I am sure honourable members on both sides of the House wish the Australian exhibitors well. I am sure that that wish extends to the Australian pub, and I know that the group involved from Richmond will make good ambassadors for Australia. The success of that ambassadorship will be seen in the flow of trade and tourists to and from this country in the years following Expo. Naturally, we will be trying to snare an equitable amount for the north coast, which contains some of the most beautiful country in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Lastly, I want to refer to the increased allocations in the Budget for technical and further education and higher education. The training package announced in the Budget will strengthen the ability of what the Minister rightly describes as the nation's most extensive training scheme. It will provide high quality training to Australia's work force and for thousands of young people preparing and training for their working lives. In this regard I hope that the attacks upon the TAFE teachers' working conditions in New South Wales will cease. </PARA>
<PARA>  To conclude, I must again commend this Government for the support it has provided for higher education in this Budget. I know that the debate about higher education charges will be waged on both sides of the House and on campuses right across the nation. However, I want to pay tribute to the Government for the fact that, over and above what is happening in the fees debate, it has provided new funding of $76m in 1992 and $42m in 1993 to help alleviate the pressures of over-enrolments and overcrowding. </PARA>
<PARA>  That funding is over and above other commitments already made and the payment of the long awaited salary increases for academic staff in universities across the country. I understand that around $4 billion will be spent on higher education in 1992. Most pleasing is the announcement of 13,000 new places and the capital works program of some $266m for 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1968 a report to the New South Wales State department of decentralisation and development entitled Some Sociological Aspects of Life in New South Wales Country Towns was published at Macquarie University in Sydney. As part of the compilation of that report a survey was undertaken in 12 New South Wales towns and provincial cities to isolate factors which impacted upon the quality of life. The chief finding of that survey was the major problem of the provision of tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the credits which the Opposition surely would not seek to take away from this Government is its commitment to answering the question: how can access to higher education be provided for provincial and rural Australia? Just some 15 months ago I told this House of the importance of the impact which the former Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education had on the electorate. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --One can well understand the concern of the Hawke Government that the Budget has been poorly received. However, I can assure it that it is not simply a matter of bad salesmanship, because disenchanted and very worried Australians have a very clear perspective of why the Budget has failed. No massive public relations campaign at taxpayers' expense and no gimmicks from the political charlatans and the imposters who have portrayed themselves as economic managers will succeed. The nation knows that the game is up, and so does the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  People have had enough of the buck-passing by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), and the `Your guess is as good as mine' honest acknowledgment from the present Treasurer (Mr Kerin). Lives, businesses and the economic and social heritage of this nation and its people are being shattered by the combination of Labor governments around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Only one Labor leader, in Queensland, who inherited a well run and balanced economy, retains any credibility. But time will see even his Budget deficit--which has now blown out to $3.9 billion--grow as spending proliferates and as State colleagues of Mr Goss, desperate for revenue, try to change the funding rules to compensate for their own mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA>  What then does the Budget tell us? It tells us that the number of unemployed will go up probably to one million. Within these figures we see a real tragedy. At least 300,000 people are now in the long term unemployed queue. Another 160,000 of the unemployed were yesterday's family breadwinners, and there are massive problems for youth and other people moving into the job market for the first time. The driving force--the motivation--behind the Budget should have been jobs. Instead, it is related to only one job--the top job. </PARA>
<PARA>  While the Government seeks some answers to its paralysis, let no-one forget that it has been the honourable member for Blaxland who was the self-acknowledged architect of this mess. He `brought home the bacon'; he produced the `beautiful figures'; he was the Placido Domingo; he sang in the leading role; and he carried all of those on the Government side of the House meekly along the path to shattering the hopes and future of millions of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  My real concern with the rhetoric of the Budget Speech is the absence of any objective assessment of the depths of the economic malaise and the reasons for it. This is not a recession brought on by drought, when recovery is usually rapid when production returns, when confidence returns and when the impact on business activity and infrastructure development is relatively minimal. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recession and the deep-seated problems that exist stem from a total adherence to monetary policy with unsustainable high interest rates--the real villain in the devastation of our productive activity. It is paradoxical therefore that, as socialist regimes and policies tumble around the globe on an almost daily basis, Australians and Australia are being forced into embracing them. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget has, for example, acknowledged that Medicare is slowly consuming itself and, with it, one of the world's best combinations of private and public health care delivery. But in making this acknowledgment, the Budget, by the action that has been taken, simply exacerbates the problem. Waiting lists at public hospitals will increase and the awful inequities that exist, particularly in my electorate of Mallee and other regions of Victoria, for many country people will remain. Community hospitals are bleeding financially as clients, unable to meet both the Medicare levy and private insurance, either forgo medical attention or travel to an already overstressed and under-funded public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA>  Obviously the Government itself is under pressure from unions and its own members to make changes to the Budget as far as Medicare is concerned. We know, for instance, that the existing Medicare levy meets only one-fifth of the cost of health care. My real concern is that the Government is being panicked through political expediency and as a servant to ideology to again follow the dictates of the union movement, thereby increasing the levy and further penalising the reducing number of taxpayers. There is simply no justification for people who wish to attend a hospital of their choice and fully cover themselves with insurance having to pay the Medicare levy as well.</PARA>
<PARA>  A similar feature of the Government's philosophy, transferred into policy, is reflected in the superannuation scheme. Treasurer Kerin again is following the former Treasurer's early initiatives, placing employers under further pressure. The Government's decision to require all employers to pay 5 per cent of their wage bill into superannuation contributions from July 1992 will increase labour on-costs with the legislated route denying employers the opportunity to argue about incapacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some small businesses have been cushioned from the impact of what amounts to a Federal payroll tax by a change to the start-up date and the special provisions of a 3 per cent rate for those with payrolls under half a million dollars a year. The Treasurer points to raising the employer contribution further, to 9 per cent of annual payroll, by the year 2000 with consideration being given to requiring employees to pay some contribution. This was the sort of consideration that should have been given at the instigation of the superannuation scheme in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of greatest concern to economic policy, however, will be the likely diversion of investor funds from productive capital investment to superannuation. Such a diversion of investment funds will be regarded by many in the business community as ill-timed, with spending on productive plant and equipment forecast to fall by 10.5 per cent this financial year--remembering that last year it fell by some 11.9 per cent. Such large successive contractions in plant and equipment spending will have the effect of limiting growth in the supply side of the economy, holding back the structural adjustments and reforms that are necessary, and greatly reducing our national capacity to bring down the horrendous current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>  This mandatory dictate by the Government, which, as I said, takes no account of a business or an industry's capacity to pay, will be a further tax on jobs. Contrary to the views of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell), who believed that this policy would increase the benefits to those in the work force, the real impact will be on those that are not. </PARA>
<PARA>  Before turning to some specific comments on the impact of the Budget as far as country Australia is concerned, I wish to make two further observations. Firstly, economic factors are not the only cause of unemployment. The disintegration of family life, the impact of family law reform and a turning to welfare to treat the symptoms rather than the need for structural change are major contributing factors. A significant number of children are now being born into unemployment, who in turn will become parents of children in the same pattern. The widespread difficulties being experienced by many sole parent families as they seek low cost housing when there is a dearth of unskilled jobs are part of a new social phenomenon. A major demographic change is taking place in Australia and it is not being addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, the Budget impact is intended as one of restraint when the obvious challenge is for stimulus for investment, for the production of wealth and in turn increasing employment. Lower interest rates and lower taxation should have been part of reforming policies but all with the aim of encouraging self- sufficiency. An incredible number of letters are being received in our electorate offices at this time from people who have been prepared to support themselves in the past and who are really wondering where this nation has gone wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government made much of its family income package, but it is both a farce and a fraud for many financially stricken farmers and small business people. Let us have a look at some of these changes. We now have a $600,000 asset test on family allowance which will effectively exclude hundreds more families from this assistance. It has totally failed to address the inequities and anomalies with Job Search and Austudy. It is inequitable that a farmer's spouse who is actively seeking work is not eligible for the Jobstart allowance. </PARA>

Realistically, very few viable farms are worth less than this. By implication the Government expects farm families with low incomes to sell the farm to provide themselves with income support. Where is the social justice here?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EG4">Mr PETER FISHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Many farm assets are not divisible or saleable in the current economic climate. For those that are, the selling of part of a farm would mean the remaining farm enterprise would be a non- viable unit. There are very few jobs available to a farmer who is able to sell the farm as a whole. This expedient of selling the farm further reduces the economic activity of any region and in turn of the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  A farm is sold together with the home on it, so selling the farm means selling the home. The reluctance of many farm families to take this step is certainly understandable. If the Government imposed this requirement on unemployed urban families, there would be a justifiable outcry. Unlike other groups, the main asset of the farm family is not the home. It may be appropriate to apply the $157,500 threshold to other groups and to exclude the home from asset calculations, but for farm families it is not. </PARA>
<PARA>  Why did the Government, in determining eligibility for the Jobstart allowance, not discount business assets by 50 per cent as it does for Austudy? Forty-six per cent of farm families today have absolutely no access to Austudy due to the assets test. The announced change to Austudy enables recipients of a pension administered under the Department of Social Security, or those receiving household support administered under the rural adjustment scheme, who apply for Austudy to be exempted from the Austudy asset test but this is no concession. The asset test threshold for Department of Social Security benefits, for example, is $347,000. So if applicants for Austudy were receiving a Department of Social Security benefit, they would already be required to have assets of less than the existing Austudy threshold. </PARA>
<PARA>  No rural children should be barred from tertiary education because of their geographical position but this is occurring. Surely in 1991, when the Government talks of social equity, such a fundamental tenet does not have to be fought for. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn now to the Budget impact on primary industry in particular--on those who work in it and those who service it, and the significance of this sector on Australia's future and our standard of living. I point to some figures mentioned in this House this week by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). He made the point that the take home pay next year of the 4,600 public servants who work in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, and who are basically paid for by primary industry levies, will not be much less than the income of the 126,000 farmers they support. It is a very interesting figure and one that we should all be concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA>  We all know that agriculture is notorious for its cycles of boom and bust, but sometimes they are caused by economic factors and at other times by dramatic swings in local climatic conditions. The current downturn, however, is not merely a low point in the ever recurring cycle of events. The evidence supports the view that the rural sector today is in the midst of a major economic and social breakdown. </PARA>
<PARA>  Geoffrey Lawrence, a researcher with the Centre for Rural Welfare Research at the Charles Sturt University of New South Wales, has said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia in the mid-80s was featured by falling commodity prices, high interest rates, increasing import costs, falling land values and increased farm debt. </PARA>
<PARA>The full extent of the rural crisis has never been fully comprehended but includes environmental degradation as farmers seek to work the land harder and the social malaise as rural towns and villages lose their human vitality. This is associated with a population migration, with the withdrawal of voluntary labour, usually that of farm and town women, and the reduction of Government services and facilities in response to the policies of financial restraint. </PARA>
<PARA>  The degree to which farmers have successfully maintained viability until recent times has been observed by counsellors in my electorate of Mallee. The majority of farmers currently being counselled were debt free at the beginning of the 1980s. In the course of the 1980s, however, as many as 40 per cent of all farms have had periods of negative income. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that many farmers have not been able to remain debt free. For instance, a Department of Agriculture study has shown that the average farm cash operating surplus for Victorian woolgrowers for the period 1985-90 averaged $46,000 per annum. It is expected that this figure for 1990-91 will decline to about $16,000--a drop of over 60 per cent--and we are now told that at least 30 per cent of all woolgrowers throughout Australia will have a negative income next year. Similarly, with wheat and other broad acre crops there was a 35 per cent decline in income in 1990-91, and for this year negative incomes are the order of the day for many farmers. </PARA>
<PARA>  Farmers have been actively encouraged by many people over the years to increase farm size to ensure long term viability. Following above average harvests in the Mallee and the Wimmera in 1983, farmers competed for more land, causing land values to rise considerably. At the same time they were encouraged to lease machinery and to purchase new plant to gain tax deductibility. As a result, many farmers borrowed quite large sums of money. It was not foreseen that, as a result of this Government's action, money borrowed to pay inflated land prices and to purchase plant would become increasingly more expensive. Loans taken out at rates of 10 to 15 per cent very quickly escalated to 20 per cent and beyond. With rising interest rates and a poor run of seasons, many farmers in my community found themselves with serious financial problems. They have been further exacerbated by land values falling now by up to 50 per cent and beyond, which substantially erodes the remaining equity that farmers had in their farms and their ability to obtain carry-on finance. </PARA>
<PARA>  This substantial debt, coupled with low commodity prices, is today the main force driving farming families into insolvency. Even if overseas agricultural protection abated as rapidly as could realistically be expected, resulting in less dumping of exports and lower trade barriers, and even if the economic policy of this country were competently managed, our farmers would gain only a temporary respite. There will continue to be unrelenting pressure on agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA>  The mid-1980s crisis in most of the Mallee--it was not much different around the rest of Australia--was attributed to the severe drought of 1982, followed by the poor seasons and conditions of 1984-85. This had the effect of focusing attention on the short term needs of farming communities rather than on the long term changes which now seem inevitable. These trends have now re-emerged in the 1990s and are now increasingly prevalent across the entire region. At that time State and Federal governments were both willing and more able to provide assistance to those most affected than is the case in these times. For instance, in 1986 in the Mallee 900 farming wives were able to qualify for the unemployment benefit. It is estimated that this resulted in an injection of some $8m into my local economy. But, of course, the Government has now made changes to the eligibility criteria regarding the value of assets and joint ownership of family farms, which has meant that many farming families are no longer able to claim such benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many skilled farmers are now in extremely difficult circumstances. The average age of farmers in Australia in 1989-90 was 53.8 years. The present conditions--and actions of the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), whom I will never forgive--have ensured that we have lost from agriculture the next generation of skilled youth from our rural communities. I will never forgive the Hawke Government for this. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many rural families are experiencing very high levels of stress and this, of course, extends into the small business community that serves them. When this is coupled with the comparatively low level of services, many country people have little choice but to endure an ongoing state of anxiety and distress. Survey data indicates that rural people experience 10 per cent more illness and have 28 per cent more hypertension and disorders than urban people. It is therefore bitterly ironic that people are withdrawing from many kinds of activities in the community, such as sporting organisations, service clubs, et cetera, at a time when the very social contact that they provide would be invaluable in alleviating the stress of the current crisis. The families most at risk are those who, in order to save money, cut themselves off from the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have had recent meetings with professional and voluntary providers of services. The current conditions are as stressful on them as on their clients. The impact of the rural downturn on many towns and communities in my electorate, and no doubt right across the whole of Australia, is very similar to that of a natural disaster. When a community is engulfed by a bushfire or a flood, relief organisations swing into action. But there is no such comforting action in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not just the economic issues that are placing stress on rural communities. Of course, there is growing concern about soil erosion, salinity and the use of chemicals. These are all issues which confront farmers and put growing pressure on many farmers throughout Australia. No matter how passionately activists may feel about the threat that some farming practices pose to the environment, it is the farmers and the landowners who must accept the need for change and ultimately bear the cost. This Budget has failed. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- Politics, as it is played within governments and parliaments which have built themselves on the Westminster system, really is about many things. It is about policies, priorities and programs. These Ps of politics, as they are often called, are determined at national and local level and are all about the interests of pressure groups and people. It comes back to things such as financial management and the very important issues of justice, equity and accountability. But it is also about alternatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In the system of government that we adopted from the British, there has been a traditional responsibility on oppositions not only to monitor the programs, the policies and the priorities set by a government; they also have a very special task, which is to present alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA>  I listened with some interest the other day when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) made what one could describe as a theatrical Budget reply. I give him full marks for the theatrics. But, when it came to performing that responsibility of presenting the alternatives, one could only give him a score of one out of 10. He presented no alternatives to the Hawke Government's programs of expenditure and receipts. He provided no explanation of a detailed Opposition strategy. He gave no alternative priorities and he gave no alternative policies. </PARA>
<PARA>  What the Leader of the Opposition did was to play the game of generalisation. He played the game of criticism without construction. He played the game of opposition without alternatives. Why? I asked myself: why would he do that? Was it that he was not ready to come forward with these alternatives? Was it that he was trying to time strategically his run--or was it that he was afraid of scrutiny? I opt for the last. I believe that there is growing evidence that it is the fear of scrutiny that is the reason for the lack of detail and lack of alternatives from the Leader of the Opposition and other members of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many pronouncements have emanated from those opposite, but they have been superficial; they have been one-liners. One notes when one goes through them that they have been targeting personal prejudices. They talk about things such as radical reform, which sounds great; but they never say what it means. They have these glib one-liners about the work ethic; but they do not really go into the issue, the detail, the substance. Then they get onto things such as the unemployed. They target personal prejudices on immigration and on those who they keep talking about as on the dole. Then they have a campaign of half truths; linked to that are deceit and, again, generalisations. To find out what those opposite believe, what they espouse or what they are saying, one has to dig--and that is often very hard to do. </PARA>
<PARA>  But there are some certainties. The certainties are that those in the Opposition--the Liberals and Nationals federally--are committed totally to Thatcherism and Reaganomics. They are committed totally to total deregulation of the marketplace. If one looks at recent material that has come forward, one sees that they are committed to all the extremities of hard right capitalism. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 13 August there appeared in the Bulletin magazine a cover story entitled `How Hewson would change Australia'. It was written and compiled by David O'Reilly. It is the first detailed exposition of the thinking--or one might say political mentality--of the extreme right wing elements that are now in firm control of the Opposition Liberal and National parties. It is a detailed analysis of the priorities, the programs and the policies of not only John Hewson but also many of his shadow Ministers. But it is also obvious that the Opposition has attempted to package these proposals so that they are politically palatable. </PARA>
<PARA>  I put it to those who have read that article that it contains enough specific detail to put fear into the minds and hearts of every Australian who believes in fairness, equity and social justice. There is nothing that is very sure, but the Opposition program is truly a blueprint to force Thatcherism onto Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have listened to the Leader of the Opposition and he has admitted a number of things. In this article, and on other occasions, he has said that Australia under him would be `radically different'--his words. He plans to `re- sculpture the nation'--his words. He talks about a revolutionary shift from the public sector to the private sector. He is talking about massive privatisation. He is talking about the private enterprise control of community services, of aspects of education. He is talking about the private entrepreneurial control of welfare, postal services, communications, pensions and health care. He is talking about the total deregulation of airlines; this means the total deregulation of air safety, which must send shudders through thinking people. He wants to totally deregulate working conditions, wages and awards. He wants to bring about Hewson's Thatcher Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I suggest that it is vital that all Australians understand just what the Hewson alternative really means. They need to understand how the Hewson plan--the blueprint--will affect them and their families. If we look at Britain between 1979 and 1988 when Thatcher controlled its society, we find that Thatcherism captured the hearts of the conservatives--particularly the extreme Right, the rich. Thatcherism clouded the minds of the economists--regrettably, even some of our own in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  Thatcherism caught the aspirations of the British people, who were looking for an alternative to what they saw were the problems and the difficulties of Britain in the 1970s. Thatcherism corralled the political thinking of the parties of the Right over there, just as they have done here with the Liberals and the Nationals. Thatcherism failed, yet we have here an Opposition Leader and his shadow Ministers running this line and saying that the Opposition will bring about a Thatcher Australian society. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition and his extreme Right followers are desperate to cover up that fact. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need not look at what Australian politicians in the Labor Party have said about Thatcherism; we can go to the British themselves. Nigel Healey is an economics lecturer at the University of Leicester. In the magazine Contemporary Review, in December 1989, he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Purging inflation from the system has cost Britain a decade of mass unemployment and burdened industry and home buyers with the highest interest rates since records began. </PARA>
<PARA>That is Thatcherism; that is what the Leader of the Opposition wants for Australia. Nigel Healey went on:</PARA>
<PARA>At the end of the decade the inflation rate was at almost precisely the levels inherited by the Conservative Government in 1979. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on further:</PARA>
<PARA>Purchasing power of the pound shrank by more than half. </PARA>
<PARA>Those opposite cannot blame the external factors; they cannot say that Britain was knocked off its course by oil shocks. They cannot say it was undermined by militant unions. They have to admit that it failed because of the economic direction, the economic emphasis, that Thatcher imposed on that country--the same economic emphasis that the Leader of the Opposition wants to impose on Australia. He is calling on Australia to adopt the same policies. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we compare the period from the second quarter of 1979 through to the fourth quarter of 1988 with the two previous 9 1/2-year periods, we find that growth during the Thatcher period was distinctly lower than it was in the earlier two periods--even lower than in the 1950s. The growth of labour productivity--that is, the output per member of the employed work force--was lower than it was in the two previous periods of equal length. The only thing that did increase was labour productivity in manufacturing; yet statistics show that the growth rate of manufacturing production was still relatively low--less than one percentage point. </PARA>
<PARA>  Average export volume for the two previous 9 1/2-year periods was 40 per cent, but during the period of Thatcherism from 1979 to 1988 it was only 32 per cent. Export volumes did not significantly increase, but imports increased by 93 per cent. Yet Hewson tells this country, `We will turn it around'. When there was a deterioration in the balance of trade there was an attempt to mask it with the growth that took place in oil exports. It did not last long. The statistics expose a deterioration in the balance of manufactures. We also see that Britain under Thatcher was worse off than all the larger European countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we talk about unemployment--which the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) raised today--employment fell by two million people between 1979 and 1983. There was a rise of over two million in the unemployed between 1979 and 1986, and this finally went to three million unemployed. In 1989 unemployment was still one million higher than it was when Thatcher came to power. </PARA>
<PARA>  So where is the miracle of Thatcher? The Tories falsified the figures and they falsified private sector investment because they included in the figures the sales of public sector real estate instrumentalities. Ken Coutts and Wynne Godley, who are commentators, academics, summed the situation up. They said:</PARA>
<PARA>The performance of all the indicators has been poor, relative either to the past and to other countries or in many cases to both. </PARA>
<PARA>They said that improvement in productivity was confined to manufacturing; in contrast, productivity in the economy as a whole grew relatively slowly. John Wells of Cambridge University summed it up when he said that under Thatcher Britain had a trade deficit as large as any in her history. There was accelerating inflation. He said that Britain experienced the most severe output recession since the Second World War--with two consecutive years of substantial reductions in GDP. He also made the point that unemployment blew out to over three million. He said that the British manufacturing industry suffered more than at any other time, even during the Great Depression of the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA>  What do we find? Thatcher had to turn it around. She had to change track in 1983--almost with a complete U-turn--which led to mounting trade deficits and accelerated inflation. Clearly, there was no economic miracle under Thatcher--the Thatcher policies that Hewson now wants to place on Australia. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2K4">Mr WRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Let us talk about Australia. The Bulletin article is the document that those on the shadow front bench have espoused as the blueprint. Let us take some of the proposals. If we look at the contributions from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the Leader of the Opposition and others, we see that all wages will have to be negotiated at enterprise levels. In other words, we will get back to hands full of threepences. We will get back to a situation like one we have in Rockhampton at the moment. A hotelier employed two girls--twins--but paid them one wage. The same fellow got a person to wait two hours before he was paid; that is called stand-by under the system that those opposite want to pursue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  How could the members of the National Party support the privatisation of postal services? It will mean that people outside the metropolitan areas will have a skyrocketing increase in the costs of postal services. At the moment, as we can appreciate, the cost of postal services in country areas is offset by the profits made in the capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition wants to force people to take out private medical insurance. There will be a fire sale of government property. The Opposition wants a war with the trade union movement. We know how irresponsible that is and the calamity it will cause. To use the words of the Bulletin, the Opposition wants to `sack tens of thousands of public servants'. Yet the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) talked about the poor people who have suffered under the Labor Party Government. Of course the Government is concerned about unemployment. The Opposition wants to sack tens of thousands of public servants. </PARA>
<PARA>  As for new taxes, the Opposition does not only talk about a goods and services tax. There is something interesting about a goods and services tax that those opposite have not admitted yet--that is, all the countries that have a goods and services tax usually have a linked welfare tax. That is what is done. All of the nations that have introduced a goods and services tax also impose on their people a welfare tax. Up to 23 per cent of all revenue gained by European countries comes from the welfare tax, where people pay for their own social security benefits. If the Opposition is going to have a goods and services tax it should come clean and talk about the other taxes that go with it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at some of the Opposition members. The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) wants to get rid of consumer protection. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) wants to sell off Telecom in 10 per cent sections. He wants to remove the cross-media ownership restrictions, in other words, allow the monopoly of the media by a few. He wants to slash the ABC funding. I can understand it if he wants to have a go at AM, because it has a biased approach. It starts off with its presenter saying what the Government said, and then it has a member of the Opposition commenting on what the Government said. It is a very clear but subtle way of being very biased when it suits it.</PARA>
<PARA>  If members of the Opposition want to have a go at someone else, they should have a go at the Australian for its bias and bitterness. When the interest rates dropped it carried a headline `Labor turmoil on rates, Medicare'. Any other newspaper, such as the Morning Bulletin, says `Business greets interest rate cut' or words to that effect. If he wants to have a go at those sorts of newspapers, I do not mind; but let him come back to fairness. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) wants open slather mining and enrichment of uranium. He wants to throw out the environmental impact assessments. The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) is going to destroy equality in education. He wants teachers to be locally employed, so the poor areas will suffer. If people are rich, that is great; they will get by. What else does he want to do?</PARA>
<PARA>  I heard the honourable member for Mallee talk about universities before. He wants to reintroduce tertiary fees for everybody. I do not like the idea of students having to pay $2,000, but under the scheme of the honourable member for Goldstein they will be paying $10,000 up front. People will have to buy their way into university--again a preference for the rich. </PARA>
<PARA>  The shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), wants to dump hospital funding on the States. Senator Richard Alston, the shadow Minister for social security, child-care and retirement incomes, is going to slash sickness benefits and invalid pensions and, he says, save several hundred million dollars with a tough new medical test. I believe that is an attack on the integrity of doctors who at this moment assess whether a person should be on an invalid pension or sickness benefits. He is saying that we should have these tougher tests and save several hundred million dollars. People will not get unemployment benefits after they have been unemployed for nine months. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition wants to wipe out the superannuation arrangements. An amount of $3.6 billion in concessional tax has been provided by this Government to superannuants, and the Opposition wants to wipe out the superannuation scheme. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) is talking about taking out insurance to cover nursing home care. Again, this is the sort of thing I am talking about: welfare taxes. It is in the Opposition's blueprint. It is insurance to cover nursing home care. At the moment this Government subsidises nursing home care. It subsidises hostel care. </PARA>

Under a Hewson government the Liberal-Nationals--let the women of Australia hear this--would make women wait until 65 years of age to be eligible for the pension. The Opposition has kept it quiet until now. We are going to make sure that everybody knows about it. Women have to be 65 before they receive the pension. That is the only time that the Opposition mentions women. There is not another word about women in this whole policy. It does not care about them; it has nothing for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Senator Michael Baume wants to privatise welfare. The honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock)--he probably will not be here after the redistribution--is attacking immigration. He wants to get rid of family reunions. He does not believe that immigrants who settle here ought to have some way of bringing their family out. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) wants to sell off Qantas completely. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) wants no protection for manufacturers or rural production unless dumping can be proved. Senator Warwick Parer is the one who gets the prize for the biggest furphy. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), has just come into the chamber. But Senator Parer has to get the prize, because in this document he talks about saving $600m by abolishing the Department of Local Government. The total allocation for that Department in one year is $3m. This smart man--the man who represents the Opposition in this field--says that he will save $600m by doing away with the Local Government Department--and its total allocation is $3m. </PARA>
<PARA>  Clearly we have an Opposition that does not have alternatives, except those that want to tear at the very fabric of the Australian society. It is attacking not only the poor and the disadvantaged, as the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission has said, with its goods and services tax, but it is attacking middle Australia as well. It is going to take away the top levels of tax and impact on them with an across the board tax on goods and services, and a welfare tax because, as I said, they normally go hand in hand. The alternatives being proposed by the Hewson extremists will devastate the quality of life and the purchasing power of the majority of Australians. </PARA>

No Australian pays tax unless he or she earns over $5,400. For a pensioner it is now over $9,000 a year. The Opposition's highest tax rate was 60 per cent; ours is 47 per cent. Its lowest tax rate was 30 per cent; ours is 21 per cent, with the Medicare levy. The Opposition has the audacity to say that it will look after the people of Australia. We know what it is about. We know that it is about looking after the rich and the advantaged. Its goods and services tax says just that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In December 1944, on the foundation of the Liberal Party, Robert Gordon Menzies, after whom my electorate was named, declared:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>What we must look for is a true revival of liberal thought that will work for social justice and security, for national power and progress and for full development of the individual citizen, though not through the dull and deadening process of socialism. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia's present social and economic woes owe much to the dead hand of socialism, which stifles individualism and withers enterprise in this country at its roots. Rampant unionism hinders the vaunted but little recognised and little realised micro-economic reform in this nation and continues to keep our economy uncompetitive with its wasteful work practices. A plethora of taxes, including a tax on employment itself, punishes anyone in this country who is foolhardy enough to invest the capital and to work around the clock. People such as that are the people who employ over half the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government has nailed compassion to its masthead. We know that the Labor Government cares about the underprivileged. Perhaps that is why it spends all its time creating more of them. This Government likes to talk about the help it gives to low income families, but under this Labor Administration the great mass of Australian people who are responsible for creating the wealth of this nation have suffered a decrease in their living standards. Real after-tax earnings for average workers have fallen by 6.7 per cent between 1985 and 1990. Research by the Parliamentary Library puts total income decline for the four years 1985 to 1989 at around 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) feigns concern for the Australian people. Where was that concern when the Budget was being framed? This caring and compassionate Labor Government boasts of the increase in employment it presided over until the recession that we `had to have'. But this increase was largely due to the number of women in the work force, and the second wage only served to mask a real decrease in living standards. Women went back to work because they had to, because their husbands could no longer provide for them and support a family on a single wage because of the rise and hike in interest rates up to 18, 19 and 20 per cent that we saw. A major study commissioned by Family Circle magazine and published in May of this year found that 86 per cent of working mothers work because of financial pressures on the family, not because they want to. </PARA>
<PARA>  And what of that other jewel in the crown of the Labor Government, the beautiful set of figures represented by previous Budget surpluses? This, too, proved to be only paste. Much of this was money that was clawed back from ordinary Australians. Total taxation on individuals has more than doubled, from $23 billion in 1982-83 to almost $51 billion in 1989-90--largely due to inflation. This has pushed ordinary workers into even higher tax brackets. Average Australians now face a marginal tax rate of nearly 40c in the dollar, compared with 30c when Messrs Hawke and Keating came to power. Worse, changes to taxes and benefits have left average middle income families worse off. </PARA>
<PARA>  For instance, a single income family with two children earning $22,000, even after an increase in income in line with the CPI and despite Federal tax cuts and the family package, was $226 a year worse off. A double income family with two children earning $42,500 was $409 worse off. But a double income family with no children earning $75,000 received an extra $891 a year, almost as much as the amount provided to a single mother with two children on welfare benefits, who got an extra $899 a year. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under this Government top income earners have seen a drop in the top tax rate from 60c in the dollar to 49c, in July 1987. On 1 January 1990 the marginal tax rate on incomes over $50,000 fell from 49 per cent to 47 per cent. But the very rich, in fact, do not even pay those rates, as they receive a large proportion of the tax reductions, rebates and credits that are paid out in Australia, mostly because of the dividend imputation scheme introduced by the present Federal Government. This reduces the average millionaire's tax rate on net income to just over 26 per cent, the same rate as that paid by someone earning between $30,000 and $50,000. So people with net incomes of $500,000 or more are paying less tax than ordinary Australians earning $30,000 to $50,000. So much for the level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA>  But this Government is apparently a caring and compassionate government--it must be because it tells us it is so often. The Prime Minister is a compassionate man. We have seen him shed a manly tear or two. Who are we to say that those are the tears usually ascribed to the reptilian inhabitants of Kakadu? Let us remember how the great Russian writer Tolstoy described the difference between sentimentality and sentiment. Tolstoy said that sentimentality was what the aristocratic lady demonstrated when she cried over a sad story in her box at the opera while her coachman shivered in the snow outside. If anyone wants to shed tears, prepare to shed them now--not just for one family but for the hundreds of thousands of Australian families who are shivering in this economic depression brought on by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  This caring and compassionate Labor Government has thoughtfully furnished us with the bloody entrails with which we may read the portents of the future, like the ancient seers. The signs of human anguish are all around us in the hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of people queuing for jobs advertised, in the `For sale' signs out in the suburban heartland as once-secure middle income families now give up on their dream of home ownership, in the empty business premises on the High Streets and in the shopping centres of our towns and cities, and in the pages and pages of advertisements for sales of capital equipment. The machinery of Australia is rusting or being sold off, often to overseas buyers. </PARA>
<PARA>  The real human tragedy is unquantifiable but nonetheless real for being so. For the past 10 years my wife, Margaret, and I have worked in marriage education and we have seen at first-hand how financial stress causes marriages to fall apart under extreme pressure. Some people have even committed suicide in this depression that we `had to have', feeling that the struggle was so unequal that they could not go on. There never was a level playing field, and it has become even more deeply corrugated under this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us pause for a moment and think about the more than 160,000 Australian families whose breadwinner is out of work. In July, 801,700 people were actively looking for work but still unemployed. Most are in the prime of their working life and aged between 25 and 54. Almost half are married. In one in four families in Australia there is someone who has no job. In other words, in 188,000 Australian families no-one has a job. Between them, those families have more than 175,000 children under the age of 14 living in homes where no-one has a job. The increase in the number of unemployed has been by far the greatest--50 per cent--in the group of people who are typically breadwinners. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unemployment amongst teenagers has increased by 23 per cent, and amongst people over 55 by 35 per cent. Virtually the entire increase in unemployment this year has been in the medium to long term unemployment categories. What of the many thousands every month or so who give up looking for work and cease to be registered as unemployed? In July alone, 44,000 Australians gave up looking for work. Who can blame them when the only jobs that they see at the local CES office seem to be along the lines of `Clerk, able to speak German, Cantonese and Indonesian', as I saw recently?</PARA>
<PARA>  Let us also pause to reflect on the bankruptcies brought about by the economic climate engineered by this Government that has been wont to tell us that it has been pulling all the right levers. The truth is that we are now in free fall with only the shreds of a parachute. This Government likes to hark back to the Fraser Government. During its term of office there were 30,945 bankruptcies, or an average of 3,868 per year. During the unholy alliance of Mr Hawke and Mr Keating, and now Mr Kerin, there have been 60,089 bankruptcies, or 7,511 per year. That means that bankruptcies have doubled and in the Labor States of Victoria and Western Australia the increase is 70 per cent or more. This is the fruit of high taxes, high interest rates and a program of disincentives for business and personal endeavour. Yet there will be no wealth to distribute if the wealth creators are tied and bound. That is the predicament that Australia is in today. </PARA>
<PARA>  Faced with these problems, what response do we see from the Government? We see not solutions but slogans, which have replaced ideas. For example, `No child is to live in poverty'; we are to be the `clever country'; we were going to have a `soft landing'; now it is the recession we `had to have'. Also, `There can't be gain without pain'. There is nothing the matter with rhetoric; it is just that in this case it is not supported by any action. The latest slogan is `better cities'. This is the neutron bomb approach to social planning-- destroy the people but leave the cities standing. In this country, government has been reduced to a matter of style. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Speaker, may I thank you, the Clerk and the other officers of the House for the warm welcome that I was given on my arrival here. I knew that my time would be interesting when the Clerk informed me that I had been seated next to the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). However, it has been depressing not to find the clash of great ideas in this Parliament at such a time of national crisis. Instead, we see the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) who, like the murderous Macbeth, displays `vaulting ambition which o'erleaps itself and falls on th'other'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Meanwhile, the real issues that the Australian people want addressed are ignored or compromised in the internal squabbles of this moribund Government. Yet, now more than ever there is a time, there is a need for good parliamentarians--not party pooches as we see every day in Question Time, who mouth dorothy dixers at the appointed time from their so-called leaders. Edmund Burke once described a good parliamentarian as one who is responsive to his electorate and able to employ his judgment and his skills for the benefit of his constituents. I will try to follow the example of the former honourable member for Menzies, Neil Brown, who used his judgment and skills to serve not just the constituents of Menzies but the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I drive a Ford Falcon, which will indicate the breadth and diversity of the Liberal Party, which can encompass both Ferraris and Ford Falcons. A barrister by trade, I come from the great middle sector of Australia. My father ran a small trucking business and a small mixed farm in Gippsland. My mother, who, I am proud to say, is here today, carried on this work for 15 years after my father's death, often rising at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m to transport stock to market. I learnt early of the need to work hard to succeed and that I could rely on no-one but myself. </PARA>
<PARA>  It would be tempting to believe that we are all equal and we all should receive the same portion of the cake, but that is a sure recipe for diminishing the cake. For all their socialist talk, Labor's Batman and Robin managed to rob the middle income earners to give to the rich. In 1983 the top one per cent of taxpayers earned as much as the bottom 11 per cent. By 1989 the top one per cent earned as much as the bottom 21 per cent. This is what the distribution of wealth is all about. This is the social justice that we hear so much of. </PARA>
<PARA>  Much of my experience at the Bar was in general civil litigation. No-one could practise in the civil courts in recent years without appreciating the economic plight of so many in this country. In 1987 I represented grain handlers before the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport. We demonstrated then the gross inefficiency of the transport infrastructure, dominated as it was by union and bureaucratic interests. Yet, five years later, real micro-economic reforms have not been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second area in which I practised involved appeals by veterans against decisions of the Repatriation Commission. These people, now old and often disabled, gave the best years of their lives, often in disease- infested jungles. They prompted in me an appreciation of the sacrifices necessary to ensure the security of our great country from foreign aggression and to reflect upon the importance of our location on the rim of Asia. In 1989-90, approximately 36 per cent of all imports to this country were from Asia and some 56 per cent of exports were to Asia. Our opposition to the trading blocs in Europe and North America and other restrictions on free trade must continue, but we need to better utilise the opportunities presented to us in our own region. </PARA>
<PARA>  My major interest in recent years has been in health law and bioethics, which include areas of national concern. Of bioethics I will only say now that I regret that the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) has apparently ignored wider community concerns by establishing exclusively within the scientific community a new Australian Health Ethics Committee with some of the same personnel from the widely discredited National Bioethics Consultative Committee. Appropriate regulation in sensitive and complex areas such as reproductive technology requires a system which is accountable and inspires public confidence. The current proposal will achieve neither. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second matter is the appropriate funding of health and the question of how we allot priorities within those services. There is almost a $10 billion shortfall between the funding raised by the Medicare levy and the amount that is spent on Medicare. The current national health strategy is clouded by the usual pie in the sky socialist ideology which fails to ask the vital questions. What are the limits of our health care resources? What are the priorities of the current allocation and what are the principles and processes by which those priorities are to be determined?</PARA>
<PARA>  Justice has to be more than glib sloganeering about universal coverage and equity. For far too long, we on this side of the House have allowed spurious claims of compassion from the Government to pass unchallenged. Almost a million Australians are unable to support themselves with the work that is their right, and the compassionate and caring Labor Government tells us that this is inevitable and will go on for years to come. This is the compassion that a charisma driven government, hell-bent on clinging to power, offers. But people must come before ideology. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Liberal Party is not hamstrung by a big brother centralist ideology but orients itself around the needs of the individual and the family. It is guided by a pragmatic ideal which Robert Menzies spelt out in April 1939, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Internally my theme is justice. I declare my political creed here and now. It is that the essential end of government is not power or glory, but the good life for ordinary men and women. The ordinary man, as I know him, asks for a happy life, not a complaining one; for a full life and not an idle one. We must have industrial justice and social justice, industrial security and social security. </PARA>
<PARA>We can create an atmosphere in which social justice can flourish by encouraging the wealth creators, the great Australian middle class, so that we can best support the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. When Count Dracula arises to take over the leadership of this caring and compassionate Labor Party, let us not be taken in by more crocodile talk of equity and social justice achieved. Let us judge the caring and compassionate Labor Administration by all its pomps and deeds. By them this Government must be known. The real--not fictional--social justice that a coalition government offers will be the stake to impale this Transylvanian team. In the meantime, let us mourn their victims, the Australian people--and this, the 1991 Budget, will be their epitaph. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --Firstly, I congratulate the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) on his maiden speech. Anyone who follows his speech will be a pale resemblance of a speaker. The Opposition supports the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill. However, it should not surprise the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) if we take this opportunity to debate matters of far-reaching consequence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I thank the Minister for his cooperation in being available when this matter is being discussed and for offering representations from the Department. I hope that will be an example to other Ministers. This Bill deals with an exemption for people with disabilities. For a long time justice has been denied to many people with disabilities. Justice denied is something that all parties are keen to redress. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill is the result of a report tabled by the Industry Commission on 18 July 1990, Aids and Appliances for People with Disabilities. Some of the recommendations contained within the 230 pages of this report have been implemented. The Bill implements some recommendations in various forms, but there are still quite a deal to go and some are still awaiting implementation.</PARA>
<PARA>  In his second reading speech, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>These measures demonstrate the Government's concern that the taxation treatment of goods for use by people with disabilities be both equitable and responsible. </PARA>
<PARA>We happen to agree with that, and in connection with disabilities--I will say it once again--I believe these measures should be bipartisan and non-political because they relate to people who deserve every assistance so they can share in the benefits that our society offers. These measures, as I said, demonstrate the Government's concern arising from the report and certainly we share that concern. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to deal here with delayed justice as it specifically impacts upon disabilities. For nearly two years the Opposition has attempted to amend the Disabilities Services Act, not only to deal with these specific concerns but also to deal with other major concerns that we have as to factors which prevent a free flow of encouragement to people with disabilities thereby curtailing their full participation in this life. We have laid this private member's Bill on the table because people with disabilities, carers and parents must be able to plan more positively for their future and not suffer any further distress than is absolutely necessary. The sales tax amendments will help in this regard to a large extent. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the amendments that we have proposed, we took the novel approach of suggesting that the principles and guidelines under the Act, which are at the moment in the hands of the Department for implementation, should come before this Parliament. We have made this suggestion so that all parliamentarians can reassert and reaffirm their commitment to disabled people through the principles and guidelines that will come before us. We suggest, as a novel approach, that there should be an appeals procedure--novel in the case of the Disabilities Services Act, because it is apparent in every other Act that there is an appeals procedure. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have suggested the extension of the transition date from 1992 because we fear that Treasury would not be prepared to provide sufficient funds to allow that transition date to come and go, without some very harsh adjustments, particularly in the sheltered workshop area. We have suggested that there should be secure funding and, particularly, we have suggested that workshops should be an approved service. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the disabilities area, where this sales tax relief was only one of the positives in the Budget, there has been concern expressed by many of the disabilities organisations. As I say, sales tax relief was one positive. I have noticed the dismay that resulted from the indexation factor for the block grants to voluntary services such as the Royal Blind Society, the Endeavour Foundation and the Australian Quadriplegic Association, which had been reduced by the Department of Finance from the 3.5 per cent, estimated and communicated to agencies in June 1991, to 1.5 per cent. This was the flow-on effect from the Budget but, in fact, owing to an administrative decision by the bureaucracy, it will mean a loss of some $60,000 to $90,000 this year for the larger organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Organisations are told a likely indexation amount in June, and this is confirmed after the Budget is brought down. The 3.5 per cent was, in fact, an overestimate and the actual estimate for 1991-92 is 2.8 per cent. However, because the Department of Finance overestimated last year by 1.3 per cent, it has taken that off the 2.8 per cent to give 1.5 per cent. This is a gross example of government again changing the goal posts without telling the players. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is also regarded within the industry that any benefit that will result from this $3m cost to Government for the sales tax exemption could be a drawback or a clawback by government of those amounts by reducing this indexation. As a result of this, many voluntary agencies--and I stress the word `voluntary' because we must always support and encourage voluntary agencies, who are already struggling with extra demand and too few resources--have been left with another unexpected big shortfall to make up. I just wanted to address those few matters of concern within the disability areas that this Bill rectifies only in part. </PARA>
<PARA>  The elements of the package are clearly demonstrated within the Minister's second reading speech and also in the explanatory memoranda. The Bill will give effect to the Budget announcements on changes to sales tax exemptions for people with disabilities. In particular, it will extend the current exemption on goods used to modify motor vehicles, to adapt them for driving by disabled persons, to include vehicles used to transport such persons. It also makes it easier to establish eligibility for exemption in relation to goods designed and manufactured expressly for invalid persons. It places a cap on the maximum sales tax benefit applicable to new motor vehicles for use by certain Defence Force veterans and other persons with specific disabilities. The consequence is that, on the luxury car threshold, sales tax exemption will continue to apply up to a retail value of $45,462, but sales tax will be payable at the luxury car rate of 30 per cent on any amount above that threshold. </PARA>
<PARA>  The exemption will be made available for such items as a general purpose tailgate, loader or hoist stored in the rear or the side of the second-hand passenger van solely to allow access for a passenger in a wheelchair. Similarly, heavy duty springs and material used to reinforce the floor of the van because of the additional weight would be exempt, and clamps and brackets fitted to the vehicle to hold the wheelchair in place would also be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA>  The issue we raise in connection with this is that, as well-meaning as the intentions of the Industry Commission and the Government would be, there comes a time when it must be realised that some of the vehicles required for the transport of people with disabilities could quite easily exceed that retail value for luxury cars, and I wish to mention one. There are quite a lot of four-wheel drives on the road today--and I am talking about four-wheel drives in particular--that may be necessary to do the conveyancing required for a person, particularly when one considers the hoist and everything else that goes with it. So I would suggest to the Minister that his Department might look at this, not only in relation to a four-wheel drive but also in relation to the need for a heavier vehicle that is going to be classed as a luxury vehicle and not be eligible for the reduction or the exemption as suggested. </PARA>
<PARA>  We note the defect in the taxation legislation as it stands at the moment in respect of wholesale sales tax. We also recognise its complications in arriving at an answer just in this respect, because if we consider the time consumed on the report, the legislation itself, the altering of the exemptions and the manner in which the exemption will be available, we realise that it is a rather complicated piece of legislative machinery. To emphasise that, we will be agreeing to the Minister's amendment, but it is yet another complication of the system that makes it necessary for the Government to re-think the legislation and to introduce another amendment to prevent some abuse of the system later on. </PARA>
<PARA>  One has to ask the question: should any tax be as complicated as that in the Sales Tax Act? There are difficulties in connection with the implementation of a tax that has three rates and exemptions. One might say it is unwieldy, unmanageable and unintelligible, but mainly, critically, I think it is unfair in the manner in which it impacts on people. The sales tax does have that difficulty and I think we ought to bear that in mind. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remember that during my years in public accounting, where we dealt particularly with income tax matters, very few people were regarded as specialists in the sales tax areas. In fact, by the time we took each State and central office, it was estimated that there were about 10 people who really understood the Sales Tax Act, and they were the people who were implementing it. It was not an Act that could be generally understood. As a result of the Sales Tax Act, we were certain that there would always be volumes of paper necessary, whether by legislation, regulation, in the schedules or the exemptions, the certification, the substantiation or in the inspections. Finally, if all those things were not in place, there would be the penalties at the end of it. </PARA>
<PARA>   If we look at the Budget Estimates and the reality of the Budget over the last decade, from 1981-82 to 1991-92, it is interesting to see the size of the increase in the wholesale sales tax. In 1981-82 the sales tax figure was $2,854m. In the Estimates for 1991-92 it was $9,237m. By the end of the decade it had increased to almost four times the amount it was at the beginning of the decade. The fact that these types of adjustments can be made at a time when the consumer is paying the tax and does not really appreciate that it is there highlights the hidden nature of this tax. Over the decade from 1981-82 to 1991-92 the tax has had an influence on inflation and has impacted on the economy in many other undesirable ways. </PARA>
<PARA>   In the last few years, it has been interesting to see the diminution in the sales tax brought about by the `recession we had to have'. In 1989-90, it was $10 billion. This was about the estimate for 1990-91, but it reduced to $9.365 billion, and this year it is less still. That stands in testimony to the `recession we had to have'. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no doubt about it: the wholesale sales tax is a hidden tax. I want to give just one example of the anomalies that are already in the system, and that concerns the component of sales tax on freight. For 15 years I have had complaints about wholesale sales tax from people such as cordial and soft drink manufacturers out of the major capital centres, because a big component of their manufacturing cost was freight, and that freight was taxed on the final product at the door of the manufacturer. They had to manufacture soft drinks with an impost against which there was no relief. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is another aspect. If a country town or a provincial centre had the benefit of having a wholesaler in the area, it meant that that was the last point of contact, and the sales tax would be applied on the freight component from the manufacturer to the wholesaler. So there is a hidden tax--not only a hidden tax, but a hidden cost to business. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the debate on Building a Competitive Australia , the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), suggested that $200m on business inputs from the goods and services tax would be eliminated or exempted. Where is that legislation? Over the last two days in Question Time, we have seen a great rush of knowledge on the subject by the current Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), but he does miss the point. He talks in terms of $200m coming off business inputs, whereas it is recognised around Australia that of that $9 billion to $10 billion collection each year $4 billion is an input to the costs of business and $1 billion is an impost on our exports. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy particularly should realise the disadvantage that our exporters suffer through that extra $1 billion impost; it places us in an unfavourable position with other exporters who do not suffer the impost. In particular, the exports of the European Community are free of any goods and services tax, or VAT as it is at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Worse than that, this impacts on our trade deficit. For 1991-92 we will still trade with a deficit of $14 billion, which will only increase our net foreign debt by that amount over the next 12 months. Our gross foreign debt currently stands at $170 billion. A lot of that is related to the fact that we export our dollars as a cost, and that tells against us in balance of trade and foreign debt figures. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no doubt about it: there is a current impost on business and employers; and there is also a current impost on lower income families and household goods in the form of the wholesale sales tax. Today the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) made the point that the wholesale sales tax is not a consumer tax. He is drawing a fine line by saying that it is a wholesale tax imposed at that point but is not a retail tax. The Treasurer should brush up on his economics, because there is no way in the wide world that he can claim it is not a consumer tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We were talking about a consumption tax. It is a consumption tax. As far as the imposition of a 20 per cent sales tax is concerned, who is the consumer of a commercial motor vehicle, a truck or a panel van; who is the consumer where an ambulance is concerned; who is the consumer of a four-wheel drive, prime mover or semi- trailer? I notice there is a 20 per cent sales tax on hearses. I am not sure who the consumer would be there, but I think it would be the next of kin. It is all related to the fact that down the line somebody is consuming the service or the goods that are being purchased under this sales tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Let us look at a business buying business equipment--office equipment, advertising material, photocopiers. All those types of things have a 20 per cent sales tax built into their prices; obviously that is then passed on as a cost of the business to the person who buys the final product or the final service. Business certainly is part of it.  Let us look at stationery. Every time somebody picks up a writing pad, an envelope, a school exercise book or any paper like that, there is a tax in itself on the business, a tax on education, a tax on anybody who wants to use that writing equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us see who is the consumer in another range of 10 per cent sales taxes. I think it has been evidenced already. Within the last two months, through one of our supermarket stores, the impost on the final consumption price of a normal week's delivery of groceries has been calculated. I think the load was priced at $145, and the wholesale sales tax content amounted to about $13, which would be a 10 per cent on-flow on these goods as far as a GST would be concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>  One has to wonder whether these goods are necessities of life or are required for the livelihood of the family, particularly as they have the 10 per cent sales tax built in. I just want to mention some of them. There were biscuits--not cooked in the oven as they used to be years ago, as granny used to do; biscuits are now bought from the supermarket. There were ice-creams and ice blocks--not really a necessity of life, but getting fairly close to it for some people. There was fruit juice and fruit juice products. We are told we should be buying pure fruit juice and the result of that is that we get taxed 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  We would want to encourage the drinking of non-alcoholic wines and beverages. Guess what that takes? A 10 per cent tax. What about flavoured milk--flavoured instant milk powder? The home wares that are required in a house--the furniture, the floor coverings, the blinds, the screen doors--all attract a rate of sales tax of 10 per cent. Of course, if one looks carefully, there is a consumption factor in that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have tried to indicate that there is an impost on business--it has been estimated to be $4 billion--and there is also a current impost on lower income families and household goods. At this stage, I move an in- principle amendment to the motion for the second reading of this Bill in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>  That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>  `whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its ramshackle and inefficient wholesale sales tax system, and its failure to replace it with a fairer, broad-based goods and services tax'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is interesting to see who have been the supporters of a goods and services tax over a period of years. I could mention none more notable than the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland I understand that in his own way, before the ACTU entered the field, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was a grand advocate for an expanded consumption tax. He is also the man who has given us some other grand promises in his term as Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was the one who said there would be no capital gains tax; the man who said there would be no child living in poverty after 1990; and the man who said at the last election that there would be no increase in the Medicare levy. It will be interesting to see whether he realises the trifecta.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The assumptions made by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in the last two days show an abysmal lack of knowledge of how business in this country runs, particularly primary industries. Yesterday the Primary Industries Minister mentioned that the farmers were worried about the enormous amount of paperwork that would be required. The Minister obviously does not realise that over the past four to five years there has been a substantial change in the income tax requirements. Every business and every taxpayer who claims a deduction now requires substantiation on paper. So the paperwork is already being done. A goods and services tax does not add to that burden; it uses the substantiation that is required at the moment. The only additional paperwork that would be required is a separate identification of the goods and services tax paid on inputs. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I mentioned before, there is a tremendous sales tax component in the freight and carrying industry. There will be relief given for off-farm fuel. In conjunction with the GST change, that will reduce substantially the cost of transport around Australia. For those people who say there is a tremendous inflationary impact built into a GST, we could say also that the current wholesale sales tax already assumes the equivalent of a 6.5 per cent GST. That is already built in through the hidden charges. Again, examples have been given in connection with New Zealand. The Government has been levelling complaints against the mismanagement of the New Zealand economy, but that was at the hands of Mr Lange's Labor Government. It was Mr Lange who created the recession and Mr Lange who created the unemployment and the high interest rates. This, of course, has been matched by those people currently governing Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to read into the record comments that have been made by some great authorities on this subject. These first comments were made between 4 June 1985 and 14 August 1985. They were attributed to the former Treasurer of this Parliament, the honourable member for Blaxland, and show what a great advocate we have for this goods and services tax. The comments start:</PARA>
<PARA>That means we are back to taxing income and taxing income alone. It is now time to take a more fundamental approach. It is time to establish a broader tax base with greater integrity, allowing the fairer sharing of the tax burden with lower rates of tax. To do something substantial about the marginal rates and about the average rates, to really cut the dependence on income tax. And to give us the prospect of indexing the system in perpetuity, you really need a consumption tax. It taxes income which is evaded and avoided, income which may never have been brought to tax under the income tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that. There is $20 billion worth of untaxed income around Australia, and the goods and services tax would be able to cover that. If we want to know the success of that type of operation, we only have to go to Italy, which was able to increase its gross domestic product sufficiently to top Britain as the fourth most prosperous nation in the European Community. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>It taxes that and produces a fiscal dividend. To the extent that the consumption tax taxes people on low incomes, we give it back in other compensation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>So he mentions compensation. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Let me say that if I believed that the proposed switch to a consumption tax would have dire consequences, I would not have a bar of it. </PARA>
<PARA>But here he was, proposing it. He mentions the three main advantages of the tax:</PARA>
<PARA>First, it will allow a more rational indirect tax system than the current anomaly-ridden wholesale tax, which has multiple rates, numerous exemptions and fails to tax the service sector. </PARA>
<PARA>Precisely what I was saying a little while ago. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Second, it will enable us to generate tax revenues to provide for a major reduction in the marginal rates of income tax. No other tax has the same potential for this purpose. Third, it generates tax from those who will continue to evade or avoid income tax and that provides a useful net dividend for distribution to the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>A few moments ago the honourable member for Menzies mentioned that, particularly in regard to taxing tax avoiders, and of course this is confirmed by the ex-Treasurer himself. His comments go on:</PARA>
<PARA>And earnings from this system, from assessing that black economy, will provide net income for the gentleman driving the tram. It will also put some extra deeners in the pocket of the bloke willing to get off his backside and earn a few extra bucks. People today get their tax taken each week out of their paypacket before it goes into their pocket. In other words, they pay their marginal rate and then they trot off to the shop to buy their necessities. You'd still go and buy your necessities, but you would buy it out of your relieved taxable income. In other words, it's just another way of collecting the tax, but we are not going to be collecting as much. </PARA>
<PARA>Again he considers that there can be a reduction in the amount of tax collected. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The great value of a tax of this kind in terms of its efficiency will be its simplicity. There would be no exemption of the so-called necessities of life. </PARA>
<PARA>That is interesting. In 1985 the Treasurer of this country was saying that there would be no exemptions for the so-called necessities of life. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I would argue that if this tax were to be contemplated with exemptions in significant areas, that would make it complex and administratively costly and would substantially delay its implementation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is interesting. I presume that the gentlemen in the advisers box know all about wholesale tax--however, if they do, they are of the very few people who do. I have mentioned only a few of those things, but I want to attribute them to the ex-Treasurer of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1991 relates to a range of wholesale sales tax measures which assist persons with disabilities. But the Opposition, always ready to take an opportunity, has moved a second reading amendment which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>  "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its ramshackle and inefficient wholesale sales tax system, and its failure to replace it with a fairer, broad-based goods and services tax". </PARA>
<PARA>Who is the Opposition trying to help? Through this legislation we are trying to help the disabled. These are the people who are very often on low incomes and spend much of their income on bread, milk, vegetables and clothing--all the things that the Opposition is intending to tax through its goods and services tax, which it calls fairer. People buy not just biscuits, ice cream and juice poppers--which the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) was talking about before and which have a sales tax on them--but a wide range of essential items that they all need. Of course, it means that nine times the number of businesses will be collecting the tax than collect it now. </PARA>
<PARA>  A number of retailers have told me of the effect that a broad-based goods and services tax would have on people in country areas and people who are not in the best position economically, such as disabled people. One retailer told me that as the owner of a convenience store he knew that his customers would be paying $1.50 more on a $30 parcel of groceries than they would pay in a supermarket in a city. One retailer complained to me about his experiences in New Zealand. He told me that there would be far more paperwork for retailers and that they would have to complete returns. This is done monthly in some countries. Other retailers have told me that there would be far more opportunity for abuse by businesses, as operators may just put money in their pockets. </PARA>
<PARA>  In New Zealand after the first year of operation of a consumption tax there was 19 per cent inflation. In the Taxpayer of 13 July, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said that the effects of the consumer price index would be quantified and would be quarantined. Quantified and quarantined: how about that! What does he mean--that it will be ignored? It can mean only that. What is the good of that? In the Taxpayer the Leader Opposition said publicly that the elderly who are not pensioners would be difficult to compensate. They sure will be. The tax will include people on superannuation, and also disabled people--the people we are trying to help through this legislation. It will include people on workers' compensation, perhaps, or on insurance. They are going to be hurt and they will be just as difficult to compensate, as the Leader of the Opposition says they will be, as those who are retired and are not pensioners. They are all going to be hurt by a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  Yet here they are, calling it fairer and more efficient. It will certainly be far more ramshackle and inefficient than the present taxation and sales tax systems. It will force people into becoming tax collectors. Under the threat of penalty businesses will become tax collectors for the proposed goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is quite clear that disabled people will be hurt very much and not helped by the sorts of proposals mentioned in the amendment--just as they will be the worst hit by the other proposals of the Opposition, such as enterprise bargaining. In New Zealand now the minimum rate of pay for these people is $A4 an hour. In the United States a minimum of $A3 an hour can be offered. Who will be hurt? It is those very people we are helping now by assisting them to get full time work even though they are disabled. They will be the ones hit. The boss will say, `Look, Bill, I am sorry but I can only afford $4 an hour if I am to keep you. You know with your position you can't do as much as others, perhaps, and that is what I will have to pay you'. They are the people who will be hit. So there is no help whatsoever in the Opposition's proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reason for the legislation we are now considering is to assist disabled people. It will extend the sales tax exemption to goods used to modify a vehicle, new or used, for the transportation of a physically disabled pensioner or other passenger who is not a pensioner. Previously the exemption applied only to disabled drivers. Now it will apply to people who are buying a car principally for the use of transporting a disabled person. So it is going to be much easier for people, whatever their income--people who are retired, not retired, pensioners, non-pensioners--to obtain the tax exemption which is available. </PARA>
<PARA>  The legislation will also place a cap equivalent to the sales tax payable on a motor vehicle at the luxury motor vehicle threshold on the exemption for new motor vehicles available to veterans and for other people with certain physical disabilities. This will improve the equity of the exemption because the tax benefit for eligible purchase of luxury motor vehicles will be a maximum in 1991-92 of $6,100. In other words, a maximum tax exemption of $6,100 will be available and it will be indexed. </PARA>
<PARA>  These Budget measures are based largely on the recommendations of the Industry Commission report on aids and appliances for people with disabilities, but there has been some variation in detail and scope. For instance, the Industry Commission recommended exemption of computers for people with disabilities. We have found this difficult because the recommendation did not give us a well-targeted basis for a policy decision. In particular, it was felt by the Government that an assessment of the needs for computer equipment by people with disabilities was required before responsible and targeted policy decisions could be made. Consequently, the Government referred the issue to the disability task force for analysis by its working party on the costs of disability. This working party is due to report in time for consideration of the 1992-93 Budget. I hope we will then see some action to provide tax exemption for computers used as a communication aid for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is already an exemption under item 123 of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act for electronic communications equipment or components thereof which are expressly designed for persons with disabilities. For example, electronic devices which use speech synthesisers to convert text to speech and would assist a speech-impaired person to communicate with other people are exempt. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased to support the legislation and certainly oppose the amendment proposed by the Opposition, which condemns the Government for not introducing a broad-based goods and services tax. The very people it would hurt would be the disabled.(Quorum formed)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --I am glad to see my colleagues drawn to the House to listen to my contribution. Of course, the reason for the calling of the quorum was that the Opposition could not provide a speaker to this legislation. I think that indicates the lack of concern that Opposition members have shown for serious debate in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  What I would say about this legislation is that I have in front of me a media release from the Disabled Peoples International (Australia), the umbrella body for people with disabilities in this country. It is glowing in its praise of this legislation and the fact that the Government has taken this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>  The legislation follows on from the Industry Commission recommendations, and indeed in some respects is more generous than those recommendations. It allows for sales tax exemption for goods that are used to modify motor vehicles for the use of the disabled-- indeed for the transport of disabled people. This legislation allows the friends, relatives and families of disabled people to obtain sales tax exemption for the modification of their vehicles or for changing or improving their vehicles in some way to allow for the carriage of their disabled friends, relatives or family members. </PARA>
<PARA>  This legislation is thoughtful and constructive and will improve the quality of life of those people who care for the disabled in our community. It has been well thought out and considered, and I think it will improve the circumstances of the disabled in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry Commission report made recommendations that certain changes should be made in the area of sales tax on computer products, but the Government considers that it is not appropriate at this time to move on those initiatives. The belief is that we need to more accurately target the requirements of the disabled in this area. Indeed, the disabilities task force will be pursuing this matter, as was indicated by the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow), who spoke before me. </PARA>
<PARA>  The interesting thing about this debate as it broadly focuses on sales tax exemptions is that the Opposition moved an amendment, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its ramshackle and inefficient wholesale sales tax system, and its failure to replace it with a fairer, broad-based goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Opposition members have no shame. They are happy to come into this place and to talk about the goods and services tax that they are proposing, the proposal which was perhaps outlined in the Sydney Morning Herald today. It is not for us to know whether in fact it is the case, but certainly the outline that we would obtain from reading the Sydney Morning Herald suggested that they were proposing a goods and services tax on everything that moved of 22.5 per cent, and that will be underpinned by a flat rate of taxation at 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  One is staggered by the preposterous proposals of Opposition members. They come into this place after the suggestion has been put forward--and it is not refuted by them that that is the basic structure of their tax--that this wholesale sales tax for which we are providing exemption in this legislation is too complicated. What they are proposing is that every retailer in the country will become a tax collector. They are proposing perhaps a VAT. VAT has some sense to it, but imagine how complicated it is, because every line of the transaction will require the individuals to determine the value added amount that will represent the VAT tax component. </PARA>
<PARA>  One would find that that type of tax structure is an immensely complicated system in which all of those things that are presently untaxed, such as services and many of the necessities of life, will be taxed. Opposition members also say, `But presently you are taxing these items at 20 per cent'. One does not have to be top of the class in mathematics to understand what that means. If there is a wholesale sales tax on an item that has a wholesale price of $10, and the wholesale sales tax is 20 per cent, that is a tax of $2. However, on the retail price of $20, which one would assume reflects generally a 100 per cent mark-up, a 15 per cent wholesale sales tax would amount to $3. </PARA>
<PARA>  The suggestion that in some way the structure of tax that we have at the moment, which is much more broadly based and better targeted than when we came into government, is in fact more of an impost on consumers is absurd. When one considers all of those items which are presently exempted and which the Opposition are proposing to tax, one finds the consequences of its proposals mind-boggling. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has been said by many speakers on this side of the House that we have objections to the Opposition's broad-based consumption tax. The two principal objections that we have are that it is regressive and that it is unduly hard on those people who are on low and fixed incomes and those people who will not have the capacity to avoid the expenditures which we see as necessary and which are presently exempted from the wholesale sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>  On top of that we see this tax as inflationary. It is the case that the costs of this broad- based consumption tax will flow through into wages and will have an inflationary impact, just at a time when Australia has finally put behind it the high inflation of the last two decades. The Opposition needs to understand that it is an inappropriate time for such a tax to be introduced, because we are going to keep saying it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The point I want to make more than anything else in respect of this legislation, which I believe has the support of members on both sides of this House because we understand that by these exemptions those people who are disabled are appropriately eased of some of the burden that goes with their disability, is that the system of tax proposed by those opposite will be complicated. They come in here and suggest that the present system is unduly complicated. We recognise that there are problems with it, but for them to suggest that their system would not be complicated is misleading, dishonest and inaccurate. It is important for them to consider that, whatever the structure of their tax base will be. If it is to be a value added tax, a number of levels will have to be considered. In fact, every retailer in this country will have to be involved in the collection of that tax, and it is important for those opposite to consider that. But we are happy for them to continue to come in here and to push that barrow because it is a barrow that we find very attractive in a political sense. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those opposite may think in some perverse way that their proposing of a policy which is unpopular will be an indication of their sincerity and forthrightness. In a perverse way they may take that position. But what I am saying to them is that it is clear to us that, whilst we recognise the limitations of the present structure, the structure that those opposite propose will be incredibly regressive, inflationary and complicated. The benefits in respect of savings and efficiency that have been suggested by many of those who support the Opposition's position are yet to be proven. They have certainly yet to be proven by international experience. </PARA>
<PARA>  So we see ourselves in this debate as happily defending the present structure, with its imperfections, because the structure proposed by those opposite will be a political goldmine for us. I suggest to those opposite that they continue to come in here and tell us that the present structure is complicated, but they should not expect us not to tell the Australian population how complicated their proposal will be. </PARA>
<PARA>  This legislation, which was introduced by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), represents a breath of fresh air for the disabled community. It represents a fresh opportunity for them and it represents benefits to their families and friends and those who care for them, which is important. It is the sort of legislation that I am happy to support in this place because it will bring about a significant change for those people and for their lifestyles. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth)--not surprisingly, given his limitations in these matters--is happy to support the position taken by his Government circa 1991. But we did not hear much from him in 1985 when his leaders were advocating it with all the strength that they could muster. So what we have seen really is a change such as that we have witnessed in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics where the hard line lefties have been called conservatives. I suppose what we have seen tonight has been the honourable member for Perth adopting a classical conservative position, even though he is as left as they come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1991 makes a number of changes to various sales tax exemptions available to people with various disabilities. These changes were announced in the 1991- 92 Budget and largely follow the recommendations of the report of the Industry Commission on aids and appliances for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  The measures contained in this Bill are designed to remove a number of anomalies in the sales tax treatment of various goods and of motor vehicles designed for people with disabilities. These anomalies resulted in a number of inequities which the Opposition recognised and which were highlighted in the Industry Commission's report. </PARA>
<PARA>  The measures are welcome in themselves in that they improve the operation of a small area of what is, generally speaking, an extremely inefficient and discriminatory wholesale sales tax system. The Bill is only one of many sales tax Bills that under this Government we seem to pass inevitably each year in a vain effort to patch up the wholesale sales tax system and make it in some way responsive to changing circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>  The wholesale sales tax system is plagued with anomalies which our legislative efforts in this place each year do not even begin to address. It is appropriate to note that, in recommending these changes, the Industry Commission drew attention to the grave deficiencies that attend the operation of the wholesale sales tax system in this area of exemptions for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commission noted that for those exemptions that are conditional upon the type of buyer or on the number of items bought the Australian Taxation Office's administrative costs, and the private sector's compliance costs in observing these exemptions, are extremely high. High compliance and collection costs are, of course, amongst the major problems associated with the wholesale sales tax system generally.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry Commission also made the important point that sales tax exemptions are `not the optimum way to provide assistance to people with disabilities'. Direct cash assistance would be a far more efficient way to compensate people with special needs who are reliant on these goods. However, since we are stuck with the wholesale sales tax system under the Hawke Government--and this system is widely used for social welfare purposes--it is necessary to ensure that sales tax laws operate in the most equitable way possible for people with disabilities and those in other special circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, what this Bill really does is to highlight the need for the wholesale sales tax system to be scrapped lock, stock and barrel and replaced with a broadly based goods and services tax. The wholesale sales tax system has become a totally antiquated and inefficient means of raising revenue. Unfortunately, this has not stopped this Hawke Labor Government from milking every available cent from its sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has increased the amount of revenue raised through sales taxes from $3.5 billion in 1982-83 to $9.4 billion last financial year. I repeat that: when this Government came into office the figure was $3.5 billion and it increased to $9.4 billion last financial year. Of course, the figure would have been much higher had it not been for the recession, which has served to depress sales such that sales tax collections last year were down 7.6 per cent on the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The impact of the Government's sales tax grab on households has been particularly severe. Sales tax receipts under the Hawke Government have increased in real terms by 53 per cent per adult since 1982-83, the year it came into office. Of course, average weekly earnings have declined in real terms over the same period. Under the wholesale sales tax system, Australians are significantly worse off than they were in 1983. The wholesale sales tax is a hidden consumption tax on the purchases of all Australians. Few consumers are aware of which goods are taxed under this system or at what rate they are taxed. Accordingly, sales tax was described by Tony Thomas in the Business Review Weekly some years ago as `the sneakiest weapon in Treasurer Paul Keating's arsenal'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sales taxes are levied on a narrow range of goods at three separate rates of 10 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent. These differing rates applied to a small range of goods severely distort production and consumption decisions, particularly in view of the fact that the commodity listings in the rates and exemptions schedules have failed to keep pace with changing consumer preferences. Items that were once deemed luxuries and so worthy of a high rate of sales tax are now considered to be necessities for which Australian households are forced to pay through the nose. Although wholesale sales taxes are levied on only a small range of goods, many of these goods are everyday household items which make up a relatively large proportion of a family's weekly budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sales taxes are also levied in a highly inequitable way. For example, caviar, mineral water and oysters go untaxed, while chocolate biscuits, soft drink and ice-cream are each taxed at one of the various sales tax rates. The trend under the Hawke Government has been for the operation of the wholesale sales tax regime to become even more inequitable. Dr Neil Warren, from the University of New South Wales, has examined the changing incidence of Federal indirect taxes since 1975-76, in a paper prepared for the Economic Planning Advisory Council. His conclusions about the changes in the incidence of wholesale sales tax that have occurred since 1984-85--in other words, under this Government--are particularly damning. He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>The changes to the wholesale sales tax appear to have increased the regressivity of this tax, both through changes to the effective rates of the tax and from changes in other factors. </PARA>
<PARA>This conclusion exposes the hypocrisy of the Government's scare campaign against the coalition's proposal for a broadly based goods and services tax. While the Government has been running around scaring little old ladies and others about the alleged inequities of a goods and services tax, it has been hitting those very same people with an increasingly inequitable sales tax regime--and significantly increasing sales tax collections year after year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The wholesale sales tax is also a major burden on Australian businesses, labouring along with households under the effects of the recession. Sales tax falls heavily on goods that many businesses use in their production processes. It has been estimated in a study conducted by the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University that nearly half of all sales tax is levied on intermediate business inputs--in other words, the wholesale sales tax is a significant addition to the costs faced by many businesses. Another 14 per cent is levied on sales of investment goods, adding to the cost of capital growth, while only 37 per cent is paid by final consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>  The same Centre of Policy Studies report found that some 10 per cent of the final incidence of wholesale sales tax, equivalent to $9 billion, falls on goods for export. This translates into an average export tax of 2 per cent, at a time when improved export performance has never been more important. The Centre of Policy Studies concluded its study, entitled A Broad-based Consumption Tax for Australia, with this observation:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a general consensus that the wholesale sales tax system has lost any economic merit it may once have had and remains only as a politically expedient but economically inefficient revenue raiser. </PARA>
<PARA>The Hawke Government stands condemned for ignoring the consensus against the wholesale sales tax system and in favour of a broad-based goods and services tax. Every major business organisation one cares to name in this country supports a broad-based goods and services tax. There has not been a single major newspaper in Australia that has not, at some time in the last 12 months, editorialised in favour of a broad-based goods and services tax. The Government deliberately ignores this massive weight of opinion behind the concept of a goods and services tax in favour of what it considers to be an opportunity to launch a shameless scare campaign at the next Federal election--and in the interim--based on our proposals for comprehensive tax reform. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is imperative that the wholesale sales tax system be scrapped as part of any attempt to reform the tax system in this country. The coalition is committed to a complete overhaul of the Australian taxation system, as part of a much larger package of economic reforms designed to return Australia to sustainable economic growth over the longer term. It was the conclusion of Professor Russell Mathews, writing as recently as 1987, that:</PARA>
<PARA>Judged by criteria of equity, efficiency, neutrality, simplicity and effectiveness, Australia has the worst taxation system of any advanced industrialised country. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for the empty words of someone eminently less qualified, the honourable member for Perth, whom we heard parroting earlier. Unfortunately, very little has changed since those words were written by Professor Russell Mathews. The coalition is determined to reverse this situation so that we can boast in Australia the best taxation system in the world at some time in the near future. For the time being, however, the Australian tax system is beset with problems. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia draws its taxation revenue from a very narrow base--namely, personal income taxes on wage and salary earners. In 1990-91, total income tax collections from individuals were responsible for 51 per cent of all revenue collected by the Commonwealth. Total income tax collections from individuals and companies in the same year accounted for 69 per cent of all revenue collections. Income tax accounts for even higher percentages of total tax collections when we take non-tax revenue out of these calculations. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a percentage of GDP, income tax revenue has increased from 16 per cent in 1980- 81 to nearly 18 per cent last financial year. A narrow tax base means tax rates--in this case, income tax rates--must be set very high in order to raise the necessary revenue. No-one would dispute that our present income tax rates are much too high. The average income tax rate on all individuals has increased since 1980-81 from 21.1 per cent to 24.1 per cent in 1989-90. The top marginal tax rate of 47c in the dollar now cuts in at only 1 1/2 times average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA>  High tax rates are distortionary in their effects on economic activity and introduce major disincentives into those areas in which they are levied. The disincentives generated by our high income tax rates are familiar to anyone who works for a living and is a PAYE taxpayer. Regrettably, with 831,000-plus people unemployed in this country and perhaps another million underemployed, there are few of those people who are paying PAYE tax these days. </PARA>
<PARA>  There comes a time when there is simply no point to working any more and earning more income, since this will place the wage and salary earner into a higher tax bracket, or the extra earnings will be taxed at the top marginal rate of 47c in the dollar--plus the Medicare levy, which we have every reason to believe might be given a hike along in the very near future. The simple fact is that the harder you work in Australia, the more you pay in tax--which is an entirely perverse way of running a taxation system. If nothing else, it is counterproductive since less work means fewer revenue collections in any case. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA>  The same disincentives apply to personal savings. The more one saves in this country, the larger the tax liability a person saddles himself or herself with. Once inflation has taken its toll, there is often little point in saving for the future. It is little wonder that our savings performance is so bad, both by historical and international standards, as I have described in this House on other occasions this week. </PARA>
<PARA>  The distortionary effects of our high rates of personal income tax are even more serious, particularly in view of the fact that they are often hidden and, therefore, escape quantification and analysis. The high rate of personal income tax encourages people to save and invest in those areas that will serve to reduce their tax liability, rather than where their funds will earn the greatest return. That is one of the hindrances to satisfactory investment in this country. People will happily invest in areas that produce mega returns if that means they can escape paying outrageous amounts of income tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also know that high rates of personal income tax drive people into the undeclared, black or cash economy--however one likes to describe it--which has been estimated to be worth some $20 billion annually. By definition, it cannot be quantified. If it could be, presumably such people could be tracked down and taxed. It may be $20 billion--the estimates go much higher. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a major incentive to evade tax under the current income tax regime, despite the significant risks and costs that can be involved in such evasion. Not only are tax evasion and the black economy often a suboptimal use of resources, but both activities also increase the incidence of taxation on the rest of the community, creating more of the same perverse incentives and distortions. High rates of personal income tax are also highly regressive. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many high income earners who might otherwise pay significant amounts of personal income tax are able to legally reduce their tax bill through such mechanisms as tax shelters, incorporation, dividend imputation and the inflation indexing of the capital gains tax. Needless to say, few of these mechanisms are available to low income earners. This is why we often find that those who have some of the highest incomes in Australia pay some of the lowest levels of income tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  The principal change we need to make to our tax system is to spread the tax burden much more widely so that everyone pays a fairer share of tax. The introduction of a broad-based, single rate goods and services tax, as proposed by the coalition, will provide the basis for a much broader tax base. This, in turn, will permit a much lower tax rate which will have minimal distortionary and disincentive effects. </PARA>
<PARA>  A low rate GST has the capacity to raise a significant amount of revenue for the Commonwealth, although we are obviously not interested in this revenue for its own sake. Combined with cuts in government expenditure, the revenue raised from our GST will allow significant reductions in personal income tax and the abolition of the burdensome wholesale sales tax system, as well as a compensation package for low income earners, social security recipients, pensioners and superannuants. The effect of the introduction of a GST will essentially be the reverse of all the undesirable consequences of the current tax regime that I have referred to. There is obviously some concern as to the effect that the goods and services tax will have on households, but the public should be reassured on that. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The speech made by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) on the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill was a very interesting dissertation about the conservatives' taxation policies. It demonstrates that the honourable member for Curtin has total contempt for the disabled community because that is the community that the legislation that we are debating in the House tonight is all about. It is very disappointing that the honourable member for Curtin has such contempt for people who suffer with disabilities in our community that he could not spend one word in his ramblings talking about what the effects of this legislation will be. I am very disappointed that that was the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Earlier this afternoon we heard from the shadow Minister for community services and aged care, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), that there was a bipartisan position on the Government's legislative program with regard to disability services. It is unfortunate that the penny did not drop for the honourable member for Curtin. He raved on about the regressive taxation plans of the coalition, if it ever got the chance to be in power, and totally ignored what this legislation is about. I will bring the debate back to what the Bill is all about and what benefits will flow from it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill continues the process of implementation of measures recommended by the Industry Commission report on aids and appliances for people with disabilities. Although it is only a minor Bill in the totality of sales tax legislation and the Budget framework, the Bill will have a significant impact on the financial situation of thousands of disabled people and their families. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill modifies sales tax provisions by exempting goods used to modify a motor vehicle to transport a person with a disability and by simplifying the current exemption process for goods designed and manufactured expressly for use by persons with disabilities. These amendments are in line with the international agreement, the Florence Agreement, signed by the Australian Government last year, which proposed the removal of all tax levies on goods used by people with disabilities. These amendments build upon the previous action of the Government in removing all tariffs on imported goods such as pacemakers, defibulators and wheelchairs as of 1 January this year. </PARA>
<PARA>  This legislation is a result of the Industry Commission inquiry into aids and appliances for people with disabilities. In fact, this Bill is, as my colleague the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) pointed out earlier, more generous than the Industry Commission actually recommended in that most of the amendments go further or are new initiatives of the Government. However, the Bill does not implement the Industry Commission recommendation that suggests that sales tax exemption be extended to computer equipment required to operate electronic communications equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has referred this issue to the disabilities task force for analysis by its working party on the cost of disability. The Government has acted in this way because of concerns about the meaning and implications of this particular element of the Industry Commission report. The Industry Commission recommendation was very narrow in its targeting and not fully explained. This issue will be reconsidered early next year in the lead-up to the 1992-93 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  These changes to sales tax provisions will improve the equity of assistance measures available to people with disabilities. They are part of the overall policy direction of the Government in the disability services area which was outlined in this House this afternoon by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) in his ministerial statement. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill does not provide an exemption for general purpose goods for use by people with disabilities. This does accord with the Industry Commission recommendation that there are too many difficulties in restricting any concession for general use goods such as computer equipment, microwave ovens and air-conditioners. Over many years various governments have considered the possibility of providing sales tax exemptions for general purpose goods. By that I mean goods that are ordinarily used by people without disabilities where they are for use by people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  Such an amendment has always been considered to be impractical for three reasons. Firstly, sales tax concessions by themselves are not the most equitable form of relief or assistance, because people derive benefits from sales tax exemptions only if they purchase new goods. Secondly, conditional sales tax exemptions involve considerable administrative costs both for the Australian Taxation Office and the private sector. Thirdly, exemptions for general purpose goods are open to abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>  The broader issue of the extra costs experienced by people as a result of their disability is, as I said earlier, being examined by the interdepartmental disability task force. The equity of present arrangements will be addressed and recommendations made on how assistance could be better targeted to those people with disabilities facing substantial living costs. I am particularly delighted to be able to speak to this Bill this evening, unlike members of the coalition, who have rambled on but have not addressed the Bill at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That is exactly right. It reinforces my commitment, and that of the Labor Government, to the continued process of reform in the disability services area. Further, the specific subject of this Bill--technical aids and goods required by people with disabilities--is relevant to my electorate as two very important service providers in this field are based there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Independent Living Centre is an incorporated, non-profit, non-government organisation providing free information and professional advice to the people of Queensland who face some disability. It provides a central resource on aids and equipment for children and adults with disabilities, including physical, visual and hearing impairments which may be alone or in conjunction with general medical, intellectual or psychiatric disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Independent Living Centre operates, firstly, an equipment display, which is a comprehensive display of equipment for disabled people to see and try out, with assistance and advice from experienced, qualified staff, including occupational therapists. The equipment is not sold from the premises or loaned by the centre; rather, various manufacturers set up displays there and the staff of the centre provide advice to disabled people and their families when they call in. A second service provided by the Independent Living Centre is an information service. This State-wide information service provides information and expert advice on aids and equipment by telephone or mail to disabled people, their families and health professionals. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Independent Living Centre was commenced in 1981. It is a federally funded program operating out of a building on the grounds of the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital. I had the pleasure of touring through the facilities just a few weeks ago, at which time I had the opportunity to talk at length with the Director, Ms Louise Van Willigen, and to learn more of the services provided by the Independent Living Centre. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ST4">Mr GIBSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is a very important service, as the honourable member for Denison points out. It is providing a very important range of services to the disabled people in Queensland and is part of the very comprehensive range of disability services funded by the Federal Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Also based in my electorate is another service provided for the people of Queensland. It comes from a group called Technical Aid for the Disabled. In fact, it also operates out of the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital, and has been operating out of that centre for about 12 years. It is a unique service. It is funded by a home and community care grant from the Federal Government and brings together a range of technical people who are willing to volunteer their services to produce a range of different and specific aids or products which are required by disabled people but which they cannot commercially purchase from private industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  Technicians are brought from Telecom, the railways and other areas where there is some technical expertise. These people give up their own time and use their skills to design, in consultation with the disabled person concerned, a piece of equipment that suits his particular need for his home. They spend many hours and a lot of effort producing this equipment at a very low cost--the Government provides the support for the purchase of the bits and pieces that may be required--and provide a major benefit to people who are disabled and who otherwise would have to suffer quite considerable disabilities coping with the problem that they have, a problem which can be fixed up with the provision of this piece of technical equipment that Technical Aid for the Disabled is able to produce for them. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is a wonderful group of people. They bring together the very strong voluntary effort that people throughout the community are willing to provide, as well as some great technical expertise. They are very ably led by their President, Professor Richard Stevens. I have had the pleasure of meeting with the people who are involved with Technical Aid for the Disabled. In a few weeks time I hope to go through the centre with the Director, Mr John Williams, to learn more about what Technical Aid for the Disabled has produced. These are just two organisations serving the people of Queensland that will benefit because of the legislation that we are debating tonight. I am pleased to provide my support for the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said earlier, I am disappointed that in this debate members of the coalition have diverted their attention from what we are actually considering here--namely, assistance for the disabled community in Australia--and have used it as a grandstanding exercise for their consumption tax. I think it is rather sad--but not surprising--to find that the coalition parties do not really have an interest in issues concerning disabled people, but are rather more willing to twist the debate here this evening back to their base policies on the consumption tax and their other regressive tax measures. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased that this Bill is before the House. I am pleased that it will receive the support of the House. I know that the disabled people throughout Australia will appreciate the Government's efforts in making these amendments, because they know that it will mean a substantial financial improvement to their situation and provide a much better opportunity for them to make something better of their lives and their homes a bit more comfortable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As previous members of the coalition have told the House, we wholeheartedly support this legislation, notwithstanding the amendment that we have moved, which I think is totally appropriate in the circumstances. This legislation highlights some of the great injustices that have existed in the wholesale sales tax area--I say `have existed' in this case, because the legislation is being changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  About a year ago I happened to visit a service station here in Canberra to buy some fuel. As I was fuelling up I happened to look through the window and I saw a fellow sitting in a wheelchair having some service done, presumably to the motor in his wheelchair, which I think basically is very similar to a starter motor in a car. Whatever that work was, it was being completed and he drove himself out onto the driveway, across to the back of a van-type vehicle, hit a button at the back and a tailboard automatically came down. He drove his wheelchair onto the tailboard, hit the button again, which raised him to the level of the back of the van, drove his wheelchair in behind the steering wheel, locked himself into position, started the motor and drove away. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was singularly and greatly impressed by that experience. I would say that this person was virtually a quadriplegic; he seemed to have very little mobility even in his arms. I could imagine how that person's life and his enjoyment of life had been massively improved by that technology. It is just such an amazing step forward. I was a member of the Road Safety Committee of this Parliament years ago and I remember when we conducted an inquiry into the licensing of drivers. During that inquiry we visited a hospital where disabled people were being taught to drive vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA>  At that time an injustice that struck me was the difference between the circumstances of people becoming injured. With two people in particular, one was the subject of an industrial accident and that person had a brand new car to learn on, while the other had gone home after work, climbed onto his roof to repair a broken tile and had slipped off and fallen across a fence. The circumstances in which he was trying to improve his lifestyle were not nearly as good. I still think that this is an issue that this Parliament should look more closely at. I have considerable objections to certain aspects of the welfare program but, when a person is suffering a disability of that nature, my generosity on behalf of myself and other taxpayers knows no bounds. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this legislation, the Government is taking some further steps to clarify the rights of those people in relation to their having a reasonable lifestyle, remembering that in any circumstances theirs is not a very happy lot. So, naturally, there is good reason to do it. I guess the pity is that it has taken so long. I have received complaints in the past where people, in trying to properly equip a vehicle for their personal use, have found that they had passed the threshold price of the so-called luxury vehicle and had seen that tax question raised. I understand that one of the principal purposes of this legislation is to ensure that it does not much matter who drives the vehicle; the point is that it is being used to assist a person with a disability. So, it is all positive. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think the Opposition is correct to move this particular amendment, which says:</PARA>
<PARA>`whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading--</PARA>
<PARA>in fact, as I have said, the Opposition has supported this legislation--</PARA>
<PARA>the House condemns the Government for its ramshackle and inefficient wholesale sales tax system, and its failure to replace it with a fairer, broad-based goods and services tax'. </PARA>
<PARA>The simple fact is that in all of these situations, be it the exemptions available to the agricultural industry or be it the exemptions available to people disabled in the circumstances that we have mentioned today, nobody knows how the system works, including in most cases the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA>  I well remember commencing a wholesale business many years ago and ringing up the Tax Office and saying, `I want to be a good taxpaying citizen'. Remember that the tax Act as it applies to the wholesale sales tax makes the wholesaler the taxpayer. The wholesaler who makes a mistake cannot legally go to the person to whom the goods were sold and ask that person to pay the difference, because that person is not the taxpayer. The taxpayer is the wholesaler, and any mistake the wholesaler makes and any incorrect advice the wholesaler gets can bring the business down if the tax problem exists for long enough and the accumulated back tax gets to the point at which the business cannot afford to pay it and so goes broke. There seems to be very little concern or compassion in the Tax Office when these circumstances arise. </PARA>
<PARA>  The simple fact was that I wrote to the Tax Office and said, `I have gone into the wholesale business. I will be selling liquor and goods associated with the servicing of the hotel industry such as paper goods, packages and things of that nature. What sales tax rate should I apply?'. I was told, `We are not going to tell you; you must tell us'. I had never been in a business before but I had to write the Tax Office a letter saying that I was going to sell this particular item and that I believed that my responsibility was to pay sales tax at a particular rate. When I submitted my list, which was quite comprehensive, the Tax Office wrote back and said, `You were wrong with this one and you were wrong with that one'. I presume that there might have been a few in there where I was wrong on the wrong side of the ledger, and I do not know to this day whether it corrected me in that case. But, of course, I dutifully passed it on to my customers who dutifully passed it on to the consumer. So the consumers paid. </PARA>
<PARA>  So the first thing is that the system as it exists is dreadful. Out in my electorate we have the circumstances of a farmer who rang me up and said, `I want to improve my wool flock. I am prepared to go to the expense of individually identifying each sheep on my property with numbered ear tags, and when I shear them I will weigh every fleece. I want to buy a set of scales for that purpose. I have approached the Tax Office and under the laws I can have them tax exempt. They are classified as an aid to manufacture. But, of course, I cannot afford to have someone standing beside the scales writing down every fleece weight. I need a computer to help with that, and I can buy the electronic scales that will put that information straight into the computer'. But the Tax Office said to him, `But you might take that computer up to the house at night and play Atari games on it. You might actually use it for such dreadful activities as working out your tax liability. You cannot have a sales tax exemption for that. As we do not know which purpose you will use it for most, you will have to pay sales tax on it'. And so he did. We argued, we fought and we struggled--to no avail. </PARA>
<PARA>  We went a bit further at one stage and found that, if one bought a plough to put in a crop, that was exempt because that was an aid to manufacture. Apparently, the tax boffins had worked out that if one ploughed something into the ground one was seeking to grow a crop. But when one went to buy a header the Tax Office said, `No, that is not an aid to manufacture; the crop has grown. That is only the thing by which you cut its heads off'. The Tax Office actually made those sorts of rulings. </PARA>
<PARA>  Consequently, I support wholeheartedly the amendment, which attacks the Government for its ramshackle wholesale sales tax system. No-one knows how it works, and, of course, it is pretty unfair. Furthermore, we can compare this with a system whereby there would be a flat tax charged up front at retail. There is an old saying which refers to three words associated with good taxation--if there is such a thing; I am a bit of an anti-tax person myself. They say that the three words are `certainty', `equity' and `simplicity'. I am not sure that any of them apply to our current taxation laws in Australia. But I have always chosen to add a fourth one--`visibility'. I am totally in favour of taxes being where people can see them. I suppose this story is not so impressive to Americans, but I will never forget finding out that when you buy something in a shop in America which has a price on the shelf of, say, $10, you hand over your $10 and the shopkeeper says, `You owe me another dollar'. You ask what for, and are told, `That is the tax'. So you think, `Oh, that is the government's share'. </PARA>
<PARA>  But why can we not have a sign at every bowser that says, `Petrol: 20c a litre plus tax'? It makes a lot of sense to me, because I believe that governments, whatever their political persuasion, should be answerable to the people for the taxes they collect. When I think $20 billion, or 20 per cent, of the present taxes raised from Australians this financial year is raised as indirect taxes--as consumption taxes--and the Aussies do not know a thing about it, I think that is taxation by stealth. Of course, as was pointed out in this House today, we levy some $300m of that on Telecom--which does not bother to write to its consumers every month saying, `Here is your account and this is the tax component of what we are charging you'. That is unfair and improper. I want low taxation, but I want it to be visible. </PARA>
<PARA>  Here is an interesting little exercise. A motor car is something that most Australians aspire to, and as many as possible like to buy one that sells for around about $25,000 new--and there are a few left at that price. I did a quick calculation using some of the information provided to me in regard to this legislation. I am told that the maximum tax exemption that people can obtain under this legislation is just over $6,000, this being the 20 per cent tax at the $30,505 wholesale limit before a car has applied to it the extra 10 per cent luxury component. But, at 20 per cent, presumably on wholesale, the tax on a $24,000 to $25,000 car--which I assume would wholesale for about $20,000--would be about $4,000. </PARA>
<PARA>  In other words, if we scrap the WST as we know it today we would have that car wholesaling not at $20,000 but at $16,000. Consequently, presumably, the retailer would take a slightly lower cash margin, applying the same percentage. But let us assume that the retailer is a bit greedy and sticks with the $4,000 profit. The retail value of the car is now $20,000, not $24,000. Because the Government still wants some revenue, and assuming that we then had a broad-based consumption tax, let us say for the first example at 10 per cent, the tax on that $20,000 vehicle is $2,000, not $4,000 as it is presently. And let us say that the government of the day is more greedy than that and wants 15 per cent. The tax would then be $3,000, not $4,000. These things have to be taken into account. People must realise that, if we have a system that does away with the established WST, which is a dog's breakfast, there will be some beneficial effects before the up-front tax goes on. </PARA>
<PARA>  The rate of application of that tax and how it is spent are matters of concern to me, and I have the opportunity within the forums of the Liberal and National parties to talk about that--and I certainly will. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes, I do. But the point I make is that, of all the taxing systems we have, the WST is the most dreadful. Nobody knows how it works, and nobody really and truly has any understanding of it or is kept informed as to what it means to them. But I thought that that little example of a motor car--we are dealing with motor cars here--was a very interesting proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I would like to touch on another matter. Today the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) wanted to tell me--and I have the only electorate in Australia that has more farmers than any other interest group--that my farmers were somehow going to be a lot better off after the industry statement, because he said that from here on in farmers would be totally exempt from sales tax. The Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), immediately jumped up and asked about sedan motor cars and a few things like that. Okay, that depends a bit on use, but what the Minister said amazed me. I went back and got hold of the documents accompanying the industry statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I knew what I wanted was there because it was burnt on my memory. On page 5.21, under `Sales tax exemptions for inputs to goods production', it said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided to simplify and extend the exemptions from wholesale sales tax for goods used by manufacturers, miners and primary producers (i.e. goods producers). . . Some existing restrictions on the goods eligible for exemption will be removed. The following goods will become exempt when used in eligible activities. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Goods such as the ones I just mentioned were then listed. They include lubricants, which is fine; office furniture, equipment and consumables; and road vehicles when used exclusively within the production premises--in other words, where people did not drive them out of the farm gate. It went on to talk about transportation. Transportation is fundamental to production in primary areas. Nothing leaves a farm that at some stage does not run on a rubber tyre. Sometimes it goes to its final destination, sometimes it might go to the rail siding, but there is a part of every piece of primary production that moves on a rubber tyre. One would think that, in setting out to remove the sales tax burden from primary producers and all the other people who use road transport, if only to get the product to the next stage of transport--be it rail or shipping--that would have been included. </PARA>
<PARA>  But what does the statement tell us? It mentions transportation of goods by rail, which is fine. It also mentions transportation by pipeline--I know a bit goes by pipeline--and conveyor belt between production premises, eligible storage facilities or exempt ports. The Government got right down to the pipeline and the conveyor belt, but left out the truck. </PARA>

What is the Minister on about? Fifteen per cent of national GDP is paid in transport; one dollar in seven is spent by Australians on transport. Eighty per cent of traffic between Melbourne and Sydney goes on the road--and the Government left it out! The Minister gets up here today and tries to tell us the wonderful things the Government has done under WST for my farmers! They are not very grateful.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I do not think they will, because they are awake. They have heard the rhetoric but have not seen the change. Let me put a simple measure on the cost of wholesale sales tax when a person runs a truck. I carted cement from Perth to Port Hedland, about 1,000 miles in the old fashioned measure. On the rig that I used, which was a double- bottom road train, I used to wear out one tyre a trip if I was lucky. That was just normal wear and tear. I used to carry 40 tonnes, only one way, and I was paying in excess of $20 sales tax on that tyre. Fifty cents a tonne of the $40 or $50 I used to get in those days was going out in sales tax on my tyres--to say nothing of the sales tax on my batteries, my spare parts and everything else I had to buy. The fact of life was that I made sure that people paid for that, whatever the rate was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That was the sort of tax burden I was passing on to consumers in the north-west, and nobody knew about it. This industry statement does not take it out; the burden on remote area dwellers is still there and it is a disgrace because every mode of production, be it in the capital cities or the country, is reliant on road transport at some stage. There is a cost being fed in and the Government was either too stupid or too dishonest to understand it. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I have said in this Parliament before, I have never yet been able to establish who I dislike most: the dishonest or the stupid. Sometimes the dishonest bloke does give me a run for my money. In this Parliament at the moment I do not know which label to put on this Government, but I am starting to think `stupid' is probably the right word. People who leave road transport out of a statement like the industry statement and then claim that massive benefits have been given to production are talking through their hats. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister is to be condemned for trying to put that argument over in this place. After all, Ministers are required by our rules to tell the Parliament the truth. In supporting this legislation, which is positive, I point out-- (Time expired)</PARA>

I want to commend the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) for the clarity with which he presented examples of the difficulties and confusion that have arisen from the application of the wholesale sales tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The legislation before the House tonight is the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1991, which contains three basic measures. The first measure extends the current exemption on goods used to modify a motor vehicle to adapt it for driving by a disabled person to include vehicles used to transport such persons. The second measure in the Bill is to make it easier to establish eligibility for exemption in relation to goods designed and manufactured expressly for invalid persons. The third part of the Bill provides a cap on the maximum sales tax benefit applicable to new motor vehicles for use by certain Defence Force veterans and other persons with specific disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  I welcome the measure because it is long overdue that people with disabilities are considered when they come to seek transport or when they seek to have aids and appliances which will make life more interesting and more bearable for them. I regard this as a compassionate measure on the part of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is a strange sort of mixture of compassion and harshness. On the one hand, it does something like this, costing $3m in this year and $3.5m in a full year, but, on the other hand, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) introduced legislation for disabled people which is so restrictive and prescriptive that wonderful organisations such as the Challenge Foundation and many others are deeply concerned about pushing disabled people out into the community, forcing them to fend for themselves. Here we have a little measure in a sales tax Bill to assist disabled people but, on the other hand, we have broad measures which will seriously disadvantage and damage the well-being and lifestyles of disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am particularly pleased with the provision that extends the exemption to the vehicles to be used as transport for disabled people. I have come to know a fine Australian company which produces special passenger vehicles--`SPV' they call themselves--by taking Australian motor cars, doing a body stretch on them and dropping a middle section into them. They are designed specifically by fine Australian engineers, manufactured to very high levels of expertise, thoroughly road tested, to allow for the transportation of disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA>  Competing against this Australian made motor car has been the common London cab. The London cab is a fully imported vehicle and it is familiar to most Australians because it is starting to appear in our city streets. The London cab has had some favouritism shown to it in the way in which it has been treated for tax purposes. I have thought for some time that it is a tragedy that the Australian manufactured vehicle, which sells for about the same price, does not have some concessions applied when it comes to the transportation of disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA>  One vehicle is built and is capable of being used for the transport of disabled people by its manufacture, and that is the London cab. The special purpose, Australian manufactured vehicle is a specially built piece of equipment. It has a marvellous finish, is beautifully designed and is expertly built by the company. Despite some representations on my part, I am afraid that until now the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) has failed to understand the claim of this Australian company. In fact, the correspondence I have received completely ignores the main thrust of my representations and concerns and the damage being done to the company by what I would regard as some unfairness in the competition it faces. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that this amendment will now provide for the manufacturer of the Australian vehicle an opportunity to sell its vehicles freely on the Australian market. I believe that these Australian vehicles will become an alternative transport for disabled people. They will be extremely popular because the side of the vehicle opens and it is possible to wheel a wheelchair right onto the floor of the vehicle, lock it down and transport two people very safely and easily from place to place. For those people who are confined to wheelchairs this will be a marvellous measure. </PARA>
<PARA>  I hope that the Minister will quickly advise me if I and the company concerned have misinterpreted the application of this sales tax exemption, because it is something that it has been seeking for some time. I know that, whilst it will be across-the-board, it will now start to level the playing field, which is a term that I do not like--it will start to make things more equitable for the company concerned. This will mean that the cost and availability of transport for Australians in Australian made vehicles will be improved. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would also like to pay tribute to the Government for the step it has taken in exempting goods designed and manufactured expressly for invalid persons. Within the electorate of Mitchell there are a number of organisations which have the task of specifically supporting, assisting and providing accommodation and workplace opportunities for disabled people. There is the Warrah School, Cumberland Industries, Macall Colony Gardens, Inala and the Hills School, as well as the hidden group of individuals, those disabled people living in nursing home accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I trust that the provisions to grant exemption for goods designed and manufactured for invalid and disabled people will allow those in nursing homes or in disabled institutions to take advantage of those aids that assist them, whether it be in getting to and from their bed or wheelchair or allowing them to bathe without discomfort. All of those things that become so much a part of life for disabled or invalid people will be decreased in price through this measure. What a sensible measure that is. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is regrettable in many ways that the Government has had to take some measures to rectify what is a strange system of taxing people--that is, the wholesale sales tax. It is a tax that has been fiddled with and changed by governments from the time of its introduction. Subjective assessments are made as to whether an item is a luxury or a non-luxury item for the application of the wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  For instance, because caviar and oysters are considered to be a food, they are not taxed. On the other hand, chocolate biscuits and ice-cream, and even kids' drinks, are taxed because they are considered to be a luxury. I cannot follow the concept of a government that claims it is simplifying the tax system but, by exemptions and extensions over the last five years, has succeeded in trebling the amount of money that it is taking from Australians by the wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are talking about transportation, and the relief for disabled people from the cost of their transport vehicles is to be much welcomed. On the other hand, the wholesale sales tax is not applied to aeroplane flights, but a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax applies to caravans. A taxi service has no wholesale sales tax on it, but a bicycle carries a 20 per cent sales tax. Therefore, despite all of its promises, the Government has not succeeded in rectifying the problems and differences that these judgments apply to the Australian community, whether the thing is a luxury item, a middle range item or just a revenue raising item. So the extension of the wholesale sales tax, since the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) became Treasurer, and continuing today, is something that few Australians realise. </PARA>
<PARA>  The application of the wholesale sales tax covers a range of goods in Australia. Few people really understand--Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that you do because you have made a particular study of this matter over the last few weeks; I am sure of that--the wide range of goods--the hundreds of items--on which sales tax is applied. The interpretations that have to be gained by wholesalers from the Taxation Office as to whether one level or another of wholesale sales tax applies, whether or not an item is exempt, or whether the tax is fully applicable cause great confusion. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have a number of expert wholesalers and retailers within my electorate who trade with each other. In some instances, depending on where invoicing takes place, the transport component is or is not included in a good. Somebody can take the invoice at the point of delivery--the wholesale outlet--and have no transport included in the wholesale sales tax. But if the invoice is issued at the front door it includes the whole of the transport component--the cost of the truck and the driver and the wear and tear on that vehicle is added to the price and taxed. There is a myriad of inconsistencies. </PARA>
<PARA>  In one part of Australia one deputy commissioner will apply one level of wholesale sales tax and in another part of Australia another level will be applied. It is only where manufacturers move across State boundaries and wholesalers move from State to State that they understand these inconsistencies. There is no rhyme or reason to some of the decisions, or to some of the goods that are included. </PARA>
<PARA>  For instance, until fairly recently if someone wanted to have a tax free shower it was cheaper to use dog soap because there was no sales tax on dog soap but there was on the soap that you and I would normally use. What a strange thing to have in Australia. This is the weirdness of the system the Government pretends to support and wants to go on supporting. It seems strange to me that with the so-called compassion--the fake compassion--that the Government has, things such as baby powder for infants are taxed at 20 per cent. Is the Government afraid that the baby's mum or dad might use that powder?</PARA>
<PARA>  I do not know what is wrong with the Government when it tries to justify such an antiquated, ramshackle system as the wholesale sales tax. Over the last few weeks Government members have become the defenders of the current system. They have become the defenders of the secret tax, applied without knowledge to the purchaser, never marked up, and kept secretly in the warehouses of the wholesalers who make out their accounts and send the cheques in to the Government. They are the tax collectors, secretly collecting tax from Australians without their being aware that pens and papers, hair combs and brushes, lawn-mowers and toilet paper, and even Ovaltine and Milo, have a tax of 20 per cent on them. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that the defenders of this current system need to look at some of the rationale that was presented to the tax summit by their own leaders. The only reason they were pushed off that course was that the union movement said at that time, `We will not wear it'. Listen to the words used by the honourable member for Blaxland at that time in regard to the necessities of life. In the Australian Financial Review of 13 June 1985, he is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>At the moment we all have to buy the necessities; if you're not buying them you can't live. And you buy them now out of your after-tax income, after it has suffered these very high repressive marginal rates. So you pay 46 cents in the dollar and then still buy your necessities. What we are saying is you buy the same necessities, but out of your relieved tax income. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the proposal that the Opposition is putting to the Australian people: out of a relieved income, there is a greater capacity to buy the necessities of life. That is the proposal that should be implemented, instead of sticking with this ramshackle system, so inconsistent, so thoughtless and so poorly thought out as it applies in Australia at the moment, and instead of sticking at the same time to our very high marginal rates of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the provisions before the House tonight are some thoughtful measures to exempt those who are disabled from paying sales tax for their transport vehicle or those providing transport for them, which, I think, is even more significant. It makes it easier for those people purchasing goods designed and manufactured expressly for invalids to buy without the imposition of sales tax. That is to be welcomed. But we have this consistently strange attitude of the Government. On the one hand, it gives a little bit of encouragement and, on the other hand, it has a general system which is oppressive and not supportive of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to persuade the Government to be courageous and pick up the opportunity to change the tax regime in Australia to give Australians a bit more of a chance. Why not follow the words of, say, the honourable member for Blaxland in the Australian? So many members opposite want to support him and see him in the Prime Minister's chair. I see my colleagues from New South Wales in the chamber. I know that almost to a man they would have that view. But almost to a man they are failing to accept the logic and the rationale of chucking out this wholesale sales tax system; of picking up the tax cheats; of applying a tax that will pick up some dollars from the tourists in Australia, who come to Australia and use our services and who now pay very little for their use. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Blaxland said in the Australian of 2 July 1985:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that it is now time to take a more fundamental approach. It is time to establish a broader tax base with greater integrity, allowing a fairer sharing of the tax burden with lower rates of tax. </PARA>
<PARA>On 18 February 1985 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said:</PARA>
<PARA>Now it seems to us that there therefore has to be a substantial increase in indirect taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>They were talking about a consumer tax, a goods and services tax. That was the cause they were arguing. It was a cause that the Government has walked away from. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those who are here in support of the honourable member for Blaxland, those who want to see a change in the prime-ministership, have to deal with this issue because, if they continue to reject these reforms of the wholesale sales tax, they are rejecting many advantages for their fellow Australians--advantages in having a consistent, easily understood tax at a low level across a range of goods and services; in reducing personal income tax; and in providing protection and exemption from the impact of that change to pensioners and low income earners. They are the advantages that they are rejecting on behalf of their fellow Australians. If they accept these measures, they will encourage those people who wish not to pay tax to save, because if they want to put their pay or their returns from their hard work into savings, there is no tax paid on those goods. So savings are encouraged by a broad-based GST. </PARA>
<PARA>  There would be an improvement in trade because there would be an exemption from a GST on those goods which have been traded overseas. There would be assistance to local manufacture because there would be a decrease in the cost of goods and services used to produce products. A broad-based GST would be more rational and more easily understood. It would deal with the cash economy, estimated by some to be $40 billion a year. How would Government members deal with that? With a broad-based GST those people receiving cash, whenever they spend any money, will be paying taxation. That does not happen under the wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  Members of the Government have done nothing about bringing the cash economy into gear, but we intend to do something. What are they afraid of? Are they the friends of those who deal in the cash economy? What influence do they bring to bear on the Australian Labor Party? Why can members opposite not take a stand against this issue?</PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, there would be the capacity to reduce income taxes for all Australians-- lower income tax so that people would have more of their own money to spend. These are most desirable objectives that the Australian Labor Party should copy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-in reply--I take this opportunity to thank all those honourable members who took part in this debate, particularly the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) and the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), whose remarks were relevant and of great assistance to all of those who listened to the debate. I thank also the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who also displayed a kind of consistency in that none of them was prepared to direct his remarks to the Bill. We were not this evening debating the Disabilities Services Act; we were not debating the March industry statement; and we were not debating the Opposition's plans for a consumption tax. There will be another occasion on which we can do that, and we in the Government are looking forward very much to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There are some particular points that should be addressed at this stage. I acknowledge the kind remarks of the honourable member for Dawson and I welcome his desire for a degree of bipartisanship on the question of assistance for disabled people. I particularly noted his remarks about heavy vehicles, four-wheel- drive vehicles and those which would be priced above the threshold specified in the legislation. I point out to him that the report of the Industry Commission, had the recommendation contained in that report been adopted, would have taxed those vehicles in full. In fact, the Bill gives people in that position a tax benefit of $6,101 in the current financial year and excludes the costs of modifications for the purpose of determining the exemption. </PARA>
<PARA>  I point out also to the honourable member for Dawson that such vehicles would be fully taxable under a broad-based consumption tax offering no exemptions. Equally, following up his remark about a 20 per cent tax on commercial vehicles equating to a kind of consumption tax, I point out that this of course is a tax at the wholesale level and not a tax at the retail level, which is what would occur with a GST. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the general question of a consumption tax, as I say, I am not particularly interested in getting involved in a detailed debate on that this evening. The proper time for that will come when the Opposition finally reveals the details of its proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>  I reject the charge that the sales tax legislation is unnecessarily complicated and difficult to administer. It is certainly not when compared with a proposal that the Opposition would be putting up. There were some complaints during the debate, for example, about the cost to business of certification and the difficulty with paperwork. I point out that the administrative costs of collecting a dollar of sales tax revenue is only 40 per cent of the cost of collecting a dollar of income tax revenue. I point out that, under the wholesale sales tax regime, there are some 75,000 taxpayers in the system. A consumption tax would be likely to increase this number by tenfold, correspondingly increasing compliance and administrative costs. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also make the point that the wholesale sales tax does offer the capacity to target particular products and particular groups where governments wish to achieve special objectives. I point to the example of the removal of sales tax on recycled paper, for example. To promote a particular objective the Government removed the wholesale sales tax on recycled paper, thereby promoting its use. In this particular Bill, to assist a particular group of people in the community, a wholesale sales tax is removed in particular cases to assist disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition, while extolling the virtues of a GST throughout this debate, has failed to tell us whether it would be providing exemptions for goods used by disabled people as provided for in this Bill. I would have imagined that the whole point of a broad-based GST would be that it would offer no exemptions, as so many honourable members of the Opposition participating in this debate and earlier discussions have told us. I think the Opposition will have to come clean, particularly during discussion on this Bill which offers exemptions from the wholesale sales tax for disabled people in particular instances. </PARA>
<PARA>  Would a GST offer exemptions for goods purchased for particular purposes? Further, would it offer exemptions for services purchased by disabled people? All of this presumably we will find out in the fullness of time--on 25 September at the National Press Club, or whenever it is going to happen. We on the Government side are looking forward to this very much. The spectacle that we enjoyed this evening of white-faced Liberals coming in here at the behest of their Whip to argue----</PARA>

In response to some remarks made by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) on the subject of the Industry Commission report, I point out that the measures contained in the Bill in many instances go beyond the recommendations of the Industry Commission, particularly the new exemption for goods used to modify vehicles to transport people with disabilities. It is a Government initiative, one not recommended by the Industry Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>

I draw the attention of honourable members in the chamber to the fact that there is a complication in the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, in spite of what the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) might say. This Bill was introduced in the first sitting week of this Parliament. The amendment which has been moved today indicates that there is a complication. This is very detailed legislation--there are schedules, regulations and everything else.

Targeting can be carried out successfully but, equally, it can be carried out badly.

<PARA>  This is an area that deserves a great deal of consideration by this Parliament and the Australian people before they have the opportunity to pass judgment on Dr Hewson's proposal to introduce a consumption tax of 15 per cent, 22 per cent or whatever figure he decides to set. At the moment the Opposition is seeking to put together a consumption tax which is the greatest con job this country has ever had to consider. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is very important to go through some of the arguments which we have heard tonight. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) has told us that, because there is no sales tax on oysters or caviar, the Government should tax bread and milk. Tonight he was saying that, because there are some luxury food items which are not subject to wholesale sales tax, then the Opposition plans to levy a consumption tax of 15 per cent or 22 per cent, whatever it is, on everything that we need to eat and drink. That includes bread, milk--</PARA>

Whereas the honourable member opposite may spend a lot of money on caviar and oysters, I can tell him that low income earners in my electorate do not. Low income earners in my electorate do not have the money for those luxury items that are mainly subject to the 30 per cent wholesale sales tax at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Opposition is also seeking to levy this 15 per cent or 22 per cent consumption tax on every dollar which is spent by these people. These lower middle income earners do not have large sums of money to put aside in shares and investments or into savings accounts. They have to spend almost all of their income to make ends meet. They are going to be hit harder than the people who are very comfortable, who drive Ferraris, who have mansions in Double Bay and up the Highlands like Dr Hewson and who are not required to spend almost all of their income on clothing and food, on looking after their children and on simply purchasing their groceries and food at the supermarket. That is why the consumption tax is regressive. That is why the Opposition proposal will hit lower and middle income earners harder than those people who are better off, and that is why the Labor Party will fight this proposal tooth and nail. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is interesting to note that it is the shadow Minister at the table who is supporting this consumption tax, a man who has made his reputation as being one of the leading lights of the New Right. The simple point I would make to him is that I would ask him to consider that at the moment 75,000 people fill out the paperwork and send cheques regularly to the Tax Office to pay the wholesale sales tax. How many people will have to fill out the paperwork for the Opposition's 15 per cent or 22 per cent consumption tax? Not 75,000 as is required with the current system, but 750,000 people every month, every week, every day or however often they are required to send in these pieces of paper. Ten times as many retailers and 10 times as many business people will be required to fill out the Opposition's consumption tax paperwork. The Opposition claims that it is the party of small government and yet thousands of extra public servants will be required in the Tax Office just to process all the paperwork that the small businessmen will be required to complete just so Opposition members can follow their own ideological hang-ups and bring in a consumption tax because Margaret Thatcher brought in a VAT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That is why we are doing this--because Opposition members have had their agenda set by Margaret Thatcher. Opposition members have said that a Labor government in New Zealand introduced a consumption tax and, therefore, we are not necessarily only following the views of the British Conservative Party. I enjoy it every time they make the comparison with New Zealand because I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are aware that the New Zealand Government initially brought in a 10 per cent consumption tax. The Government of New Zealand adjusted the compensation for pensioners and worked out ways which, it said, would ensure income tax rates could be cut. However, within a very short time what did that Government do? It increased the consumption tax from 10 per cent to 12 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is the hidden agenda of the Opposition. That is the reason why it wants to bring in this consumption tax. Opposition members know that, once they have a consumption tax established, it will be easy for any future Liberal government to raise taxation by stealth by simply jacking up the consumption tax from 15 per cent to 22 per cent to 30 per cent or to 35 per cent whenever it needs extra money to fund its particular programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition still has not told us how it intends to compensate pensioners who are going to be greatly disadvantaged by the consumption tax--pensioners who have to spend almost every dollar that they receive on purchasing goods which they need to make ends meet. We have had no explanation at all from the Opposition as to how they will be compensated. The Opposition might come up with a certain figure to compensate pensioners receiving the full rate of pension; but what about the part rate pensioners, the people on railway superannuation? How is it going to provide adequate compensation to those people who are battling to make ends meet?</PARA>

<PARA>  How does the Opposition plan to compensate all of the people for the fact that their savings are devalued? The Opposition has not advanced any mechanism for providing adequate compensation to the pensioners, the superannuants, the school kids with savings, the farmers or anyone else out in the community.

<PARA>  The important thing is that the Opposition says that its consumption tax would be visible but that the current wholesale sales tax is secret. The point I make is that anyone who has travelled to the United Kingdom or any of those countries that have consumption taxes or VAT will probably have had the unpleasant experience of having found something on the shelf that they wished to purchase, having taken it to the cash register with their money ready and having been slugged with an invisible consumption tax which the retailers have not shown on the prices of the goods displayed on their shelves. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is very clear which is a secret tax: it is not the wholesale sales tax, which is seen in the price displayed on the shelves; it is the VAT, the consumption tax or whatever else is levied. I simply ask those opposite who say that their proposal would get extra money from the black economy: how many people with large sums of money who have not paid income tax are spending money on bread and milk and how many are spending money on Ferraris, mansions, oysters and caviar? It is very clear that the wholesale sales tax ensures that it mops up a large amount of that money that goes through the black economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Having been tempted by the Opposition to make a few comments on a consumption tax, I had better return to the Appropriation Bill. The important thing to note about these proposals is that the Budget provides this country with a foundation for recovery, with the Budget Papers demonstrating that this year's economic growth is expected to be about 3.7 per cent. Whilst employment has fallen by 300,000 and caused increases in unemployment in my electorate and others around the country, in the life of the Hawke Government we have seen employment increase by more than 1.3 million. That is a rate of employment growth per year which is more than three times the rate of employment growth during the Fraser years. So, when Opposition members get up in this House and shed crocodile tears for Raymond or other people in their electorates who are undergoing the great difficulties of unemployment, I simply suggest to them that they compare the success of this Government with that of the Fraser Government. This Government has created 1.3 million jobs--a rate of employment growth three times that of the Fraser years. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is fair to try to make a judgment as to whether the Government is doing enough to ensure that the economy picks up at the right pace. We can be very proud of the fact that, for example, last year exports of manufactured goods grew 20 per cent--something which demonstrates great scope for hope for the coming year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The housing industry is growing rapidly. But, most importantly, we have had a dramatic fall in interest rates over the last 18 months or more. Of course, during that period there have been some criticisms of our previous Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), and of our side of politics. Those opposite have said with hindsight that we kept interest rates too high and that, if we had eased interest rates earlier, perhaps unemployment would not be as bad as it is. But, in perhaps accepting those criticisms, it is worth while to compare this Government's decisions in lowering interest rates with the Opposition's policy. Virtually every time that Treasurer Keating and Prime Minister Hawke supported the Reserve Bank of Australia in dropping interest rates in the last 18 months, the Leader of the Opposition accused the Reserve Bank Governor, Bernie Fraser, of acting for political reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have a quote from the Leader of the Opposition on 31 January 1990 when he was shadow Treasurer. He was asked by journalist Martin:</PARA>
<PARA>Can we say that that cut in interest rates then wasn't justified?</PARA>
<PARA>The then shadow Treasurer replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I think there's little doubt that the Treasurer's pushing the pace on interest rate reduction to meet his political timetable. </PARA>
<PARA>But as recently as today in this morning's Australian, 18 months later, we have the headline `Hewson attacks Reserve governor', with the opening paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Opposition intensified last night its assault on the one percentage point cut in interest rates from claims of political motivation to a personal attack on the governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA>I wondered whether perhaps the Opposition had made a mistake and put out a press release from 18 months ago. But, no, that was not the case. The Opposition has not changed its tune. It has opposed a cut in interest rates all along. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the Government had followed the Opposition's arguments and kept interest rates higher during the past 18-month period, what would have been the effect on employment at that time? We would have had higher unemployment and a deeper recession. It is a bit rich that Opposition members come into this House and complain about unemployment. The policies that they have been advocating in the last 18 months would have kept interest rates higher and made that recession worse. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at fiscal policy. The Opposition has argued that this Government's deficit of $2 billion is $2 billion too high. It would rather have had a balanced Budget. It would rather have cut government spending by $2 billion. Even the Opposition's own economic analysts show that a reduction in the deficit of $2 billion would have meant a reduction in employment of 46,000 Australians. But those opposite would have had interest rates higher. They would have had a lower Budget deficit and, of course, the obvious result would have been a deeper recession and a longer period before the economy recovered. So I do not think that anyone would believe that the Opposition has the answers to Australia's current economic difficulties. This Budget has laid the foundation for recovery and for growth in the economy of 3 3/4 per cent-- something which deserves endorsement by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the few minutes left for me to speak, I wish to make a comment on the Government's better cities program. It was certainly a long time coming. But this Parliament has faced up to the Federal Government's national responsibilities to improve the quality of our cities. In fact, in my maiden speech I drew attention to the great urban problems in my own electorate. It is my fond hope that this program can ensure that people who suffer from isolation in my electorate due to the inadequate transport system and the people who suffer from having inadequate hospital services, a degraded environment and inadequate employment opportunities can have these addressed in the better cities program put forward by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe). </PARA>
<PARA>  Instead of the Opposition's seeking to bag this program, perhaps it might seek to be a bit more constructive and to join other State and local government authorities in ensuring that this money goes to improve the quality of life in Australia, in our cities and outer suburban areas and also in our rural and provincial cities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has fallen into the trap that most members of the Government seem to fall into these days. They peddle misinformation and deceit. They are doing it unashamedly and blatantly and I can only interpret that as meaning that they are actually running scared. They know that they have been there for almost nine years and that they have blown the opportunity to reform the taxation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government was on the right track back in 1985. The former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) in his address to the National Press Club on 5 June 1985, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, the consumption tax. There are three main advantages of this tax. First, it will allow a more rational indirect tax system than the current anomaly-ridden wholesale tax, which has multiple rates, numerous exemptions, and fails to tax the services sector. Second, it will enable us to generate tax revenues to provide for a major reduction in the marginal rates of income tax. No other tax has the same potential for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the House that this was the honourable member for Blaxland talking at the National Press Club on 5 June 1985. Speaking about a consumption tax, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Third, it generates tax from those who will continue to evade or avoid Income tax. That provides a useful "net dividend" to the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government was on the right track back then in 1985; but, as we know now, the history of the situation is that the Government was rolled by the ACTU. Yet the honourable member for Blaxland was right then. The great irony of all of this--as we hear Government members getting up and peddling this misinformation--is that the Government knew it was the right thing to do. I suppose it hurts the Government now to see us going about implementing the tax reforms that it so much wanted to implement back in 1985. The matter goes further. In the Australian of 18 February 1985, the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have got in this country a position where our marginal tax rates are too high and they are biting in too early . . . They are disincentives and people rightly feel that they have got too high a burden of direct personal tax. So for obvious reasons of personal hardships, incentives and economic efficiency we have got to bring those rates down and bring them down substantially. Now it seems to us that there therefore has to be a substantial increase in indirect taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>What more support does the Prime Minister need for the introduction of a broad based consumption tax? Yet the Government has been dishonest. This is where the Government stands condemned, because it has persevered with the hidden wholesale sales tax. I want to remind the House of this fact, because it speaks volumes of the duplicity and dishonesty in the way that Government members speak on this issue. Wholesale sales tax revenue has increased from $3 billion in 1983 to over $10 billion in 1991--a massive increase in percentage terms in the hidden wholesale sales tax. The Government has done this by stealth. It does not stand up and tell us where the tax is applied; it does it quietly. The tax is hidden and yet it is an enormous tax burden. It is a hotchpotch of inequality and unfairness. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that this Government will stand condemned for its inability to come to grips with real tax reform--tax reform to do what the Prime Minister said, to remove disincentives. The Prime Minister wanted to do it, but he has not been able to do it. The trade unions, at that time, gave the Government its marching orders and the great losers have been the Australian economy and the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will speak now directly on the Budget. I do not shrink from taking on the debate about the goods and services tax. The Government can throw everything it likes at us, but I remind it that good things will come to those who wait; in due course we will provide the details of our tax reform package and it will be grasped with great enthusiasm by the people of Australia. As we look back over the weeks when we have heard garbage, misinformation and dishonesty, the Government will stand even further condemned. It will have egg all over its face. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Hawke Government's ninth Budget has been a complete flop. In fact, `flop' is probably an understatement, because it has been an abject failure. It has failed because it has been broadly perceived as being completely irrelevant. It is irrelevant to today's economic environment. It is irrelevant to families who continue to be worse off than they were 12 months ago. It is irrelevant to the people lining up for food parcels at the Brotherhood of St Laurence or the Salvation Army, as I reminded the Prime Minister in Question Time the other day. It is sadly irrelevant to the almost one million people who are unemployed, many of whom are on the scrap heap. A sad thing is that many of the unemployed are becoming unemployed at 39--as was a constituent the other day--45 or 52 years of age. People of 50 are coming to me saying, `What do I do? Do I wait until I go on the age pension?'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, the Budget is also irrelevant to the many Australians whose businesses have gone bankrupt because of this Government's policies. We heard today in Question Time a reference to the enormous increase in bankruptcies that this country is experiencing. </PARA>
<PARA>  Fundamentally, this Budget is irrelevant because it fails to address the key issues. Already, the Budget is falling apart, as we might have expected it to do. Government Ministers--even the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) the other day--and members are distancing themselves from it. Perhaps we expected too much from the Budget. Perhaps there were unreasonable expectations of it. Australia desperately needed to see light at the end of the tunnel, but it is not there. </PARA>
<PARA>  A Budget is a plan or a blueprint for the future. It is something to be grasped as the basis for a course of action. But this Budget is none of that. At a time in this country's history when, perhaps like no other time, there needed to be a way forward, there is none. Instead, there is policy paralysis. Everything is ad hoc. What is right one day is not right the next. We are reminded, increasingly starkly, of the similarity here with the dying days of the Whitlam Government--a rudderless ship drifting helplessly. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is really difficult to identify the worst features of the Budget. It has few redeeming features. The overall forecast deficit--somewhat understated--of $4.7 billion is an indictment of the ability of the Government to be consistent. With some justification, the former Treasurer claimed some accolades for the Budget turnaround in recent years from deficit to surplus, and I am prepared to say that that was no mean feat. There was a clear need to ensure that the public sector was in balance and that there was a zero public sector borrowing requirement. That was indicated by the economics of the time. It was appropriate. It indicated a commendable shrinking in the total Commonwealth debt. But the projected $8.1 billion surplus for the 1990-91 Budget failed to eventuate and now we have this Budget. Even with the forecast deficit of $4.7 billion, once again the Federal Government must put its hand into the domestic savings pool--this at a time when clearly the Government needed to be disciplined, needed to cut spending more and needed to pursue a tight fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, the situation has been made even worse since the Budget was brought down. This was not the Budget to bring home the bacon; it was the Budget designed to save the boss's skin. The Budget reeked of left wing interference. We know that the Prime Minister depends on the support of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the Left, for his job. This Budget was clearly about the Prime Minister keeping his job--as I reminded him in Question Time--while hundreds of thousands of other Australians struggle to keep theirs. </PARA>

They are really excited about the better cities program. They will have better park benches to sleep on perhaps, and better footpaths on which to line up for food parcels. Somehow, ironically, the better cities program is on but Medicare is left choking and gasping. The $3.50 co-payment, which will raise $163.9m in 1991-92, compares with the cost of the better cities program of $56m in 1991-92.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Maybe we do need better cities. But is this the time? Is this fiscal responsibility? Is it appropriate? Where is the discipline which the former Treasurer, with his schoolmasterly manner, imposed? We know that it has gone out the window, just like the Medicare copayment appears to have done since the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition has long been pointing out the failures of Medicare. We support the concept of those who can afford to pay being asked to pay. We applauded the Government's biting, albeit tentatively, the ideological bullet and finally admitting that Medicare was failing. It has taken it a long time to get to that point. Now even that one commendable aspect of the Budget has changed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I move on to a slightly different tack. Families are the fundamental unit in our society. Family breakdown, which is almost endemic in Australia, causes innumerable other problems. One of the primary causes of family breakdown is financial hardship. I want to remind the House--I hold the Government responsible for this--that the average family is considerably worse off now than it was at the last election. Many families are struggling. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even though interest rates have come down, the damage has been done. We heard the honourable member for Dobell's self-congratulatory remarks about how the Government had brought interest rates down. He needs to be reminded that it was this Government that put them up in the first place. It ought to bring them down. We applaud the fact that they have come down. We hope that the fall is sustainable. We believe that the latest reduction of one per cent was politically motivated, but time will tell once again. </PARA>
<PARA>  Through those months and years of high interest rates many families had their savings depleted. There remains a great deal of uncertainty about whether the breadwinner will have a job next week or next month. In many families both partners are forced to go out and work. This creates great hardship and stress in the home, particularly as children in many of our cities come home to an empty house. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this area of concern about the family, once again the Government is big on rhetoric but meagre in substance. I am prepared to say that there is a commendable recognition in the Budget of the plight of rural families. We do not resile from giving credit where it is due. The raising of the family allowance supplement threshold from $18,000 to $19,300 will be a help. The Budget statement suggested that there will be some additional assistance for 200,000 families. </PARA>
<PARA>  The point is that most families are still paying too much tax. A lot of the problems that we are having in this country get back to the tax system. Is it any wonder that that is where we are placing emphasis? Is it any wonder that that is a key area for reform? If we can fix the tax system and make it fairer and more equitable, and if we can introduce incentive into the tax system, we will address many of these problems. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) in his eloquent maiden speech earlier this afternoon made the point that families are bearing the brunt of the recession and an inequitable tax system. That continues to be the case. It has got worse and worse. It is in the area of tax reform that the Budget is so lacking. The Government has no policy initiatives of any sort to address that particular area. The Government has nowhere to go in respect of serious reform of the tax system. All we have is more tax. Everywhere we look we have more tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  The superannuation levy is nothing more than another tax. In this particular case it is a payroll tax in disguise. It is another tax on employment in Australia. The sad fact about that particular tax is that it will lead directly to more unemployment. Estimates say that it may lead to an additional 100,000 on the scrap heap by the year 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many have talked in this debate about superannuation and the need to encourage people to provide for retirement. We do not have any argument with that concept at all. We have a great argument with the methodology, as many others have said. The other side of the tax is that it is clearly inflationary. In that sense it will have a significant impact on pensioners and low income earners, which is not offset in any way. The Government talks to us about the compensation in our proposal. There will be compensation, and we will make that clear. Where is the compensation that the Government has given for the wholesale sales tax that has increased from $3 billion to $10 billion? There is not a hint of compensation there and not a hint of compensation for other taxes that have been inflationary. </PARA>
<PARA>  The tax system is desperately in need of reform. I was reading the other day that the Deputy Commissioner was saying--what a stark remark it was--that in 1936 the Income Tax Assessment Act had 127 pages and today there are 5,100 pages of tax legislation. It has just been patched and re-patched. </PARA>
<PARA>  Between 1982-83 and 1989-90 Commonwealth tax revenue per head of population increased from $2,660 to $5,300. Over the same period--that is, the time that the Hawke Government has been here--average individual income tax, which was 21.3 per cent of income in 1982-83, had risen to 24.1 per cent by 1988-89. Marginal tax rates also continue to be too high, and this is a major disincentive to people working harder. Over the same period we also know how deplorably low productivity growth has been. It has been virtually zero, whichever way we measure it over those years. If ever we needed a glaring deficiency, that is it. Why would anyone want to work harder in a system such as we have in Australia whereby the harder we work the more we are penalised for working?</PARA>
<PARA>  Perhaps the most interesting program mentioned by the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) during his Budget Speech was the endangered species program. The Government has increased the funding for that program to $5m. This begs the question as to whether it is legitimate for the Government to spend taxpayers' money protecting Labor Party members of parliament. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- The tragedy of the Strathfield gun massacre has stunned the nation. After five such tragedies in the past four years, together with the spread of guns to school children, following the pattern of the United States, gun violence can no longer be ignored. Richard Glover wrote recently in the Sydney Morning Herald:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Guns don't kill, people do. Yes--but it's guns that turn a domestic argument into a shooting. It's guns that convert a punch-up into a murder, and guns that make a suicide out of a depression. And it's semi-automatic guns that escalate a murder into a massacre. </PARA>
<PARA>The causes of gun violence go much deeper than just the availability and use of guns. Gun crimes are part of a general tide of violence in society, male violence, drugs, the alienation of individuals and the increasing displays of violence and weapons in films and television. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have to look closely at many aspects of our society--at our education system, at the inequalities of wealth and opportunity, at our political system, at the constitutional problems of Federal-State jurisdictions and at the way that our culture stamps people with success or failure. There is some evidence that the armaments industry sees Hollywood as its main showcase for the full range of weapons, from hand guns to the latest high tech jets, and funds it accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our adversary two-party political system, which prevents either major party taking a strong position where there is any well organised lobby in the community, is a factor. This was shown at the 1988 State election in New South Wales where the Greiner-Murray Opposition irresponsibly and shamefully exploited former Premier Barrie Unsworth's stand on gun control. The present cat and mouse search for a `bipartisan approach' by the Government and the Opposition in New South Wales is a pathetic admission that the interests of political parties always come before the public interest. Similar manoeuvres in the areas of immigration, abortion and tobacco advertising show the failure of the party system to cope with strong minority groups. All these aspects have to be addressed. It may take years, but we can wait no longer. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Federal Government has no choice but to get heavily involved in gun control and not hide behind the Constitution. State boundaries are meaningless with the portability of weapons and mail order. It is farcical for the Australian Capital Territory to waste time on elaborate gun control laws or even for the New South Wales' politicians to posture, when Tasmania has been the gun buyers' cut price supermarket. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are some legitimate considerations that have been put forward by the gun lobby, but the paranoia of the right of citizens to bear arms against the possibility of some sort of coup must be rejected. Likewise, the frightening tendency of extremist groups to amass huge arsenals and engage in war games with weekend `people hunting' trips, as are advertised in Queensland at present, must also be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA>  The facts are that at the moment there are at least 3.5 million guns in private hands in Australia. Some 25 per cent of Australian homes have a gun. The fundamental problem is availability. Every effort and measure must be taken to prevent proliferation of all guns except to legitimate owners; that is, rural producers, sporting clubs and police. There is no case for private ownership of military weapons or for keeping guns in the home in urban areas. Both shooting clubs and law enforcement bodies should keep secure armouries at central locations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Penalties for premeditated misuse of guns should be increased to a level that would dramatically reduce crimes such as armed hold-ups. The difficult censorship problem in film and video has to be addressed. We can no longer go on with the increasing public diet of ultra-violence and massacre movies. It is frightening to realise that in Australia today the box office success of movies is almost proportional to the level of violence. </PARA>
<PARA>  Licensing and controls on gun ownership and use must be implemented, but we should never pretend that this is any more than a minor remedy to the problem. The increasing trend of violence in society must be addressed at all levels, not just at the level of gun control. All governments in Australia have to give a lead by moving away from the trend to the American style escalation of official violence as the response of its police forces. Such a response is totally self-defeating. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- There are many outstanding community organisations operating throughout Australia. These groups provide a wide range of services and support functions for local communities, and in many cases to specific groups of people throughout Australia. It is widely recognised that community organisations play a vital role in our society and help to enrich the lives of many people. This is true both for those people who play an active role in the operation of an organisation as well as those people that the organisation comes into contact with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I would like to tell honourable members about one of those groups, Focal Extended Inc. It is an organisation which is very active within the Oxley electorate and one for which I have a great deal of respect. This group was originally formed in recognition of the need for those involved with the intellectually disabled to adopt a coordinated approach to the very significant changes that were taking place in the delivery of services to these people in Queensland during the early 1970s. Although the organisation was first established in the Ipswich area in 1974, it has since expanded quite dramatically, with its membership including intellectually disabled people and their parents and relatives, as well as many other members of the community with an interest in the welfare of this group. </PARA>
<PARA>  The membership of Focal Extended is primarily in Queensland; however, it does have members interstate and from overseas. Since its formation, the range of functions undertaken by Focal Extended has become quite broad, with it now providing a wide variety of support and information services to the intellectually disabled and their families. It also plays an advocacy role on behalf of its client group, promoting the welfare and rights of the intellectually disabled and their parents and families. </PARA>
<PARA>  More recently, Focal Extended has moved towards providing housing to meet the specific needs of its client group and, in particular, to ensure security of tenure for these people throughout their lives. This is clearly in line with the Hawke Government's commitment to providing the best quality of life for all people with disabilities and allowing them to have an independent lifestyle. There is no doubt that Focal Extended plays a very important role in our community. However, like all organisations, it needs funds in order to be able to provide those services. A large part of the funds used by Focal Extended comes from the efforts of its own members, and the usual hard task of fundraising involves selling raffle tickets, seeking donations and holding stalls and pie drives. Anyone who has been involved in any community group knows of the amount of time and effort that goes into this type of fundraising. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recently, however, Focal Extended had an opportunity to do something a little different. It held an art exhibition, with works from some of the leading artists, including Eric Whisson. This exhibition would not have been possible, however, had it not been for the support given by the sponsor, Citibank. Because of my association with the banking industry prior to entering Parliament, as an employee and union official, and my close association with Focal Extended Inc., the beneficiary of this exhibition, I was very pleased to be invited by the sponsors to perform the official opening last month. </PARA>
<PARA>  As honourable members would be aware, recently I have been involved in this Parliament's inquiry into the Australian banking industry. During the inquiry most of the attention has been towards `kicking' the banks, so it is very refreshing to be able to stand here tonight and offer some praise to the industry, and to Citibank in particular, for its community-minded spirit in supporting community groups such as Focal Extended. The funds raised from this exhibition provided much needed assistance to enable the organisation to continue its good work and it helped to relieve the burden placed on its group of dedicated fundraisers. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that it is appropriate that Citibank, one of the world's largest banks, should receive recognition for its efforts. Citibank has operated in Australia through its subsidiary Citicorp since the early 1930s and provides its Australian customers with a wide range of banking services, as well as life insurance and superannuation. To Mr Ken Rushworth, Queensland Manager, Citibank Retail Bank, I offer my personal congratulations for the bank's willingness to support this worthwhile community project. </PARA>
<PARA>  This particular exhibition was not the first or only time that Citibank has provided sponsorship to important community projects. In Queensland alone, over the past few years it has supported the Royal Children's Hospital Foundation, the Abused Child Trust, the Asthma Foundation, the Queensland Cancer Fund, the Paraplegic and Quadriplegic Welfare Association and the Shaftesbury Citizenship Campus. Citibank is also involved, or has been in the past, in supporting the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, the Doxa Youth Welfare Foundation, the Multiple Sclerosis Society, and many other worthwhile organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Citibank's willingness to work with and to assist the general community in this way is a shining example of the public-minded attitude that we would like to see exhibited more frequently by the business community. Again, I say congratulations to Citibank and to Focal Extended for their cooperative approach to assisting those people with disabilities. I hope that the example shown by Citibank is followed by many more businesses and industries in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- Many constituents in the La Trobe electorate come from non-English speaking backgrounds. Many of them have been in this country for a very long time. Although in many cases they speak and understand English better than those people who were born here, these migrants still enjoy communicating in their mother tongue. One of the few avenues left to them to hear their native language spoken has been to listen to SBS radio 3EA. People in the Dutch speaking community of the outer east of Melbourne are quite angry at the most unfair and inappropriate manner in which rescheduling of Dutch programs has occurred. The few hours a week when they could tune into the radio and listen and laugh along with the Dutch language programs being broadcast gave them a feeling of keeping in touch with their roots, with their heritage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The broadcasting time for programs in the Dutch language has been cut almost in half. In comparison with other language groups, the Dutch speaking community is experiencing severe discrimination. For example, there are 5,956 Filipino language households and 18,278 Dutch language households. The number of Dutch language households is more than three times the number of Filipino language households, yet the new scheduling by SBS Radio 3EA provides one third more Filipino language programs than Dutch programs. Is it because the families from Dutch speaking backgrounds have merged so well with the Australian community that they are being passed over? That is a good question.</PARA>
<PARA>  Many of the Dutch migrants who chose to come to Australia from the remnants of war- torn Europe have become upstanding and prominent citizens within our Australian community, and particularly within my electorate of La Trobe. They have worked hard and they have contributed much to the local communities in which they have settled. The Dutch flower growers and the nurserymen of the Dandenongs attract tourists from all over the world to their magnificent floral displays. The Dandenongs and flowers are synonymous with the Dutch community in my electorate of La Trobe. </PARA>
<PARA>  Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands has visited my electorate. Indeed, the Dutch community has worked together to build at Montrose a retirement village named in her honour. Beatrix Village at Montrose has a reputation for providing a touch of the Netherlands for the older members of the community who migrated from Holland many years ago; yet it is totally immersed within the wider community that is the township of Montrose within the Australian electorate of La Trobe. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Dutch language households in my electorate are an integral part of the community in which they reside. They are contributors, not takers. It is indeed a pity that for their efforts to become part of the Australian community the elderly Dutch will have one of the few pleasures of their retiring years denied them. The abolition of the popular Dutch radio program that was previously broadcast on Sunday afternoons on SBS Radio 3EA has caused much grief and anger in the older Dutch community. These people are feeling a great sense of loss at the rescheduling that has taken place--all for no apparent reason. </PARA>
<PARA>  Dutch radio programs have been slashed out of all proportion, and I am quite angry about those cutbacks. The Dutch speaking community deserves a better deal. I call on this Government to reconsider its decision to slash Dutch radio programs and to immediately reinstate the Dutch programs on SBS Radio 3EA, Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government talks about a multicultural Australia. As is so often the case, it is very good at talking, but when it comes to action it falls well short of the mark. The Dutch speaking community has participated in the establishment and enrichment of this great nation, particularly since the Second World War. This Government has an obligation to ensure the maintenance of accessibility to Dutch language radio programs through SBS Radio 3EA in Melbourne. I call on the Government to take remedial action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- Last Saturday Channel 10 in New South Wales broadcast a program called Australia's Young Achievers. This program is held as a yearly event. It is available to young people up to 25 years of age who are nominated because they have excelled, whether it be in art, sport, science or in a career. One of those young people who received Australia's Young Career Achiever award is Michael Danielle. Michael Danielle, I am pleased to say, is a resident of my electorate who in 1989 at the age of 18 opened his own jewellery business. He is not only an artist; he is also a wonderful person. He did, with the backing of his parents admittedly, go into this business in Ware Street, Fairfield. Through his skill, his general hard work and, as I said, his magnificent ability not only to design and create but also to make magnificent jewellery, he now employs some nine people. I believe that he has shown, not only by his actions but also by his skill and the way in which he has conducted and expanded his business, that he is a person who is truly representative of a young achiever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I was very pleased that I had the opportunity in 1989 of opening that business for him. In fact, I was exceedingly pleased to hear that a young man whom I knew so well personally had been nominated for and had received that award. He has grown in strength in that business and, at the age of 20, now runs two businesses. He has just opened his second business at Riverwood. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In fact, the Treasurer, who is at the table, met the young man the other night. He was at a function that we both attended. I am saying this because many things have been said in this Parliament in the Budget debate about the assistance that we are giving to the youth and the unemployed, and much has been said by the Opposition on where it feels unemployed people are going today. I make this speech to give an example of what has been achieved by a young man with determination, skill and ability. He is a son of Italians who had settled in this country and who had at least said to their family, `You must learn to stand on your own two feet. We will assist you all we can, but you must learn either a profession or a trade so that you can give back to the country that has given us a home'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This man has done more than that. This man has created employment and is providing continuing employment. He has prospered, and he will continue to prosper because he has that determination to succeed. I believe that he is a shining example to all other young people throughout Australia. The award of Career Achiever of Australia is a fitting award to give to him. I know that he very proudly accepted it and very shyly said in his thanks that he did not believe that he should have received it but that he was proud to have it in his possession. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am very proud to bring to the notice of this Parliament the fact that the electorate of Prospect has not only multiculturalism, which the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) was rather concerned about, but also fine upstanding people who are able to generate employment and to project in their careers and, most importantly, young people who have a future ahead of them. They have a future which they have not relied on somebody else to make; a future that they have carved out for themselves; a future which they will strive to work with and for; and, most particularly, they will provide for others at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA>  Michael Danielle has, through his artistic ability, become renowned throughout the area and I know he will continue to prosper. I wish Michael Danielle well. I wish all of those other young achievers who received awards the other night well. Most particularly, I hope that they become examples to our future Australians. </PARA>

<TITLE>Maffra Hospital</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="859" SPEAKER="McGauran Mr P.J." NAMEID="XH4" PARTY="NP" ELECTORATE="GIPPSLAND">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Gippsland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.48 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --The decision by the Victorian Government to close the Maffra Hospital in my electorate is a sad chapter in the administration of regional public health care policy. The closure of the hospital represents nothing more than a net reduction in health care resources in the region. There will be no expansion in the current level of services at the Gippsland Base Hospital in Sale. Discard that illusion. That is no more than an accounting exercise. The simple fact of the matter is that there are no gains to be had by any health care service in the region because of this decision. All that will follow from the Budget initiative to close the Maffra Hospital will be a net reduction in acute health care facilities for the region; that is, a reduction of services for a community whose age structure and demand is for exactly that type of service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Currently the health and care service profile of the hospital is perfectly attuned to its community's needs. Its total resources are used efficiently and tailored to local requirements. Few hospitals can boast this match between the demand and supply in health care services. Importantly, it is because they lack balances of this type that larger metropolitan hospitals struggle to achieve equivalent efficiencies. Given the demographic character of the region--80 per cent of the population of the Maffra and Avon catchment are aged between 0 and 49 years--demand is predictably for acute care services. </PARA>
<PARA>  As all those here tonight understand, the struggle over past years has been to graft available health care resources onto regional demand. This issue has been at the heart of every effort to design an efficient and equitable health care policy for rural Victorians. None of us sought special status for the region. All we sought was to ensure that available health and care resources were effectively targeted and that the local community had reasonable access to the appropriate level of facilities. Now we are seeing that simple strategy based on those simple principles wrecked. </PARA>
<PARA>  If there were some inherent inefficiencies in the operation of Maffra hospital, action of the kind the Government has undertaken might be understandable. If there was some argument that the region was overserviced relative to the rest of the State, it might be possible to swallow the decision. But the decision does not spring from efforts to improve efficiencies in the distribution of health care resources; nor was it derived from an appreciation of the needs of the wider region. Essentially, then, the decision to close Maffra Hospital and to strip 30 acute care beds--not 20 but 30 acute care beds--from the region's available public health resources was an arbitrary one. </PARA>
<PARA>  Despite the conventions and the regulations of the Victorian Health Act, no consultation with the hospital, let alone the community and other hospital service providers, was undertaken. This is hardly how policy processes bearing on the important issue of regional health care policy should be enacted. The Government has simply barrelled in and torn down years of careful planning by hospital authorities and staff and local communities. </PARA>
<PARA>  But still other myths about this decision need to be exploded. There are claims afoot that in exchange for the axing of the 30 acute beds the State and Federal Governments will re-establish Maffra hospital as a centre for aged care nursing home beds. There are no such published or publicly stated intentions. No provision has been made in the Federal Budget for the expansion of nursing home beds beyond commitments entered into earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The State Government's decision to close the hospital does not herald any plans for a new aged care policy for the region. There are no additional spending proposals to extend services for aged care facilities for the region. Once again, the simple fact is that Maffra hospital will be converted into a 30-bed nursing home, which is the minimum number necessary to justify public funding. There is no new aged care blueprint for the region. There is no detailed plan to capture the full advantages of the physical and human resources at Maffra to boost the provision of aged care across the region. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, I believe there might have been some sympathy for reviewing the charter of the Maffra hospital if it had been based on consultation with regional authorities and local communities. The community might be responsive to such measures if they were presented as a strategy for public health and aged care which made some more determined effort to meet the needs of regions such as Gippsland. But those are opportunities the Government passed up. </PARA>
<PARA>  In short, then, the decision to close Maffra hospital simply signals a retreat from past efforts to ensure adequate provision of rural health care services. Nothing more need be said of the matter. </PARA>

<TITLE>Bankcard Interest Rates</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="860" SPEAKER="Wright Mr K.W." NAMEID="2K4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CAPRICORNIA" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2K4">Mr WRIGHT</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Capricornia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.52 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- I enter this debate to make a public appeal to the banking industry to immediately lower the interest rates its members are charging on Bankcard. Everyone realises that the Reserve Bank dropped the official rate down to 9.5 per cent; yet, despite that, despite the major changes, the massive cuts, that have taken place in official rates over the last 18 months--down from 18 per cent to 9.5 per cent--the Bankcard rates have barely moved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I extracted some figures yesterday and found that Westpac is still charging 24.6 per cent, the ANZ Bank 23.88 per cent, National Australia Bank 24.6 per cent and the Commonwealth Bank 22.75 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members will recall that when Bankcard came into being the rate was 18 per cent, or 1 1/2 per cent per month. That was exorbitant and it was criticised, but it is certainly nothing like today's rates. Since Bankcard was introduced, we have seen a lift from 18 per cent to 21 per cent, and then to this 24.6 per cent high, and it has remained there. Despite all the changes that have taken place in all the other types of rates--the drops that the banks have seen and they have brought about on the moneys that they have to pay on deposits--they continue to hold up Bankcard rates. They say the reason is that they are constantly facing losses. Personally, I believe that is baloney. They do not come good with the figures; they simply say that. I argue that it is part of their strategy to try to force governments and the community to accept doing away with the interest-free period and also accept some sort of fee. I simply will not accept that. I know the consumer movement across Australia will not accept it. </PARA>
<PARA>  On one hand banks are telling us that they are suffering losses, yet they continue to promote Bankcards. I have yet to come across any person who ever asked for an increase in his or her threshold. People say they got a letter from the bank simply saying that their borrowing rights had increased from $1,000 to $2,000 or $1,500 to $3,000. The same is true when people turn 18: if their parents bank with a certain bank they get the offer of a Bankcard. </PARA>
<PARA>  Yet the banks say that they are losing so much. The fact is that they are making considerable profits. They also use these Bankcards to get their clients involved in other products. They are gaining from the interest and profits they make on other products. </PARA>
<PARA>  Clearly, there is a need for the banks to be responsible. They are being commercially immoral. They are pretty tough words after the sorts of comments my colleague the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) made about Citibank, but here is a bank that is obviously doing the right thing. The rest of them are grabbing people by the throat financially and squeezing as hard as they possibly can. There is a need for rates to fall by 10 per cent; there is a need for greater community pressure; and I am also calling for Government pressure to see whether we can bring these rates down. </PARA>
<PARA>  The banks seem to be laws unto themselves. They are quick to slash interest rates on their deposits. One can see from the figures that there are still billions of dollars in passbooks; the banks pay 3.75 per cent. I have come across an example where Westpac, in other savings categories, is paying 3 per cent interest on moneys held in accounts. The banks also introduced fees for anyone who had less than $100 in some kinds of accounts. </PARA>
<PARA>  If one looks at the rates they are paying, the ANZ has a low on term deposits of 5.25 per cent. If one looks at the rates they are charging, on personal loans Westpac ranges from 16.5 to 21.25 per cent. Banks are avaricious when they are charging people, yet when it comes to paying on deposits they are very shy about coming forward with reasonable interest rates and returns. </PARA>
<PARA>  But Bankcard is the issue--and also the sorts of rates banks are charging on business. There are cocktail loans where banks will allow a person a minimum overdraft. I know of a case where they allowed an overdraft of $10,000, but the other $10,000 had to be on Bankcard--a cocktail loan forcing up the overall cost of money. Banks have introduced their own credit squeeze. </PARA>
<PARA>  Banks are doing the same thing with housing. When they knew the rates were going down they raced out and got as many people as possible to go into fixed loans rather than take the advantage of the variable house loan. I have figures showing that the Commonwealth Bank has a fixed loan of 14.25 per cent, which is higher than all the other banks. It is despicable that our own Commonwealth Bank is prepared to abuse its position as a banking organisation to take advantage of people in this country. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise this evening to talk about some changes to the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the introduction of a pharmaceutical allowance as announced in the Budget in health program No. 6. Firstly, I refresh the memory of the House about some comments I made recently when talking about changes to the Defence Service home loans portfolio when it was privatised to Westpac back in 1988 and the reneging by the Federal Labor Government on the commitment to veterans who were recipients of DSHL loans that they would not be financially disadvantaged by the privatisation process--or that there would be no financial disadvantage to the recipients as a result of that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In its haste in formulating the legislation to effect the transfer of those loans, the Government unfortunately forgot that in various States in many instances DSHL recipients would have to pay financial institution duties, and they would also have to pay, as a result of the transfer to Westpac, a mortgage discharge fee which had previously been handled free of charge by the Department of Veterans' Affairs for those DSHL recipients. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn to the changes to the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which was announced, as I said, in the recent Budget in health program No. 6. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>  The Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) provides drugs to holders of the Personal Treatment Entitlement Card (PTEC) (yellow card) and to holders of the white Specific Treatment Entitlement Card (STEC) (white card). Currently these drugs are supplied free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA>  The 1990 Budget introduced a patient contribution of $2.50 per prescription item for war widows, service pensioners and orphans under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The patient contribution is indexed annually and will be $2.60 from October 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the changes that were made in this Budget, similar changes were made to the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme, and from 1 January 1992 PTEC and STEC holders will pay a patient contribution of $2.60 for a prescription item. To offset this patient contribution, a pharmaceutical allowance of $5.20 per fortnight will be paid to PTEC and STEC holders; and the safety net provided under the PBS is to be extended to the RPBS for the protection of veterans who are chronically ill.  The matter that is rather insulting to those people who have served this country in the forces in the past--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) and (2) Reform of the taxation system has been a major priority of the Government since coming to office in 1983. With significant changes to the tax system behind us, a period of consolidation is now intended. Notwithstanding this, the tax system is kept under constant review and the Government will continue to make further adjustments to improve the equity of operation and integrity of the Australian Taxation system. For instance, the Government announced in March a significant broadening in the range of goods exempt from sales tax when used by manufacturers, miners and primary producers. The cost of this exemption is estimated at $375 million in 1992-93 (first full year of impact). These changes are part of the review to simplify the administration of the wholesale sales tax system which was announced by the Government in the 1990-91 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>  Apart from the work of this review, it is not possible for the Government to predict whether it will consider other adjustments to the indirect tax system in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>  I would note, however, that the recent ALP Conference held in late June in Hobart rejected proposals for the introduction of a consumption tax.</PARA>

<PARA>  (1) Yes. A listing of consultants hired by AQIS since January 1989 has been prepared and will be provided to the honourable member. Excluded from the listing are those employees who are hired under contractual arrangements and whose tasks relate directly to the ongoing administration of AQIS. Given the substantial administrative resources required to answer in detail each of the questions asked by the honourable member, the information provided has been limited to the essential elements of the question.</PARA>
<PARA>  Should however, the honourable member require a more detailed response concerning a particular consultancy, or contractual staff, I would be pleased to have this information made available.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) An investigation is currently underway into an allegation of conflict of interest. As this investigation is not complete I am unable to provide further details at this time. No other audits or investigations have taken place, however, as part of the ongoing review of AQIS systems a brief review of consultancies was conducted by AQIS Corporate Services Branch, in October/November 1990, to ensure the practices in place for handling consultants were appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>  This review highlighted areas where administration could be improved and senior AQIS staff were advised of the recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) The issue of conflict of interest is of real concern at all times for bodies such as AQIS,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs reduced the citizenship fee for aged pensioners from $35 to $20, effective from 6 March 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Australian Passports for adults are available for a maximum 10-year term at a cost of $87. This issuing fee is set by the Government as a fee for issue, and is not related to the validity period of the document, nor to the financial circumstances of the applicant. There is no provision in the Passports Act or Regulations for either a reduction of fee or length of validity, for aged pensioners. When the Treasurer announced an increase in the fee in 1987 he also stated that, in future, the fee would be adjusted annually by applying the variation in the Consumer Price Index. This measure maintains the real value of the passport fee at the 1986-1987 level.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is the Government's view that as the passport issuing fee is incurred in most cases only once every ten years, is not an unfair financial burden on applicants.</PARA>
