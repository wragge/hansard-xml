<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government Legislation Amendment Bill I express my displeasure, not so much because we are debating this particular Bill, but because yet again we are seeing the Government guillotining a heap of legislation through the Parliament in the usual rush. Yet again we are seeing the problems of a government which is disorganised, unable to get its act together and unable to get legislation into the House on time so that we can have sensible debate. Although this Bill may not be controversial, nonetheless the Opposition intends to move two amendments&mdash;one at the second reading stage and one in committee. However, the fact is that we are still under some duress and in need of a reasonable amount of time to discuss some of the very important issues in the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill to amend the Australian Capital Territory self-government legislation contains a number of matters, some of which are fairly straightforward, some of which are a little more controversial. Firstly, the Bill proposes to give effect to the Minister's undertaking to repatriate electoral laws to the ACT so that after the next election the ACT Legislative Assembly will have control over these matters. I believe that all honourable members will agree that if the ACT is going to move to self-government, in the proper sense of the word, it will need to take these sorts of responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we notice also that the Bill proposes to give the ACT the power to determine the number of Ministers in the Legislative Assembly. Again, I suppose that one would say that that a reasonable thing; but only if, as one would hope it would be, the power is exercised in a reasonable manner. I have to say to the House that there have been a number of occasions on which the ACT Assembly has left members of this House gasping at some of its antics. One hopes that these are teething problems and that the Assembly will in time learn to operate as a responsible legislature so that people who live in this very important Territory can feel some pride in their government. I wish that that would happen sooner rather than later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also proposes to remove the requirement for the ACT to obtain the Federal Treasurer's approval before making certain guarantees. Again, this is part of giving responsibility to the ACT Legislative Assembly to act as a responsible governing body. We support that move. I mentioned that I would be moving a second reading amendment. That proposed amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the failure of the legislation to address the problems that may arise if the Electoral Commission is not required to refuse applications for registration of political parties where it is of the opinion that the name or description of the party is frivolous or vexatious, mischievous or likely to deceive, mislead or confuse".</PARA>
<PARA>We will also, in the Committee of the Whole, be moving an amendment along the same lines but specifically applying to the ACT. The second reading amendment obviously refers to wider responsibilities of the Electoral Commission than just those relating to the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important to remind honourable members why this matter is being brought forward and to remind them what happened in the course of the ACT election on 4 March 1989. In fact, by any measure, one would have to describe that election as a total fiasco. It is something that the Government must accept responsibility for because this Government pushed through self-government legislation in the form that it was in then. In particular, it created an electoral system called the modified d'Hondt system,something that people outside the ACT would be utterly confused about&mdash;if they had ever heard of it. Clearly, people within the ACT were not much better off in terms of their understanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of this extraordinary electoral system&mdash;one that is not used in any other part of Australia&mdash;we had a fiasco. It took nine weeks, over two months, just to count the votes in the election&mdash;an extraordinary situation. But, more than that, there were 117 candidates standing for 17 positions. In fact, there were 108 parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fiasco went on. Let us look at some of the names of these parties&mdash;hence the reason for the the Opposition parties moving their amendments. We are trying to help the Government to avoid this sort of fiasco occurring again. Standing for the ACT Assembly were parties such as the Party! Party! Party! Party and the Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party. I notice that the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) still cannot smile about these things. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, some of them might even be in the Government. Not only did we see this extraordinary fiasco; we had an extraordinary how to vote card and ballot paper. The ballot paper was literally a metre wide. It was the second biggest ballot paper in the history of the Western world. In fact, according to my colleague the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), he could find evidence of only one bigger ballot paper&mdash;in Illinois in 1930. So the ACT almost set another record with this fiasco of an election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, it was an extraordinary ballot. It took nine weeks to count the votes; the ballot paper had 139 boxes; each ballot paper had to be sorted into 209 categories. Even for Senate elections in New South Wales, when there are several million votes to count&mdash;not several thousand&mdash;there are only 140 categories. That gives honourable members some indication of the extraordinary fiasco brought about by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Opposition is not opposing this Bill, I do intend to move a second reading amendment. I believe that we have to avoid the situation where we might have a party with a frivolous or vexatious or mischievous name which could be used quite deliberately to mislead, deceive or confuse. Our move is well and truly not before time, because we find that one member of the current ACT Assembly has already succeeded in registering a party called the Hare-Clark Independence Party. Clearly, this is designed to mislead the voters. The Government earlier this year agreed to a referendum being put at the next election, which we clearly support. Interestingly it offers voters only one choice, that is, moving from the modified d'Hondt system, this marvellous system under which it takes nine weeks to count the votes, to either a Hare-Clark system or single member electorates. Hare-Clark is an unusual electoral system and&mdash;since none of my colleagues from Tasmania are in the chamber I can say this&mdash;it is practised in only one part of Australia, and that is Tasmania. One has to ask again why it is that the Government seems to want to use some fairly confusing electoral systems, ones which certainly the people in the ACT would not be familiar with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, there is a referendum and it does give the people of the ACT the opportunity to sort out a better electoral system so that they can avoid that fiasco they had in 1989, when we saw these marvellous names for parties and clearly a number of people holding self-government of the ACT in contempt. We had groups like the Party! Party! Party! Party and the Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party. We even had a party that said `No self-government', which still managed to get at least one member elected. That again tends to cast some doubt on what the Government's intentions were in trying to give self-government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment shows that we are still concerned about the fact that the Government has not addressed what can happen with some of these frivolous names, or whether someone would want to be quite deliberately mischievous, or whether someone would want to deceive or mislead the voters in the naming of the party. So I believe that the Government should have a long, hard look at this issue. If it does not want to be held in contempt, if it does not want to be held up to ridicule as it was in 1989, it should look very closely at what it is doing with this Bill to ensure that that type of situation cannot occur again. We will be moving a formal amendment in committee to that effect, but we are also moving a second reading amendment that would affect all elections in Australia, not just in the ACT. We believe it is important that when electors are faced with a choice they are not misled and they do not see situations where the electoral system is held up to ridicule as it was in the ACT in 1989.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with these issues in the reverse order to that which I would have preferred. I will deal firstly with the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). I do not think this amendment is a sound one. The Government has already moved to make it more difficult for frivolous parties to register by increasing the cost of registration and requiring them to have a minimum number of members. So it is considerably more difficult for a simply frivolous proposal to be accepted by the Electoral Commission. But as well as that, quite seriously, there are problems in legally defining what `frivolous' or `vexatious' would mean in practice, or what it would mean to be `likely to deceive, mislead or confuse'. In conversation with experts on this matter I have been told that it would be quite difficult to define what the criterion of `vexatious' would be. The definition of the term `mischievous' is so broad as to be virtually incapable of sensible application, and the operation of the disqualification of names which are likely to deceive, mislead or confuse would also be uncertain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, those concepts are broad and vague. They would lead to widespread dispute, and it seems to me better to stick with the provisions that have already been passed for making it more difficult to register a party so that only those parties which are serious would bother, rather than introducing this somewhat contentious and imprecise approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some years ago, a Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform considered a Bill which proposed to prohibit, among other things, party names which were offensive, obscene or frivolous, and of these grounds only that of obscenity was adopted by the Committee. So Parliament has already looked at this kind of proposal in the past and rejected it, and I think we should do so on this occasion as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Capital Territory Self-Government Legislation Amendment Bill is a very sensible and relatively minor Bill. It is one which would simply give the ACT Legislative Assembly the power to control its own electoral system. That is clearly consistent with the principles of self-government, and in fact self-government itself is consistent with the overall philosophy of democracy, which we accept and apply throughout Australia. So this is just one of the final transfers of power from the Commonwealth to the Territory consistent with what has already happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also gives the Assembly the power to determine the number of Ministers. It would be quite anomalous if the Commonwealth continued to set a maximum number of Ministers for the Territory. It is obviously entirely proper that the Territory itself and whoever is in government should determine how many Ministers are necessary and appropriate.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes minor changes to loan guarantee arrangements so as to increase the Territory's power over those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those changes are the tail end of the transfer of powers from the Commonwealth to the Territory. That transfer occurred because, without self-government, the Territory would not have been governed in a democratic way. Before self-government we had a paternalistic dictatorship&mdash;certainly a benign and often generous dictatorship; nevertheless it was a system of government over which residents of the Territory had no control. Now, with self-government, that situation has passed. The people of the Territory are able to elect their own government and determine the policies and priorities which it will apply in the Territory. That is appropriate. The people of the Territory, for example, give a very high priority to education. It is important that they should have a government which in turn can reflect that in the priorities of its Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before self-government, priorities were set by Ministers who were somewhat remote from opinion in the Territory because they were not directly accountable to it and who made decisions which were antagonistic to what many people in the Territory&mdash;probably the majority&mdash;regarded as appropriate. That situation is now over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true, as the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) has said, that there has been turbulence and there have been some very silly decisions made by at least one of the governments of the ACT in the last 2 1/2 years, but the position is now settling down. The ACT now has a thoroughly mature and responsible government. The people of the Territory will have the opportunity to re-elect that government on 15 February. I am delighted that that election will give the chance not only to re-elect a Labor government but also to elect it in a way that will ensure stability of government in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the 15 February election there will be a referendum about the electoral system. The honourable member for Wannon criticised the electoral system, with justification, but he did not recall that the only reason the ACT has that electoral system is that his Party prevented a more conventional system being accepted by the Senate. If the Liberals had cooperated with the Labor Government, the ACT could have had either single member electorates or a Hare-Clark system, both of which are accepted electoral systems in Australia, rather than one introduced from overseas. But that was not agreed to in the Senate, and so the d'Hondt system was introduced. The d'Hondt system is used extensively in continental Europe, but it has not been popular here at all. So in the referendum next year the people of the ACT will have the opportunity to choose between single member electorates and a Hare-Clark system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the people will accept single member electorates, because single member electorates are the best way of ensuring that people elected to parliament are accountable to their electors. People know whom to go to; they can identify who their member is; they know whom to ask for help; and, if they do not like the service they receive or the sorts of policies that that member articulates, that member can be defeated at the next election. It is the best way of ensuring a direct relationship between voters and their representatives. At a time when there is widespread political alienation, that surely should be the highest priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other advantages of single member electorates. They are used in the lower House of the Commonwealth and every mainland State. So people are familiar with them; they are accepted; they are understood; they are fair; and the members are accountable. What more could we ask of an electoral system? The Hare-Clark system does have some advantages, and it works reasonably well in Tasmania, but in my view it does not ensure that direct relationship between representatives and voters which, as far as I can tell, most people want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that the introduction of a single member system in the ACT would lead to a Legislative Assembly dominated by the Labor Party. That remains to be seen. My colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) has told me that he believes firmly that that would not be the case. In his view, a single member electorate system of voting in the ACT would lead to a majority of independents being elected. That may be true. It is certainly true that people in the ACT value independence very highly, and I think it is quite likely that, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro says, a significant number of prominent people who are independent of any of the major parties would be elected if single member electorates were introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there is anything automatic about the outcome of an election with single member electorates. Quite clearly, some of the electorates would vote Liberal, but it is quite possible that many would vote for independent members. Whether the candidates belong to parties or are independents, their election depends very much on their quality. So I do not think that the criticism of this proposal for single member electorates is sufficient to prevent it from going ahead. I hope that the people of the ACT will vote overwhelmingly for single member electorates in the referendum on 15 February, and I hope that this House will support this very moderate and reasonable Bill without the amendment as proposed by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite what I think are the good intentions of the Opposition in moving its amendment, the Government cannot accept it.

I can almost say that if it is not good enough for the honourable member for Fraser, it is not good enough for me.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I believe that the amendment that is proposed, however well intentioned, is flawed for a number of reasons. Firstly, the Australian Electoral Commission, in its own forthright views on this matter, highlighted that the criterion of vexatiousness is at least uncertain; that the definition of the term `mischievous' is so broad as to be virtually incapable of sensible application; and that the operation of the disqualification of names which are likely to deceive, mislead or confuse would also be quite uncertain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of including the Opposition's proposed broad and vague provisions in the Bill would be to give the Electoral Commissioner a wide discretion as to whether parties should or should not be registered. The Commission itself takes the view that the likely outcome of that would be an increase in the number of cases taken to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal seeking review of the Commission's decisions regarding registration. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have absolutely no doubt that the reason we have seen widespread political alienation and dissatisfaction in the past few years is that the Labor Party has treated the voters of Australia and the people in general with utter contempt.

It is clear that in the operations of government in Australia the Labor Party has not shown due respect for the democratic method of government that we have in this country.

I cannot imagine how he would put into one of those categories a party that exists to advocate the system of election which his own Party is advocating. I am surprised, even shocked, that he would do so. It seems rather disloyal to his own Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take a classic example of the kind of problem that would be brought about if this amendment were persisted with. The proposal is that, if names were likely to deceive, mislead or confuse, the Electoral Commissioner would have the discretion not to register them. I want to put a proposition to the honourable member about the kinds of arguments that could be brought to bear in this matter. To simplify this matter: what we are looking at here is that the Liberal Party of Australia is proposing that this Parliament place in the hands of a non-elected official the right to debar certain citizens of this country from forming a political party with a name of their choosing in order to stand for election. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>What the honourable member is suggesting is that certain citizens of this country can be constrained by the decision of a non-elected official as to the name of a political party which they seek to form and to have stand for election in the ACT. What an outrageous proposition for the Liberal Party of Australia to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider what this would mean in practice. What would happen if the person who is in the position of the Electoral Commissioner is confronted with an argument that the name of a political party is likely to mislead?  Let us take the name `Liberal Party'. In my understanding of the use of the words `Liberal Party', that party is supposed to be a party which, by its own representation, recognises the rights of individuals, that purports to place considerable importance on the rights of citizens of this country to be able to undertake a whole range of activities so long as they do not impinge upon the rights of others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What kind of judgment ought we to make about the name `Liberal Party' when that party is the party that wants to constrain the right of citizens to form a political party of the name of their choosing, the party that increasingly in this Parliament brings to this chamber authoritarian views which in fact fly in the face of what are supposed to be traditional liberal values?  What is the Electoral Commissioner supposed to do&mdash;make a judgment about whether the name of any party that is put before him is misleading?  The Opposition, in essence, is asking the Electoral Commissioner to make a political judgment about the use of a name, and that kind of political judgment is a judgment which ought to be made by the citizens of the ACT and not by some non-elected official. </PARA>

I tell the honourable member that the way to overcome that problem, and the way to build the faith of the people in the institution of the Parliament, is to reform, as this Government has done, the institutions of the Parliament so as to ensure that in this place the proper parliamentary procedure is observed and that people in this place have the right to carry out and do carry out the functions of parliamentarians first and foremost and represent their constituents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Banking Integration Bill 1991 is to enable the processing of the removal of the distinction between savings banks and trading banks which commenced with the Banking Legislation Amendment Act 1989. It will enable that to be finalised. To this end the Bill removes some significant impediments arising from the administrative costs and legal difficulties associated with the integration of savings and trading banks within that same group.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distinction between trading banks and savings banks is a result of the history of bank regulation. For many years banks have recognised the efficiencies to be gained by management being directed towards treating the trading and savings banks as a single bank rather than as distinct entities. The regulatory requirements place significant impediments in the way of achieving the full economic benefits and efficiencies of a single bank focus. The Banking Legislation Amendment Act in 1989 removed the regulatory distinctions between trading and savings banks but left the legal entities still intact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to complete the process of rationalisation, legislation is necessary to enable the merger of trading and savings banks to take place in a direct and economic way. This Bill is the result of extensive consultation with the Australian Bankers Association and has the support of the banking industry. The public will benefit from the increased efficiencies resulting from this restructuring. The legislation ensures that the integration does not have any adverse financial impact on either the Government or the banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to indicate that there are a number of banks involved in this. In schedule 1 of the Bill, the receiving banks&mdash;in other words, the trading banks&mdash;are listed as a who's who of Australian banking today. They are the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, the Bank of New Zealand, the Bank of Queensland Ltd, Citibank Ltd, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the National Australia Bank Ltd, the National Mutual Royal Bank Ltd and Westpac Banking Corporation. The list of transferring banks, banks which will be transferred across to the trading banks, is a complete list of the savings banks in Australia&mdash;the Australia and New Zealand Savings Bank Ltd, the Bank of New Zealand Savings Bank Ltd, the Bank of Queensland Savings Bank Ltd, Citibank Savings Ltd, the Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia, the National Australia Savings Bank Ltd, the National Mutual Royal Savings Bank Ltd and Westpac Savings Bank Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address a few comments to three of the major banks in this country&mdash;the Commonwealth, which is the largest bank in Australia, the National Australia Bank, and Westpac. I have always been under the impression that the Commonwealth Bank was started by a Labor government. In fact, the folklore of the Australian Labor Party indicates that. But a report from the Commonwealth Banking Corporation entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Background in History</EMPHASIS>, written in 1980 by Professor L.F. Crisp, Chairman of the bank, indicates that the creation of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation by the Liberal-Country Party Government of Sir Robert Menzies and Sir John McEwen dates back to only 1959. It is talking about the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report goes back to the earlier part of the bank's history and states that the former Commonwealth Bank of Australia was founded in 1912 under legislation introduced the previous year by Labor Prime Minister Andrew Fisher, but the evolution and real development of that bank was given early statutory encouragement by a 1924 Act of the Nationalist-Country Party Government of S.M. Bruce, later Lord Bruce, and Doctor, later Sir, Earle Page. In fact, many of the forward and progressive implementations for the establishment of what we now know as the Commonwealth Bank were put in place by a Nationalist-Country Party government. Whilst a lot of the Labor Party credit goes to people within its own ranks, the history does not indicate that it should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also had a brief look at the annual report and summary of the National Australia Bank, which has an issued capital of $962m. The present bank is the outcome of a merger between the National Bank of Australasia and the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney that took place in 1981. There was quite a rationalisation of banks throughout that period in Australia's history. Many banks amalgamated, and the National Australia Bank was one of them. Along the way, the group had absorbed the Colonial Bank of Australasia in 1918, the Bank of Queensland in 1922, the Queensland National Bank in 1947 and the Ballarat Banking Company in 1955. Savings bank operations were commenced in 1962, so the National Australia Bank was a fairly late entry into the savings bank field. The Bank of South Pacific Ltd was established by the bank in 1974 to undertake the bank's Papua New Guinea business. The name of the bank was changed in October 1984 to the National Australia Bank Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The managing director's review of 1989-90 relates to how the National Australia Bank's performance was affected during that year, particularly by its loan portfolio. The review states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were obliged to double the charge against profit for bad and doubtful debts, while the cost of funding non-accrual loans became an increasing burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to the Westpac Banking Corporation, which has an issued capital of $1,305m, and a little bit of its history. The Westpac Banking Corporation came into existence on 1 October 1982 following the merger of the Bank of New South Wales&mdash;Australia's oldest company&mdash;with the Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd. The merger was effected by a share exchange following the issue of two Wales $1 shares plus $1.50 cash for each CBA $1 ordinary stock unit held. Holders of $20 preference stock units were offered $20 cash per preference stock unit. I refer to some comments by the bank's managing director in 1989-90 because in his report he also talked about some of the problems with loan matters. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bad debts increased as medium-sized commercial customers and small businesses failed. The level of bankruptcies is now running at uncomfortably high levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the year, the group has recorded a net charge for bad and doubtful debts of $1.2 billion compared with $578.7m in 1988-89.</PARA>
<PARA>I now move to the Commonwealth Bank which, as I mentioned earlier, is the largest bank in Australia. With the acquisition of the State Bank of Victoria it has picked up quite a large savings bank and a large base of customers in Victoria&mdash;in fact, I think somewhere in the vicinity of five million savings accounts. I refer to the Commonwealth Banking Group annual report 1990, and the report of its Chairman, Mr Besley. He says of the year's performance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Group's profit performance and targeted capital generation fell short of plan for the year&mdash;due principally to the impact of increased bad debts&mdash;the Bank's performance continues to meet industry standards.</PARA>
<PARA>He does not say anything further on the bad debt situation, but obviously all of the banks in Australia have been impacted upon by the problems experienced as a result of bad debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am talking about the Commonwealth Banking Group, I note with some interest proposed further asset sales of the Commonwealth Bank in New South Wales, with a number of bank freeholds being put up for sale on a lease-back arrangement. I guess that is recognition by the Commonwealth Bank that its business is one of banking and not one of property management, ownership and control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised the matter of bad debts because my attention was attracted to an article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> which is headed `Banks in the `80s suffered from lack of "risk control"'. The comments in the article are attributed to Mr Graeme Thompson, Assistant Governor, Financial Institutions, of the Reserve Bank of Australia. He has made a number of claims which are also attributed to a Mr Ian Macfarlane, the Reserve Bank of Australia's Assistant Governor in the economics area. The early part of the article, which is apparently attributed to Mr Thompson, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two senior Reserve Bank officials have conceded that deregulation of the finance sector added to Australia's economic and financial problems during the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, the article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the officials maintain that it is only with the benefit of hindsight that a better outcome could have been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>The comment about deregulation causing all the problems in our financial areas is quite erroneous. Deregulation in itself was fine, but banks and other organisations in the financial area did not apply the proper risk control or accountability for much of their lending policies during the 1980s. That in itself led to many problems. As a result of that poor risk control or poor loans policy by a number of our major banks and their lack of accountability in that area, many people in Australia overborrowed and became too highly geared. In many instances, they borrowed against overvalued assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can recall from my early business career that, if someone wanted to borrow money, he went along to his bank manager and pleaded his case and the bank manager asked extensive questions on what sorts of assets he could put up as a security. If the farmers in my electorate wanted to borrow money against some assets, such as cattle, the bank manager would leave the office and physically inspect the farmer's farm and the cattle to see whether they were in good shape. If they were in good condition, the bank manager would say, `They are in good heart; they are in condition; I am prepared to advance you X dollars against the security of the cattle. I can see that you are running the farm well'. The bank managers were fully accountable for their actions; they went out and inspected the assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the 1980s we have seen loan policies which lacked risk control and accountability, as Mr Thompson said. Large sums of money were loaned to organisations and individuals purely and simply on a piece of paper. There was no physical inspection of any likely assets that they might have had. There was no comprehensive report on how they were ever going to repay that money. It is fine to borrow money and be in a position where one can expand some activity, but in many instances money was borrowed purely against overvalued assets and the assets themselves were not even inspected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have seen evidence of this in Victoria, where we witnessed the debacle of the State Bank of Victoria and its ultimate demise and sale to the Commonwealth Bank. I recently received a news release from the Victorian coalition, dated Wednesday, 23 October. It just shows how serious the situation is with the State Bank of Victoria. I hope that this legislation before the House, with the amalgamation of savings and trading banks, does not lead to the situation that was experienced by the State Bank of Victoria in taking over Tricontinental in Victoria and the subsequent debacle that ensued. This news release of 23 October is headed `Audit Report: Victoria "in the red" over State Bank Sale'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The State Opposition said that yesterday's Auditor-General's report discloses that Victorian taxpayers will be "in the red" over the sale of the State Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shadow Treasurer, Alan Stockdale, said that when the ownership of Tricontinental is taken into account, taxpayers are nearly $1700 million down the drain over the sale of the State Bank and the collapse of Tricontinental.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Stockdale said that paragraph 2.20 of the Auditor's Report discloses, for the first time, that the Commonwealth Bank has already demanded repayment of $760 million of the price it paid for Victoria's State Bank under indemnity and warranty clauses in the sale contract.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what I am referring to when I talk about savings and trading banks being incorporated into the one. We cannot have that operating without having proper accountability and proper risk control in the operations of whatever the enterprise might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), is in the House. He has been closely involved in taking evidence in that inquiry into the banking industry. We all wait with great interest for the tabling of that Committee's report and for his comments about what can be done to bring greater accountability and greater risk control into the banking industry. If there is one lesson to be learnt in the 1980s about banking and finance, it is certainly that there will need to be risk control factors built in and accountability by all banks. Of course, there is a responsibility on borrowers as well. It is all very fine to be able to borrow, but there is an obligation on borrowers to repay their loans, and in the time that is allocated for the repayment of that loan. In the 1980s we saw a lack of responsibility and proper prudent control of loans not only in the business area but in many areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this legislation is enacted, it will be necessary for complementary legislation to be enacted in a number of States. It will also require parallel legislation in New Zealand to pick up the New Zealand situation. Complementary legislation will be required in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those few words, I indicate that the coalition does not oppose this measure. I certainly wanted to flag a number of concerns that I have about proper risk control and proper accountability in the banking and finance industry, particularly in view of the lessons that we should have learnt from the 1980s. Let us hope that we can move into the 1990s and beyond with proper control and proper borrowing and loan procedures so that we do not experience another period like the last eight years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not surprisingly, on a Bill such as this, the Bank Integration Bill, which is not controversial, I find myself in almost total agreement with the sentiments that have been expressed in a very wide-ranging contribution by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). This legislation is but one extension of the Government's commitment to ensuring that the deregulation process in the financial industry, which was started in the mid-1980s, continues along that particular route to deregulation. The benefits that it was promised would flow from it to consumers are encapsulated in this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pick up, and probably add to, some of the comments made by the honourable member for Bendigo. As he pointed out, I am Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which has been examining the banking industry in this country in the last 12 months. Today is two weeks to the day before the report is to be tabled in the Parliament. I see that my good friend and colleague the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), will follow me in this debate. He and I are therefore somewhat constrained in what we may say about what the report concludes or recommends on issues that have certainly been drawn out in the contributions this morning. Nevertheless, he and I have been around long enough to know that we can probably get away with some of the things we would like to say in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have seen, the Bill will facilitate the integration of savings banks and trading banks. As indicated, it is a further step along the road to deregulation. Following that liberalisation of banking regulations in the mid-1980s, the differential treatment of savings and trading banks became increasingly unnecessary. Consequently, the Government decided to remove the distinction between them for regulatory purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Banking Legislation Amendment Act, which received royal assent on 7 November 1989, included amendments to give effect to the Treasurer's announcement in the 1988 Budget of the removal of the distinction between savings and trading banks. The removal of this particular distinction was aimed at enabling banks within the same group to have better use and allocation of funds, simpler funding and accounting arrangements and greater flexibility in servicing customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to make one or two comments about the effect that was desired by bringing this legislation to bear because it does raise the question of banks and their offshoots within the same group. It is an issue which our inquiry has looked at with some considerable time and effort because the whole issue of the growth of financial conglomerates and the questions being raised as to what is a bank these days loom very large when one considers even this small step of allowing savings and trading banks to merge, if only for legal reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, for example, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> as late as today, on the last page in the Chanticleer column under the heading `Big Four have insurance world fighting for its life', there is very much a consideration of some problems which may in the future arise as the big four banks in this country get into a position where they are diversifying their group structure, where they are not satisfied with simply doing banking activity, whatever that might be in the 1990s, but are concerned about getting into life insurance, into superannuation, into selling wine, into having travel companies as part of their group structure and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular article goes to some lengths to point out that the big four in fact are having something of a commercial brawl at the moment in extending their insurance arms and invoking methods to enable them to come under the group structure. For example, an arrangement has been entered into between Westpac and the AMP in terms of life insurance. The result of that has been that Westpac's own life insurance arm has now been folded into the main part of the banking operation and AMP is now being sold and distributed through the 3,000-plus branch network of Westpac. That has advantages to consumers; there is no doubt about that. It has advantages to consumers because we are now seeing a product retailed through a 3,000 branch network, where in the past it may have just required the knocking on the door of an AMP insurance salesman or trying to get people out into the remote areas of Australia to sell the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disadvantage and downside that has been identified is the demise of a reasonably efficient and effective life insurance arm of a major bank. It has now been subsumed by AMP. Some might say that that means that competition has decreased and, in a deregulated environment, that is not good. The issue&mdash;which we canvass at some length&mdash;is whether the number of participants in a system equates with increased competition. In other words, if there are more banks or more financial intermediaries operating in a particular system, does that mean that competition has improved and the consumers are benefiting? It may well be. There is substantial evidence that indicates that it is the case, that even if there were a reduced number of major players, but they were supplemented with a range of other financial institutions and intermediaries operating in an economy such as that of Australia, the level of competition would not be diminished in any way, provided there were all sorts of other aspects associated with such a system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They would go to the sorts of issues that the honourable member for Bendigo alluded to a little earlier when talking about another article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today under the heading of `Banks in the `80s suffered from lack of "risk control"'. That issue, of course, is appropriate prudential supervisory standards. It is interesting that the Reserve Bank has chosen to release a collection of documents from which Mr Thompson, the Deputy Governor of the Bank, has been extensively quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today and also in the business pages of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian,</EMPHASIS> at a time when the whole question of the role of banks in the 1980s has been under some considerable spotlight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A conference was convened by the Reserve Bank earlier this year. The Bank has decided to release the papers that were given at that conference. The information which is contained in the article in the paper today is not new to me and it is not new to the honourable member for Sturt or others who have participated in the banking inquiry because it formed the basis of what was told to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to reflect on the comments made about deregulation by the honourable member for Bendigo&mdash;with which I entirely agree. Deregulation did not, of its own, contribute to the problems of banking in this country in the 1980s. There were a range of other issues associated with it and, in effect, they are completely canvassed in our Committee's report, which, as I said, will be tabled in two weeks time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, Mr Thompson comments in this article that two main themes emerge from the RBA's reflection on post-deregulation experience. He said that, firstly, the risk control systems of the banks&mdash;that is, the ability for the banks themselves to recognise when there were problems in their own banking conglomerates, when there were problems with loans that were not being repaid on time, when there were fairly slack lending guidelines in place in the 1980s&mdash;were not up to the mark; perhaps their risk assessment systems were not good enough. One might also question whether the Reserve Bank was up to the mark at the time. I see my friend nodding on the other side because he knows well that we comment about that in our report, but I will leave that for two weeks time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Thompson also said that there was a need for a more effective early warning system about banks that might be heading into troubled waters. I could not agree more. It is an issue which I think the banks have started to address in some way. They have started to put in place risk assessment procedures which they hope will give them some early warning signs, and I think that is an appropriate response. However, they are on a hiding to nothing at the present time because there is a view around that they are imposing their own credit squeeze on the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1980s they were criticised by farming communities and others for throwing money at them and getting themselves into trouble because they did not have early warning signs of where problems might arise, they did not have appropriate risk assessment techniques or risk control procedures in place and they did not take the right view of the sorts of people to whom they were lending. Now, in a recession, after the problems of the 1980s, they are being kicked to death for not lending as easily and as freely to people who have, in many cases, viable propositions, particularly in small business and in the farming communities of Australia. They are being kicked to death because they have tightened up too much. Maybe the answer lies somewhere in between. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will come back to the main thrust of the legislation because I know my colleague on the other side wants some time to speak on this, and there is a time limitation. I conclude by saying that this Bill serves the purpose of including provisions which facilitate the transfer of assets and liabilities of each savings bank subsidiary to its trading bank parent. That transfer is, in the main, achieved through the principle of universal succession, but it is also assisted by exemptions from most Commonwealth, State and Territory taxes and fees and by providing for tax neutrality under income tax law. It is great that the Commonwealth and the States are giving some sort of tax relief. One would hope that that sort of relief is reciprocated by the banks themselves in terms of the people with whom they deal as customers and to whom they are lending at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation thus gives further encouragement to savings and trading banks to amalgamate, consistent with the legislation passed by this Parliament in 1989, and in doing so will also simplify the prudential supervisory role of the Reserve Bank. I hope it does. In the seminar which the Reserve Bank convened earlier this year, all sorts of experts commented about the problems of the 1980s, what needs to happen, whether deregulation was hastened too quickly and whether there should have been greater attention to the main game in town&mdash;that was prudential supervision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those issues were addressed by the Reserve Bank in that seminar. All of those issues were addressed by the Reserve Bank in its submission to our parliamentary inquiry and have been canvassed by the inquiry's report. I am sure that the Reserve Bank, like many others, will be looking forward to some of those comments seeing the light of day in this place in two week's time on Wednesday, 27 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is timely. It is a further indication of the Government's concern to ensure that impediments in the financial industry of this country are removed; but&mdash;and it is a big, underlined `but' from my point of view&mdash;what must clearly go with this is appropriate prudential supervisory controls; the prudential supervisors must have an eye on that main game; and benefits promised to consumers from a deregulated banking environment&mdash;where funds were to be more freely available and people knew that there was safety and soundness in our banking system&mdash;have to be delivered and continue to be delivered. Some of them have been delivered; some of them have not. I think our report will point to the direction where they can be improved. This legislation is a step in the right direction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be following the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) and before him the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) in debating the Bank Integration Bill. There is no argument about the proposal contained in this Bill. I want to draw to the attention of the House some changes that have occurred which have brought about the necessity for this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a time, under the regulated banking system that operated prior to the early 1980s, when there were savings banks as distinct from the trading banks. The argument is that the banking conglomerates that have savings banks now want to bring those operations under the umbrella of the bank operations to give them flexibility and efficiency in the funds they manage and borrow from customers who place it on deposit and the funds that they lend. I can appreciate all that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In passing, I comment upon the fact that banks are saying that they want to bring a subsidiary under the arm of the bank. They do not operate under the normal company law like other enterprises. When other enterprises want to bring a subsidiary under the umbrella of the owning major group company, they have to liquidate the company, and bring the assets on board through the liquidation processes. The point I make in passing is that banks do receive a special treatment from the nation, from the Parliament and from governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are legislating to facilitate banks becoming more efficient on the ground that by bringing their savings bank arm under the umbrella of their trading bank operations, they will become more efficient. That has those advantages, but I want to draw to the attention of the House that there may be some disadvantages as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the regulated banking system, the safety of the banks was assured in ways very different from the way in which the safety is assured today. In fact, the present Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;he has spent a time as the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank&mdash;said of banks, `If you do not let them do much, they won't get into much trouble'. The savings banks were not allowed to do much and did not ever get into much trouble. In certain cases, some savings banks chose not to do too much; they could have done more. In choosing not to do too much, they did not get into much trouble. As a South Australian, how I wish the State Bank of South Australia had remained a savings bank and borrowed from small depositors and lent back to those small depositors, mainly on housing loans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And kept out of New York as the honourable member says, and kept out of the entrepreneurial, adventurous high risk loans. The honourable member for Macarthur draws me to the point I wish to make: by bringing the savings bank subsidiaries under the umbrella of the bank, we are absorbing within the relatively riskier portfolios of the total banking operation the somewhat safer operations of their savings banks&mdash;small deposits gathered in and lent out on housing loans. That raises problems for the prudential supervisor, because it puts the deposits of small savers at a much higher risk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was intrigued during the hearings of the inquiry into banking to hear bankers come along and say how important it was to preserve the risk spectrum. But they were looking at it with one eye closed. For them, the risk spectrum was on the asset side of their bank portfolios&mdash;lending to the honourable member for Macarthur and saying, `He can pay the indicator rates because he is a very safe borrower' and looking at a customer such as the honourable member for Sturt and saying, `He looks highly risky. We will put a 5 per cent margin for risk on to him'. It is very important that the risk spectrum be applied in commercial ways and not in makeshift ways. The presence of a risk spectrum is as important on the liability side of a bank, as it is on the asset side of a bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When banks had subsidiaries that were savings banks, they could virtually say to the depositors, `Here is a savings bank, its portfolio of assets is housing loans. If you put your money with the savings bank, it has a relatively higher degree of security in business terms than the total portfolio of the bank'. The same used to be true with finance companies owned by banks. Where people wanted to lend money, they lent it on the security of a debenture&mdash;a first, second or third debenture, secured note or unsecured note. According to the ranking of the debentures or notes, they got a higher or lower rate of interest because they then knew that they were getting a risk premium for the riskier asset. A higher rate of interest meant a riskier element to the capital and interest repayment. By bringing all of those under the umbrella of the banks, we need to recognise that we are then raising the risk that confronts the depositors with banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Banking Act, the Reserve Bank is required to exercise its powers and functions for the protection of the depositors of the banks, but the Reserve Bank constantly reminded the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration that that does not mean bank deposits are guaranteed. That is all very well for the Reserve Bank to say. The Reserve Bank could say that it would let a bank fail if it gets into difficulties, but would it not be concerned about the stability of the financial system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the financial system then got into difficulties of instability, would there not be a chance that the Reserve Bank would come to this Parliament and ask it to do what the Congress in the United States is being asked to do this month&mdash;to put a huge amount of money into its banking system, to enable the depositors of the Bank of New England to be paid out in full in circumstances where many bankers believe that the Bank of New England should have been allowed to fail because<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> it lent its depositors money on highly geared property loans? Whilst I support this legislation, because it will enable greater efficiencies to yield a dividend to the whole financial system, I think it is important that we understand that, under the system we have at present, we are bringing more and more deposits under the bank umbrella, which are being lent out over a wider range across the riskier spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Macarthur talked about banks getting involved in the insurance industry and a whole range of other activities. As they venture into many other riskier, new activities, it imposes upon those who have to supervise the banks to protect the depositors a higher responsibility. The banking inquiry report will be sensitive and concerned about these issues. They will deserve careful attention when the report is brought down in a fortnight's time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill proposes some rather minor amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act. Certain amendments to the Citizenship Act proposed in 1984 led to many people who believed that they were Australian citizens, either through descent, armed service or possession of an Australian passport, discovering that they did not have the entitlement to Australian citizenship. This Bill redresses one of a number of such incidences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill introduces amendments to provide for a person to obtain Australian citizenship by descent through registration. Changes to the Citizenship Act in 1984 inserted a new section 10B, which limited registration of Australian citizenship by descent to persons who were under the age of 18. Prior to that amendment, a discretion existed in the Act to register persons as descendants regardless of their age. Since that date persons who have discovered that they are not Australian citizens when they thought they were cannot register as Australian citizens as they are now over the age of 18. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is common where Australians might have moved offshore. It happened in the case of my own family. My wife's mother went off-shore, married and had a daughter. She sought to register that daughter as an Australian overseas. At that stage they registered sons but not daughters. We did not discover until very much later that that matter needed to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have come across numbers of other situations where Australians have been very conscientious about their duty to register their children born overseas as Australians born overseas. A reverend gentlemen, who has apprised me of his circumstances, had two daughters. He sought to register both of them overseas. The application for one was there but somebody had misplaced the application for the other. Both are now over the age of 18 years: one registered as an Australian born overseas; the other could not be registered. The matter could not be remedied because there was no discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people might genuinely believe that they are Australians. They might have had passports issued to them and otherwise acted as if they were Australian citizens, but for technical reasons they could not now assume the citizenship that they thought that they had, sometimes because of mistakes even in the bureaucracy, not necessarily mistakes of their or their parents' making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill provides that persons who are now over the age of 18 and who could have applied for registration as an Australian citizen by descent, provided they have an acceptable reason for having not so registered, can now apply to be so registered. The Bill provides that any decision not to register a person is to be notified to the person and is subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also includes an amendment to Section 10B, which makes it clear that a person cannot acquire citizenship by descent when the parent so acquired citizenship under these provisions unless that parent has resided in Australia for a prescribed period of two years. I understand the reason for that is to ensure that there are not ongoing entitlements which families might possess for citizenship by descent which they would then seek to pass on to their descendants if they had not sought to come back to Australia at any time. It does not seem unreasonable to prescribe such a limitation that a person should have resided here for at least two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Deputy Speaker, you would appreciate that the Opposition supports this provision since it does address one of the concerns that we in the Opposition have expressed and taken an interest in. But there are other matters which this legislation does not deal with. There have been a number of attempts by the Government over time to deal with difficulties in this area, but they are being dealt with on an ad hoc basis. There are occasional amendments dealing with one issue upon which there is a degree of pressure, without any consistent framework of consideration of what ought to be done in the area of Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major issues ought to be addressed and ought to be on the Government's agenda. Therefore, to concentrate the Government's mind on some of these issues, I move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading:</PARA>

There are still a number of people in Australia who believe themselves to be Australian citizens upon the basis of armed service in support of this country and others who believe that, through length of residence in particular, they have such an entitlement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until November 1984 British subjects with close ties to Australia were allowed to hold Australian passports even though they were not technically Australian citizens. Spouses of Australians, children born abroad to Australian parents and business people who are frequent travellers are examples of non-citizens to whom passports were in fact issued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1983 Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking recommended that only Australian citizenship should be used as a guide for who should be granted an Australian passport. In line with this recommendation, Australian passports issued before 22 November 1984 are now no longer acceptable as evidence of Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of ex-service men and women who have been active in the service of this country and who may have supported, in other cases, Australian ex-servicemen and settled in Australia after some of the battles in which Australia was involved. Many, particularly those who served in the Australian forces, believe that the oath of allegiance that they swore at the time that they took up arms in support of Australia was sufficient recognition of their commitment to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had numbers of examples given to me over time. One is that of a child who arrived in Australia from Britain with his parents in 1927. He served in the Navy for 43 years. He had brothers in the Air Force and a sister in the VAD in the Middle East and in Papua New Guinea with the AIF. He held an Australian passport, including an Australian diplomatic passport. I have known other people who have held official passports at various times and who have later had doubts raised about their entitlement to be Australian citizens. He was refused passport renewal this year, unless he could prove his entitlement to Australian citizenship. He does not believe that he should have to go through that form and provide evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not keep any register as to who is an Australia citizen or has entitlement to citizenship. The Government says there is a method by which one can find out. It says, `Put your information up and test it. We will knock it out and you will find out you are an illegal entrant or that you are a stateless person'. We require ex-service people to pay fees. We exempt pensioners. But if someone serves this nation, that person is not exempt. These people are rightly aggrieved that, having served this nation, they still have their entitlement to call themselves Australians put in doubt. This is a matter that needs to be taken up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second example is that of a Vietnam veteran. He was shipped to Australia as an orphan aged nine. He was refused a passport to return to England this year to meet his family for the first time. He was told that he was an illegal entrant. As I have said, there are people who are entitled to citizenship in some cases. They are required to pay a fee for a declaratory certificate. The procedure to obtain such a certificate is often onerous. To many it is seen, in the way in which it is dealt with, as insulting to them because they believed they were Australian citizens. This is particularly so when the issue of war service is involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The application form requires information about people's backgrounds and what has led them to believe that they had acquired Australian citizenship, whether it be by birth, a grant of citizenship under the various transitional provisions that operate or by descent. The question of whether or not a person has lost his or her citizenship in the meantime is a matter that must be assessed before any declaratory certificate is granted. The fee&mdash;I believe it is $30, but I suspect it may have gone up in the recent Budget&mdash;is a substantial fee for many elderly people to have to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was of great concern to me that because of these difficulties with obtaining Australian declaratory certificates of citizenship, a number of the Australian veterans who wanted to return to Gallipoli, and recently to Crete to commemorate the Battle of Crete, determined not to go rather than face the ignominy of having to go through the process which they believed put at risk their entitlement to call themselves Australians. One only has to read through the material which the RSL produces from time to time to know the very real concern that exists in regard to the way in which this issue has been handled. I regret that, while it is appropriate that this amending legislation be pursued, the Government is not yet prepared to move in this area. This is not the first occasion on which I have raised this issue in debate about the Australian Citizenship Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter raised by the Bill relates to the withdrawal of citizenship from those people who have obtained an entitlement to citizenship through fraud in immigration. It is the case that, if a person obtains Australian citizenship by fraud, that citizenship can be stripped from that person. That is right and proper. However, what concerns me is what arose in regard to a particular gentleman who married a young lady off-shore. The young lady had a clear intention of deceiving that gentleman, obtaining Australian residency and bringing out another partner from overseas. She had no intention of entering into a bona fide domestic relationship at the time when she, in fact, married that gentleman. Evidence later came to light which indicated that that was her intention all along. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the time that matter could have been dealt with in relation to the grant of residency, that opportunity had passed. By the time the matter was to be thoroughly reviewed, she had already put in an application for Australian citizenship. Of course, that is only a relatively short period after a person has become a permanent resident, and the lady obtained Australian citizenship. Even though she may well have been able to be stripped of her permanent residency if action had been taken earlier, because that permanent residency had been obtained by fraud, the citizenship, once granted, even though it was rooted in fraud itself, could not be taken away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regard that as a very important issue. That matter is still with us. We have the Auditor-General's report on the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in which he makes it very clear that there are some irregularities occurring from time to time in relation to the grant of permanent residency. The Auditor-General states on page x of the overview of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although cases had been decided in accordance with precedent and administrative rulings, the results indicated&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in an audit that he undertook of a sample&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that more weight had been given to factors such as an applicant's relationship with a permanent resident than to misconduct, including alleged breaches of the law. Some cases had been approved despite questionable actions by applicants.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When it occurs, one ought to be able to go back and review the facts. If fraud has been involved, the entitlement to permanent residence should not continue. It ought not be a matter that can be overcome because of the passage of time and the grant of citizenship because of fraud, which then cannot be removed. This is a matter of very considerable moment. I know that departmental officers are aware of it because it has been raised previously in public evidence before parliamentary committees. This further amendment was something that was necessary if the Government was to be able to deal with the sorts of situations I have cited. It is a matter that ought to have been dealt with in this Bill at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter I want to speak about is perhaps the most important issue. Quite surprisingly, if one reads the Australian Citizenship Act, one sees that there is nothing in it that spells out in a comprehensive way the nature and the obligations of citizens of this country and the obligations of this country to its citizens. Some 20 per cent of all Australians are born overseas. They come here either because they believe that they will have the chance of a better life&mdash;in terms of either political or individual freedom, or in economic terms&mdash;or because they have been denied in their home countries entitlements that we in this country take so much for granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most public documents Australia is identified as having a commitment to various institutions and values. These include parliamentary democracy and the commitment to Western liberal values and the rule of law, equality before the law, freedom of the individual, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, equality for women, equality of opportunity for all and universal education. These are matters which we take for granted and which are not necessarily the case in other countries. I believe that many people come to this country because of this value system, these overriding values. But as the FitzGerald report&mdash;a report commissioned by this Government, not by the Opposition&mdash;stated, we must not pretend that these values are perfectly applied, but we must recognise that they are fundamental to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it seems that at the very least the government of the day must be seen to be upholding, preserving and extending these values to all who seek to live permanently within these shores as citizens of this country. Those people must also have some reciprocal obligation, a commitment, to this nation first and foremost. It is a two-way commitment that binds us together and it is the very thing that gives us our identity as Australians; the very thing that makes us people who want to make this a great country in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this two-way commitment is expected to be binding in more than a personal sense, then the obligations and entitlements of the people who accept these institutions and values ought to be spelt out quite clearly in the Citizenship Act. The fact is that if we search through the Australian Citizenship Act we will find nothing that sets out objectives, sets out what we are seeking to achieve through making people Australian citizens. There is nothing here that defines what we mean by what it is to be an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure, there are lots of definitions. Sure, it will tell us how to obtain Australian citizenship. We are dealing with that today when discussing the question of descent. The Act says that people get descent by birth or by adoption. They are matters that are dealt with. It talks about the granting of Australian citizenship. We can go through that in detail, including the effect of a grant of citizenship. It deals with technical matters relating to the impact of citizenship in terms of obtaining certificates and the like. The loss of citizenship is dealt with&mdash;how Australian citizenship can be renounced; how someone can be deprived of it. It deals with children of persons who lose or are deprived of their citizenship. It talks about when people may resume their Australian citizenship if it is lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of detailed provisions that are dealt with in this legislation, but nowhere does it tell us what Australian citizenship is about. Nowhere are there any objectives. We certainly know that there is a citizenship ceremony; it is a legal process prescribed by the Act. Candidates can take an oath or affirmation of allegiance when they make a commitment to this country. We are also told that they can do it according to their own religious format, and they can bring their own bibles or sacred books along for the ceremony. We also know that when they swear an oath or take an affirmation of allegiance they say they will `faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen', but nowhere does the Act say what those duties are. Nowhere does it say what they are getting. Nowhere are these things spelt out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is normally assumed that these duties are along the lines that the applicants are prepared to obey the laws of the country&mdash;I suppose they have to read all these statutes&mdash;and take up their political rights to enrol. All of us have been along to citizenship ceremonies and said, in general terms, `Well, you will be able to vote now', not recognising that some people as former British subjects already had such an entitlement. Other duties would include serving on a jury and helping to defend Australia should the need arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The granting of citizenship brings with it a great deal more than that. There are certain civil and social rights that people obtain through citizenship, although very often they are degraded in a sense because they are also provided to people who have permanent residency in this country. Additional privileges include: appointment to public office, and in some cases there used to be restrictions on people even joining the Public Service although they have been ameliorated over time; eligibility for a passport; immunity from deportation; and service in the Australian armed forces. However, the enunciation of obligations is rarely seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of citizenship in that sense as dealt with by this Act is very shallow indeed and, unfortunately, citizenship because of that is often seen to be something that is handed out and made available very easily after a very short period of residence in Australia. </PARA>

We are very much more a part of the global economy, and I recognise that, but it does not make the concept of the nation obsolete or ineffective. In fact, we have seen a resurgence of nationalism in many countries in recent years, and in this context I think there is a need for us to look also at the issues relating to dual nationality&mdash;a matter that has been put off the agenda on many occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many forces have shaped and continue to shape our image of ourselves and our country. That is a matter we need to look at. The recognition of our history regarding the Aboriginal population and our attempts at reconciliation form part of that process that we are going through, as does legislative action against discrimination, a matter that ought to be on our agendas now, and our policies in relation to cultural diversity and the management of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These things create an environment, a framework, against which we can build a sense of nationhood that is tangible and meaningful to all Australians. These processes are not perfect, but they do exist and they demonstrate a willingness to adapt to the demands of modernity and show the importance we place on values such as equality, acceptance, personal freedom, tolerance and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's national agenda for a multicultural Australia&mdash;stripped of its overt political rhetoric, because there was some of that in it, and its policy initiatives, some of which have been followed up and others of which have been dealt with not so enthusiastically, particularly where budgetary constraints are involved&mdash;did set out in its definition of what was meant by `multiculturalism' some matters that might very well be dealt with in a citizenship document, particularly in its objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that definition of `multiculturalism' we had these points made: cultural identity&mdash;the right of all Australians, within carefully defined limits, to express and share their individual cultural heritage, including their language and religion; social justice&mdash;the right of all Australians to equality of treatment and opportunity, and the removal of barriers of race, ethnicity, culture, religion, language, gender or place of birth; and economic efficiency&mdash;the need to maintain, develop and utilise effectively the skills and talents of all Australians regardless of background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the part that is often overlooked, and an essential part of this definition, covers these statements as limits: multicultural policies are based upon the premise that all Australians should have an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia, its interests and future first and foremost&mdash;not matters spelt out in the Citizenship Act where one might expect that they may be; multicultural policies require that all Australians accept the basic structures and principles of Australian society, the Constitution and the rule of law, tolerance and equality, parliamentary democracy, freedom of speech and religion, English as the national language and equality of the sexes; and that multicultural policies impose obligations as well as confer rights&mdash;the rights to express one's own culture and beliefs involve a reciprocal responsibility to accept the rights of others to express their views and values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those expressions of view as to what we mean by a multicultural society are points that are not at issue. The Government put it out in its national agenda. We indicated, when the Government was prepared to recognise the importance of those limits, that it was a bipartisan approach because it reflected our one-Australia dimension. But it is clear that if we are going to have citizenship which is understood, which is meaningful, if we are going to place a value on what it is to be Australian, then in some place in the objectives of this document it ought to be set out. We ought to say what we mean, say what it is to be Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do give equality of opportunity to all. We do accept that people come to this great country from a variety of backgrounds and that they are entitled to equality of treatment and opportunity. These are the commitments we make to our citizens, but citizens also have a responsibility to accept the overarching and overriding values which are so important and which have brought people to settle in this country, and to give and make a commitment to Australia. We ought to have a citizenship Act that spells out these things, so that when we speak to people at citizenship ceremonies we all know and understand exactly what we mean. I regret that we have not seen a thoroughgoing review of this Act so that we can give it that dimension. For this reason, I hope the Government will take on board and support the amendment that I propose so that it can set about the real task of producing a better Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable members know, we in this House use the quaint expression `Bills of a housekeeping nature' to describe amendments to legislation which are intended either to correct unintended consequences of items of law or to clarify, modernise or simplify previous legislation. Sometimes housekeeping matters are of a very minor consequence, and in other cases the legislative amendments can have a very great impact on the lives of people who come within the ambit of the changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1991 contains a housekeeping matter in the latter category. All honourable members have heard of the unfortunate cases in which people have suffered greatly as a result of the unintended consequences of the Australian Citizenship Act 1984. I am fairly confident that all members of this House would join with me in being pleased to see the arrival of this amendment Bill in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no intention of supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), but he raises some very relevant matters in it. I have already discussed one of those matters with the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), and that is the treatment of ex-servicemen in this country. I agree with the comments of the honourable member for Dundas on this matter, and I am sure the Minister would not disagree either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In part (b) of the honourable member's amendment he made some comments about fraud which worried me. I respectfully suggest to the honourable member, with whom I normally have a very good relationship&mdash;as I did when he visited my constituency&mdash;that if he has any concerns about fraud he should take them to the Minister. I hold the present Minister for Immigration in very high esteem and I am sure he would not entertain any matters of fraud and would have them investigated almost immediately. I suggest to the honourable member for Dundas that he should take it up with the Minister immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was intrigued by the Minister's disclosure of coalition policy that newcomers to this country should wait four years to become citizens. I am looking forward to his next visit to my constituency when he tells my constituents that the Opposition policy is for a waiting period of four years for citizenship. I will hold him to that policy speech when he comes out to Cabramatta in the near future, hopefully before the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To really understand the reasons for this amendment, we need to look at the original Citizenship Act 1949, which, in definitive terms, began the process of setting out the rights of people to become Australian citizens through descent. However, before I begin that process, I will take this opportunity to outline the circumstances of the recent well-publicised problem which has faced a young Australian, Mr Anthony Clyde Robe. By telling the story of his unfortunate dealings with the Citizenship Act, I believe I will give a graphic example of why the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1991 is worthy of support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Robe was born in London in 1959, the son of an American father and an Australian mother. Anthony's mother was a former Miss Tasmania and his grandfather was a respected Tasmanian judge, Justice Gibson. Anthony's parents separated when he was a very young boy. He lived in America with his father and his mother returned to Australia. Prior to the separation he had travelled on his mother's passport. When Anthony reached 18 he was given his own Australian passport in America, despite his not being registered as an Australian citizen. Registration had not occurred because of the Australian law prior to 1 May 1970 which said that Australian registration could not be carried out by the mother unless the baby was born out of wedlock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the tightening of passport procedures which occurred as a recommendation of the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking, Anthony was denied a passport when he recently applied for a new one to come to Australia. Honourable members will recall that Justice Stewart recommended that applicants should produce either a birth certificate or citizenship papers to be given a new passport. Anthony, of course, could produce neither. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The young man was devastated to find that he was not an Australian, particularly as for years his mother had told him of his proud family connections in Tasmania. Fortunately, the Embassy allowed Anthony to come to Australia on a temporary entry visa, although he is now in the ridiculous position of having permanent residence granted but no citizenship until he spends the required period in this country. If it were left to the policy of the Opposition, he would have to wait another four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anthony is only one of many cases who have variants on the same story&mdash;they never knew that they were not Australian citizens; their parents had been responsible for their circumstances. Anthony's problems can be traced as follows. Prior to 1949 the right to Australian citizenship was basically judged by one's status as a British citizen and whether or not the father was an Australian by birth or naturalisation. In 1949 the new Act laid out the process of registration, which needed to be done for a child in the first five years of life to ensure Australian citizenship existed. If, for any one of the thousand reasons that could exist, registration was not carried out in the first five years, the Minister for Immigration held a discretion to register a given person. It did not matter what the age of the person was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Citizenship Act 1984 altered the existing situation by inserting a new section 10B in the Act. This section limited the registration of Australian citizenship by descent to persons under the age of 18. The reason for the amendment was to tighten the procedures to ensure that citizenship existed only for those with genuine ties to Australia. It was felt that, once adulthood had been reached without application for citizenship, ties with Australia could not be described as close. Unfortunately, the amendment failed to consider the myriad of cases which could exist whereby adulthood could be reached without the individual understanding that he or she did not have Australian citizenship. The amendment also failed to consider the consequences of the situation prior to 1 May 1970, whereby registration was not possible through the mother unless the child was born out of wedlock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1991 corrects the problems created in 1984 by allowing people who are not over 18 years of age to apply for registration as an Australian citizen by descent. The only provisos are that those people must have been eligible to apply for registration as Australian citizens prior to the commencement of the 1984 amendment date, and they must have an acceptable reason for not being registered. Those reasons are as pointed out. I would commend the change in the provisions, in the hope that it will help people who may be in similar circumstances to those in the case of Mr Robe, which I have already cited, and in the hope that it will ensure that this situation will not arise again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition, in addressing itself to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4), would like to speak initially about the process by which this legislation is being brought before the House and the need for in-depth discussion and debate on it. Although we are talking about a government department in which welfare takes up $34.408 billion of the Budget, this legislation, too, is being subject to the guillotine. As I always comment just before the end of an autumn session and also now the Budget session, every time a welfare item comes before the</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>House, it is put through at the end of the session in haste and by guillotine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to two other Bills that have been before the House: firstly, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), which was debated in this place only three weeks ago and on which we asked questions about the method used to arrive at some of the definitions. We now find that in the Senate those matters have been addressed and the Bill has been amended, which means that it will have to return to this House for further debate later on. While we are more than happy with the result of questioning the Bill in this House, that goes to indicate that the current raft of legislation that is going through under the guillotine will not be subject to the debate that it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation that I want to refer to mainly is the legislation that went through the House in the May-June autumn session and was subject in the Senate to over 100 amendments. That Bill then had to come back here for amendment after lying in the Senate over the recess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This time last year, we were debating in exactly the same circumstances the charter of residents' rights and also the contract for residents' rights in nursing homes. A tremendous rush was caused on the resources of this House and also the Senate in trying to get something through and in trying to make good legislation out of what was failed and bad legislation. Yet here we are, nearly 12 months into the new year, after being assured that the legislation was required and the charter was required for implementation early in 1991, and it has not yet been implemented within the nursing homes or the hostels around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I put, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and I am sure you would be interested in this, because I know you do not like the guillotine being applied to very basic and important legislation&mdash;is this: what confidence can the people of Australia have when we are forced into these circumstances of legislating in haste and in crisis?  There is no confidence that the legislation that came back to us with 100 amendments is now correct&mdash;and perhaps it will have to be tried before the courts of Australia. But in mentioning that process, all I can say is that it is a failed process; there should be more time for debate and more time for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When looking at the failure of the process, we then only have to look at various aspects of what is happening to this Government at the moment, and we can only conclude that this is a government in crisis. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> we see that the Premiers Conference that was supposed to have gone ahead later this month is now hanging in the balance or has actually been cancelled because the Premiers have savaged the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) over his portrayal as far as fairly basic considerations on devolution are concerned in connection with State taxes. He has precluded that discussion and, therefore, has made this very important Premiers Conference a waste of time. I know that within that Premiers Conference there were to be decisions made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In connection with disability services on the accommodation aspect, there is a Bill coming up within a couple of days on that very aspect which would have been determined at the Premiers Conference. I just ask: why has the Government gone into these arrangements and aborted them because of its own crisis?  We all know what the Premiers Conference was to be about, and we all know what its apparent cancellation is about. It is about the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), trying to become the Prime Minister of Australia. All of this is happening at a time when there are one million people unemployed throughout Australia&mdash;many of whom will be dependent on these Bills. We also have a rural sector and a small business sector awaiting some type of relief because of the massive lack of cash flow being suffered within those sectors at the moment. To anybody listening to and noting the comments in the media it will be obvious that Labor has no answers to the crisis that it has put itself into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did mention that there is a growing cost of welfare. The Budget for 1991-92 predicts an expenditure of $34,408m. It is interesting to reflect on the cost of that welfare in the light of the fact that the number of pay as you earn taxpayers is diminishing. I notice that last year, $40 billion was collected from pay as you earn taxpayers, and this year the sum has been reduced to $37.6 billion. The welfare bill accounts for 90 per cent of the revenue received from pay as you earn taxpayers. It is a sad reflection on the Government when we see it in crisis, when we are legislating under pressure and when increasing pressure is being put onto the productive sector of Australia in connection with just this one item of welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In connection with that cost to welfare, I might just mention what it means to the people of Australia. As I understand it, on the more recent figures, those people on unemployment benefit, or under Jobstart and Newstart arrangements, as they now are, number 720,754. That is the highest level ever reached in Australia&mdash;720,000 Australians are having to resort to the unemployment benefit. If we break that down, we see that every householder in Australia is contributing an unprecedented $5,016 every year towards the cost of welfare. In this particular atmosphere Labor policy is in paralysis, and that is due to internal bickering and trying to turn Australia into something that it does not want to be. That is basically what the position is. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that internal bickering, the Labor Deputy Premier of Queensland, Tom Burns, when speaking about the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, on the ABC just last week, said of the Government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . they don't care about the unemployed&mdash;they haven't done anything for the unemployed for years. . . they couldn't care less about the nation at all, (and) the Keatings and the Richardsons are really not interested in anything else other than themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>What an indictment to have to read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on this very important subject!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps we should talk also of some of the elements of waste that have come to the fore in recent weeks in the Department of Social Security. Probably the one that takes the cake&mdash;and this is occurring while Australians are suffering and have a need for some type of income&mdash;is the fact that the Department of Social Security has gone into the movie business. It has been ascertained that the cost for the Department's corporate television unit is $570,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is really great to start identifying what its videos and movies are used for. For instance, there is a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Corporate Wardrobe</EMPHASIS> video featuring the four final tenders for the DSS corporate wardrobe&mdash;$4,441. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tuggeranong Office Park</EMPHASIS> video, which advises staff of the philosophy behind the Department's new Canberra office, cost $9,885. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Social Worker</EMPHASIS> video featuring `a day in the life of a social worker and how they operate'&mdash;$8,976. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trial Music Video Concept</EMPHASIS> video&mdash;and this is a really great one, a rock video for DSS officers&mdash;cost $890. Two cultural awareness videos for staff cost $31,116. They are just part of it. People of Australia must question whether this type of expenditure is too lavish for Canberra bureaucrats, and bureaucrats generally, while people are suffering hardship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention just one other matter in connection with the Department of Social Security. The Department has a computer program that identifies migrants and assists in the recovery of money. That program has apparently been put out of action and the Department cannot retrieve names. So out of $32m only $1.9m has been identified as being recoverable. The Department expects to be able to trace probably $9m, but at the very best $23m will be wasted because of a computer that will not work, a computer that is not able to provide the information required. It has been possible to identify $9m but there is no indication whatsoever from the Minister that that can be recovered. So the best scenario is a $23m loss. One knows only too well how that money is required in Australia today, particularly when one goes out into the bush and sees the suffering people are undergoing at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to remind honourable members that we are suffering, that Australians are suffering, because we are in a recession that the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), said we had to have. I can only imagine that if the present Treasurer (Mr Kerin) said that it was a recession that we had to have it would receive the approval of every member of the Ministry, including the Minister for Social Security, and also receive the approval of every Labor member and senator in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the effects of the current recession that we had to have. As I have said before, over one million people who want decent employment in Australia are denied access to employment. That is over 10 per cent of the work force. But in the meantime, as I understand it, the work force within the Public Service has increased, which only means that in Canberra I have the feeling that we isolate ourselves completely from the real needs of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us also look at the record bankruptcies that are now being shown up in the statistics. They indicate not only business failures but personal failures and farm failures. These record bankruptcies do not disclose the business closures that are happening right around Australia at the moment. People whose real jobs are producing income for Australia are being terminated right at this moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can also look at the increasing tax burden and the unfairness of the taxation system we have at the moment, particularly when we relate it to small business. This applies not only to conventional forms of taxation. Government these days has instituted a superannuation levy which will be mandatory by 1 July next year&mdash;3 per cent on small businesses and 5 per cent on big businesses. This is only a tax against the income of businesses right around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer also to the one per cent, shortly to be 2 per cent, skill training levy. Skilling Australians was a job traditionally undertaken by government in the universities and tertiary institutions of Australia. By way of taxation, this responsibility has been transferred to employers right around Australia, who are already suffering under that other hidden taxation in high real interest rates. Australians, whether they are buying homes or whether they are in business, are suffering the highest real interest rates of any nation around the world with which we trade. On top of that we see a record debt being built up, not only domestically, but in our foreign transactions. That is the effect of the recession that we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of all these things on the Australian welfare bill will be tremendous. The welfare bill will increase as more productive businesses and jobs go out the back door because of the recession that is now so deeply entrenched within the Australian way of life. If one were to look at it even less cynically than I, one would have to come to the conclusion that this Government lacks compassion and that it has no real sense of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A marvellous statement the Prime Minister made, I think in 1988, was that by the year 1990 no child, no Australian child, would be living in poverty. One must really question this Government's attitude towards social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to spend a few moments on what is becoming a real problem within Australia, and that is rural poverty. I think it is appropriate that we devote some time to trying to bring  to Parliament, and to Canberra, the message about the real effects of what is happening in the bush. I will give a few examples from my own electorate which I do not think are atypical of what is happening around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Dawson, my electorate, sugar prices have been falling over the last 12 to 18 months. During this time Labor has unilaterally reduced the tariff protection once enjoyed. In fact, at the beginning of this year the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), gave an undertaking to the sugar industry that the tariff would not be reduced. But by the time the March economic statement came out there had been effective reductions in those tariffs. When the price of sugar is falling on the world markets, and tariffs are being reduced further, sugar producers are left in a fairly delicate situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the Bowen vegetable and fruit industry, again a typical industry within Dawson. Because of the recession in the south and the cost of freight, it is cheaper for Australians to buy a foreign produced product&mdash;imported tinned pineapple, imported tinned whatever one likes in the fruit and food lines&mdash;than to buy the fresh product. Growers have suffered accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beef and sugar industries in Dawson have been affected by the reduction in US quotas. I believe that the situation will only get worse. If we add to these examples the situation of wool and wheat and the other primary industries around Australia, we build a picture of severe devastation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 11 November there was a story about a place in my State&mdash;one which you would be familiar with, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;called Jericho. The headline is: `Jericho spirit silences the trumpets of doom'. Social security and the means of getting some cash flow are so lean in the Shire of Jericho that it has fallen to the local police constable and the local nursing sister to organise the people of the town and the surrounding area in order to do something about the plight not only of rural property owners but of the working people of that town. There we have another example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you were at Charleville with me within the last two months. There we saw the effects of droughts and floods. We saw the problems of people who are trying to get a cash flow by reconstructing bank and pastoral house loans. We saw the effects of diminishing prices of wool and beef. I am not ascribing any blame to the Government in connection with beef, but I think we can ascribe a lot of the problems with wool to the Government because of its failure to act on the unrealistic bench price for wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is example after example. In the last fortnight one of my colleagues heard of a young man in the north of Queensland who suicided because for three years he was unable to get work and he was no longer prepared to be a burden on his parents. There are the stories of an elderly couple thrown out of their home when they could not meet the interest payments, and of the young couple evicted from their station property with two little kids to feed and not a cent for the next week's food bill. Do we in this House have any appreciation whatsoever of the plight of the people outside of these hallowed houses and buildings of Canberra? I do not think we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of all the things I have categorised, within the last 12 months we have had the leader of the Labor Party rural task force going into the country and saying that there is no rural crisis. The next best thing he could have said is that the farmers have never had it so good. That is a famous saying of about two decades ago by another Labor leader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) was asked to speak to the Bowen growers in connection with their plight and to see what could be done. There was a refusal to meet with them. Also, the State Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Casey, flew in on an aircraft and spent half an hour with these people, even though he had arrived three or four hours late himself. The same Mr Casey said, `There is no drought in Queensland. There is plenty of water in the dams. It is just that we have had a prolonged dry'. That is the type of reaction that has prevented governments both in Canberra and in Queensland moving in connection with the crisis, which is only deepening and bringing greater despair. It is a critical point that we all have to address. It does not matter where we are or what we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just last Monday week in my own electorate, 300 cane farmers and other interested people who have an income from cane met in a crisis meeting. They were concerned about quite a few things. One was the effect of the drought and another was the effect of prices. Both have considerably shortened the 1991 season; the cash flow has stopped at this point. They will get a little cash flow between now and June but they cannot really expect anything until the commencement of the 1992 season. In two mill areas within the Mackay area, the 1992 season is already a disaster. There are people ploughing out dead cane and dead plants because they do not have the water to keep them alive. Their cash flow is going to be affected not only for the 1991 season but also for the 1992 season. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that comes out&mdash;I think people right across Australia will recognise this&mdash;is that there is a pride within the farming and rural communities of Australia that says people do not want the Government to help them. They often deny themselves, unintentionally, the assistance which is their right and entitlement. The greatest thing that they have to do is to put their pride in their pocket and to ask people and governments for consideration for the plight they are in. It does have a terrible effect on social feeling and the feeling of being worth while within a community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a situation such as this, I believe the Government, and particularly the Department of Social Security, would do well to put more social and financial counsellors in the field so that they can address the problems of pride, first of all, and just give people directions to where they can gain assistance. It is just a simple philosophy of addressing the problems not only of the rural community but also of those people who depend on that community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a real mockery to turn to the fact that $570,949 was spent on videos by the Department of Social Security and that, at worst, $32m could have been lost because a computer broke down. What other business in Australia could suffer a loss of $32m and still survive?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there has to be a fundamental realignment of this Parliament and this Government with the needs of the people of Australia. In the immediate future, it is the desperate shortage of cash flow that people require relief from&mdash;whether they have been retrenched from a job, whether their business has gone broke, or whether they face the perils of natural disaster, as many are. If, instead of having to rely on the policeman and nursing sister, who no doubt have enough work to do themselves, we could get, out at Jericho, information centres from the Department of Social Security, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and any of the other departments to which we normally turn for assistance and help, that would be a strong point in making contact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need rural counsellors so that people will be encouraged to apply for relief and benefits from the programs that are available to them. They might also assist in trying to talk to bankers and other people whom we must rely upon to play their part in this regard. We must quicken the Social Security reaction to the areas of difficulty. I go back to the liquid assets test for the hardship provisions which came to this House three or four weeks ago. I would not say it stymied the benefits flowing but, when some people looked at the liquid assets test, as it then applied, many would have been discouraged from applying for the benefits. The situation is different now but we must quicken our reaction to the plight of people in rural areas, particularly with rural assistance procedures that are in place at a State level. There is a need for others to participate in this crisis&mdash;that is, the bankers in loan reconstruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just spoken of a few of the problems that I have witnessed and which are available through any papers. There are situations such as this all over Australia. I suggest that in the middle of Sydney there are people in suburbs facing the same despair, the same lack of encouragement, and just wondering where to go. We must also realise that, as I made the comparison of the amount of PAYE and business taxation, there must be the realisation in this recession that that type of income available to the Government is getting less and less while the pressures on it are becoming greater and greater as people become unemployed and fall into the welfare net. All this adds up to more despair for more Australians right across the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I apologise for taking the time of the Parliament on this matter when I perhaps should have been addressing the Bill itself. I do not want to reiterate what is in the Bill. I am sure that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), who is on the Government side and who will follow me, will reiterate that, line and verse. The Opposition supports the Bill but we ask the Government to look realistically at the problems that are presenting themselves to Australians outside of these hallowed halls, and this hallowed building, in what is sometimes described as a city without a soul. There are people in the community who are hurting massively, and Governments can help them in many ways. That relief will have to come sooner rather than later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak in support of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991. I would like to respond to some of the points made by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). He did not really concentrate on the Bill at all; he made a wide-ranging speech about social welfare and even brought in rural questions. I believe that I should respond to some of the points that he made. Firstly, he attacked the Government for using the guillotine. I can recall Mick Young, when he was Leader of the House, saying how much he learnt from the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I guess that the present Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has learnt a lot from both. It is true that both sides indulge in the guillotine. Generally, my view is that it is brought about by legislation being prepared late. While I believe that this is not particularly acceptable, it does seem to be something that we have not been able to get away from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I object, in particular, to late nights. I sometimes arrive at Parliament House at 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. and not getting home until midnight is quite ridiculous. I have said to my own parliamentary caucus and my colleagues on the other side of the House that it is time we learnt that the right time to go to bed is when it gets dark and the right time to get up is when the sun comes up. If more people go to bed with the chooks and get up with the chooks this place would be a lot happier and there would be a lot less fighting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) also said he felt that the Government was getting away from what the Premiers Conference was trying to do on welfare. Already a number of measures are in place that have been agreed to by the Premiers and the Federal Government on important welfare issues. We have to take into account the fact that there are plenty of objections from organisations which claim that they are going to lose out, as are their clients, by some of the things that are being discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to face up to the fact that there may be another Premier like we had in Queensland who did not particularly believe in youth refuges. People come to this Parliament and say to us, `Our Premier is no longer prepared to give us these important facilities. We have children who have been kicked out of their homes and children who do not have homes. What are you going to do about it?'. We have to do something. We cannot accept the situation to occur where we do not care about those who are in need of welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My personal view is that there ought to be a diversion of a lot of welfare administration from State to local governments because they are closer to the people and are able to assess far better than either Federal or State governments. They would even be able to make better assessments than we do in some areas of social security entitlements. I have long held the view that the system is not particularly good, especially in welfare areas. It is not particularly effective from an efficiency point of view, nor is it particularly effective when looking at the real needs of people. Assessments cannot be made, whether it is in Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney or Canberra, nearly as well as in local areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dawson criticised the expenditure of this Government. Most of the time the expenditure on social security by this Government has been less than what it was under the Fraser Government. In spite of the present unemployment level, if we look at total spending over many years in real terms, we see that this Government has a pretty good record. If we look at the first seven years of this Government compared with the seven years of the Fraser Government, we see that this Government's record is pretty good. </PARA>

That $570,000 may be important in improving staff morale, understanding staff, keeping staff up to date with changes that have occurred and the need to develop attitudes and encourage people to train and get training. The honourable member talks about Canberra bureaucrats, but he did not mention that the people at the counters of Social Security offices in his electorate in Mackay, in my electorate in Queanbeyan and in the electorate of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) are facing tragedy&mdash;perhaps farmers are facing tragedy&mdash;and they are not particularly happy about going to the office. The people at the counters are facing hostility and have to put up with peak numbers at certain times. They may need the information and instruction that is being provided by these videos. I believe it is important to keep them in touch, particularly the people who are at the coalface in the offices of the Department of Social Security. They need plenty of information.

His inquiries will include investigating reports that an Australian aid worker was present at the event and may have been injured. May I interpolate in the answer I have prepared on this matter to say in respect of the specific part of the Leader of the Opposition's question which related to the possible connection with earlier events that we will see that the officer there conducting those inquiries looks at that issue as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesian Ambassador said in his discussions at DFAT this morning that the Indonesian Government is viewing yesterday's events seriously and would undertake a thorough investigation, and that it regrets the deaths which have occurred. Ambassador Siagian gave our officials an account of the incident based on what he said were preliminary reports. He said that violence had erupted following an attack by demonstrators on an Indonesian army officer. We are not, of course, in a position to assess the accuracy of conflicting reports of the incident. We do welcome the Indonesian Government's acknowledgment of the seriousness of the situation and its decision to undertake an investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I say, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory said in his press release today, that the Australian and Indonesian governments have both worked hard&mdash;as I think all honourable members acknowledge&mdash;on the basis of goodwill on both sides to build a responsible and beneficial relationship between our two countries. That relationship is one to which not only my Government attaches great importance; I think that is an importance also shared in the minds of all honourable members. East Timor, we must say, has always been an area of concern in that relationship. We have recognised Indonesia's sovereignty over East Timor, but we have constantly expressed our concern about human rights abuses there. We have consistently done that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, the Government has made no assessment of the impact of a consumption tax of 15 per cent or any other rate because we have no interest in introducing such a regressive, unfair, administratively complex tax. Of course, we have been aware of several figures being mooted by those opposite as the Opposition's chosen initial rate. It is a bit like their chosen initial date of announcement. It was going to be 15 September, 21 October and 17 November&mdash;a bit like their health policy. Whatever is announced, we shall be making our assessment based on the details. We are not that silly. With all the big smirks on their faces, the 15 per cent could be a leak so that a lower rate might be proposed by these conservatives so that the public will see it as a welcome relief. One thing we know for certain is that, whatever rate is planned, it will be raised&mdash;and probably sooner rather than later.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the effects of a GST on country Australians, I can do no better than report the recent observations of an elected representative of country Australia with a rare pedigree. I refer to reports yesterday of comments by the State member for Flinders in the Queensland Parliament, Mr Bob Katter Jr. Yesterday he announced his intention to seek National Party preselection for the seat of Kennedy. As a candidate, young Bob is emphatic about the impact of a GST on country Australia. Asked where he stood on a goods and services tax, he said that it was not up to him to sell the goods and services tax to the people of Kennedy but to sell to Canberra the attitude of the people of Kennedy, `which on the whole was antagonistic'. Bob Jr went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't hesitate to say . . . that if that GST is on foodstuffs then I have some enormous difficulties in going along with it.</PARA>
<PARA>Asked whether he would seek to be a Minister in Canberra, Mr Katter said that he was not going to Canberra to opt for obscurity. If elected, he said, he would pump heavily for a strong leadership role. After saying that he was going for a strong leadership role, he also said that he did not know what vertical fiscal imbalance was and that he would not be learning. But, amazingly, he said that he disagreed with the Leader of the National Party, Mr Tim Fischer, over the coalition's proposed GST. So here is a bloke running for preselection, and the first thing that he says is that he disagrees with his parliamentary leader.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Bob Katter Jnr ever gets anything right in his life, it seems that the GST and its effect on country Australians is it. He knows, as all of us on this side know&mdash;and as the current National Party Leader knows&mdash;that the Nationals out in the bush will be running away from the GST as fast as they can once they see the figures. He knows that it does not matter what rate is announced in the GST package, because the Nationals in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia will not have a bar of it; nor will the Australian people. The people of Kennedy, of course, will know. They now know that there is only one person to vote for in the next election who is in a party that has a policy of opposition to a goods and services tax. One can imagine the slogan now: `Don't vote for a Nat rat. Vote 1 Rob Hulls'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. I ask him whether he has seen an article in the Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun</EMPHASIS> newspaper early this week claiming that patients face a massive hike in the cost of attending their general practitioner. What is the Government doing to guarantee that all Australians have access to quality health care in general practice at an affordable cost?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2954" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; HEALTH, HOUSING AND COMMUNITY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. There was such an article. It claimed that the changes to Medicare rebates to commence on 1 December will force a number of larger clinics in Brisbane to stop bulkbilling. That, of course, is untrue. On 1 December there will be three changes which affect the amount received by a doctor for a bulkbilled service provided to a patient who is a non-card holder. Firstly, the net Commonwealth payment for the service will be reduced by $2.50. Secondly, the doctor will be entitled to make up that reduction of $2.50 by charging the patient. Thirdly, the medical benefits schedule will rise by 3.57 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that means is that the reduction in fees by $2.50 is cancelled out by the payment of $2.50 by the patient to the doctor. So the doctor is no worse off. After adding the increase in the Medicare schedule, for the most common GP consultation the doctor could in fact receive an increase of 85c per consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, far from being worse off under the new scheme, a general practitioner giving a bulkbilled service could be 85c better off than before. Of course, if particular clinics have been encouraging patients to attend unnecessarily, the modest $2.50 price signal will lead to some patients resisting this bad medical practice and could lead to a drop in volume of services and a drop in income for those clinics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is concerned that the leadership of the AMA has seized on the changes to Medicare to renew its seven-year-old call for doctors to abandon bulkbilling. We will monitor the impact of the changes, and we will know within weeks of any change in the pattern of bulkbilling in State or Federal electorates or in postcode areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to take place from 1 December are part of a broader package of reforms announced to general practice funding. This package includes the allocation of $12m in 1991-92 for demonstration practice grants. Consultations are being held with representatives of the medical profession on the nature of the demonstration projects and on the criteria for their selection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Demonstration projects will be selected through a wide national advertising campaign. Initial advertisements informing doctors of the availability of this money will appear in the national press this weekend. Practices which otherwise approach the Government to express interest in trying innovative approaches in line with the general aims of the formal program due to commence on 1 July 1992 will also be considered. The practitioners being funded as demonstration projects will be encouraged to act as a broad reference group to assist in the development of the ongoing program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason at all to see any reduction for bulkbilling in terms of doctors' income. Quite the reverse, on a consultation basis there could be an increase. Because of what the Government has put in place, in the next few months we will begin to see demonstration projects that flow from our concern with the quality of general practice.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of various statements by Opposition spokesmen of their intention to announce substantial cuts in government expenditure in conjunction with their release of their plans for foisting a value added tax on this country. Of course, at the same time those opposite are saying that, we have the rather ludicrous situation of the Leader of the National Party continuing to make statements about the need for greatly increased expenditure in various areas. For instance, not so long ago he called for an extra $1 billion for roads in Queensland. We can presumably multiply that by five for the Australian expenditure.

In 1989 those opposite nailed their colours to a figure of $2 3/4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the impact of such cuts on social justice would be quite severe, as was shown by the details of the Opposition's 1989 cuts.

The most notorious was to cut unemployment benefits off after nine months and make special benefits available to about half of those knocked off unemployment benefits after nine months, so saving $665m. Others were to slash labour market programs by about half to save $200m, to cut half a billion dollars off welfare expenditure, to cut $200m off education and to cut $100m off Aborigines.

<PARA>The document goes on to look at ways in which one might seek to redress that inherent regressivity of a value added tax. It recommends against trying to make the tax less regressive by such things as extended exemptions or zero rating or different rates because it says that would make the tax complex and costly. So it recommends dealing with this issue how? By increased expenditure on low income earners. What is this Opposition planning to do? It is planning to slash government expenditure on an array of low income earners&mdash;on Aborigines, on the unemployed, on other people who are recipients of welfare.In other words, in the context of introducing a regressive tax which, according to the IMF, one can seek to redress to some degree at least by increasing expenditure on people who are on lower incomes&mdash;targeting the poor&mdash;the Opposition intends to do the opposite.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning I launched the Travel Safe campaign, which is the next phase of the national AIDS education campaign. It will provide relevant information to almost five million travellers who enter and leave this country each year. The focus of the campaign is, as always, to make HIV and AIDS personally relevant and to educate everyone about the risk of HIV transmission and the measures people can take to protect themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AIDS does not need a passport. It has crossed most boundaries in the world. Australians who travel overseas should travel safe. I think honourable members ought to be interested in this issue. Up to this point I think we have had considerable success with a series of campaigns and work that has been done cooperatively between the Commonwealth and the States to deal with an issue which is a great tragedy, particularly on the continent of Africa but also within South East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians who travel overseas, as are those who travel to this country, are involved, if one likes, in one of the most serious risks to human health that has faced us, certainly within the twentieth century. We have had success, but it is important that we take the approach that we have developed so successfully on into this area of travel, which is becoming increasingly important around the world and which can place this country at very serious risk. We have been partially successful because, in the messages that we have delivered we have been frank and honest, but then we have not sought to judge or to blame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Travel Safe campaign is based on the Commonwealth Government's major dictum in its education prevention programs: it is not who you are but what you do that puts you at risk. There is clear evidence that people behave differently when on holidays or away from home and that they do not always behave as they expect they will. The aim of the campaign is to provide information which impresses travellers of the relative ease of protecting themselves and others from HIV infection and staying healthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of media attention on the issue of HIV infection and foreign travel has concentrated on the industry of sex tourism, but it is also important that people recognise that there are other risks&mdash;for example, for people for whom it is necessary to have blood transfusions in countries in which blood is not screened as it is in Australia; for people who need regular injections and who will require clean injecting equipment, people such as those who suffer from diabetes; and for people who might seek to have their ears pierced or to have acupuncture, tattoos or simple operations of that kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the features of this particular campaign has been the great support that has come to it from the people involved in the travel and tourist industry. For the first time in the world, in Australia the airlines are cooperating to ensure that something like 80 per cent of all airline tickets for travel to and from Australia will have warnings or advice concerning the need for people to be aware of the dangers of AIDS when travelling. This campaign is an extraordinarily important one. The cooperation of the industry that has the closest interest in travel is very much appreciated by the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What had happened was that the Premiers had agreed to begin discussing better ways of dealing with the environment. Discussions had been going on for about nine months in relation to that issue. The basis of those discussions was not that the Commonwealth would give up any of its powers in relation to foreign affairs or corporations, or whatever other powers it may have; nor would it give up its interest in protecting the environment for the good of the national interest. What it was looking at&mdash;and I hope there will still be the opportunity for this&mdash;is the rationalisation of processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we had achieved quite substantial improvement in those processes. We had reached the stage of draft 11. The views that I expressed, which were outlined in this Parliament, referred to draft 3. I believe there has been considerable progress since that time.

We believe that if the channels of communication can be kept open, particularly on an issue such as the environment, a great deal can be achieved. Take, for example, the issue where I believed there had been substantial agreement: environmental assessment processes. There had basically been agreement on one environmental assessment process for Australia. I think that is a great step forward and I believe it would be a great shame if we did not bring those talks to some fruition and get agreement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The scheme is targeted to assist areas, particularly in rural Australia, which are confronting particularly high levels of unemployment or which include large numbers of unemployed people. The inclusion of the training wage element has meant that we have required negotiations with unions and employers and variations to awards. I am pleased to say that we have achieved changes to awards which cover local government employment in Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia; and industrial agreements have already been signed covering New South Wales and the Brisbane City Council. As at the end of October there were 565 participants in the scheme in Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland, and we still believe that it is possible to fill the 4,500 placements which we had in mind for this year.</PARA></TALK.START>

This has been held up because of the intractable negotiations between the unions and the employer association. On the union side, the Victorian Trades Hall Council is yet to endorse the program, largely because of the training wage element, although discussions are continuing with my Department and, hopefully, this matter can be resolved with the Trades Hall Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of far greater concern has been the attitude of the Victorian Branch of the Municipal Employees Union, which in May indicated its opposition to this program and which has refused to budge an inch since that time. Other unions have followed the MEU's lead in Victoria and have refused to endorse the program. Nevertheless, the MEU in other States has cooperated with the program, and of course that is why we are getting some placements under way in those other States.</PARA>

I appreciated the fact that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Choice </EMPHASIS>magazine and the Australian Consumers Association had shown an interest in that area, as they have traditionally. I was concerned as well that they chose to use a few flippant comments in that article. I think we need to keep in mind that the Government, in its approach to road safety and the reduction of the road trauma, necessarily pursues it in a number of different ways and will continue to do that. Not only this Government but preceding governments, as I have indicated on other occasions, have quite correctly shown a bipartisan approach to something which is a very serious national question and a matter of great social and personal concern to many people who are affected by it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we need to keep in mind that, as a result of the approaches that have been taken, the dimension of the road trauma in Australia has continued to decline since records have been kept. Coordinated figures that we have for last year and so far this year indicate that the results have been the best on record. When we take into account the fact that the number of licensed motorists or riders in Australia has increased substantially, the number of motor vehicles has increased, and the population has increased, those improvements should bring a great deal of satisfaction to anyone who is concerned about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The peak year was in 1970, when approximately 3,800 people died on Australian roads. Progressively the number reduced to about 2,800 a couple of years ago. Last year it was 2,300. The number continues to decline all of the time. We need to keep in mind as well that, if the trend that had been established up till 1970 had been maintained after 1970, that would have represented between 1970 and today, a period of 21 years, an additional number of about 45,000 people who would have died on Australian roads. If we were to do nothing about the 2,300 number for last year, that would come to represent 23,000 people who would die on Australian roads over the next 10 years. That is the equivalent of the population of a significant country town in Australia. If we did nothing about those 50,000 people who were injured on our Australian roads last year, that would come to represent half a million people who would be injured over the next 10 years. So of course we have to continue to do something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 70 per cent of the people who died on our roads were either drivers or passengers in motor vehicles. In 1989 we decided to introduce a program to bring about improvements in motor vehicle occupant protection. As part of that, we have recently allocated three-quarters of a million dollars to ensure that the current program could be undertaken. It is being pursued by the Federal Office of Road Safety in connection with Monash University. We have, for example, seven major car models in Australia. Those standard cars have been purchased and crash tested. The results of the crash testing have been forwarded to Autoliv in Germany, which is one of the leading companies in the world in the area of occupant protection, seat belts and air bags. It is in the process now of assessing the results of that crash testing. We will then be in a position to assess that. We will crash another three cars under these controlled conditions at the beginning of next year and, as a result of that, we will be able to bring together a much more comprehensive understanding of the sorts of measures that can be adopted to ensure that car drivers and passengers of motor vehicles are given greater protection.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we raise as a matter of public importance the failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to provide the leadership necessary to bring about essential reforms in Federal-State relations. Yesterday, we had the very unhappy news that the forthcoming Special Premiers Conference, long set down for November, would not be attended by the Premiers and that they were only prepared to go and attend a meeting among themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To set the background to this particular disaster in Australian politics, let me take honourable members back to 30 October 1990. I quote from the words of the Prime Minister in opening the Special Premiers Conference in Brisbane that day. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our agreed goal can be simply stated in this last decade of the first century of the Australian Federation to make the Federation work better.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe we are agreed that the purpose of setting such a goal is to improve our national efficiency and international competitiveness and to improve the delivery and quality of the services we provide as governments for the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Speaking to the Premiers, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But your response so far convinces me that never has the time been so propitious as indeed it has never been so urgent and compelling for a new effort, a new approach and a new spirit of cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA>We say `Amen' to that. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those areas which we are looking at today cover the full range of inter-governmental relationships, the general financial arrangements, tied grants, micro-economic reform, duplication of services, the environment and industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on he said&mdash;and I think these words were very important and we, certainly on our side of the House, supported him fully:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot emphasise too strongly the need for us all to move our thinking beyond old fixed ideas of centralism or States rights, of the Commonwealth versus the States. I believe the people we represent expect us to rise above that. The guiding test for everything we do here should be what is best for all our citizens and our fellow Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>I take honourable members back to the response of the Opposition to the Prime Minister's call, which was to support it 100 per cent. Honourable members might recall that the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Greiner, was fulsome in his praise of the Prime Minister's taking this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might also say that given that Australia faces problems of a kind that it has not faced for 60 years, and probably the need for structural change of a kind that it has not faced since the beginning of Federation, it was doubly important that the initiative be taken to sort out the financial and administrative arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States. No higher purpose could have been pursued by the Prime Minister at this most difficult time in our history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we have now? We have extremely bad news from the States. This whole edifice which the Prime Minister has been labouring to build is lying in ruins. We take no satisfaction in that. We applauded the announcement of its construction; we offered our support. We have given encouragement all along the way. But now we find that the whole edifice is collapsing not because of flaws in the architecture but because of the collapse of the firm carrying out the construction. Like so many of the great builders throughout Australia that this Government has sent crashing into bankruptcy, the firm of Hawke and Co. is itself in the hands of the receivers as a result of its own shady deals and duplicitous behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also, I might say, an element of farce attaching to the collapse of this particular conference. The night before last the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) were sitting in the Prime Minister's office in Canberra&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Costello" NAMEID="CT4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr Costello</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which Treasurer?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr CARLTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The current one; the current Treasurer. Also, the Premiers of the various States were sitting in their respective offices for an hour and a quarter while they tried to get a phone link-up put in place by Telecom. After an hour and a quarter the Premier of New South Wales said he had another pressing engagement and that if our technology and our systems were not sufficient to bring about this linkage between the leaders of our country, he had to go off and do something else. I do not know whether some Telecom technician was in the Keating camp or what the reason for this was, and no doubt more information will emerge in time, but it was a pathetic situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the following day the Prime Minister had an ignominious scramble to the telephone again so that at 11 o'clock he could speak for an hour or so with the Premiers. Regrettably, the Premiers no longer trusted the Prime Minister; therefore, they were not prepared to sit down and talk with him in what was to be an historic conference. That is a tragedy for Australia, for all of us, and we profoundly regret it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did this occur? The fundamental reason it occurred is that there is a collapse of the authority of the Prime Minister. He has lost the confidence of his own Party, of the Premiers who belong to his own Party, and of the various interest groups that make up the elements of power and support for a Prime Minister in the whole of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the best commentators on this issue of power at the top is Richard Neustadt, who has written a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Presidential Power: The Politics of Leadership from FDR to Carter</EMPHASIS>. This book is recognised internationally as one of the best studies&mdash;and it takes the American Presidents as its example&mdash;of how power can be exercised and preserved. Every leader has to rely on a number of groups and bodies in any community for support, and a leader uses that power carefully. A leader can squander that power by deceitful behaviour, by bad behaviour, and if, over a period, a leader comes to a very important time in a nation's history and the power that must be used has been squandered, then that leader's capacity to deal with the problems of the nation is diminished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have here a gradual destruction of the trust in this Prime Minister through his own actions. If we look at the various events that have occurred, we can go right back to the Prime Minister's move towards the leadership of the Labor Party and his replacement of the then Leader of the Party, the current Governor-General, Mr Hayden. We know a lot more about that now than we knew before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, we had the testimony recently of Phillip Adams who told the story of the Prime Minister ringing him up and suggesting to him that there was market research material around which was very damaging to Mr Hayden. Mr Adams was asked to place that in the press as if it had come from somewhere else. It was duplicitous behaviour, and it was something that came out afterwards. The manner of accession of the Prime Minister to the leadership of the Labor Party came to be regarded by his colleagues as something which would lessen their trust in him as Prime Minister. From the very beginning there was an erosion of the trust that is needed for leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We go on to the taxation summit, and one of the critical elements of economic policy which is currently a matter of debate. In that tax summit the Prime Minister and his then Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), argued passionately for a broadly based consumption tax to be brought in as a critical element of policy. Everybody now knows that the Prime Minister takes exactly the opposite view, and they know, as a result of that, that this is a person who simply cannot be trusted on matters of high policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also know, and this is something much more serious in terms of integrity, about the Kirribilli conspiracy when the Prime Minister sat down with his then Treasurer and good friend and they both decided to mislead the Australian public in the course of an election campaign about the future of the prime ministership. It was only because the Prime Minister ratted on that deal and deceived the person with whom he made it that the other person spilled the beans. But we all knew then, everybody knew, that this was another element of failure of trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had the extraordinary situation of WA Inc. Do honourable members recall that for weeks and weeks Mr Burke was sitting over there in Dublin in disgrace and eventually it was Mr Burke himself who decided to remove himself? As the Leader of the Opposition said at the time, even in his disgrace Mr Burke knew what to do; yet the Prime Minister did not. That was another critical event in this diminution of trust that people might have in the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to the more recent disintegration of trust amongst Ministers. We have had a whole succession of Ministers openly defying their Prime Minister, openly leaking Cabinet secrets. Any Prime Minister in control of a situation would surely, early on, have been able to discipline these Ministers. Yet time after time they go on television and openly defy the Prime Minister. They leak complete Cabinet documents. One was leaked only this week. They have been leaking now for months. We have had extraordinary displays of sheer contempt for Cabinet Government, and the Prime Minister has been totally unable to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all have had discussions in the corridors with people opposite, with Ministers, who might perhaps be tired and, some of them, emotional when they tell us these stories. But they are openly talking about each other in a way which portrays loss of trust. So we have the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) being the first one to say that the Prime Minister should go; we have a situation where the President of the Labor Party, the organisational head of the Prime Minister's own Party, is actively working against him; we have the chief Whip, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) organising against him; we have&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know he is in New York. That does not stop him; the Minister knows that. There will be a phone bill, and we will investigate that. It might be like the Dublin phone. New York to Sydney might be the same as Dublin to Sydney and Canberra. We will have a look at that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we have a collapse with the ACTU. The ACTU is another power base for the Prime Minister. What have we got there? We have the Secretary of the ACTU openly in conflict and openly supporting the honourable member for Blaxland. So one of the bases of power of the Prime Minister&mdash;another one, the ACTU&mdash;has been squandered and there is no longer any trust there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem it has is the deal done with the loony Left: the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;the concessions on policy day by day&mdash;there because of the deal done with the loony Left. So if we are looking at Richard Neustadt's approach to the diminution of power, the squandering of authority, this Prime Minister has squandered his authority from the very beginning. The squandering has mounted in the same way as he has squandered the nation's resources and now, at a time when Australia is at its worst point for 60 years, he has not got the authority and he cannot command the trust even of a majority of Labor Premiers to call a conference on a matter of major national importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is nothing to be happy about. This is a national tragedy. People in the community are desperate. There are a million people unemployed. People are looking for a light on the hill. They are looking for leadership. They are looking for relief. What do they see in the heart of government? They see an absolute shambles in the Government. They see a Prime Minister who has squandered the trust that he built up initially&mdash;the enormous popularity&mdash;and all they can say, like Cromwell, is, `The Government has been here too long. For God's sake, go'. And it should go because it has totally lost the trust of the Australian people and it has certainly created astonishing difficulty for almost every Australian. It is time it had the decency to resign. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the speech of the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), I am not absolutely certain of what he had to say, because he did tend to ramble a bit about his view of the historiography of the rise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to power and his continuation in office, which is a historiography and story that I think will not be well recognised around the chamber or anywhere else in the rest of the country. All one can say is that that very mild mannered honourable member obviously carries an awful lot of frustrated spleen. He has at last had an opportunity to be given a canter by the Opposition to see how he might go on this particular topic&mdash;he reduced us all to absolute tears of boredom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member has a point which ought to be debated in this chamber, that is, the direction of Federal-State relations and the recent attitudes and actions of the Premiers and of the Federal Government. I think that is a matter that we are entitled to air in this place&mdash;and ought to air in this place&mdash;because the matter of Federal-State relations is invariably going to be one of substantial public policy in this country. It is a shame that he spent effectively four or five minutes of his speech on that and another 10 minutes on an attempted denigration of the man who has won more elections in this country than anyone else bar Bob Menzies. That is a pretty enviable record. Obviously somebody who does that is no dolt, nor is he a person who fails to enjoy the confidence of the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member feels that the Australian polity can be compared with the polity that Kenneth Kaunda has had to deal with, he is even more unrealistic in his attitude to politics than his speech appeared to indicate. But so be it. If that is the point at which he comes forward with his political analysis, that perhaps explains the rest of his speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, though, has to watch itself very carefully in this area of the Premiers Conference. That conference broke down on one central issue, and it is not surprising that it did. It broke down because it is the ambition of a number of the Premiers to reverse decisions that have been taken over the years and have effectively excluded them&mdash;they are not actually legally excluded, but effectively excluded, politically&mdash;from the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the package that the Opposition is going to produce in another week or so, this is a very important consideration indeed, because if the Opposition performs as it has indicated it wishes to, it will create an environment in which a State income tax or indirect tax, as a means of raising resources for the State, will for the first time become practically politically possible. What the Opposition has said is not only that it will introduce a new tax, that is, a broad based consumption tax, but also that it will cheerfully, as indicated by its attitude on this, open up the possibilities for State governments to tax either in the indirect area or in the income tax area, and indeed will wish to encourage them to do so. So not only will the Opposition front the polls next time round with one new tax, but also it will effectively front with one new tax implemented by itself and open encouragement to the States to introduce the second. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell those opposite that our slogan at the next election will be, `No new taxes'. It worked remarkably well for somebody else in another country in recent political times, and it will work remarkably well for us. The Opposition, as usual, in its sloppy formulation of public policy, has let the cat out of the bag. There will be an opportunity, which indeed it will support, for the States to go down the road of establishing their own taxation systems. Let me go through this a bit further. In the income tax area we have a situation in which any government that came in and tried to impose at State level some form of surcharge on Commonwealth taxation levels, would invariably, in public perception, be seen as imposing an unnecessarily high burden of income tax on the ordinary citizen in this country and would suffer political penalties as a result. It would indeed be doing that; it would be imposing too high an income tax burden on the average citizen in this country. Therefore, the States do not do it, and the fear of penalties is the only thing that stops them doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no constitutional inhibition on any State government imposing a new income tax&mdash;none. The States are perfectly entitled to impose income taxes if they wish to. The Constitution permits them to do it. The fact that they do not is based on a set of court interpretations which say that where the State and Federal levels of government have concurrent powers, the Commonwealth shall prevail. In other words, the Commonwealth gets first bite at the cherry. If the Commonwealth has bitten to the point of political acceptability, and no level higher than what the Commonwealth has bitten is conceivably acceptable, then the States do not tax. That is basically the situation which exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the attractions of the consumption tax for governments&mdash;all one has to do is to look at the evidence of the way in which they have gone&mdash;is that they can bring in a consumption tax at a certain level, say, 8 1/2 per cent, pretend not to do terribly much with it, make massive cuts in public outlays, bring down income tax, and then, because the public are not invariably convinced that an addition in tax and a price rise in their goods accordingly are the product of inflation or a product of a competitive policy, or lack of competitive policy, by the retailer&mdash;or a product of government taxation&mdash;ramp that consumption tax way through the roof. And have not governments done it!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">British consumption taxes started out at 8 1/2 per cent or thereabouts, from memory; they are now 17 per cent. Similarly, in the rest of Europe, the level of consumption tax started out either in the low double digits or again in single digits, and in many countries in Europe the consumption tax rate is now over 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States could impose some taxes in that area. There would be some constitutional inhibitions on them doing so, but they could work their way around that. With the wholesale sales tax they can do very little, but once somebody has established a broadly based consumption tax so that everybody is paying a very substantial amount, they too can lever themselves in for the odd additional percentage point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With its proposals in the consumption tax area, the Opposition firstly by the possibility of political concealment in the area of a consumption tax, and secondly by the proposition to substantially reduce income tax rates, is setting up for the first time since World War II a serious political opportunity to give the States the capacity to do what they can legally do anyway. Honourable members can imagine the situation where a State Government has decided for various reasons&mdash;it has a good majority, it does not have a problem in the upper House or it is the beginning of a four-year term&mdash;to slip in the odd income tax to do one or two things that it might like to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fellow who really understands these things is John Stone, who used to reside in high circles in the Opposition until the last election campaign and has now been removed. He knows what to do with consumption taxes. He knows that once a consumption tax is in we just keep ramping away. We know that the public will always be confused about whether the price rises they come across at the counter when buying their goods in their corner store, their supermarket or wherever are caused by inflation or something else. He knows that they are never going to be absolutely certain what produced that price rise. It is a great little tax for the people who have no concern whatsoever about the levels of taxation that the public pays. Is it not just like the Opposition!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we came into office we had a taxation system that had been perverted because the upper income earners and the business community in this country had found a plethora of ways to escape it. The Opposition ladled taxation onto the ordinary people in this country. How did it ladle it on? It did not actually increase income tax payments&mdash;though it did allow bracket creep to ensure that the ordinary individual paid a bit more in tax&mdash;it ladled it on with petrol taxes. Once the Opposition got the petrol taxes in place, it could afford to move those up and the general public never really knew whether it was the Arabs, the Government or the petroleum companies doing it. It was not an exposed and obvious tax in the way in which income tax is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In this Premiers Conference process we finally had to say to the Premiers, `We are prepared to offer you opportunities for some form of guaranteed income; we are prepared to talk to you about that. We are prepared to give you certainty. We are prepared to do that for you. These things are definitely open for negotiation.' We are not going to be bloody-minded on this. At the Federal level, we have done things that interest us, such as national rail freight authorities and a national roads commission to preside over uniform standards and charges in the roads area. These are matters that interest us. They are Federal concerns in micro-economic reform. Those are the things that we have been putting up in a vast array of other areas. They interest us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are delighted that the States came on board to help us put in what are vital reforms to the transport infrastructure of this country. In this Premiers Conference we were going to address what might be called State concerns rather than concerns of the national Government in which we started to pick up one or two things that the States have become worried about over time. They have become worried about the extent to which they can rely on receiving a particular income over a period of time with a Commonwealth Government that has made a very strong stand in reducing outlays since it has been in office and has made a strong stand in reducing income tax levels of the ordinary citizens of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no escaping the fact that the States have found themselves carrying part of the burden of that process. They do not like it. They are being obliged to confront issues which their electorates do not oblige them to confront. The electorate is 100 per cent focused on the Commonwealth Government. People in the electorate demand of us performance in micro-economic reform and performance in taxation policy. They scrutinise us&mdash;as they should&mdash;to ensure that we are not imposing a massive tax burden on them, and they prevent us from doing so even if we were inclined to do it. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. We are about the second or third lowest taxed country in the OECD. We were not there when the Opposition was in office and we will not be there if it introduces a broad based consumption tax. We can tell people that with absolute certainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premiers came to us and said, `We want, effectively, by the back door, your agreement to a position which would effectively allow us control on taxation policy&mdash;that is a first stage&mdash;to a more emphatic, directional role in an area where we used to be'. Before World War II the States had very substantial taxation powers and authorities. We said, `No, sorry. We can do things for you in a guaranteed area; we cannot do things for you in, effectively, imposing new taxes in this country. That is not what this Government is about. That is not what fiscal discipline in this country is about'. The Premiers said to us, `Despite the fact that this was a conference about our concerns more than it was a conference about the sort of things that you wanted to do, whack, off will go the old nose and we will not talk to you about it'. That is fine; that is their business. That is what they want to do. If they want to whack off their noses to spite their faces on this issue, I guess we can all live with it. It is a pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a bigger pity if we did not have an opportunity to expose yet another part of the Opposition's secret agenda. Not only will it have a broadly based consumption tax&mdash;introduced at a level low enough for the Opposition to try to skive off and get away with it, while it ramps it up subsequently&mdash;but it will actively encourage the States to impose a tax of their own. The slogan is: no new taxes. The Opposition should remember that for the next election: no new taxes; vote Labor. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Many members of the House would have heard of the new chaos theory. I have read something about it; I thought I knew about it. A lot of people have said to me, `Is this something to do with the Labor Party in its centenary year?'. I said, `No, it is not to do with that'. But, obviously, the Labor Party is in chaos. </PARA>

So where are we all going? It looks at the moment as if the Government has hit a brick wall, does not know where to go and is waiting for a miracle to turn the economy around.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard a previous speaker say that the goods and services tax would diminish payment to the States by $1.5 billion or $2 billion. That is nothing compared to what this Federal Government has reduced the payments to the States by over the last two or three years. The Prime Minister has to tell the ACTU that it can no longer dictate the terms of Australia's economic recovery and that, if it wants to talk about enterprise bargaining, it must be fair dinkum so that both employer and employee can get together to work out what is best for each of them and the nation's productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has to be honest about the proposed GST, or goods and services tax, and not oppose it because of a dictate from the ACTU, which in the past preferred the failed ACTU accord to the goods and services tax. Only in this way will incentive be given to the Australian workers to work hard for a decent reward which will allow them to invest and save. The Government is extremely intent on condemning the goods and services tax. We heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) spend most of his speech on the goods and services tax because the Government sees that course of action as its only means of retaining government, particularly if it carries on with the furphies that it is going on with at the moment. The Government has even produced a book of speakers' notes and already we have heard the rhetoric from the book in the Parliament. Most of it is totally unfounded. </PARA>

We will go to the people of Australia with positive incentives and we will fight the case on its merits. Even with these policies, the task of getting people back to work will not be easy, given the mess the Government has got us into.

Then, of course, the greatest ratting of all was the time that he ratted on the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). Of course, all of Australia knows what happened about that ratting and what that ratting has cost this nation.

Projects such as the third runway in Sydney&mdash;which would cost the taxpayer hardly a cent because it would be funded by money from the airline system&mdash;the Coronation Hill project, Wesley Vale, the Riverina gas pipeline, a good example, to name a few, would pump millions of dollars into providing jobs and not cost the taxpayer.

Under the leadership of this Government and this Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), Australian National is the most efficient and best financially performing railway system in this country. This Government and this Prime Minister have given the leadership to this nation to establish, almost a century after Federation, a national interstate rail freight system. It is in its early stages, but at least it is being done&mdash;almost a century after Federation. It is being done because of this Prime Minister and this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to road transport and the matters of road safety, driver licensing and vehicle regulations. The idiotic situation when we came to government in 1983 was that one could drive a vehicle in one State of Australia and it was legal but when one crossed the border into the next State it was illegal. Around Australia each State had a different set of regulations or requirements for driver licensing. Under this Government and this Prime Minister there will now be uniformity in vehicle regulations. There is uniformity in requirements for driver licensing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we came to office there had been no attempt by the former government&mdash;those who are lecturing us today&mdash;to overcome the fact that interstate road transport operators could use our roads and make no contribution whatsoever for the road damage that they were creating. In fact, when we raised the matter, and when we had the Razorback mountain blockade in 1979, honourable members opposite turned their back on it. They did not want to know about it. They said it was a State problem. That is the kind of leadership that they gave at that time. It was this Government and this Prime Minister that brought into operation, in 1986, the interstate road transport licensing scheme to bring everybody into the net. That scheme is being further developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer now to the great love of the Opposition&mdash;the waterfront.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting for lunch I spoke to the House about the speech by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). I was critical of some of his remarks, particularly his criticism of the Government in respect of its relationship with the Premiers and the States in regard to welfare. I made it clear that there were plenty of objections from organisations which were sceptical about the ability of States not only to institute but also to maintain the types of services that are needed in Australia. Quite often we find a change in a State government and thereafter a change in welfare practices. Of course, then people come to the Federal Government and ask what it is going to do. We certainly do not want that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also critical of the honourable member for Dawson for criticising the spending of a sum of money on television and video production. I mentioned the importance of building up staff morale and understanding in our Social Security offices. It is all very well to attack the spending of an amount of money, but the honourable member for Dawson should have given a full account of what the money was being spent on. If it was being spent on people who are at the counter in Social Security offices around Australia who occasionally face hostility, very personal tragedy and often have to cope with peak numbers coming into their offices, it is understandable that they should have training and video is a very good way of doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's policies&mdash;even those enunciated by the honourable member for Dawson&mdash;would lead to more people being on social security. It is quite clear, if we compare the first seven years of the Hawke Government with the seven years of the Fraser Government, that more was spent in real terms on social security by the Fraser Government. So the Opposition's policies are ones which condone keeping people on social security. We have to try to get away from that and, in a short time, I propose to explain how that should be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dawson also attacked our policies on superannuation. He has no policies at all on how we will cope when the baby boomers retire. They will soon be retiring and, when they do, we need to have policies in place to cope with the increasing number of people receiving age pensions when it may well be, with our present birth rate, that there will be a decreasing number of taxpayers. The only way to remedy the problem is through superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay full tribute to the Whitlam Government and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a member of that Government, for trying to bring in a national superannuation scheme. That, of course, was opposed by the insurance industry. But now the Government has cooperated with industry, unions and employers to ensure that people are paying into superannuation schemes and that their employers are also paying in. We are doing something about social security pay-outs, while the Opposition condones the growth of social security expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dawson attacked training. When will he realise that training is all about getting away from the old habit of keeping people in that vicious, depressing circle of being on benefits, not being able to get a job, having no training to get a job, losing self-esteem and losing the ability even to present themselves for a job? We are trying to get away from that through training schemes and with the cooperation of the social security offices, the Commonwealth Employment Service and some very important organisations in the community within industry, the TAFE system, the SkillShare system and other systems by which people are actually helped in their local communities so that they can get out of that vicious cycle of unemployment and being on social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the honourable member for Dawson went back to the usual theme, which is the same one that the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) was talking about a moment ago; that is, how the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that no child will live in poverty by 1990. I think that sometimes in politics we, in the Government, tend to shy away from actually confronting that remark and confronting the way the Opposition makes it. The Opposition is really not conveying the truth of the situation. The Prime Minister himself has said that he should have said that no child need live in poverty; his written notes said that no child will need to live in poverty by 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the facts. Now, with the additional amounts payable per child for families on relatively low incomes, no child need live in poverty&mdash;that is, if we adults get it right. We do not always get it right. We too often get it wrong. Of course, the off the cuff statement of the Prime Minister, which varied slightly from his written notes, did not recognise nearly as much as his written notes did that no child need live in poverty today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not suit the Opposition to believe it. Even the following day, the newspaper said that it was interesting that the off the cuff statement of the Prime Minister differed from his written remarks. Of course, the Opposition is not interested in the truth. It is interested in scoring points. People who are interested in the truth will understand that what could only have been meant was that no child need live in poverty today if we, as adults and the parents of the children, get it right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dawson also mentioned that, in his view, the Government has failed to recognise the poverty needs of rural communities. This is the very thing that we have been looking at recently. He is right when he says that there are people in rural communities who have problems rolling up to the social security office and seeking benefits. We have ensured that the people involved with the rural adjustment scheme will be the ones who do the assessments of these people. That means that the people who understand rural poverty, such as rural counsellors and the people there in the offices, whether they are involved with rural protection boards or other organisations, will be administering the rural adjustment scheme in rural Australia. They are the people who understand the needs; they are the people who will do the assessment; and they are the people who will ensure that people receive their entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully endorse the contention of the honourable member for Dawson that people ought to be reassured that they have the right to seek benefits under the new social security provisions after assessment by rural adjustment scheme personnel. Of course, there are other options open for people in primary industry. Even though the rural adjustment scheme and the social security benefits which are associated with it are more complex than the scheme of the Fraser Government, there is a great difference and that is that this scheme is really targeted to those in need. There is strong evidence that, with the way payments were made to farmers under the drought relief policies of the Fraser Government, there was some rorting and some abuse. It was not a bad scheme. Basically it was properly administered and of great benefit to many farmers, but this is an improvement. I think we ought to recognise the improvement in all the areas of social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RED scheme of the Whitlam Government was a good scheme. But then there was a wage pause. If it were not for the fact that the wage pause scheme pegged wages, it would have been an improvement on the RED scheme. It was introduced by the Fraser Government. The wage pause scheme covered women and some other disadvantaged people. Then we had the community employment program under this Government. That was an improvement on the scheme of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community employment program meant that more disadvantaged people were able to benefit and we were able to get some people out of that unemployment cycle. But of course with training&mdash;with the cooperation of the Commonwealth Employment Service, social security offices and the organisations that I mentioned before&mdash;we are now able to get even more people out of the long term unemployment cycle and into full time employment. We do not just say to them after three or fours months of a job creation project, `Well, that was very good. You did a good job. We recognise what you did and we hope you get a job'. Some of them did, but now those who participate in these schemes are saying, `Well, at least we have training so that we are ready for a job when it comes along'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the honourable member for Dawson criticised what he called the failure of the Government to react to an unrealistic floor price for wool. Of all the hypocrisy that I have heard from the National Party, that would be about the greatest&mdash;and on its record there is a lot to beat. Its members in this House are telling the Government that it should not have reduced the floor price, as unrealistic as it was. There were farmers, of course, who were saying, `Do not reduce that floor price'. Now, of course, wise in hindsight, they recognise that it needed to be changed. They were certainly as heavily&mdash;or more heavily&mdash;involved than any of us in trying to maintain that reserve price program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social security legislation blends the interests of those in need with the interests of those paying; that is, the taxpayers. In 1983, we had a number of complaints. We had complaints that people were collecting benefits in two or three places sometimes; in other words getting three lots of benefits. I recall hearing of someone who had gone to the United States and was getting his unemployment benefits through the post. I recall hearing of people refusing to accept work and receiving benefits even though they said, `No, I am not interesting in taking this or that job'. That has changed. The dole concept has been abolished, but with that change has come some obligations and agreements between the Commonwealth Employment Service and people who are prepared to take advantage of those benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what has happened is that this Government has been tough, but it has been tough recognising the need to help people to get into the full time work force and the need to do everything we can to help them. Now unemployed people have an agreement. They say, `Right, I am prepared to present myself well. Yes, I am prepared to take a job if you and I agree that it is a job that I should take'. If the Department of Social Security says that it is a job that it feels a person can take, the person has to take it. Things have changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition has made a lot of noise about being tough, it really has taken a laissez faire attitude and made little change. The Government has responded differently from the Opposition. Once again, we find the Opposition making a lot of noise about being tough&mdash;no dole after nine months, less spending on welfare, leave things to the welfare groups and non-government organisations. That is what it will do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we had the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) attacking ACOSS. What was he really attacking?  He was not attacking a bureaucracy; there are only two or three people in the Australian Council of Social Service. He was not attacking the office; it is a pretty dingy sort of system ACOSS has got. The Opposition was attacking the organisations. It was attacking the Salvation Army, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, St Vincent de Paul and the Smith Family. It was attacking family support and disadvantaged groups. They are the organisations and people it is attacking&mdash;the people on the ground, the disadvantaged groups. This Government has got together and decided on an approach which answers the concerns of taxpayers, answers the needs of participants and, in addition to that, answers the needs of this economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What an extraordinary address we have just heard from the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). We heard the honourable member parading his views in this House as though he had some sort of monopoly on all that is wise in the area of child support and social security benefits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Kooyong has pointed out, the Prime Minister said `will'&mdash;as the record shows. Even if the honourable member for Eden-Monaro were right, what a hide he has to come in here parading and defending that line when more children have been committed to poverty as a result of unemployment and the policies of this Government than ever faced that grim reality under the Fraser Administration. Loads of children are living in poverty because their parents do not have work, will not find work and are cultivating a climate in which their children will grow up expecting unemployment to be a way of life. That is the indictment which the honourable member's Administration cannot escape.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess I stand in this House with some prejudices about social security legislation and the impact that it has on unemployed people. I have some prejudices because I think that my obligation as a member of this Parliament is to ensure that the maximum number of people are given an opportunity to work. Frequently, in my experience prior to entering Parliament, I had people who chose deliberately to abuse the system. I used to be in a labour intensive industry. Nothing irritated me as much as being on a Riverland vineyard in the middle of summer with a crop waiting to be harvested and having relatively fit young people saying to me, `Oh, boss, this is soul destroying work. I'm off', leaving the pensioners and the elderly people who had been part of my grape picking team for generations to continue to pick those grapes in 40 degree heat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that we ought to oblige young people to work. The one thing that this legislation will do which I commend is that at least it will take out the disincentive to work which existed prior to the legislation coming into effect. What is unemployment in Australia?  It is a tragedy. It is a tragedy because we have a pool of young people who are no longer able to work, obliged to work or expected to work. In addition to that tragedy we have a pool of available time not being used by productive Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have often asked myself what I would do if I were unemployed. I do not pretend that I could answer the question realistically, because I have never had to face that grim reality. But I do know that in the one hour that it takes me to drive from my home to the airport, on the Sundays when I am coming to Canberra or sometimes on Fridays when I am returning to my office, I look at the jobs that I see waiting to be done between the airport and my home. I see thousands of opportunities for people to be employed. I see lots of painting to be done, no shortage of fence lines that could be straightened, plenty of industrial yards that could be tidied  and lots of businesses with grass growing up that people would be pleased to have trimmed, tidied up or sprayed with a weedicide in order to have an even tidier run from the airport to Gawler, where I live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These opportunities are lost simply because we do not allow employers and employees to negotiate their work arrangements. Opportunities abound for jobs to be done in Australia, but we lock the unemployed into being unemployed because we will not allow employers to employ them except under a very rigorous system that, frankly, discourages employers from putting on young people, in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was first in the fruit growing industry I owned an old Morris commercial truck. On the run from the airport to my home there is a Morris commercial truck resting in a yard waiting to be restored. It would not cost anything. A bloke would pay to have it taken away. There are employment opportunities for someone to take it away and restore it. Unemployed people have time on their hands. My responsibility as a legislator is to ensure that nothing is put in their way to stop them making that time productive. I wonder why we do not really come to terms with unemployment by encouraging young people to be productive by removing the disincentives that so often have been put in their way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud the legislation that we are debating this afternoon. I applaud it because much of what it does, little though it is, removes disincentives for young people to work. First of all, one section of the legislation takes the Aboriginal employment incentive scheme and says to an Aboriginal person, `If, as an Aboriginal under the Aboriginal employment incentive scheme you are receiving income, that income will be deducted from whatever other social security benefits you might get'. I think that is a good thing. Given the present state of the Australian economy we have an obligation to target assistance where it is most needed. We have been through all of this and those of us on this side of the House know it better than most. We have been through it all when we agreed that the assets test should apply to the family allowance to ensure that even family allowances would be targeted and not applied to people who did not necessarily need them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the sobering truth that PAYE taxpayers&mdash;which public servants and employees are&mdash;currently have 90 per cent of all their tax spent on welfare in Australia, we begin to appreciate how desperately we need to target our welfare. Some $37.67 billion is generated by PAYE taxpayers and $34.41 billion is spent by the welfare lobby in Australia. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro had the gall to come into this place and say that we, the Liberals, actually condoned keeping people on social security, when we are the very people seeking to reduce that welfare bill which is so crippling the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud the targeting that is in this legislation. Another thing I applaud is the way&mdash;too small a way, but nonetheless a step in the right direction; a step in a very long journey, but a step nonetheless&mdash;in which the legislation goes about encouraging employment. In this legislation it is suggested that the unemployed, who are currently denied rent assistance if they find work, will have that arrangement changed so that if, for example, they find work they can work for a period&mdash;once this legislation comes in&mdash;of six weeks in lieu of the present four weeks before the rent assistance they would normally have is denied to them. If they are on Newstart they will be able to work for a period of 13 weeks instead of the existing four weeks if they find a job, and that period of employment of 13 weeks will not deny them their rent assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, of course, once they lost rent assistance they had to wait 26 weeks before it was reinstated. As a result of the legislation brought into the House earlier this year&mdash;the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3)&mdash;the Government reduced that time of waiting to 18 weeks. It is suggested that this legislation, which would enable them to get that rent assistance if they work for a period of six weeks under Job Search or 13 weeks under Newstart, will in fact apply as from March 1992 as well. I also point out that the weeks that they have already served on a benefit will be counted towards the 18-week waiting period that would previously have denied them rent assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inability to access rent assistance has been a real disincentive to finding work. People have said, `Why should I go into a job for four weeks, when if I get a job for four weeks I will not be able to get rent assistance for 26 weeks?'. The Government is doing something to change that; it is removing a disincentive to people to work. That is why I welcome this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a little mystified about why the legislation applies from March 1992. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) might care to comment on that, given that many of the most labour intensive jobs exist over the Christmas period, and the disincentive to employment will still exist until post-Christmas this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also notice that the legislation indexes the amount of money that pensioners can earn and still receive the pension. That is an important step and a step to be applauded, because if we have people who are prepared to be industrious, given the present state of the Australian economy, we should be encouraging them to work. I am indignant not about the legislation but about the attitude of the Government, which suggests that all the Opposition is about is frustrating the opportunities unemployed young people have to work. That is arrant nonsense. All the Opposition is about is providing opportunities for young people to work and removing the disincentives that currently exist for employers to employ the unemployed. Our support for this legislation is evidence of that and no less real is our support of an industrial relations policy which would allow employers and employees to mutually negotiate a work agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that much of Australia's unemployment burden is currently being carried by young people? Obviously, because we oblige employers to pay 18-year-olds the same salary as they pay 24-year-olds. We oblige them to treat 18-year-olds as if they were experienced in the job. We allow no flexibility in the way in which they go about approaching a young person who may be prepared to work and wants to work. As I said earlier, I do not find any shortage of things to be done in Australia; I find a shortage of people prepared to do them. That shortage exists largely because we put real disincentives in the way of the employment of young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our industrial relations policy is designed to allow employers and employees to choose what are the appropriate working conditions for them, given that there will already be a basic salary, basic standards and the opportunity to belong to the union movement if employees choose so to do. But the choice is there. In 1991, under this Government, people cannot even volunteer to work for nothing, because if they do they will abuse the very standards the Government lays down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It frustrates me to be an Australian who sees job opportunities waiting to be taken and people being denied the right to be employed simply because our present employment arrangements are so rigid. I welcome this legislation, in that it actually encourages young people to pick up employment opportunities, without deliberately denying them some of the assistance they need because of the time they have been unemployed. I am encouraged by what this legislation does in that it encourages pensioners to earn money, not necessarily evenly over the year but as fruit pickers or pruners in a period when there are job opportunities available, and the money they can earn is being indexed so that they will not be adversely affected as inflation erodes the value of the money they can earn before their pension is reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I as an Australian am offended that at a time when unemployment is at an all time high, at a time when dole numbers have gone up something like 58 per cent in a period of two years, at a time when our social security budget obliges us now to spend $5,016 per family, we fail to provide job opportunities when there is work waiting to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I plead with the Government to recognise what it has in unemployed young people. It has a resource that is being wasted&mdash;not a resource we seek to exploit, but a resource that is being wasted&mdash;and that resource is nearly 10 per cent of the employable people in Australia. That is unforgivable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Work is waiting to be done in Australia if we are prepared to be flexible in the way that we allow employers and employees to go about negotiating their working arrangements. That is what the Opposition stands for: relieving children from child poverty by providing their parents with job opportunities. We think that is not too hard to do. We support this legislation because it is a step in the right direction, but it is nothing more than a step. There is opportunity for Australia to gallop ahead if we start to take the potential of the unemployed and make the unemployed productive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) and wish to address a number of issues which have already been raised by speakers on this and the other side of the House. I suppose one must first and foremost look to the reasons for the existence of the Department of Social Security. I am sure that we on this side of the House support the existence of the Department of Social Security for a host of reasons, but most importantly because it addresses the needs and concerns of those people in our community who have not had the opportunity or the good fortune to be able to provide for themselves in their older years; for those people who are disabled; for those people who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in situations where they are sole parents, for a host of reasons; and for those people who are unemployed and for whom we believe there should be a right to at least a basic allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not of the view that people who are unemployed as a result of misfortune should be able&mdash;as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) has just said&mdash;to rort the system or take advantage of it. We do not believe that at all. We believe that as a community we must provide for those people who are deserving of need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment Bill examines penalties. I draw to the attention of the honourable member for Wakefield that last year 1,900 people were prosecuted by the Department of Social Security for attempting to defraud the system. The number of prosecutions and the number of people who are found to be defrauding the system are going down each year. That is the result partly of a range of measures which have been introduced by the Department of Social Security to ensure that the people who need our help are the ones who are getting it. As a government we are committed to those in need, but we are not committed to criminals. To ensure that social security fraud is treated as fraud is in the best interests of Australia. This Bill addresses that issue and ensures that the penalties are increased. Increasing the penalties brings social security offences into line with all other Commonwealth offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I would not espouse taking people to gaol&mdash;I believe that often that is very unproductive&mdash;I am very much in support of prosecutions for fraud. I believe that community service is perhaps the best way in which this issue can be addressed, because it enables people who have defrauded the system to pay off what they have stolen from us, the Australian taxpayers. I exhort all honourable members to acknowledge that theft is theft, no matter whether a car is stolen, possessions are stolen from a house or money is stolen from other members of the family and the community. This Bill attempts to equalise penalties for offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important issue which is examined in this Bill is the child disability allowance. On one particular aspect this amendment is retrospective to 1 July 1991, which ensures that a parent can receive the child disability allowance when a disabled child is home on leave from an institution, even if the institution continues to receive the family allowance for that child. This would give effect to the original intention of amendments made to the 1947 Act in 1989. It has taken my whole lifetime&mdash;since I was born in 1947&mdash;to ensure that these amendments have come to fruition. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WF4">Ms CRAWFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Parliamentary Secretary says, 1947 was an excellent year; he too was born in that year. I think we would recognise that the way in which children who have special needs are treated has changed dramatically. Many severely disabled children often need more than one care giver. The difficulty is that only one person can receive the child disability allowance. Sometimes we find these children not only in institutions but also in the care of a foster family, when, for example, the child's parents are separated, and they share the custody of the child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw your attention, Madam Deputy Speaker, to the latest statistics, which indicate that about 75 per cent of all families with a disabled child have marital break-ups. It is usually the woman who is left as the carer, because it has been found that the male has been unable to cope either with the disability of the child and the demands that makes on the family or with his perceived loss of self-esteem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a whole range of situations in which two people who may not necessarily be sharing accommodation find themselves in need of the child disability allowance. So the Bill amends the Act to enable both of those people to be eligible for the child disability allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1975, when the Whitlam Government introduced the original handicapped child's allowance, Australia's Labor governments have recognised the particular and special responsibilities of families with a child who has a disability. We understand the extra strain and cost on families and individuals caring for such children and have tried to help them. I can cite a number of cases. Madam Deputy Speaker, you would be aware of a respite care centre in Eagleby which looks at the very special needs of some of our youngest children. It looks after children from nought to 21 years and provides respite care not just for the disabled child but for the family, including the brothers and sisters, of that disabled child. That centre had its first birthday last week. It was a very special occasion. It was wonderful to see gathered there about 150 people for whom the centre offers real respite and real support. I am very proud to be part of a government that recognises these services and the very special needs of our disabled children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is also a further refinement of our concern to help people cope with changing family circumstances. As I have said, in 1975 the Whitlam Government's handicapped child's allowance was to assist parents caring for handicapped children in the family home as an alternative to institutional care. It was paid then, as today's child's disability allowance is paid, to recognise the extra costs parents incur with a disabled child and to help with respite care. Many of us would know the extra cost incurred for children with disabilities and special needs. Some of them can become quite violent, so there are breakages in the home. There are extra medical expenses and often extra costs for special clothes. And, of course, there is the demand on time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To qualify for the payment 16 years ago, the claimant had to be providing constant care and attention to a severely handicapped child at home. The payment was free of an income test and was usually paid to the mother. This was modified further in 1977, when a second category of `handicapped' was introduced to recognise the needs of low income families caring for a child whose handicap was not severe enough to satisfy the original medical criteria but whose condition imposed a significant financial burden. The eligibility criteria were based on the existence of a disability and the need to provide care and attention only marginally less than the care and attention needed by a severely handicapped child. Payment of this category was subject to a test of financial hardship and was made on the basis of reimbursement of documented extra costs incurred because of a child's disability, up to the maximum rates for a severely handicapped child. One can imagine the complexity of such a scheme. It was criticised because of the difficulty of interpreting the different categories and the inequalities occurring because of differing perceptions of the levels of disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all honourable members would recognise that for many families with a disabled child who has special needs, the kind of bookkeeping required and the demands made on the family's time preclude their having spare moments to do this kind of bookkeeping. There were differing views. Some people complained; many other people were grateful to have the old handicapped children's allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1984 this Government conducted a handicapped programs review and produced the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Directions</EMPHASIS> report in 1985. Many parents said that they were happy to have this payment for their child with special needs, but they found the process of proving entitlement somewhat disheartening and terribly difficult&mdash;as, of course, was the kind of label placed upon children as being `handicapped'. We now look at the child's disability allowance, which was introduced in 1987, not only as something having a new name but also as a whole new direction for children with special needs and disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with the general direction of changes came the Disability Services Act, which reflected comments made in the social security review conducted by Bettina Cass and in the other issues paper on income support for families with children. This Government has presided over enormous changes in the care, education and recognition of, and community support for, people with special needs and special disabilities. The replacement of the handicapped children's allowance with the child disability allowance meant that there was an end to that distinction; there were no degrees of severity or disability, and there was no income test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rate was increased from $92 to $115 a month. To mark the distinction between a child with a disability attracting the child disability allowance and the one who does not, the need for care and attention was addressed. If care and attention had to be continually recurring, provided every day, be significant in nature and required for an extended period, then the child was eligible for the allowance. Many of us would understand very easily and very clearly that the demands made on time are often not necessarily commensurate with the severity of the disability; indeed, the disability can be of such a nature that it requires special time and special attention. The provision of this allowance addresses time, care and concern. The focus of the child disability allowance has become one of care. It shifted the emphasis which had been on the nature of the disability, what was known as the handicap, as a requisite for receiving the allowance, to one of care. The amount of care, attention and time that was needed meant that that was a measure of the entitlement. I think this is a very important distinction and a very important change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rate of the child disability allowance has been indexed since January 1990. In this year's Budget, the Government announced that it would increase the payment from 1 January 1992 to restore it to its real value. Most honourable members here would know that the current rate is $29.95 per week. It will go up to $32.10. It is now a payment of real usefulness to families who have a child with a special need and they are able to use it to defray some of the additional costs they face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of children attracting the child disability allowance has risen by more than 10,000 since its introduction in November 1987. We are concerned that there are more children out there. Families need to be made aware of this because what is known in bureaucratic parlance as the `take up rate' does seem to be particularly low at times. We believe that this payment is a simple recognition of the extra burdens accepted lovingly and willingly by families of a child with a special need. We believe it is incumbent upon this Government and upon the community to recognise those very special burdens that are placed on families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent survey of parents who are receiving the child disability allowance asked for comments. Many people said that it helped significantly with expenses. We hope that this measure will be improved. This year's Budget extended the health care card cover to recipients of the child disability allowance. Many people talked about the extra costs needed for transport of children with special needs&mdash;a larger car, a larger van, the cost of taxis and so on. Often children with special needs cannot be left with one adult in a car. They may need an extra person to be with them and that is an extra expense. During the survey one parent stated, `The child disability allowance is of enormous help in the ongoing quest to enable our son to reach his full potential'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is where the child disability allowance is at. We are hoping to provide a small measure of support whereby children with special needs and special abilities can achieve their full potential. The whole thrust of the Disability Services Act is, in effect, to look at that whole area and to ensure that people with disabilities and special needs have their abilities recognised. That should be recognised by the community as a whole. We believe that the amendments today, though minor, will impact on families. It is also an indication that this Government has listened to the views of parents and carers. We hope that the changes today will reflect the change in the care patterns of people over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment ensures that a parent can get child disability allowance for the times when a child, who might ordinarily live in an institution or congregate care, comes home to stay for a few days. In effect, we are encouraging the situation where parents can have a child at home. We acknowledge the cost of the care that they must give to that child, even though the child may be very disabled and spend much of his time in institutional care. Many years ago parents were not encouraged to have their children at home. One of the amendments of the Disability Services Act ensures that children become less institutionalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted to have a whole circle of houses within my electorate which provide independent living&mdash;supported accommodation&mdash;for a whole range of people with disabilities. One lady had spent 25 years in an institution. She said to me, `You have no idea what it's like to be able to decide when you can get up and what you can eat'. I do not think that is asking very much. I am delighted to see that the Government is taking those sorts of considerations into account. It saddens me when I hear members of the Opposition decrying the Disability Services Act and decrying the moves that are made towards independence for many of our people with special needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment is very small. We hope that it is an indication of the way in which the Government is pursuing the needs of people with disabilities in our community. It is a reflection of the fact that we have shifted to care as the central issue. It is a reflection of the fact that we acknowledge that there are changing patterns of care within our community and that we have different kinds of people providing care&mdash;not just for the child or the person with the disability but for the family. All families need support, but those with children with special needs need that bit of extra support. This allowance provides for that. The Government recognises that many families are part of a two-family structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Government has responded to the demands of the community and accepted responsibility for the people and children with special care needs by allowing the child disability allowance to be expanded. This will ensure that the people in our community are looked after and cared for in their very own special way and in the circumstances which they and their families have elucidated. As a Government, we have responded to that. The amendment is simply an attempt to recognise those values. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Initially, I take this opportunity to thank honourable members who have contributed to this debate. I welcome the support of the Opposition on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make a few comments on some of the contributions by honourable members. The honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) has made it very clear that this Government is about caring for people who cannot care for themselves. I agree with her on that point. In the area of the child disability allowance, she makes very good points. We want to make sure that those who are not as fortunate as those of us who are healthy have the opportunity to make whatever they can of their lives, given their disabilities. I welcome what the honourable member had to say in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is all part of this question of the welfare bill which was mentioned quite regularly by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) in their contributions. They made a big deal about how much money we spend on welfare. All I can say is that this Government, as the honourable member for Forde has just stated, is about caring for people. I do not know what would happen if the Opposition was ever to gain the Government benches. They<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> make it very clear that they are going to lop billions of dollars off the Budget. Their demeanour is such, and they have made it clear, that they are going to take it from the social security area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some of the matters mentioned by the honourable member for Dawson. He made particular reference to rural poverty and the problems out there in the bush. I can understand that. Not all that long ago, about three or four months ago, at the invitation of the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) I visited Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula and, with one of the rural counsellors there at the time&mdash;I think her name was Monica Dodd, a lovely lady&mdash;I spoke with three farming families</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were doing it very tough. They had applied for unemployment benefits, but there were some problems. They sat down and gave me the real, human story of what they were suffering, not as a result of something brought upon them by this Government but because of the general level of commodity prices throughout the world and, of course, the drought in many areas of the country. Nevertheless, the fact was that these people were suffering, and I was very pleased that after a little bit of, let us say, unravelling of some tape here and there we were able to help every one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has attempted to do something with respect to rural families who are asset rich but have little or no income. Admittedly, because there is just so much money involved and there are budgetary constraints, we cannot widen it so that every farmer in Australia is able to get social security benefits. In the Senate the Government will introduce an amendment to this legislation which will be known as the farmers' package. I might just take the time of the House to mention what that farmers' package is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has announced this new social security provision linking the rural adjustment scheme to the social security system. This is in recognition of the extreme hardships that are currently being experienced by the farming sector. More farmers will have access to Job Search allowance and Newstart allowance due to changes in the current hardship provisions proposed to take effect from 1 January 1992. The main change will be that farmers will no longer be required to sell their farms in order to be considered under hardship provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, RAS authorities will be providing advice to help the Department of Social Security determine an individual farmer's eligibility for Job Search allowance and Newstart allowance under the activity test. This improved access to benefits is expected to assist about 2,000 farmers and will involve funding of about $10m this financial year and $20m in 1992-93. The new provisions will operate for two years and will be reviewed in the context of the 1993-94 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Admittedly that will not benefit the many thousands of farmers who consider that they too are entitled to assistance, but at least it will look after approximately 2,000 of them. It is something the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and I have discussed, and it has been discussed with the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson. We will keep an eye on it. It is just hoped that the rural poverty crisis that we have at the moment in many areas of Australia does not continue. It is certainly something we are aware of and in fact, at least to a significant degree, we have done something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it would be right of me not to mention the comments of the honourable member for Dawson with respect to the guillotine. I understand that on many occasions when the guillotine is put on legislation there can be cause for complaint by the Opposition. Certainly in this case we will have plenty of time. The honourable member for Dawson during the course of his speech did not really take too much time talking about this particular piece of legislation; indeed, he talked about a lot of other general matters. I think it is a little much for my friend the honourable member for Dawson to be saying that, in some way or another, the guillotine imposed on this particular piece of welfare legislation has in any way disadvantaged anybody. There were only two speakers on his side and only two on mine; nevertheless, as I said, there was certainly plenty of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention one particular section of this legislation which goes to the question of fraud. I think it was mentioned by the honourable member for Dawson in passing, and also by the honourable member for Wakefield. We are now making sure that fraud against the Department of Social Security is regarded as being what it is&mdash;a serious matter. This legislation now arranges for penalties under the Social Security Act to be in line with maximum penalties applicable under the Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present Social Security Act, without going into specifics, there are certain maximum penalties which bear little relevance to the same sort of seriousness of offences under the Crimes Act. This will be part of an ongoing strategy on behalf of the Department to ensure that wherever possible we target that scarce welfare dollar for those who are most in need. It adds to more mobile review teams that we have put on; it adds to the new computer data matching programs that we have with the Taxation Office and other Government departments, and it adds also to our Newstart strategy. Now, after 12 months one is considered to be long term unemployed and is obliged to enter into a Newstart activity agreement with the Commonwealth Employment Service. Individuals will not be paid unemployment benefits unless they do what they say they will do under the contract they have with the Commonwealth Employment Service. I think this Government has done a lot in terms of the fraud question, particularly in the last two or three years, to tighten that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Wakefield. He talked about fraud with social security, particularly in terms of fraud by some unemployed people. He talked about how some people were not working, that they were getting the dole, et cetera. All I can say to him is that he obviously has not heard of the Government's Newstart strategy. We make sure that after 12 months those on unemployment benefits enter into this Newstart activity agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not about making people do what the honourable member for Wakefield wants them to do, that is, menial tasks such as painting the fence along the road on the way to his electorate, or whatever. We are about trying to reskill them so that we put them into the situation where they do things of benefit to them. We want to retrain them, reskill them, so they can get a job when jobs become available as soon as we are out of this economic downturn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply say that I commend the Bill to the House. I am happy that the Opposition is not in any way opposing it. I look forward to the Senate amendment with respect to rural poverty. </PARA>

The terrible tragedy that is unfolding in Yugoslavia fills us all with sadness.

We are further alarmed, of course, at the refusal of parties to comply with negotiated cease-fires, as we have seen, interminably, over the last several weeks.

We welcome today the passage of this resolution, which highlights the frustration that the Australian Parliament feels while violence in Yugoslavia continues unabated.

Our view last Monday, as expressed by Senator Hill, was that economic sanctions imposed by the European Community, the United States and Canada should be supported by Australia. We acknowledge that the Australian Government has taken this step today. Australia should also announce that it will join in any oil embargo if implemented by the United Nations. All of these efforts are designed to press the parties to observe cease-fire arrangements and to accept the European Community peace plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on behalf of the Opposition, I want to acknowledge the patience and forbearance of the various communities in Australia from the Balkans because the events obviously are emotionally draining upon all of those with family links there. They have real concerns and they are entitled to have those concerns. The way in which they have responded demonstrates their commitment as Australians to Australia and its interests. There is a need for continuing restraint, which we all respect, but we do understand the real feelings and concerns of those who have relatives and loved ones in that area of the world. That is reflected very much in the resolution that has been carried unanimously in the Parliament today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation now before the House, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, is important legislation. I want to signify at the outset that the Liberal and National parties will not be opposing this legislation and will be as constructive as always on matters of repatriation. This Bill proposes amendments to veterans' affairs and associated legislation in order to give effect to initiatives arising in part from the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note once again we have a very large team from the Department of Veterans' Affairs accompanying the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), as though he is going to be under some deep assault. I will justify the presence of those people by raising a number of questions so that the Minister can respond at a later stage in the debate. The most significant of the amendments contained in the legislation concerns the payment of a fee for pharmaceuticals under the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The fee itself is not imposed by this legislation, it is achieved by amendment to delegated legislation. Legislative amendment is required for the payment of a fortnightly pharmaceutical allowance to offset the patient contribution, and this is included in the Bill. This measure is to take effect from 1 January next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments in the Bill allow for the payments of advance pharmaceutical allowance as well as indexation of the patient contribution and the pharmaceutical allowance. Other measures include dealing with earnings credit applicable to the ordinary income test. The maximum amount of a person's earning credit is currently fixed at $1,000. The amendment proposes that, commencing on 1 July 1992, the earnings credit account maximum be indexed in line with the CPI. Also included in this Bill, but not related to the Budget, are amendments to operational areas in the periods during which such areas are to be regarded as operational for the purposes of determining eligibility for benefits. One of these amendments includes Iraq and Kuwait. Others relate to Malaya and Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in this context that I would like to raise formally with the Minister some legitimate queries that we have. I hope that he may be able to respond in this debate in this House. Alternatively, my colleague the shadow Minister for veterans' affairs, Senator Jocelyn Newman, will raise the matters in the Senate in order that we can have formal responses to these queries. Firstly, on the matter of Iraq and Kuwait, the legislation provides under schedule 2 on page 13:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">by adding at the end the following:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">``11.The area comprising Iraq and Kuwait</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The period from and including 23 February 1991 to and including 9 June 1991''.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister: why has it been necessary to extend from that particular date?  I realise that 9 June was the accepted cut-off date. Presumably, the previous legislation did not lay down the full period necessary to encompass the Gulf war. Then again, I notice that this clause of the Bill relates to the area comprising Iraq and Kuwait, rather than the other areas which were dealt with in the previous legislation. Perhaps therein lies the answer. The Minister might like to confirm that it was only after the commencement of hostilities in the Middle East that some Australians on exchange actually made it into Iraq and Kuwait and therefore required repatriation cover for their service under fire in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like that matter clarified because, as I understand it, the other legislation did have a wide time frame. It picked up HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>, HMAS<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Brisbane</EMPHASIS> and all the other ships for the duration required. There is still one ship in the Middle East as we speak. In terms of this legislation, it is important that the House have that matter clarified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make particular mention of those Australians who went across the start line on the day of the invasion and the reinvasion of Kuwait to drive Iraq out of Kuwait and fulfil very brave, courageous and capable roles with the units to which they were seconded. I commend and congratulate all those in the Navy and other services who recently received special commendation and meritorious and bravery awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned that none of the Army exchangees appeared in that particular listing. This is not something we would raise lightly in the House in this sort of debate, but I would like to know whether that is because, firstly, they were on exchange and will fall into a different category and receive different consideration for their award associated with the unit in which they were serving, be it the British Army or the United States Army, or, secondly, again because they had been on exchange, the focus had not been on when the cut-off was made for the list of recommendations in recognition of their service, which led to the investiture at Government House last week. Very deserving recipients were present to be invested by His Excellency, the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consideration should be given to appropriate recognition of those who were on exchange and who were in the situation of having to fire more than the odd angry shot or were being fired at. I gather that this particular provision in the Bill relates to those who actually went into Iraq and Kuwait after the commencement of hostilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point I want to raise in respect of the Iraq and Kuwait aspect is that I am very curious about why the period commences on 23 February. The hostilities actually commenced, and the units involved, including one containing an Australian soldier, actually crossed in the third week of January. It was earlier than 23 February. The Minister might recall the actual date that the hostilities commenced. From memory, it was about Wednesday, 16 January. Honourable members attended a special sitting of the House in the following week. Yet this particular provision commences on 23 February, one calendar month later. It is one month after some of the Australians who presumably are being picked up by this provision had already arrived in Iraq and Kuwait. I put to the Minister that this needs to be looked at very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will state the exact date of commencement of hostilities when it is made available to me. It was certainly in the middle of January; it was not the middle of February. Therefore, I query the commencement date of 23 February 1991 as being one month too late. Equally, there may well be an explanation. I invite the Minister to consider that matter. I have found the actual date. Hostilities commenced on the night of 18 January. Some Australians went into Kuwait&mdash;ultimately they may have also made it into Iraq&mdash;between 18 January and 23 February. Therefore, why was 23 February chosen as the commencement date, as opposed to an earlier date, 18 January?  Could the Minister look at that? Could he also look at the recognition factor associated with those on exchange?  In the scheme of things, they may have fallen through. I take this opportunity once again to salute the service given by so many Australians, including the Australian Naval Commander, Chris Oxenbould, the captains of the various ships, exchange officers, liaison officers, members of the Air Force, as well as the Australian Army and a large number of officers from the Navy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect I want to query relates to the Malaya campaign dates, which are also being altered in this legislation. There has been concern expressed this afternoon about the exact reason why that alteration is necessary in 1991, which is a long time after the Malayan emergency. It is curious. I guess there is a legitimate reason for that. I tried to turn up from the explanatory memorandum what that reason might be. If the Minister is able to offer any clarification in relation to that, it would also be very welcome. I note in that regard that it only applies to claims after a certain date with regard to cutting in. This will protect previously lodged claims in respect of the Malaysian campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I want to raise relates to those Australians who have now gone forth, as I mentioned last night, to Cambodia. I wish them well. It is an advance party. I welcome the assurance given to me informally by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that this House and the Senate will be passing a motion informally in support of that Cambodian commitment at the appropriate time and ahead of the commitment of a larger force. I also commend the fact that Australia is under consideration for ratification as the overall commander of that international force in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister:  are the Australians in Cambodia automatically covered under the previous veterans legislation, or will an additional regulation or, further, separate amendment be required to cover them?  The business of legislation before parliament is a costly one. We have the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) before the House. It is part of the Budget legislation. It would not be difficult, if it were a requirement to put in an additional clause, for this to be done on this occasion, and not incur the cost of another set of amending Bills just to cover that circumstance. I seek clarification of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the House is entitled to know what the situation is, a week after Australians have gone forth to war in a peacekeeping role in Cambodia. I know it will be a very challenging role. I am confident that they will do their very best. I do not underestimate the danger that is involved in Cambodia for one moment. It will be a lot more dangerous than the Namibian peacekeeping mission. Let us get this legislation right if additional amendments are needed to cover the repatriation circumstances. There is no argument that the Government's intention is there; I do not question that for a moment. I realise that it will be met. The question is: when?  If possible, why should it not be in this particular legislation before the House?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth and larger area of this legislation relates to the pharmaceutical benefits arrangements. Honourable members on both sides of the House often have to attend veterans meetings in representing their constituencies. They are quite interesting meetings. A range of opinions, whether it is an RSL auxiliary meeting, an RSL sub-branch meeting or a war widows meeting, is expressed. I have attended excellent meetings, such as one at the Southport RSL with your good self, Madam Deputy Speaker. One thing that upsets veterans more than anything else is change. Even when the change is in their favour, the starting-off point for any changed measure which the government of the day or the Minister of the day is putting to veterans is always a negative disposition. Change has to be very carefully explained to them. It is very upsetting to them. They have served their country in time of war, they are used to a particular range of treatment measures, entitlements, structure of entitlements and eligibility&mdash;and along comes yet another change to those arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  I want to remind the Minister how upsetting it is for veterans to contemplate change, even where that change is in their favour. I put it to the Minister that this has led to some considerable concern about areas of change introduced since we had the original Veterans' Affairs Bill back in 1985-86, and it has not really settled down ever since. There have been changes in almost every Budget and almost every calendar year, and some of those have been very significant changes indeed. Some have been for the better; others have not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament should not lightly change repatriation arrangements and entitlements, including those under the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It does not mean that the status quo should stand either. I am not arguing that case. I just think that we need to do it very carefully and the Department of Veterans' Affairs needs to maintain the full raft of advisory assistance, consultation and publications&mdash;which it does, to be fair to it&mdash;most of them in plain English, to ensure that veterans can track themselves through the changes that are being made and be aware that, for example, on this repatriation pharmaceutical benefit change, in one sense they are not out of pocket and, in another sense, well-being is conferred on the health of the veterans community generally by the dynamic conferred by this section of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is not opposed to this legislation. I reiterate our strong support for looking after those who served their country in time of war and in time of peace. Much of the new and expanding role of veterans' affairs now relates to soldiers who have gone to Namibia as a peace-keeping force, who have gone to Cambodia, who are in Pakistan at the moment as part of yet another UN effort in that area or who have been in the Middle East and elsewhere. It is the responsibility of the Parliament to see that the right thing shall be done in accordance with the words of former Prime Minister Ben Chifley. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond, especially with regard to that cut-in date of the Kuwait-Iraq service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 is an omnibus portfolio Bill to give effect to changes to veterans' affairs and associated legislation announced in the 1991 Budget, as well as a number of non-Budget changes, all of which have been developed to improve the quality of life and health care for veterans and war widows, and to generally improve the administration and delivery of benefits to veterans and dependants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The brevity of the Bill is a reflection of the fact that many of the changes to improve the benefits for veterans&mdash;for example, the increase in the mileage allowance for veterans who use their own car and the provision of emergency short term home relief for veterans and war widows&mdash;are proceeding by delegated legislation or administrative measures. One other measure, the replacement of the telephone rental concession vouchers with the payment of telephone allowances, will be included in legislation to be brought forward in the 1992 autumn sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the matters contained in the Bill, part 2 provides for amendments to the National Health Act 1953 to provide joint safety net provisions in respect of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, the PBS, and repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme, the RPBS, patient contribution fee. This is part of the extension of these arrangements introduced last year in respect of the PBS to pharmaceutical benefits provided under the RPBS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1 January 1992, those pensioners who are currently entitled to the supply of drugs free of charge under the RPBS will be required to pay a patient contribution of $2.60 per prescription item. The charge will be fully offset by the pharmaceutical allowance of $5.20 a fortnight which will be paid to all veterans eligible to receive drugs under the RPBS. I would like to stress that the charge will be fully offset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that there has been the necessity to implement and to bring about change over the last few years in regard to veterans' affairs, but it has been done to streamline, to improve and to ensure that those moneys spent in appropriations for veterans' affairs maximise the benefits that come through to our veteran community. It is pleasing that this Bill is supported by both sides of the House. I think that is good and I think that does go a way to solving the problem that the previous speaker, the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer), mentioned&mdash;about change and a concern on the part of our veteran community about change&mdash;as evidenced by the fact that both sides of the House support this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to congratulate the Minister again for the work that he has put into this Bill, as he does with every Bill in regard to veterans' affairs, and also to congratulate the officers of the Department of Veterans' Affairs for the commitment that they make to our veterans and war widows. They do an outstanding job. As I said last night in a previous debate, we have the best repatriation system in the world and both sides of the House can be proud of it. Indeed, other countries that are bigger than Australia can look to us as a role model. It is unfortunate and sad that many countries that have veterans from many conflicts over time do not come up to scratch when it comes to looking after their returned service personnel as we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the safety net arrangements, veterans will pay no more for RPBS drugs than they receive as a pharmaceutical allowance in any calendar year. After the safety net limit of $135.20 is reached, veterans will be entitled to free drugs for the remainder of that calendar year. These changes will ensure the consistent application of the Government's overall strategy to address some of the problems associated with over-prescribing of medicine and to encourage more sensible and responsible drug use throughout the community in the best interests&mdash;I stress that&mdash;of the health and well-being of veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that veterans with RPBS entitlement are not out of pocket at any stage, advance payments of the pharmaceutical allowance will be made available, free of any income or asset test, for those who require high levels of medication. There is no doubt that many of our ageing veterans require a large amount of medication. That is one of the sad facts of ageing. Certainly some of the debilitating problems of veterans are associated with the conflicts and the environments in which they served our country. My mind goes particularly to New Guinea and the islands. Many men who went there suffered under incredible circumstances&mdash;in the Owen Stanley Ranges and in places such as Buna, and in Borneo, Malaya and Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, no income test will apply to the payment of advances for those people entitled to RPBS benefits and war widows in recognition of the fact that the benefit is of a compensatory nature. The system of advance payments is to be simplified so that it is easier to understand. At the same time, the qualifying provisions relating to the payment of the advance have been widened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of the Bill contains proposed amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 in respect of three proposals. The first of these is the 1991 Budget measure to index a person's earnings credit applicable under the ordinary income test and currently fixed at $1,000 per annum, in line with movements in the consumer price index, with effect from 1 July 1992. The earnings credit allows maximum rate service pensioners to undertake paid work on a short term or occasional basis without suffering an immediate reduction in pension or loss of fringe benefits. Currently, the Act makes no provision for adjusting the level of earnings credit, which has not been increased since its introduction in 1987. Indexation of the earnings credit limit will thus ensure that its value is maintained. I think that is an important point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second proposal proposes substantial changes and improvements to the arrangements for the payment of a pharmaceutical allowance and advance pharmaceutical allowance. The system of advance payments will naturally be extended to apply to the RPBS. In addition, the system of payment of advances has been simplified and the operation of this provision extended for a further two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for the indexation of the pharmaceutical allowance, the concessional beneficiary charge and the general patient reduced charge from 1 January 1993. Amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act, the Social Security Act and the National Health Act to give effect to these changes are also included in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter in part 3 relates to proposed changes to the operational areas. Provision is made for the insertion of a new item 11 to extend the operational areas in the Gulf region to include Iraq and Kuwait, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Farrer said, with effect from 23 February 1991. An end date of 9 June is also being inserted for operational service in the Gulf region, and there are changes to the commencing and closing dates for operational service in other areas as well. Periods for operational service for northern Malaya and south Malaya are described in items 5 and 7 respectively, reflecting the periods during which those areas were regarded as being operational. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to support this amendment Bill. As the previous speaker said&mdash;I have acknowledged his commitment to the veteran community, and I think it is fair to say that everyone on both sides of this House is committed to the veteran community&mdash;our thoughts are with our personnel who are going to Cambodia, and with other personnel in other parts of the world, who are very bravely, under different circumstances from those of war time, serving our nation and the United Nations in an attempt to bring about a better way of life and a more peaceful society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that in time to come Australians will be needed in other peacekeeping roles. I hope and pray that that is never in total conflict. But, sadly, there will be peacekeeping roles for our personnel to perform, I am sure. Consequently, this Bill's area of coverage will need to be extended. When we switch channels at news time we see the sad circumstances in Yugoslavia and other flashpoints. It is hoped that commonsense will prevail in these areas too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I commend our personnel in all the sections of the armed forces for the outstanding role that they have played from the very start&mdash;from the Boer campaign right through to today. </PARA>

I reiterate the concern expressed by the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), in respect of this commencing date for, to quote from the Bill, `the area comprising Iraq and Kuwait'. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) also referred to that matter. He referred to a period from and including 23 February 1991 to and including 9 June 1991. That, obviously, is a mistake, and it needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Australian troops were there within 36 hours of the commencement of that particular action on 18 January. I cannot quite follow how that commencement date of 23 February has been arrived at. I understand that the Leader of the National Party has drawn that to the attention of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys). Hopefully it can be corrected during the debate on this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. I am particularly interested in the parts of the Bill that deal with the extension of the pharmaceutical charge to certain veterans. In many respects this debate is similar to the debate we had here last night. There are some common elements to the two matters. Once again, I believe that the credibility of this Government in its custodianship of the very important area of veterans' affairs is in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that last night the coalition opposed the Government's legislation which facilitated the integration of repatriation general hospitals into the State hospital systems. We did so because we could not trust the Government's verbal assurances&mdash;or guarantees, if we want to use the slightly stronger word that the Government used at the time&mdash;that veterans would not be disadvantaged. In fact, each of the speakers on this side of the House last night underlined that, in fact, to the contrary, we did not and would not trust the Government in respect of the effect this would have on the existing entitlements that veterans enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said last night, and I repeat it now, that while we may not doubt the integrity of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, we certainly do not trust the Government. For this Government, as far as I am concerned, the interests of veterans are not paramount. But I must say that, having reflected on some of the things that transpired in the debate last night and that impact on this particular piece of legislation, the Minister has come down in my estimation. Last night he accused me&mdash;and I do not take it lightly&mdash;of not representing the interests of my veteran constituents. He also, I believe quite mischievously, misrepresented the position of the Queensland RSL. I want to make it clear to the Minister that, on the issue of the hospital integration, the Queensland RSL was, and still is, opposed. There is nothing equivocal about that. There may have been some confusion and cloudiness introduced due to the good offices either of the Minister or his Department, but the Queensland RSL is opposed. If the Minister wants me to quote chapter and verse from what actually occurred at its national congress in Mackay, then I am happy to do so. In particular, I reacted very strongly to the suggestion that I was not representing the views of the veterans in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will point out another mistake the Minister made last night. I do not know where he got the figures from.

My interest in veterans' affairs&mdash;apart from my own personal involvement, which I will not go into again&mdash;means that I must be very careful and diligent in representing the views of the veterans in my electorate. They are a significant number and, as I have said on every occasion that I have spoken on veterans' affairs&mdash;which is every occasion that it has come up in Parliament since I have been here&mdash;I do have a genuine concern and interest in the affairs of veterans, because, as I and the honourable member for Farrer say in this place, we believe that they need very special consideration and very sensitive treatment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that when I spoke last night I was representing the views of my constituents. Incidentally, the south-east district of the RSL has 25,000 members&mdash;maybe that is a figure that the Minister had in mind&mdash;which is 60 per cent of the total State membership of the RSL. So the south-east district covers a very significant number of people. From my consultations with them, I believe that they remain strongly opposed to integration, and I will tell the Government what they think about its proposal to extend the cost of pharmaceutical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said some nice things about the Minister in the past, I have taken this opportunity to put on record my disappointment that he castigated me for doing exactly what I claim to have done to the very best of my ability; that is, to represent the views of my constituents who are veterans. I think that sort of aspersion&mdash;to suggest that I do not take account of them&mdash;is, from my point of view, about as low as one can go in a debate in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Bill that we are dealing with, I will deal directly with the aspect that I am particularly concerned about; the Leader of the National Party has dealt with some of the broader issues. I want to make a few comments about that aspect of the Bill which gives effect to the decision announced in the Budget to extend the co-payment arrangements for pharmaceutical benefits to certain veterans. The Minister in his speech said that these changes are intended to `address some of the problems associated with overprescribing and oversupply of medication' for some veterans. We have discussed this in the broader context of the existing arrangements that now apply to social security beneficiaries, war widows and other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the Opposition has generally supported the view that the price signal that is involved here is an important one. Clearly, in the general context, it has worked because we have seen a significant reduction in the use of prescriptions for that reason. Indeed, the projected savings associated with the initiative that the Government is taking here&mdash;that is, $10.5m in 1992-93, $11.5m in 1993-94 and $12.2m in 1994-95&mdash;indicate, at least in theory, that this will be the effect. In other words, we can extrapolate from the savings that there will be some reduced use of prescription. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the implication there is that at the moment drugs are being over-subscribed for veterans. I am not entirely convinced about that. In the discussions that I have had with veterans' organisations and with some of the doctors, as one would expect, they deny that. But on balance&mdash;I say `on balance' despite the fact that I have some misgivings about this proposal&mdash;the Opposition has taken the view that it should support this legislation largely because a patient contribution has been successful, as I said, in addressing problems associated with overprescribing and oversupply. This, coupled with the safety net, ensures that veterans are eventually fully compensated. In fact, it seems clear that some veterans may even be better off because of that compensation if, of course, they do not need the full number of prescriptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of the argument that I am prepared to accept is that if overprescription is going on, then there is an element of drug abuse involved. There is a possibility that veterans may be better off by virtue of the fact that they will be saved, in a sense, from an element of drug abuse. Their health, in that sense, may be enhanced. But all that, of course, assumes that the price signal has the desired effect and that unnecessary prescriptions are no longer issued. I think that issue, in the case of veterans, is a very big question mark. As I say, I have some misgivings about it, but the Opposition has nevertheless taken the view that it ought, on balance, to support the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still say to the Minister, however, that in my general conversations with individual veterans this is still an issue of sensitivity. It is quite surprising that people are ambivalent. There are some people who feel strongly about it&mdash;this is the context of the debate that we had last night&mdash;but there are others who are not overly concerned because, obviously, it is not costing them any money depending on how we look at it; they are being totally compensated. So they are not so much concerned about this individual initiative&mdash;and it may, as we have agreed, have some benefits for them&mdash;but in macro terms veterans generally see this as another intrusion, or another attack to use a stronger word, on the special status they enjoy. They see that this lumps them in with all other social security beneficiaries. That is the point of weakness. That is the point of concern that I have with this particular proposal. A bit more of the thin edge of the wedge is going in; it diminishes just a little more the very special status that we ascribe to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I express that concern on behalf of the veterans in my community because I have discussed that with them and that is their reaction. They say, `Well, the $2.60 does not matter too much. In effect, I can even get the money up-front'. It is not the cost; it is the principle involved&mdash;what they see as just another step. Last night the crunch, in effect, came when we opposed that particular proposal because that was a big step in the diminution of their rights and privileges. This is only a little step. In the overall scheme of things the effect of this measure is probably not great, nevertheless it adds to the concern that veterans have that this Government does not take their concerns as seriously as it should. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be in the House again this evening to speak on veterans' affairs legislation and to support the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) in the work that he is doing on behalf of all veterans and war widows in our community. I might respond further on in my comments to some of the points that the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) has made in his contribution this evening. He might be surprised to know that I agree with him on a number of points, particularly with regard to the reaction of veterans in my electorate&mdash;he has reflected the views of veterans in his electorate&mdash;to the changes that have occurred to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme as they affect veterans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of other measures that are included in this Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, and I would like to remind the House of some of those. The Bill is a multipurpose Bill or, as we describe it&mdash;I am yet to understand why we describe it this way&mdash;an omnibus Bill. It seeks to give effect to a range of decisions that were made in the Budget, as well as make a few changes of a non-budgetary nature. All of these changes&mdash;and I would stress this most strenuously&mdash;have been developed to improve the quality of life and health care for veterans and war widows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the points on which I strongly disagree with the honourable member for McPherson. I believe that the actions of this Government can in no way be considered to be a diminution of the quality of care that this Government has provided and will continue to provide to veterans. I think this Government has demonstrated clearly, over the full period of its term of office, that it does have a very strong and abiding concern about the welfare and quality of life of veterans. This Bill in no way constitutes any sort of attack on that quality of care. In fact, what we are doing by these changes is locking into the Government's structures protection for the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme, as the legislation we debated last night on the integration of the repatriation hospitals into the State hospital system locked in the continuation of those hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to recognise that changes in arrangements do not necessarily constitute reductions in the quality of care. What they do reflect is a change of circumstances&mdash;a change of needs. This Government has the responsibility to act, but to act in a positive way to recognise the need to make changes in the care of veterans and in the circumstances of veterans. This means that the responses that we may have developed 20 or 30 years ago in regard to care for veterans are not necessarily the appropriate responses in the 1990s and beyond to ensure that we are able to maintain that quality of care. I would place the changes in the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme within that context because, although they alter some of the financial arrangements, in no way can they be classified as an attack on the quality of care that this Government will be providing to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill encompasses aspects such as an increased mileage allowance for veterans who use their own cars and the provision of emergency short term home relief for veterans and war widows. These changes are being implemented by delegated legislation or administrative measures. Another measure contained in the Bill is the replacement of the telephone rental concession vouchers with a telephone allowance. This will be brought forward in the 1992 autumn sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2 of the Bill provides amendments to the National Health Act 1953 to provide a joint safety net provision in respect of the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. As we have outlined, this is an extension of the arrangements which were made last year for ordinary pensioners and will now apply to veterans and war service pensioners. Part 3 of the Bill contains amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act and deals with the earnings credit applicable to the ordinary income test. This part makes provision for the maximum amount of a person's earnings credit account to be indexed in line with the movements in the CPI. The present system has a fixed credit earnings amount of $1,000. This has remained static since its introduction in 1987. The indexation of the earnings credit will commence at the start of the next financial year. The earnings credit allows maximum rate service pensioners to undertake paid work for a short period or on an occasional basis without suffering an immediate reduction in pension or loss of fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn now to the changes that are being introduced in regard to the pharmaceutical allowance. As has been outlined by previous speakers, this Bill will introduce a measure to charge veterans and war service pensioners an amount of $2.60 per script. However, as has been indicated, those people will be fully compensated for these changes; they will suffer no loss of income. It is particularly important to note that pensioners such as totally and permanently incapacitated veterans, who are very heavy users of medication, as we all recognise, will be able to seek an advance of this increase in their pensions to ensure that they are not out of pocket and that they have the financial resources to purchase the drugs and medication that they require or have prescribed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twelve months ago in this House we were debating the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme as they impacted on pensioners, and at that time there was a lot of doom and gloom in the community. There were a lot of pensioners who expressed grave concern about them. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, like me, reflected the concerns expressed to us by our constituents that this proposal would have a dramatic impact on the quality of health care for pensioners. A lot of people were claiming that the health of pensioners would suffer with the introduction of the $2.50 prescription charge, as it was then, and now $2.60 with indexation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people were claiming that this charge would result in pensioners not having their prescriptions filled as they required them, that they would stop taking their drugs and medication, and that this would have an adverse impact on their health. We have had fully 12 months now to examine the impact of the changes. The fact of the matter is that those dire consequences that were predicted at the time have not come to pass. There has been no adverse impact on the quality of health of pensioners or social security recipients as a result of the introduction of the $2.50 pharmaceutical benefits charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important for us to realise that, similarly, there will be no dire impacts on the health of veterans, war widows or service pensioners. What the charge has done is to ensure that when people go to the doctor and are offered a prescription, they are a bit more careful in considering whether they require the prescription or whether they require additional drugs. It means that people are now using medication more wisely. I think it is important to recognise, particularly when we are dealing with the aged community, that the medication and drugs that are prescribed are extremely expensive. If we look at the booklet which sets out the charges that the Government pays for the provision of these drugs, we will find that a lot of them run to a cost of $90, $120, $140 a bottle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up till the Budget last year that medication was totally free. We introduced a $2.50 charge, which is now to be increased to $2.60. We are introducing also a similar charge for drugs for war service and veteran pensioners. That medication is extremely expensive. There was heavy evidence that a lot of the recipients of the free medication were in fact wasting the drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the impact of the introduction of the charge? Firstly, it has not had an adverse impact on the health of pensioners. In fact, in a lot of cases it has probably improved the health of a lot of pensioners because they are not taking as much medication. They do not quickly grab a bottle of pills the first time something happens to them. Secondly, we have saved the Government a considerable amount of money. I am not sure of the exact figure, but there has been a reduction of some eight million or nine million in the number of scripts being filled. There is no evidence whatsoever that this has impacted adversely on the health of pensioners. There has been no evidence from doctors or any other medical practitioners to the effect that they have seen a decline in pensioners' health or that their patients have stopped taking their drugs and have suffered as a result. In fact, people have been more wisely using their medication, have stopped wasting medication and have improved their health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the scheme the Federal Government has also been undertaking a campaign in our retired and aged population to encourage those people to look at alternative methods of improving their health rather than taking drugs and medication. I think that is a very healthy trend, because in the last 20 years in this country we have had a massive increase in the consumption of drugs and medication. In a lot of cases those drugs and medication were not necessary and were simply palliatives. What we now have is a much wiser use by those members of the aged community of drugs and medication. I think that that trend will continue when this change is introduced by way of the veterans' affairs legislation and service pensioners and veterans are required to make a small payment of $2.60, which is fully compensated for. They will receive a $2.60 per week increase in their pension to cover the cost of these drugs. That will in fact result in an improved health situation for veterans and war service pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the honourable member for McPherson I have spoken to a number of veterans in my electorate. They have expressed concern to me. As the honourable member indicated, veterans have indicated that this is an attack on the quality of their care and that it is a diminution of the concern that the Government has for veterans. I have said to them that nothing could be further from the truth and that, in fact, what we are about with this legislation is improving their health by encouraging them to adopt better health care practices. I believe that the Government is serious about trying to improve the health care of war service pensioners and veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no problem in supporting the legislation. I have had no problem in telling veterans in my electorate that, although I recognise that they are a very special group of people, they have provided great service to our nation and that they are worthy of special consideration, none of the Government's actions, either in this legislation tonight or in the legislation that was passed by the House last night&mdash;or in any other actions that the Department of Veterans' Affairs or the Minister for Veterans' Affairs takes&mdash;are an attack on the quality of care, the concern or the compassion with which this Government deals with veterans and war service people. I am pleased to support this legislation and to commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the legislation before the House and to participate in the debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. At the outset I want to express my appreciation of the fact that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) is in the chamber during this debate. I want to speak about matters affecting returned servicemen generally and their entitlements, something about the extension of entitlements to wartime merchant mariners and something about the change in what I detect is the relationship between government and veterans. I think that change is very much to the credit of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years I have noticed that veterans entitlements is an area that has been worked to death by some sections of the community. There are those who almost make a career out of creating mischief and spreading misinformation. Our colleagues on the other side of the House have been quite expert at it at times. One could undertake no more debasing task than to set about unjustifiably causing fear, exaggeration, anxiety and needless worry amongst the ageing Australian community&mdash;and, most of all, amongst our veterans, people who have risked their lives and whose families have suffered in defence of our nation. Those who pursue those kinds of tasks will go down in history as people who have really debased Australian veterans&mdash;debased the role, the commitment and the contribution that they have made to the defence of our country and the preservation of freedom in our land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have detected from the Minister over the last couple of years is that there is a better understanding of the changing needs of our returned veterans. As they age&mdash;just like the rest of us in this chamber&mdash;their needs and expectations change, their ability to participate in some events changes and they need more help in some areas. We as a caring community and the Department are charged with a very special responsibility; we have to respond to those changing needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite dastardly that people have set out deliberately to create anxiety, needless worry and fear and confusion in the minds of people in the higher age group. I do not know why they do it. Some of them do it because they get some satisfaction out of feeling important; others do it for political purposes; and others do it for purposes I just cannot divine&mdash;maybe they just cannot help themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this omnibus Bill that is before the chamber this afternoon we are looking at a range of amendments to the Act as it stands. Some of the confusion that I have come across has been in relation to the introduction of a charge for prescriptions. All that arrangement does is place veterans under exactly the same kind of system which exists now for the rest of our aged community. There is nothing special or different about it; it places them in the same position. They receive a supplement to their pension. For the first $135.20 outlay on prescriptions they will be required to pay at the rate of $2.60. They will receive $2.60 per week addition to their entitlement&mdash;and one offsets the other until that outlay of $135.20 is reached. From there on, all prescriptions are free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite remarkable how some people have been successful in confusing our veterans into thinking that somehow they have to outlay all of their own money and pay for all of these prescriptions and maybe they will get some of it back later on. It is just nonsense, it is just mischief and it should not be happening. There is an attempt to make life more difficult for our veterans, but in reality it places a uniformity on the system for the veterans and their pharmaceutical entitlements or benefits and the rest of the aged community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there had been some wild and continuing outcry from the rest of the community about the operation of the charge of $2.60 per prescription and the offsetting supplement that is being paid to them with their pension entitlement, then there would be ground for some concern, but the reality is that I have not had one request for months and months in relation to the pharmaceutical charge from any of my aged constituents who are covered by that legislation. Not one!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a number of complaints in respect of veterans. When they show me the information they have received, it is just plain mischief; it is wrong and it is obviously designed to cause them anxiety. When I have talked to them I have explained that this is just an extension of what happens to everybody else, it does not create a problem anywhere else and this is the background to it. They can understand that because they are fair minded people; they do not expect there to be any discrimination in how the system operates. I do not have any difficulty with that, and if it is explained properly and in a careful way to our veterans they can readily accept it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that has been the source of some mischief in relation to our veterans in my region of the Hunter has been an attempt to raise the campaign against the integration of repatriation hospitals. In the region where I come from our veterans are much happier being able to go to a hospital nearby, close to their families, where they can be visited by their family when they are in hospital, rather than being carted off to Sydney, to Concord. Considerable savings are to be made for the taxpayer in having them treated at home, but primarily it is a good quality of care at a much more convenient location. I have not had any complaint, nor have I seen the kind of inconvenience or degradation of care that is claimed by those people who have been objecting or trying to raise opposition to the integration of our repatriation hospitals. </PARA>

In the Minister's second reading speech when he introduced the Bill last week he referred to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the extension, from 1 December 1991, of repatriation treatment benefits to Australian merchant mariners of World War I and World War II on the same basis that applies to Australian war veterans. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I have said in the House before that this is a very welcome decision from the Government, and I again want to give recognition to the Minister for the role he has played in getting a successful Cabinet decision for the extension of these benefits to wartime merchant mariners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 14,000 Australians who were engaged during World War II, we know that at least 637 died on Australian vessels. Next year will be the fiftieth anniversary of the Coral Sea battle and an extensive range of services and commemoration activities are presently being developed by the special council that has been set up for that purpose. Australian wartime merchant mariners, including those who played a role in those battles and survived, will be involved in those activities, which will include all of Australia's defence services as well as the US service people who were involved at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People generally do not recognise how important the merchant marine is to Australia. The extension of this entitlement to those wartime merchant mariners is a long overdue recognition of their sacrifice and the sacrifice of their families, because they did not have the same protections or level of care, and there were not the same records kept of injuries incurred by wartime merchant mariners during World War II&mdash;and, worse still, World War I. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have told the Minister privately, and he has had representations from various merchant mariner organisations, and from Mr Bob Nelson and the kindred services committee, that our merchant mariners are now looking to a continuation of the Minister's efforts to ensure that they have equality in entitlements with veterans. They want the rest of the entitlements&mdash;not just the medical entitlements, but an extension of the remainder of their entitlements. The same arguments apply&mdash;I do not have to argue them all again; it has been done on previous occasions. Merit is there and the extension of those entitlements is deserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that when the appropriate occasion arises during the next budgetary considerations there will be a continuing effort to have those extended. There is not much point in gaining an extension of those benefits if our merchant mariners from World War II are no longer here to receive them. I press that point on their behalf and on my own behalf. I commend the Minister for his achievements in that area. I think the Bill, overall, is an extension of entitlements that will be readily accepted and understood by our veterans generally, and I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

The honourable member for Shortland has been here for many years. He was a great Minister in this Government and he was a great member of the Opposition. I put on the record that I was very grateful for his assistance in gaining recognition for merchant mariners after these many years. This was achieved through a large effort in consultation and cooperation with the honourable member for Shortland and his very good friend Mr Bob Nelson. I appreciate that, because he was able to influence quite a few of my colleagues in the Ministry to bring the merchant mariners under the Veterans' Entitlement Act. I especially thank him for that and I thank him for his contribution in this debate this evening. </PARA>

The Leader of the National Party supported the rewrite of the plain English part III of the Veterans' Entitlement Act. We have published the brochures put out by the Department of Veterans' Affairs in larger print to make things easier for veterans.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is with delight that I stand here again speaking in your august company, but with a House not as full as this Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 demands, as did the social security Bill this morning. I say again, in terms similar to those I used this morning, that it is absolutely criminal that, once again, we are faced with an uncertain program that launches this debate 24 hours ahead of its scheduled time because of the impact of the guillotine. The process which affects that guillotine does not allow proper debate on a subject as sensitive and as important as this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the first time that I have made this complaint. In fact, this time last year, we were rushing through this House a measure on nursing homes&mdash;that is, the residents rights, charter and contract&mdash;which we were told had to be in place within a few months so that it could be implemented. I had to say on that occasion that it was the worst piece of legislation that has ever been drafted. To the credit of the legislative draftsmen here, it was not done by them; it was done within the appropriate department. But here we are 12 months later, and in actual fact the problems that we mentioned would be part and parcel of the implementation have been only too real. But I want to deal with that later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders what this process does achieve, particularly in view of the fact that even legislation that is cleared from this House and amended in the Senate comes back here for approval. And one wonders just how accurate it is at that stage. Of course, when we are dealing with community services or social security Bills, one really has to wonder about the Government's social justice policy when important parts of legislation are brought before us time and time again with little opportunity for the Parliament to consult or debate and fairly numerous changes are proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill was introduced at midnight last Thursday, as practically the last item of Government business, and here we are within six days, expected to have had the comment of the industry on it and wide ranging discussions. It is impossible then to try to appropriately address these matters at this time. I just say again: the process of government is in crisis, and it is a disaster for those constituents outside whom we are supposed to look after. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed within this Bill affect hostels, nursing homes and services for people with disabilities; and I wish to deal with each of those separately. Amendments to the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act, to be renamed the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act, implement decisions on aged care announced in the 1991-92 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for financial assistance to be paid to organisations providing community aged care service packages to aged or disabled persons not living in institutions. It is stated that these packages will provide a level of care comparable to that provided by hostels for their more frail residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal has received a guarded response from those who provide care for our frail aged in hostels. They refer to the Minister's statement that all surveys of older people have shown that they prefer to stay at home and receive care rather than move to a residential facility. The Australian Affiliation of Voluntary Care Associations states that there is a significant difference between what older persons prefer and what they need in the way of personal care support to ensure a satisfactory quality of life, and also that there is a high variability of need for personal care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has long supported the view that the longer we can allow people to stay in the comfortable environment of their own homes, the better it will be. But we have to take note of what is mentioned there by the Affiliation&mdash;that what we have to look at is the personal care support to ensure a satisfactory quality of life wherever it is, whether it be in a hostel, residential, or in the home environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also points out that the cost of providing personal care support to older persons in their own homes will not be less and, in some cases, may be greater than in a hostel. These consumers will require other services such as those provided under the HACC program. Unless HACC is able to meet the increased demand, the success of the community aged care package is at risk. However, the Affiliation acknowledges that the care service packages are a good idea, but emphasises the importance of early implementation of pilot projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aged Services Association of New South Wales and the ACT says that such a service will build up emotional needs as well as physical needs and warns of the dangers of discontinuing such a package when an older person has become emotionally dependent on it. As a consequence of the introduction of community aged care service packages, the number of hostel places per 1,000 people over 70 will be reduced from 60 to 55. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill restructures the personal care subsidies paid to hostels into three levels of funding geared to care needs. In actual fact this is the commencement of what we have often suggested&mdash;that nursing homes in the future will be those providing heavy nursing care requirements and the hostels will be those providing lighter nursing care requirements. </PARA>

That is a specialised requirement of the staff in a nursing home, but it cannot be attributed to a hostel, with its lesser degree of sophistication in this regard. But we are told nothing about how this will happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do know that the particular aspect that the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) has brought to my attention is being addressed in Melbourne at this moment at the AAVCA annual conference. The AAVCA is concerned about the changing needs of staff between one and the other, and the traditional service being provided by the other and now being changed in midstream without any respect whatsoever for what the staff will have to suffer in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional support will be available for residents who are very physically frail, including people with dementia. I want to mention that again later on because the existing dementia grants program will be phased out. For special dementia hostels this amounts to a cut in funding. The current personal care subsidy plus the dementia grant amounts to $30 per day. Dementia sufferers will now attract a subsidy of only $26.20 a day if they aspire to the highest category of care that is being suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ask the responsible Minister whether he believes there is a need for stand alone hostels for dementia sufferers and, if so, when he will address the need for adequate funding of such hostels. I want to dwell on this a little because there are specialised hostels throughout Australia. I can actually name two: one in Perth in Western Australia run by the Anglican Homes, and another one in Toowoomba in Queensland which has tried to specialise in dementia cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In actual fact the Perth one has determined, in a very carefully thought out formula, what the Government would be saved by funding a lesser category of dementia care compared with putting such cases in a nursing home. And the saving is substantial. Yet that organisation, for the three years that it has been operating, has had to have its funds matched or built up by the State Government because there are insufficient funds from the Federal Government. In actual fact, had it persevered without State subsidy, the losses that have been incurred over three years would have put it out of business at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is probably a need for a stand alone arrangement, if we have the figures checked; and I believe the Minister should do that. But to unilaterally then declare that the dementia grant of $30 per day will be diminished over a period and supplanted by the $26.20 per day is asking the impossible of hostels. It will be impossible for them to provide adequate care and the quality of care for these particular people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this Bill and in addressing the matters that confront aged care at the moment, the Government has turned a blind eye to the needs of those with dementia. If one goes into any nursing home or hostel in Australia, one will find that the majority of persons there are suffering from a dementia problem. Some are in the nursing home under another category, but basically dementia is the problem. The Government refuses to look at the problems associated with this: the problems of the carer who needs respite care, the problems within the nursing homes and the problems within the hostels. None of this has been addressed by the Government. Its only reaction has been to pull down the subsidy already available. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unrealistic. Again, as the honourable member has mentioned, it places this huge onus on nursing staff and hostel staff because they have a responsibility of care. I do believe that the Government has not considered that responsibility and duty of care of the professionals in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many organisations are gravely concerned about the latest version of the personal care assessment instrument proposed for hostels. I understand that the Government consulted with industrial, consumer and industry groups in October but, despite satisfying none of these groups, it proceeded to conduct a pilot study involving five hostels in New South Wales and Victoria. This pilot study is to be followed by a major trial of the new instrument, involving 340 hostels across Australia, to be completed before Christmas 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest version of the PCA instrument is widely perceived to have many deficiencies. These include placing undue demands upon already stressed hostel management because of the need to maintain and provide documentation required to validate the personal care assessments. This is a job that requires a degree of skill and certainly a degree of time and care, because any incorrect assessment could lead to penalties later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the other matters that have to be taken into account are deficiencies within what is being suggested, and those deficiencies include the fact that the categorisation of residents and the resultant funding is not likely to reflect the real costs of personal care for residents who have dementia or a behavioural disorder or who otherwise require high levels of personal care. Another is that specialised dementia hostels are not accommodated by the general personal care assessment instrument. A separate instrument is proposed for those facilities, but details have yet to be provided for consideration. Another is that short term illness is not recognised in the new personal care assessment instrument. Another is that the personal care assessment will be effective for three months. Consideration should be given to this period being extended to six months, which I understand is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also contains provisions to enable some control to be exerted over the quality of persons operating approved hostels. It will be a condition of the hostel's approval that the person operating or proposing to operate a hostel be approved as an approved operator. This provision already applies to nursing homes and poses no real problems to the hostel operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By amending the National Health Act, the Bill gives effect to two of the changes to the nursing and personal care funding arrangements for non-government nursing homes announced in the Budget. One set of amendments will enable a nursing home to delay applying for a new classification for a resident whose previous classification expired during or shortly after return from hospital leave. A new application will not now need to be made until the resident's care needs have been assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further amendments providing for a temporary classification for a new nursing home resident are in response to a request from the industry that nursing homes receive an interim level of funding for new residents at the lowest level of classification pending assessment of the resident's care needs. Although the industry has requested a mid-level of classification, it acknowledges that this is a very practical improvement brought about by the Government listening&mdash;at last&mdash;to the concerns of nursing home proprietors, staff and the unions involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for additional infrastructure, that is, SAM funding, for nursing homes in isolated areas and for homes caring for residents who receive certain feeding and continuous oxygen. It is very important to note here that this additional care is being given because there are many people living and working in isolated areas in nursing homes and hostels where the cost of the care is greater than it might be in other places in Australia. But the Minister still refuses to address the inadequacy of SAM funding generally. Estimates have been made within the industry that there is a deficiency as high as $10 per day in that SAM component. Others assess it at less than that figure, but there is a desperate need for nursing homes which provide that quality and service of care required to have this immediately addressed. I am not telling the Government anything in this regard but I believe it should be taking notice of the people who are the carers as far as this inadequacy is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the introduction of SAM funding arrangements, the nursing home industry has pointed out that there is a major deficiency in the construction of the return on the investment element of the funding package. It has argued that until such time as SAM is based on a properly constructed methodology, one in keeping with standard Australian business practices and correct accounting procedures, the industry will continue to have major financial problems. For some proprietors the difficult times are here right now. The situation in Victoria is absolutely critical. I am advised that some 21 per cent of the private sector homes are in or near receivership, and the rest are struggling for survival. For nursing homes throughout Australia, SAM is insufficient to ensure the long term survival and regeneration of the industry and its buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked the Minister when he will listen to the industry's cries for help. I have been at two conferences this year and this has been a major concern to the people. I believe we have to recognise that the industry is, in the majority of cases, providing an invaluable service on behalf of the Commonwealth and the Government for our frail aged. If the Minister could tell the House what the Government is doing to address the inadequacy of SAM funding, I would be much relieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did say that I was going to talk about the problems that we have found with the contract and also the charter which was rushed through the Senate at this time last year. We understand that, even with delays, there are still guarantees that cannot be given on one of the major amendments that we sought, but that was not effected, and the concerns of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference seeking to have the agreements provide for the exclusion of visits by medical practitioners who are not prepared to accept the philosophy of the nursing home in discharging their responsibilities as practitioners. It was regarded by some&mdash;particularly within the Government circles&mdash;that this amounted to people not having the choice of their own doctor. That is not the case at all. All that the Catholic bishops were asking for was the exclusion of practitioners who would not accept the philosophy of that nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister: to what extent has this been addressed? To what extent are the contracts and also the charter rights determined to be legal and incontestable? Or will the Government relieve the pressure on these people either by amending the contract, as we first suggested, or at least by giving them the right not to sign a charter or contract? I believe it could go as far as that. The industry itself is waiting. It is quite prepared&mdash;and it always has been prepared&mdash;to observe the requirements in this regard. But time will tell what the cost of executing these documents and the administrative time burden will be in connection with these contracts. A document I have been given advises:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A recent survey showed that the nursing home resident population is turning over at the rate of 56% per annum, this would mean that for a 100 bed nursing home in any one year 56 contract documents would need to be negotiated. This is more than one a week!</PARA>
<PARA>The document says that when the time spent in counselling, advising and explaining to the residents or their guardians is taken into account, it is going to be a huge cost to those people operating the nursing homes in getting these contracts signed. They are also dealing with the additional complication that some of these people, who are generally elderly, may not understand what the contract is. I would defy most parliamentarians to tell me what the contract means in many regards. When the operators talk to the guardians of families it will create a massive problem as far as implementation of these contracts is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with the comments we have made, we will be moving a second reading amendment later on. Our proposition is that while we will give the Bill a second reading we are concerned particularly about the dementia grants and the lack of appreciation by the Government of what is happening in that regard. We will be moving that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to move to the second area that is contained within this Bill, special nursing homes. The Bill proposes amendments to the National Health Act 1953, the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 to revoke approvals to the 17 remaining nursing homes for people with disabilities and the three remaining hostels for people with disabilities at the time the existing Commonwealth-State disabilities agreement came into full operation in each State. The amendments allow for these nursing homes and hostels to be included in the transfer of administrative responsibility for all Commonwealth funded disability accommodation services to the States when the CSDA agreements, which were signed on 30 July 1991, come into full operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, in listening to some of the advice and counsel that comes from outside, is not prepared at this stage to allow the Government to put a sunset clause on these particular Bills, which I understand will remove the guaranteed funding that is available under the Health Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do this for many reasons. Firstly, many of these hostels and nursing homes had already transferred and were uncertain about what their funding would be. In spite of the fact that they said there would be guaranteed funding, I can quote one such nursing home in north Queensland where the funding was not made available on the same basis. Purely and simply, while that nursing home was licensed for a certain number of beds, the Department assessed the usage of those beds for the previous 12 months and reduced the funding to a percentage&mdash;about 80 per cent&mdash;of the beds that were there before because of the usage problem. That particular nursing home made a particular and deliberate effort to get those residents back into their own homes for periods such as Easter, Christmas and other holidays. That is now telling against them and I understand that, from the last time I spoke with them, they have had their funding reduced to about 80 per cent of the beds available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a problem where not only are hostels and nursing homes not getting the same funding but it has also been suggested that the number of beds will be diminished. Once we reduce the number of beds to a certain number, the viability of the whole enterprise goes out the back door because of the fixed costs involved. We have been told that the sunset clause applies as of 30 June on the basis that, firstly, accommodation under the Disability Services Act will be transferred to the States and, secondly, employment services will be retained within the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week and this week we had the spectacle of seeing another leadership challenge from the former Treasurer against the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) which has put the veto on next week's planned Premiers Conference. Apart from talking about taxing arrangements and such items as that, I would have thought that the Government would have addressed the matter of transferring accommodation services to the States. I do not know what process is now going to take place or to what extent this is now in place that enables the Government to say to the Opposition that as from 1 July 1992 accommodation services will be in the hands of the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing we ask is: on what basis will the States have the accommodation in hostels and nursing homes transferred to them? If it is on the basis of the present Disability Services Act, the Government would be aware that we in the Opposition have proposed amendments to the Disability Services Act for several reasons: firstly, to bring the guidelines before this House so we can debate it and make the decisions ourselves from here, instead of leaving it in the hands of the bureaucrats. Will that be included? Secondly, will the contracts that have been signed conform to a definite pattern set out by the Act instead of allowing the bureaucrats the opportunity of expanding that contract with any detail they might want to include to the disadvantage of the proprietor? Will that be included? The third amendment we sought related to the appeals section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have grave difficulty recommending to the Opposition that the comparable legislation right across Australia be on the basis of the current Disability Services Act, particularly with the transition date set at 1992, which is an impossible target not only for the Commonwealth to achieve but also for the States. I would suggest that those 17 remaining nursing homes and three remaining hostels did not sign those contracts for a very good reason, that they were not sure whether they would be guaranteed a continuation of the funding, that they could not be guaranteed that the nursing homes and the hostels would be allowed to back fill&mdash;in other words, as one resident went out, another one could be admitted. The very reason they remained within the scope of the current Act is that they did not have those assurances. I do not think the Government can give those assurances at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is suggesting that there is no rush, in spite of the fact that the guillotine is being applied to yet another Bill, to make a judgment on this matter. We suggest that there should be a deferral of the passage of the Bill until, firstly, appropriate legislation is in place to ensure continuity of the funding to the nursing homes and hostels to be transferred; and, secondly, proper guidelines are drawn up for the proposed transfer of accommodation services to the States, which ensure continuity of funding at the level currently paid and on the terms currently in operation, or complete clarification of the intending relationships between the State and Federal governments as to the funding for accommodation services. We do this for a very good reason. I do not think the Commonwealth should relinquish its responsibility until it can be guaranteed that funding will be available to provide the same level and quality of care that is available from the carers at the moment. This should be a predominant part of the Government's consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there is no rush for judgment on this Bill. There is still time to process such a proposition in the autumn session. As a result, members of the Opposition will seek that deferral from the point of view of voting against that clause of the Bill when it comes before the Senate because obviously we will not have that opportunity here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 because it relates to an issue that is very dear to my heart. As you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and other members present will know, my electorate of Cowper goes from beautiful Port Macquarie in the south to sunny Coffs Harbour in the north. The electorate has the feature of having a very high demographic component of the population above the age of 65. That is about 55 per cent higher than the Australian average. This means that we have a particular demand for nursing homes and aged hostels. I was most interested to hear all that the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) had to say; he was right on track. I share his concerns about many of these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to raise, in particular, a number of points. The Government's circular 91009, issued on 25 October 1991, is very demanding in terms of its effect on nursing homes. Section 40AA(6)(B)(C) requires approval of premises as an approved nursing home, subject to completion of agreements between residents and proprietors after March 1992. Any non-compliance for the completion of agreements requires regular reports to be completed by the proprietors of private nursing homes. These reports are due in January and July 1992 and relate to those not entering into an agreement under clause 20. Agreements are mandatory after 1 March 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be monitoring teams checking compliance as part of the outcome standards and they will be trying to ascertain whether agreements are in force, whether they have been properly explained to the residents or their representatives and whether the residents understand them. I think that will create quite a bit of difficulty and expense not only for the nursing homes but very possibly for the residents as well. I think that the vast majority of private nursing home operators in Australia and community based nursing homes are absolutely fair dinkum. Their only concern is the proper care of the people living in their establishments. They will probably have to recommend that legal advice is obtained for the residents or for their families to interpret the agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the residents or their representatives choose not to enter into an agreement, specific procedures and documentation is needed. They need to have a very good reason for not having the agreement. I think that is going to place a great deal of stress on some of the elderly Australian citizens who are living in these particular institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, too, that clause 5.1 and clause 18 specifically prohibit any extra charges. I think that this is probably unfair and unreasonable in so far as a lot of activity is generated in nursing homes and it is necessary that from time to time there should be extra charges. I think it would be far more reasonable if the Department's agreement were to permit that where it was reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clauses 15 and 15.3 are very relevant because my understanding of the agreement is that the nursing home patient who is allocated a bed in a particular ward, room or corner of a room is entitled to maintain occupancy of that particular bed, that individual bed, as long as he wants. I think it would be reasonable to suggest that there could be circumstances&mdash;I am sure there will be circumstances&mdash;where there are patients in nursing homes who, for reasons of their interest and their welfare, would need to be moved. I am thinking perhaps of the circumstance where somebody was, unfortunately, in his last days. The director of nursing, in the interests of the patient, would suggest that it would be appropriate to move that person into a private room. However, under this agreement that will not be possible. We should have some change involved in the agreement to permit this to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note, too, that clauses 21.3(d), 21.4 (c) and 21.7 give residents 56 days occupancy in a nursing home without paying any fees and continued residency even if paying no fee if no alternative accommodation is provided. I can see that the person who was in the nursing home without financial resources must be cared for and there must be provision made for that person. Nobody in his right mind would suggest otherwise. Equally, nobody in his right mind would suggest that, in the instance of a community nursing home or a private nursing home, the organisation concerned should have the responsibility thrust upon it to absorb the financial cost involved. This is surely a cost appertaining to government. I hope that the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) will pay attention to this particular point because I believe it is quite relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 23 specifies that nursing homes should have residents committees and an internal disputes committee. I can understand the logic in this being suggested, but we are not talking about battlefields or disputes between the ACTU and big business. We are talking about nursing homes that are looking after our ageing parents or our relatives and other citizens of Australia. I am rather distressed by the thought that we have to have an internal disputes committee, as a matter of law, inside a nursing home, where people are being loved and cared for and respected and looked after. I really wonder at the production of the heat oppressed brains of some public servants in the Department who must be out of touch with reality and do not know the way it works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have the opportunity, and I frequently exercise it, of visiting a great many nursing homes in my electorate. By and large, without exception, in my experience those people are looked after with love, care and affection. I find it quite strange that the bureaucratic monolith we have here is suggesting that nursing homes have to have this sort of industrial disputes committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that in some cases the nursing homes in my electorate do not have a residents committee, but they have a monthly meeting of residents and relatives where they are able to make any points they want to. They certainly do not have an internal disputes committee, but the director of nursing is always available, when required, and sorts things out. This is the way it happens in reality. But it seems to me that what is occurring with the provision of this agreement is that we are rapidly losing touch with reality in what we are providing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 24 says that residents of nursing homes have a right to participate in decision making and make submissions to the proprietor. That is either directly or through resident committees. I do not know of any nursing home in Australia where the residents, their relatives or their carers do not already at this minute have the right to make submissions, suggestions and requests. By and large, I know from my own experience that, if these are reasonable, they can happen and they do happen. I suggest to the Minister that there should be a rethink, a relook at this problem, because I do not believe that it is entirely appropriate that this is the way we should be going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us face it, we are talking about institutions already. We are seeking to put them on an agreement, a charter, and what we will end up with will be a prison-like situation in which the rules have to be followed. I believe that the proposals are not necessarily for the benefit of the residents. Some nursing homes&mdash;individual charitable organisations&mdash;have provided the complete funding to build and furnish nursing homes. The Government pays the patient subsidy to assist in the cost of nursing care but it has had no involvement in the capital investment involved in the provision of those services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, where there is a private or a community nursing home or other aged care institution, there should be the opportunity for a reasonable return on the investment. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), who spoke before me, made mention of this as well. Most of these hostels and nursing homes are always seeking to provide more care and better facilities. In my own electorate of Port Macquarie, the Port Macquarie Garden Village has put in bowling greens, spas and a heated swimming pool for the hydrotherapy treatment of people who live in the complex. Without making a reasonable return, they do not have the opportunity to further improve the facilities being offered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, too, that the charter of user rights must be displayed on the walls of the nursing homes and copies given to patients and their families. I suppose that is fair enough. There should be communication and there should be knowledge. However, I do wonder about a virtual invitation for local committees&mdash;charitably we might describe them as do-gooders&mdash;which have nothing to do with the organisation concerned but want to stick their bib in and interfere with the management. I do not think that that is necessarily reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested to me that the agreement between individual patients and the companies involved with private nursing homes really embodies 27 pages of threats. Every nursing home has to provide that signature during November, and the agreement will take effect from 1 December. As the honourable member for Dawson pointed out, this legislation was rushed through the Senate a year ago, virtually nothing has happened since, and now we have this deadline whereby nursing home proprietors right around Australia are being forced to sign this charter of rights during this current month to take effect on 1 December. I think that there should be more time and I think there should be some right of appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, too, to note that, should a patient not be prepared to sign the agreement&mdash;and that is possible&mdash;the Government will sign on that patient's behalf. What is interesting is that the whole thrust of the charter of rights is&mdash;properly; I do not dispute this&mdash;to protect the rights of the patients. But, equally, if we are to be fair, just and equitable, there should be some provision to protect the rights of the organisations, community bodies and companies that are actually involved in running these particular nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following on from the suggestion that there should be a reasonable return on investment, I point out that such a return had been promised to the nursing home industry. But the question could well be asked: where is the increase in the SAM subsidy?  On the basis of what I have been told, no home is making a reasonable amount under that current SAM subsidy. Nursing homes are not even making enough to put money away for future expansion and the provision of better facilities. The nursing home industry was led to believe that it would get a substantial increase in the SAM subsidy. In fact, the figure that was mooted and discussed was 34 per cent. What happened?  What did they actually get?  The increase was 1.2 per cent, which was totally inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the Minister in the strongest possible terms that the SAM subsidy for the care of patients in nursing homes should be tied to the CPI. Anything else is totally unreasonable. It is unreasonable to expect nursing home companies, proprietors and community bodies to continue to provide the services when their costs are going up and up at an ever increasing rate and when the subsidy is not keeping pace. The Minister should seriously consider the provision of CPI adjustment to the SAM subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like again to make the point that the nursing homes and the aged persons hostels in Australia are providing an invaluable service. I speak from the heart. My own parents are resident in St Joseph's Hostel for the Aged in Coffs Harbour, which is a very new aged persons hostel facility. It is so new, in fact, that I am pleased to say that I will be performing the official opening on Wednesday of next week. I thank the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services for the opportunity of opening that facility on his behalf. I really appreciate that because, as I said, my parents are residents there. The standard of quality of the new hostels and nursing homes is really quite outstanding. I know this from my personal experience; also, my mother-in-law is resident at Ozanam Villa hostel in Coffs Harbour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The care provided, in this instance in hostels operated by the Catholic church, is absolutely outstanding. But within my electorate there are a number of nursing homes. Whether it be the Legacy home, the Garden Village, the Salvation Army home or private facilities, the standard of care is absolutely outstanding. The elderly Australians who are resident in those facilities deserve the best and, in my opinion, they are receiving the best. But the provision of that quality care could be made much easier for the institutions and companies providing it if there were a more reasonable payment from Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to draw the attention of the House to the experience of a small exporter in my electorate who several days ago, in attempting to take advantage of the opportunity to develop niche markets in Asia, was caught up in an unfortunate incident. He is a farmer near Naracoorte in South Australia. On 1 November he consigned some sheep and feral goats by air on Singapore Airlines flight 228 for a customer in Singapore who required them for a religious festival. The consignment was to leave Australia from Tullamarine in exactly the same crates and under exactly the same arrangements as for a number of previous consignments from Adelaide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those animals arrived at Melbourne airport and were inspected by two Department of Primary Industries and Energy veterinarians who certified them as being in good health. They were loaded into three three-tiered crates for travel. That loading took until 12.35 p.m. that day because of delays involving ground staff. Two hours later, just before the flight was to go, the forwarding agent was told by an airline representative that the shipment was not going because `animals had died and horns were protruding from the crates'. Other reports suggested that there was bleeding from the animals and a nail protruding from the crates. One of the veterinarians who had inspected the animals earlier said that, although one animal appeared to be dead, his professional opinion was that `on balance the shipment should proceed'. Despite this, the Singapore Airlines representative decided not to load any of the animals, including those from the two crates with no problems, and the customer in Singapore was therefore forced to purchase animals from a competitor, at a greatly increased price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it turned out, there were no dead animals, no broken horns, no bleeding sheep and, as far as one can ascertain, no nails protruding from any of the crates. That small businessman, Mr Malcolm McKenzie from Naracoorte, has put in an account to Singapore Airlines for some $14,000, and his customer in Singapore, Mr James Ng, has also forwarded his costs to that airline in that country. Mr McKenzie, of course, believes that he may have lost the customer altogether. I want to say that this is a sad example of why Australia is not taken seriously in some areas&mdash;our failure to deliver and the fact that we have become in some areas an international joke in terms of purporting to be a nation of reliable deliverers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, on that day there were a number of reasons for what happened, which have been reported in the documents since then. The main one seems to me to have been that a union element and Qantas ground handling staff's apathy and lack of cooperation may have caused the Singapore Airlines station manager to act as he did&mdash;as well, of course, as a mistaken early diagnosis by a Department of Primary Industries and Energy veterinarian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once upon a time, these curious inefficiencies were confined to the waterfront. But it is very disturbing to know that they are increasingly at the airports as well. It seems to me inexcusable that Singapore Airlines should somehow have come to make such a decision, and I hope that it finds it within itself very quickly to pay due compensation to both parties&mdash;that is, the Australian exporter and the Singaporean importer&mdash;as there seems to be no reasonable reason for such a bad and costly decision to have been made. Decisions such as this, when multiplied, only sully our international reputation. </PARA>

In its transitory period of office, the Scullin Government had been torn apart by the growing problems of unemployment, national indebtedness and falling exports. That sounds rather familiar. The Prime Minister's hair turned white and he had aged a decade in just two years. Yet, in stark contrast to the present Administration, I believe the Scullin Government had a genuine concern for the unemployed and for the future of the nation.

It is a government whose contempt for the Australian people would sicken the stomachs of Labor stalwarts like Frank Tudor, Matthew Charlton, John Curtin, Ben Chifley and Joe Scullin. These men would be dismayed to see what has become of their country during the last 20 years.

Every day the productive sector is called upon to justify its existence; every day it is called upon to pay for the excesses and the ambitions of politicians and bureaucrats. With Christmas coming up, the number of business closures will soar and unemployment levels may well jump from the current 15 to 20 per cent to as high as 20 to 30 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, this Parliament debated the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) under guillotine. It was not possible to have a say, so I am seizing this opportunity to do so.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complexity of that legislation yesterday, which has the object of eliminating the order of $500m in sales tax from the cost structures of businesses producing goods, is beyond belief. I want to underline that, comparatively speaking, $500m or thereabouts is small change compared with the total sales tax imposed on businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total amount of wholesale sales tax collected is of the order of $9,500m. We have authoritative estimates prepared by the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University that, of that $9,500m, 49 per cent is paid by businesses as sales tax on materials and supplies, so-called `business inputs', that businesses buy for use in their production process&mdash;as stationery, motor vehicles, fuels, et cetera. A further 14 per cent is paid by purchasers of investment goods, such as machinery and equipment, leaving only 37 per cent paid initially by ordinary consumers. Forty-nine per cent of the $9,500m is $4,655m and adding the other 14 per cent gives a total of $5,985m, so nearly $6 billion is paid initially by businesses and that has an effect on costs. That is the total dimension of the problem. What we have in this Bill is a procedure for dealing with about $500m. Relatively speaking, as I say, it is a trifling amount; the Government is fiddling while Rome burns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the coalition's goods and services tax, businesses would not have to finally pay such sums&mdash;they pay GST on inputs, but it is refunded by the Government. So they would not have to pay this sort of money&mdash;$6 billion&mdash;and, therefore, would not have to pass on that vast amount in their ex-factory prices. Just think how not having to pass that on would reduce costs, and the effect it would have particularly in the area of Australian-made goods competing with imports. That is the area that I want to focus on. Business not being able to compete with imports is a great national problem for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Constituent after constituent complains to me about going into the supermarket and everything is imported: goods are made in China, Taiwan, France, Germany, Bulgaria and where have you. With the coalition's GST&mdash;not this paltry $500m&mdash;Australian products ex-factory will be cheaper because there will not be any of this wholesale sales tax to pay, so they will have a fairer go at competing with imports. Equally, Australian producers will have a better chance to compete in export markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of most important effects of the Opposition's goods and services tax. What sort of reaction do we get from the Government? It rants and raves about the goods and services tax. In particular, it argues that what the Opposition is doing in this context with this tax is relieving businesses of nearly $6 billion of tax by imposing the goods and services tax on all consumers with the effect, in particular, that&mdash;and this is what it often says&mdash;the poor are being made to pay extra tax in order to reduce tax on business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. I have two points in answer to that charge. First, it is an essential part of the Opposition's proposal that the poor will be fully compensated for the extra cost due to the GST. That draws the teeth of that point. Second, while the initial incidence of the sales taxes is on business, it is added on to the price as part of costs and the final consumer pays. It never was a case of business `paying'; the final consumer pays. With the GST, similarly, for the Australian product along with imports, when they both sell at their ex-factory prices plus GST, it is the final consumer who is paying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>In either case, with sales tax or GST, it is the final consumer who pays. But the GST procedure of imposing no tax on business inputs because the tax paid is refunded keeps costs down and enables the Australian producer to compete more effectively. It means more activity and more jobs for Australians, thus helping the unemployed and helping families. With the GST as a component of the tax package, which is itself a component of the whole Opposition policy package, we can go on to achieve that fundamental change that is needed to turn this country around for the benefit of all Australians.</PARA>

The attitude of the Indians on that day was in stark contrast to the attitude of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to the recent World Wave Ski Championships on the Gold Coast in Queensland at which 10 South African competitors were rudely pulled out halfway through the contest, which then had to be downgraded to the World Individual Invitational Titles.</PARA></TALK.START>

Eighteen months planning went into these world championships. The organisers were promised Australian Sports Commission funding of $10,000&mdash;which was withdrawn in writing two days before the contest went ahead. The World Wave Ski constitution says that anyone from any country may compete in the championships&mdash;there are no restrictions. Therefore, the organisers had no control over who competed. </PARA>

He is also the Executive Member of the National Olympic Committee of South Africa and Chairman of the Non-Olympic Sports Multi-Sport Organisation. He says in that letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The South African Wave Ski Surfing Association has been and still is an affiliated member of COSAS. It is therefore in my capacity as President of COSAS, as Executive Member of NOCSA and as Chairman of the Commission for the establishment of the new multi sport organisation, that I can confirm that the South African Wave Ski Association is accepted by us as the sole national and properly constituted, structured and organised governing body for all facets of the sport of wave ski surfing in South Africa. SAWSA is totally open to all members of whatever nationality, race, colour or creed, and its constitution contains no discriminatory clauses.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have it. However, this Government takes its instructions from the ANC. The ANC has not cleared this body yet because it has never heard of it. All other countries say that it is okay for that organisation to compete, but Australia says no. We had this clumsy, oaf-headed handling of the situation. We had officers of the Department ringing up after a couple of days of competition&mdash;with smug voices, I am told&mdash;wanting to see the 10 South Africans because they were out here on tourist visas instead of sporting visas. </PARA>

They immediately phoned Canberra for instructions. They called in all the foreign visas and passports and said that they would take a few days to process them. Of course, this meant that our international visitors could not cash their travellers cheques while all this nonsense was going on. The officials eventually let the 27 New Zealanders off because of the special relationship we have with that country. Four nights later they called in all of the almost 50 left into their Southport office, put them in a room with no light, no air-conditioning and no chairs&mdash;and they had to sit on the floor for several hours while, in a Nazi-style grilling, they were interviewed at length, one at a time. </PARA>

Why then were not the English, Japanese, French and American wave ski competitors banned, too. It was absolutely outrageous. It was an embarrassment to Australia. When the immigration officials turned up the next day to check that the South Africans were not competing, they were ordered off the beach by the other competitors who were so disgusted by what had happened. I would like the Ministers for Immigration, Foreign Affairs and Sport to look into this matter and apologise to those South Africans concerned, to the competitors from the other countries, and to the Australian competitors for what happened.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to bring to the notice of the House the subject of interstate trucking. As honourable members are aware, the lifeblood of this nation is very much within the trucking industry and at the moment that industry is under review. I was going to ask the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) to put this matter before the Premiers Conference, but I think he may have some difficulty doing that in the short term&mdash;although at a later date he may be able to raise it with his fellow Ministers at a State level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue that I would like to place before the House&mdash;and if there are any other members who have information regarding it, I would be pleased to hear from them&mdash;refers to truck drivers who believe they have been stitched up by the police forces in the various States. Let me elaborate on `stitched up'. It would appear from the evidence that I have before me, which has been very much of a verbal nature and perhaps difficult to prove, that people in the trucking industry are being booked unfairly for breaking the speed-limit. However, with today's technology, many of these trucks today are fitted with speed limiters. One of my constituents, a Mr Koppe from Trafalgar, had a speed limiter fitted to his truck on 31 January this year. The speed limiter was tested at that stage, and the records I have in front of me show that it was capable of doing 62 miles per hour top speed on a flat surface. Mr Koppe came to me quite concerned that in New South Wales he had been pulled up by the police and booked for doing some 15 kilometres per hour over the speed-limit. He immediately took his truck to people in Brisbane and had it rechecked. The vehicle came back the next day&mdash;this was on 7 May&mdash;and the people who tested it said that it had a maximum speed capability of 100 kilometres an hour. He believes that he was stitched up at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I made representations on his behalf to the New South Wales police, it was interesting that they said there were two things that they relied on&mdash;one was the radar and the other was the observation of the policemen. Rightly so, I could say, on the other hand, that we had a professional truck driver who would know when he was breaking the speed-limit and who also had a piece of technical equipment which showed that he was not breaking the speed-limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further evidence has come to light that the industry is perhaps being victimised in some areas. I refer to the November issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Truckin' Life</EMPHASIS>, where it says that a 38-year-old policeman from Victoria was driving a truck on 19 July. It goes on to explain where he was. He had a Western Star fitted with a speed limiter which cuts in at 98 kilometres per hour. He goes on to say how the police followed him, pulled him up and claimed he was doing 112 kilometres per hour. When he showed them his ID they backed away from it, and their comments were, `Well, you have got to make a living'. He ended the article by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I honestly believe that this was another stitch-up job, as there is no way I was speeding. </PARA>
<PARA>The point I want to make to the Minister and to the House is that those truck drivers are trying to do the right thing, they are fitting speed limiting equipment and they are trying to enhance the reputation of their industry, so somewhere at law they should be able to have evidence that shows that their trucks have speed limiters fitted and it should be evidence on which they can defend their cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention the business expense basis. The on-the-spot fine was $200, yet the cost of defending that matter would have been about $2,000, for my constituent to go to New South Wales, present this evidence and bring in experts. As a businessman he could not afford to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just ask the Minister to take on board what I have said tonight. Other honourable members may have evidence of unfair play, evidence of the trucking industry being unfairly picked on. Some members of the industry are trying to do the right thing.

The bartering that has been going on for years, the swapping of services, the back scratching between the legal profession and the medical profession&mdash;these are all means of avoiding the payment of tax.

However, I deplore the Government's decision to impose such an unfair, insensitive tax. It is not even 10 per cent&mdash;it is 30 per cent. On the basis of that seemingly very strange action of the Government in putting this tax on a piece of equipment that it is compelling the people who install air-conditioning to have, I appeal very strongly to the Minister to remove the imposition of that tax on those items as a matter of urgency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) touched on the taxation of a very important form of purchase. I wonder whether he will take the opportunity next week, when he and his coalition partners have their seminar, to thrash out how the GST is to be applied in a number of these areas. As there is further discussion of the GST, which is proposed by the Opposition parties, will a whole host of exclusions be sought? How far will the integrity of the system allow for those exclusions? So those who get up and give examples of the present tax regime to that end should be careful about how they enter the debate within their own parties about this new form of tax that the coalition will put before the Australian people at the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to speak about the consumption tax tonight, I want to speak about my growing concern and dismay at the coalition parties' small-minded attitude to the better cities program. Day after day in this place we have Opposition members come before us and talk about the `mad cities fantasy' and all sorts of other derogatory descriptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask members of the coalition parties: when will they confront some of the major issues that are confronting Australia? Are they able to confront those issues in the very dry manner in which they appear to put them before us? The Opposition parties will have to come to a realisation that many of the things that confront Australia as a nation very much require the involvement of government and often&mdash;this might horrify some on the other side of the chamber&mdash;the intervention of government, not often directly to produce results but often through the involvement of different programs to get attitudinal changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that the building better cities program hopes to demonstrate is that there are examples of planning our urban structures in a better way. Through the projects that will be funded under this program, it is hoped that there will be attitudinal change not only by decision-makers but also in the expectations of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take an area such as my electorate on the northern urban fringe of Melbourne, which has grown dramatically over the last two decades, one of the municipalities is the city of Whittlesea. It has been in the top five municipalities for growth for something like the past 15 years. The municipality is coming to the limit of its capacity to be able to put in place the type of infrastructure that the community expects. It is now required that we look at different ways in which our cities can develop. The Victorian Government, as part of its commitment to the building better cities program, has put forward a package for the northern suburbs. The elements of that package are very important because they are integrated and look at ways in which we can demonstrate that the mistakes of the past should not be repeated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those projects is to look at whether previously institutional land at places such as Janefield that will become available as a result of the deinstitutionalisation of the State Government can be used for housing. Already, local environmental groups have raised their concerns. I think that their concerns are premature&mdash;we are entering only the first phase of this program&mdash;and that there will be thorough consultation. I think that the environmental groups misunderstand the extent of the project that is proposed. They do not understand that there are positive aspects and that we can look at the environmental concerns and make sure that we carry out the project in a proper manner. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to discuss very briefly the terrific Skillshare operation in place in my electorate at the Basin Centre run by the Salvation Army. One of the things that makes the Salvation Army program so significant is the fact that when we examine the Basin's balance sheet, the financial statement for the year ended 30 June 1991, we see that the Federal Department of Employment, Education and Training, through the Skillshare program, contributed $162,883 but that its total income was $582,911. The Skillshare program is largely funded by the Salvation Army through its on-site farm program, through local business and industry, and through charging fees for some of the Skillshare operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell honourable members, some of whom may not know, that the Salvation Army is an international movement; it is an evangelical branch of the universal Christian church; its message is based on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS>; and its ministry is motivated by a love for God. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mission is both spiritual and practical, encompassing the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the alleviation of human suffering and distress without discrimination. The Skillshare operation includes a large farm operation. In the past few years, those at the farm have done a terrific job in genetic herd improvement. Their genetic development and better nutritional standards have enabled the centre's herd to be in the top 10 per cent of herds tested by the West Gippsland Herd Improvement Cooperative five times out of the last 12 months. By comparison, in 1986-87 they were producing 152 kilograms of butterfat per cow and in 1991 they are producing 211 kilograms of butterfat per cow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the programs that the Basin Centre operates, one is residential. In the first program, which was developed on the site following the closure after 87 years on that site, it operated a Bayswater youth training centre. That training centre was for those youth who were found, on orders by the court, to be outside the law and outside parental control. That centre is now closed, but the Basin Skillshare Centre continues to operate as an attendant centre for persons who are on community based orders. Those people undergo training programs; they work on the farm enterprises at the Basin Centre location; and they are generally assisted by the Salvation Army to return to an active and productive life in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Skillshare continues to be the Basin Centre's dominant program since its inception in 1989&mdash;and it has grown very rapidly. Through its program last year over 200 persons were assisted, with 41,250 hours of structured skills training delivered, which was nearly double the number of hours it had contracted for with DEET. Despite the outcome, the Department of Employment, Education and Training chopped its budget in that financial year by $45,000. Fortunately, late in the year DEET realised the mistake and rectified it to the extent of another $30,000, and this year the Basin Centre's requests will have been met. </PARA>

That equipment provided by the Mazda Foundation to the Basin Centre was worth over $50,000. We thank the Mazda Foundation and we congratulate the Basin Skillshare Centre on its excellent programs of continuing work in the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Railways Commission (AN) has been undergoing restructuring since its formation in 1978. This has involved major changes in the nature of its operations, which in turn has meant substantial changes in the number, types and location of staff employed. These changes are expected to continue, and also involve a reduction in the number of staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) AN has advised that it expects that about 1,800 staff are either surplus now, or will become surplus over the next two years. It is intended to reduce staffing by about that number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The staff affected are in all areas of AN's operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) It is expected that the redundancies will occur over the next two or three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) The future of rail in Australia depends on its efficient operation. This has involved, and will continue to involve, restructuring of a wide range of functions often leading to a significant reduction in the level of staffing required. It is inappropriate that AN continue to carry staff who are not gainfully employed. This situation has also been exacerbated by the current business climate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) AN has not made public the numbers in each category of staff affected at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(f) Labour savings have been made through natural attrition. AN has until recently had a policy of no forced redundancies, and voluntary redundancy schemes have been in operation for several years, but AN, the ACTU and key rail unions recognise that compulsory redundancies are now required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(g) On 30 October 1991, I announced that the Government had decided to allow AN to offer a package involving three weeks pay for each year of service up to a maximum of 76 weeks, including four weeks in lieu of notice. This package is conditional on commitments from unions not to flow the package on and is to apply to any redundancies at AN which might flow from the establishment of the National Rail Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(h) The enhanced redundancy arrangements do not affect superannuation entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) AN has had, until recently, a policy of no compulsory redundancies. Dr Williams' statements were made in this context. The current policy, which allows for compulsory redundancies, was decided at the July and September 1991 meetings of the Commission, but only has effect following the Government announcement of an enhanced redundancy policy on 30 October 1991. AN has advised that it is actively canvassing its workforce to ensure that those wishing to take advantage of redundancy packages can do so. It hopes that this approach will avoid the need to target specific positions in order to achieve its staff reduction targets.</PARA>
