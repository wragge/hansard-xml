</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to that. On the basis of the evidence that has been given up to this stage by Mr Burke to the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters, let me say this: I and the Government believe that many of the actions that have been taken by Mr Burke have been unwise in the extreme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members-Ha, ha!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I have not finished. But on the basis of the advice that has been given to Senator Evans-who has the primary carriage of this matter and with whom I have had significant discussions-by his Department, while there was action taken by Mr Burke that, had it been known at the time, would have required reprimand by the Department and a cease and desist order from the Department to him, the advice is that, on the evidence that it has to this stage, including what Mr Burke has said, there would have been no grounds for his dismissal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> May I say that Senator Evans has indicated in writing to this effect and on those bases, while I repeat that many of the things that, as now revealed, Mr Burke has done I think have been unwise in the extreme and improper on some accounts, I also repeat that no advice has been received from the Department that that would require dismissal. Indeed, the advice is that none of that action would in fact constitute grounds for dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me say, Mr Speaker, that in regard to much of this I think the position has been well put by the Opposition's Senator Hill. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>These are the issues that will be examined-</PARA>
<PARA>and he was referring to the full facts of the handling of the leader's account. I believe that those matters should be left to the Royal Commission to establish. I believe it is not for this Government or this House to make judgments on those matters. Indeed, Senator Hill said on 29 April:</PARA>
<PARA>But these are the issues that will be examined no doubt in depth and when there's a finding we would respond to them further.</PARA>
<PARA>As I say, Senator Evans is of the view-and I agree-for instance, that the operating and controlling of party political funds for the purpose of directly supporting political campaigns would be imprudent and inappropriate for a serving ambassador, and the Department has advised Senator Evans that if such conduct had been established, the Department would have considered appropriate a reprimand and an instruction to cease his involvement in such activity. Without making any judgment about the facts of the matter, Senator Evans has written to Mr Burke directing him not to engage in such activity while he remains an ambassador.</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members-Ha, ha!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Presumably the Opposition is implying that it is not appropriate for Senator Evans to write in those terms. I am advised that such activity is not contrary to the Bowen Committee's code of conduct or the guidelines on official conduct of official public servants, but the view of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and of the Government is that more stringent standards should apply to ambassadors because of their special status. Senator Evans has asked his Department to consider the desirability and practicality of establishing a specific code of conduct to guide ambassadors.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TITLE>RURAL ADJUSTMENT SCHEME</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9U4">Mr NEWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Has the Minister seen reports that the farm adjustment measures he announced recently provided very little new money for the rural adjustment scheme? How much new money has in fact been provided, and what is the importance of this for farm businesses?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3061" SPEAKER="Kerin The Hon J.C." NAMEID="QH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WERRIWA" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 April I announced a package of rural assistance measures to take effect from 1 July this year. The centrepiece of that package is an additional $96m for the rural adjustment scheme in 1991-92, and a foreshadowed further increase of an extra $80m for 1992-93. It was a disappointment to me to find that the response to these increases, particularly from the farm organisations in Western Australia and New South Wales, was that the package was a con. These unhelpful political responses fail to take account of a number of facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, the increases in RAS funds-rural adjustment scheme funds-are the largest single increases ever made, reflecting the serious view that this Government takes of the current income difficulties for the wool, wheat and some smaller sectors. The amount of new money we have allocated is based on the most careful and thorough predictions about the future of farm incomes that we have ever produced, and on a detailed appraisal of the rural adjustment scheme using information from farm surveys, the rural adjustment scheme authorities themselves, the banks and rural councillors. Every one new dollar we allocate to debt reconstruction under part A of the scheme is effectively a commitment of $7 over seven years, because that is the way part A is structured.</PARA>
<PARA> The main complaint from the New South Wales Farmers Association seems to be based on two things: first of all, an out and out error. Some of its people are quoted as saying that there is only $2.5m extra for household support and rehabilitation for next year when in fact cabinet had agreed to $52.5m extra. Secondly, they have complained that there is not enough extra debt reconstruction money, and that the RAS authority will run out of funds in the next few months. This is again wrong, but on several accounts.</PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales authority has additional money for part A to be paid to it for the months of May and June this year. It, like some of the other authorities, has financial reserves. From 1 July it will begin to receive its share of the new part A funds allocated. If New South Wales wants additional money for debt reconstruction, it can get it in the new financial year by the State Government matching the DRIS program-that is the debt reconstruction and interim subsidy scheme-that we have put in place.</PARA>
<PARA> I have already indicated the Government's intention to review the RAS allocations, the States' responses and the demand on the scheme in December of this year. The money available for debt reconstruction after 1 July under part A and the special new DRIS will be sufficient to subsidise between $1.1m and $1.7 billion worth of borrowing, depending obviously on the amount of subsidy applied, but that is up to a seventh of institutional farm debt.</PARA>
<PARA> These discussions on RAS were announced in conjunction with the decision to pay $35m in compensation to wheat growers, to provide enough money to double the number of rural councillors, and to establish a new rural access program. As I said, this package was carefully prepared and targeted, and costs over $100m extra in the next financial year. So those who describe it as a con should ask themselves whether their attitude is helpful to their constituents, particularly in the light of the review of RAS due next December, and whether other people, like machinery dealers and shopkeepers, would not object to being subject to such a con. It is the farmers in some States who pay their dues to farm organisations who are being conned. From some of their leaders they get no analysis and no constructive proposals-just cantankerous self-promotion.</PARA>
<PARA> I end on a positive note: we have provided a very significant boost to the capacity of the State rural adjustment scheme authorities because we believe the rural adjustment scheme is the best way to assist those with long term prospects who are in financial difficulty and to assist others to make the necessary structural change and leave the industry. It is now up to the State governments to maximise the available RAS funds by matching our money for part B; we pay the whole of the allocations to parts A and C. It is also up to the banks to do all they can to help with carry-on funds, especially for wheat growers.</PARA>
<PARA> Recently I met with the Executive Director of the Australian Bankers Association. I have been assured of the banks' understanding and cooperation. I only hope that this high level cooperation will be translated into flexibility and cooperation in the banks' regions and branches, where it will really count for farmers. A positive attitude by the State farm organisations would really be a most helpful thing in all of this.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Prime Minister. It relates to the still serving Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See, Mr Brian Burke, who received donations of $400,000 to his leader's account from Mr Lang Hancock. Why did the Government approve a visit by Mr Burke to Romania, in company with an employee of Mr Hancock, in April 1989? Was the Prime Minister personally involved in the decision to give Mr Burke a special role in promoting trade in eastern Europe? Did Mr Burke meet with the late Nicolae Ceausescu on that visit? Was Mr Burke discussing interests associated with Mr Lang Hancock when he was in Romania in April of 1989?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3062" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Soon after Mr Burke took up his post in Dublin, he raised with the Department the possibility that he might continue his involvement in matters relating to Australia's trade with eastern Europe. The Department recommended to Senator Evans that, in view of Mr Burke's established links with eastern Europe and with Australian companies which did business there and the consequent potential benefit to Australia from his activities, continued involvement in this area by Mr Burke as an Australian official would be acceptable subject to certain conditions, such as keeping other areas of the Department informed about his activities to ensure that they were properly coordinated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that Mr Burke made only one visit to Eastern Europe under this arrangement. I understand that that visit was to Romania in April 1989. It was made at the request of Lang Hancock. I understand that Mr Burke was accompanied by an employee of Mr Lang Hancock and by Australia's Ambassador and Trade Commissioner in Belgrade, who are responsible for Romania.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1990 it was decided, in the light of events in eastern Europe, that the arrangement was no longer of much potential benefit to Australia, and it was brought to an end. There was nothing secret in this arrangement. I understand that it was raised by the office of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) with Senator Evans's office in January 1990. As to whether on that visit Mr Burke met the President of Romania, I do not know. As to my own involvement, I have some recollection that I knew that he may be going there, but the actual arrangements and clearing of it and the conditions under which he did it were, as I have indicated in the answer to this question, a matter for the Department.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The March balance of payment figures released yesterday showed the strongest trading result for Australia in three years. It is the best signal yet that the Government's policies are working to rebalance our external accounts. The current account deficit is now running at about 24 per cent less than for the same period a year ago. It is well within the Budget forecasts. As well, the surplus on goods and services trade means that we are paying with our exports for all our imports of goods, all of the costs of bringing them here and all of the travel abroad. In other words, we are paying our way in terms of goods and services. This trend and this change are not a flash in the pan. We have to go back to the 1970s to find a consistent run of surpluses of this variety. Indeed, our merchandise trade balance has been in the black for 10 of the last 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apparently, there is some guffawing on the Opposition front bench, so I repeat: our merchandise trade balance has been in the black for 10 of the last 12 months. Another encouraging trend in our balance of payments has been the phenomenal growth of manufactured exports under this Government. Since the Government came to office, manufactured exports have increased by 300 per cent. Indeed, in the three months to March this year, manufactured exports were nearly 20 per cent up on exports for the same period in the year before. For those people who think that Australia has a terminal disease in regard to its exports, who think that the world no longer wants what we produce, let me remind them that merchandise exports have more than doubled since we came to office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our export volumes, goods and services together, have been growing at an annual average rate of 8.3 per cent over the life of this Government. I repeat: 8.3 per cent consistent growth in goods and services over the life of the Government. As any of the Statistician's releases show, export volumes have increased right through the 1980s, and have increased strongly. Therefore, what we are seeing is a structural change in the way in which this nation does business with the rest of the world. We are seeing a structural change in the trade accounts of this country. We are seeing a consistent shift to exports. That shift was only dented by the drawing power of domestic demand at the height of the boom through 1987, 1988 and into 1989. As domestic demand has come back, those goods have been released to the export markets again. The strength of exports in the 1980s has nothing to do whatsoever with the recession. It was a structural change brought about solely by this Government-solely by the moves to competitiveness, by a floating exchange rate, by changes in wage policies, shifts in the factor shares, changes in the tax system, enhanced productivity and, generally, a willingness on the part of Australians to engage the rest of the world in trade. That is why the structural change is there.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that our friends opposite saw the portents in yesterday's figures. They saw the first surplus in goods trade since 1988-which itself was a spike-and realised that this trend which we have seen is consistent with merchandise trade surpluses. One has to go back to the 1970s to find a similar trend. They could see what this means as we continue to strengthen the external side of the economy and what it means politically for them. It was therefore of no surprise that the numbers were bagged by the shadow Treasurer, as they always are. Any good news is put asunder in his manic determination to put Australia down for his own miserable political ends. We saw those references from him.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that what we saw in the March balance of payments was a structural improvement in Australia's trade accounts-structural not cyclical. For the year to March exports were up 13.5 per cent and imports were down 13.5 per cent. There could be no more stark statistic than the fact that exports were up 13.5 and imports were down 13.5 and that there has been a trend improvement in exports right through the 1980s. It is that which will deliver growth to the Australian economy. It is that which will underpin living standards through the 1990s. It is that shift to the external sectors which is coming from the success of the Government's policy in rebalancing our external accounts.</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat: yesterday's figures were very important in painting that picture. They were not a flash in the pan, and are a portent of a stronger, healthier internationalised economy as we go through the 1990s.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In profound agreement with my friend and colleague the Treasurer, I make this point: if we look at the period since 1983, by any objective assessment the accord has been fundamental not only to the economic but also to the social achievements that have occurred in this country since 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the honourable member from the Opposition for asking me what they are. I will tell him what they are. In 1983 we inherited a country, after seven years of coalition stewardship, which had produced the historically unique situation of having double digit unemployment and double digit inflation at the same time. That is what we inherited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the accord, with the great cooperation of the Australian trade union movement, even with the loss of jobs that has occurred over the most recent period we have still created 1.4 million new jobs in this country. I remind the Leader of the Opposition, as I have on many occasions, that that is a rate of job creation twice as fast as the coalition managed to achieve during its period of office.</PARA>
<PARA> We had a situation where the profit share of national income was absolutely ruined. We have moved significantly from the wages share to profit share which has enabled investment over the past two years to reach record levels. We have had a shift from wages to profits, and we have had that because of the operation of the accord. As well as that, we have had a more than 10 per cent reduction in real non-farm unit labour costs under the accord.</PARA>
<PARA> It is recognised by leaders of industry that the trade unions, if they had wanted to exercise their industrial muscle, could have achieved significantly higher money wage increases than they did. In all of those circumstances, where we have also had a 60 per cent reduction in the level of industrial disputes in this country, it is impossible for anyone, whether the Treasurer or the Prime Minister, to come to any conclusion but that the accord has been fundamental to those economic achievements.</PARA>
<PARA> But it is not only those economic achievements because, as part of the preparedness of the trade union movement to accept lower money wage increases than it could otherwise have achieved in the field, it has accepted in return significant improvements in the social wage. It is not simply something that has been done between the trade union movement and the Government; all people in the Australian community are better off, because Medicare has been brought in, there has been a doubling of the access of young people to education and a massive increase in child-care provisions in this country. All those increases in the social wage have been brought to bear under the accord.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I agree with Paul Keating that the operation of the accord has been fundamental not merely in the operation of the wage fixing system but in the achievement of greater social justice in this country. Having said that, it is the position of the Government, including the Treasurer and myself, that in this country, given our history and social mores, there will continue to be a significant role for the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> As distinct from those opposite, who would abandon to the forces of the market those in the work force with the least bargaining power so that they would not have any sort of protection at all, we believe that it is the role of the Industrial Relations Commission to provide a basic standard below which no-one in this country shall be employed. We believe that the Commission will continue to have that role and continue to have a dispute settlement role. Of course, there is also a role for the Industrial Relations Commission in negotiations such as those that have taken place recently in the area of the waterfront, negotiations in which I have been involved, together with Senator Collins and Senator Cook.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not make any apology for the length of the answer, because it is an important question and the answer is also important. It is not a question of either the accord or the Industrial Relations Commission. True it is that, given the most recent decision of the Industrial Relations Commission, there is a period in which we are going to have to work out together how those respective roles are going to operate, but there will be a continuing important role for both the accord and the Commission.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I want to say that the draft agreement was, in our judgment, a magnificent breakthrough. It was a fitting culmination to the campaign that was begun by Australia, in cooperation from the outset with the Government of France. When we first rejected the Antarctic minerals convention and, as the honourable member will recall, began arguing for a comprehensive environmental protection regime for the Antarctic, we were almost laughed out of court in many sectors in this country and certainly in most countries around the world. This was seen as the impossible dream. Our unstinting pursuit of this goal and the intrinsic merits of the arguments that were used in support of it gradually won the day in the international community and we gradually convinced other nations that they should support our efforts to preserve this superb and fragile area of the globe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The draft agreement includes extremely tight provisions prohibiting mining and mineral resource exploration. It means that, even if a review conference is called after the initial 50-year period, any amendment to the prohibition would need the agreement of all current consultative parties such as Australia. I should also mention one very important aspect of this issue which has tended to be overlooked: not only did we get a prohibition and an effective veto by all the consultative parties, but we also made great progress in establishing a comprehensive environmental protection regime and the designation of the Antarctic as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science. There will be measures to ensure compliance with the environmental agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> As I think the honourable member will appreciate, Australia's negotiating team had a very tough job, not only in Madrid but also in the preceding international conferences that led up to Madrid. It had a very tough negotiating job against the entrenched position of some of the mightiest nations on earth-the United States and the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA> Against that formidable opposition our negotiating team did a magnificent job with absolute meticulousness. It did its job quite brilliantly. I think not only on behalf of the Government but also on behalf of the people of Australia, members of the negotiating team should be congratulated for the job they did. I also want quite directly to thank and congratulate France for the continuing support we received from the French. I know that the draft has to be approved by governments, but we are extremely confident we will succeed in making sure that the Antarctic remains protected.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion-I know the honourable gentleman who asked the question has a profound interest in this issue-I hope that all treaty nations will now move quickly to give this draft agreement their full support.</PARA>

Until the most recent decision, the accord was worked out between the trade union movement and the Government. May I say that that process was done with consultations with employer organisations. We worked out a framework which, I remind the honourable member for Bennelong, he would have loved to have done when he was Treasurer. Does he remember the sorts of wage outcomes he got? His last one was 18 per cent. He could not come within a bull's roar of getting any sort of sensible national wages aggregate outcome.

<PARA> As distinct from the total incapacity of the honourable member for Bennelong under his philosophy, his policies and his principles of getting any acceptable aggregate national wage outcome, where he had his last effort of an 18 per cent blow-out in wages, under the accord-and fundamentally under the accord-the Government has sat down with the trade unions, had discussions with the employers as well, and said, `For the forthcoming financial year, the national aggregate wages outcome will be X per cent'. In every year that predicted aggregate national wage outcome has either been achieved or we have come in under it.</PARA>
<PARA> It is no wonder that the honourable member for Bennelong is very embarrassed and touchy about this issue. Would anyone not be embarrassed if his last effort in office-under his principles, his policies and his prescriptions-had produced an 18 per cent wages blow-out, where he saw the Government coming into office and saying, `This is the wages outcome we will get', and every year achieving it? No wonder the honourable member for Bennelong is very touchy about the subject, and well he might be. The great wonder of this is that, having seen the capacity of the accord process to achieve these given national wage outcomes, having remembered the blow-out he had, which absolutely ruined the Australian economy, and having seen the contrast, he now wants to condemn Australia to a return to what he did before. That is the massive surprise about the position of the honourable member for Bennelong. There is no difference between the Prime Minister--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me finish. There is no difference between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer-no difference at all. It is the case that, given the decision that has just been made by the Industrial Relations Commission, there will have to be a period in which both the Government and the Industrial Relations Commission in a number of ways sort out what their roles will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had the good fortune up until this year that where the work has been done between the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the Government, in consultation with many employer groups, we have gone to the Commission and said, `Here are the results that we believe we can deliver for the benefit of the Australian people if the accord is implemented'. On every occasion up until this year the Commission has seen the good sense of saying yes. In particular, year after year it has seen the results delivered, not only in terms of national aggregate wage outcomes but in regard to the gradual movement to significant workplace reform. As the Commission has seen those results being delivered, it has made the very sensible decision to say, `Yes, we are going to be associated, through the Commission, with the implementation of that accord'.</PARA>
<PARA> On this occasion, for a variety of reasons, the Commission has chosen not to make that decision. It is inevitable that, in those circumstances, as the Treasurer said, the Commission is going to be looking at what its role is, and so will we. I am confident, given the good sense within the Government, within the trade union movement, within the employer organisations and, hopefully, within the Commission, that we will be able once again to reach a position where, together, the Commission, the Government, the unions and the employers are going to do what they could never do under the regime of the honourable member for Bennelong-that is, get a 60 per cent reduction in industrial disputes; get a 10 per cent reduction in real unit labour costs; and say, `This is what the given national aggregate wage outcome will be'.</PARA>

It is a personal award and it does not indicate in any way that there are no policy differences between Australia and Turkey. The honourable member should appreciate that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Turkish Government is aware of our position both on Cyprus and on human rights. Australia has consistently supported the United Nations Security Council resolutions on Cyprus-namely, resolutions 541, 550 and 649. This Government has consistently supported those resolutions. We have upheld the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus, consistently condemning the unilateral declaration of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983. I think, as the honourable member knows, we have consistently done that.</PARA>
<PARA> We have been actively involved as well in a search for a solution to the problems of Cyprus. We have contributed the services of 20 Australian Federal Police personnel to the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus. We have been supporting the United Nations Secretary-General's negotiating efforts, which we believe offer the best prospects for a just and lasting settlement of this question. This Government supports the universal application of internationally accepted standards of human rights. We remain concerned over continuing reports of human rights abuses in Turkey.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to information provided by the Amnesty International parliamentary group, our embassy in Ankara makes representations to the Turkish Government on cases of concern. In my discussions about important international and bilateral issues with President Ozal, I will of course raise these and other issues of concern to Australia, as, may I say, I did when I was in Turkey last year and speaking with the President then. But I note and I welcome President Ozal's significant personal contribution to recent reforms in a number of areas in Turkey. So I believe that I and the Government have a responsibility to take a comprehensive view of Australia's national interests.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the case, as I believe the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party will agree with me, that last year President Ozal played a significant role in helping this nation to commemorate what for it is one of its most sacred institutions, and we are honouring the President of Turkey in respect of the contribution that he has made to the improvement of relations between us. But I emphasise to the honourable member for Calwell that our doing that, as we believe we should, responsibly, in regard to a proper understanding of Australia's overall interests, does not mean that we ignore or put aside our concerns on these other issues: the question of Cyprus and the question of human rights in Turkey. I repeat the answer I have given to the honourable member: that in the discussions I had with President Ozal, those issues will be raised and dealt with seriously.</PARA>

What the Leader of the Opposition will not bring himself to understand is that a sea change occurred in 1983 in terms of the attitude of government to the organised work force of this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A sea change occurred in 1983. This Labor Government said that the organised working men and women of this country are a force for good. Whether we are going to get increased productivity, whether we are going to get better work practices, and whether we are going to get achievable aggregate national wages incomes depends on the Government sitting down in a constructive way and talking with the trade union movement. We have never made any apology about that. We have gone about it. The Minister for Industrial Relations, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have been involved in sitting down and talking with the leadership of the trade union movement. We have achieved the outcomes to which I have referred-outcomes which honourable members opposite were never capable of achieving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That does not mean that at some time the Treasurer will not be speaking with Mr Kelty. It does mean that that will be happening. For instance, when the present Minister for Finance was the Minister for Industrial Relations, he spoke with them. Senator Cook speaks with them; I speak with them. But we speak with them on the basis of a common policy and a common philosophy. The common philosophy is this: the organised working men and women of this country are an asset without whom we will not have growth, without whom we will not have increased productivity, and without whom we will not have restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA> The only way to get their involved, positive cooperation is by sitting down and talking with them. Sometimes it is the Treasurer, sometimes it is the Minister for Industrial Relations, sometimes it is the Prime Minister-but it is always on that common philosophy and on the common basis of trying to get what is best for this country. Against that position we have the unfortunate fact that 100 years on, in 1991, honourable members opposite have learned nothing. It was the use of troops against workers in 1891, and it is the same policy today.</PARA>

Given the Federal funding implications of the freeway, can the Minister advise of the Government's intentions in this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3072" SPEAKER="Brown The Hon R.J." NAMEID="5A5" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CHARLTON" MINISTERIAL="LAND TRANSPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the proposal on the part of the New South Wales Government to impose the toll on the F4 freeway west of Sydney, and I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for the question. He raised this question in the Parliament at least on one occasion-on 18 February-and the concerns he expressed on that occasion vindicate the position that he adopted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By way of background and for the benefit of members of the House, I would like to indicate briefly the circumstances surrounding this toll proposal and why it is causing such concern not only to me, but also to the local community in the vicinity of the freeway. The New South Wales Government plans to fund the so-called missing link section of the F4 freeway between May's Hill and Prospect, and some widening work further east, through a private toll road development. As the F4 is a State arterial road, and therefore the responsibility of the State Government, the imposition of a toll is a matter for the State to consider, and the Federal Government is not in the business of telling the State how to run its road system.</PARA>
<PARA> The location of the toll booths on the F4 is, however, of direct interest to the Federal Government. The section of this road on which the New South Wales Government proposes to collect revenue has already received substantial funding from the Federal Government. The New South Wales Government proposal is to place the toll collection booths some distance to the east of the eastern end of the missing link on the section to be widened. In between the booths and the eastern end of the missing link lies a section of road that was paid for by the Federal Government under the Australian bicentennial road development program, and at a total cost of $38.4m. This section of the road has already been paid for by the public, and under the New South Wales proposal the public would be required to pay for it again.</PARA>
<PARA> Should the toll be imposed, it is likely to force thousands of cars and trucks through adjacent streets in the area in an effort to avoid the toll. This raises very real concerns about safety and increased air and noise pollution in the local community areas.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, I consider it to be unfair that commuters in the Parramatta area, represented so admirably by the honourable member for Parramatta, will be forced to pay the toll every day and that they should be expected to shoulder the burden of funding a section of road which will ultimately benefit a much wider section of the community. After considering the matter closely and at some length, I have come to the conclusion that, because of the implications of that for Federal programs and the social implications, there would be no social benefit which would justify bringing forward the construction of that road by the imposition of a toll and which would outweigh the social disadvantages that would be associated with it. For that reason, I will not give my approval.</PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to make it perfectly clear that that does not necessarily pre-empt any decision that might be made in the future by me, as Minister, or by the Government in connection with questions of that kind. We will continue to do as we have done in the past-consider questions of that kind on their merits. But in this particular case, I endorse the concerns raised by the honourable member and those of his colleagues who represent those areas west of Parramatta and who are looking after the interests of their constituents. As far as I am concerned, that road will not have a toll on it. We will not charge people again for a road for which they have already paid.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 April the Brisbane Sun, the Sydney Telegraph Mirror and Haydn Sargent on Radio 4BC in Brisbane reported that I favoured paying drug addicts extra money for just turning up for work. The Brisbane Sun published an article by Paul Reynolds with reaction to the proposal by the Queensland Confederation of Industry. The newspaper also printed an editorial roundly slamming my purported comments as a `ludicrous idea'. The Telegraph Mirror attributed to me the statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Drug addicts who try to kick the habit should get paid extra for just turning up to work . . . bonuses for good work attendance are needed as an incentive for employees undergoing drug rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Haydn Sargent said:</PARA>
<PARA>Amongst a lot of good suggestions that Mr Staples made for employers helping in the rehabilitation of addicts-whether they're alcohol or drugs-is the suggestion that they're paid extra money for turning up at work is just plain silly. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Sargent went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>That kind of attitude expressed by Mr Staples gives rise to the constant criticism that governments all too often have become quick to resort to unreasonable welfare mentality rather than trying to find solutions to inspire people to work. </PARA>
<PARA>In fairness to the Brisbane Sun, it at least ran a small correction on 22 April. But to my knowledge the Telegraph Mirror and Mr Sargent have not admitted their mistake. Needless to say, the suggestion in the reports that I advocate paying drug addicts for turning up to work is simply rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA> At a Drugs in the Workplace conference in Melbourne on 18 April I said that sick leave was legitimate for people undergoing drug and alcohol rehabilitation, a common practice in many developed countries. Moreover, I said that incentives for workers respecting good health practices, such as bonuses for high productivity and good attendance records negotiated between employers and employees, could be considered in a package approach. This is very different from what was reported in those papers. Sensationalist reporting, based on misinformation, causes unnecessary confrontation and is not conducive to developing national approaches to combat drug abuse in the workplace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fairly commonplace event these days for those who live in the Australian community to witness the breaking of promises by this Labor Government here in Canberra. But yesterday we saw a breathtaking new high in the Government's approach to its credibility-in specific terms, the preparedness of one of the Ministers of the Government to make clear, definite and concise promises which he has, as of yesterday, clearly broken, with no remorse, no sense of guilt and no apology thrown in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I speak in specific terms of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), who just on 12 months ago, on 6 May last year, made a clear promise to resign if he was not able to achieve significant reform on the Australian waterfront. I want to quote from the comments of Senator Collins, to put in context the promise that he made just on 12 months ago yesterday. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>If there hasn't been the completion of the award restructuring process and if there hasn't been a number of these enterprise agreements put into place, after I've been in this job 12 months, I quit. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I won't need anyone to sack me, I will do it myself. </PARA>
<PARA>We cannot get any more definite commitment than the one we have just heard, which was made by the Minister for Shipping, Senator Collins, 12 months ago. If this were a man of honour, a man of decency and credibility, one would consider that, as of yesterday, the anniversary of the making of that promise, Senator Collins's resignation would have been offered to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). One would have considered, too, that the Prime Minister would have accepted it. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the last 12 months, we realise that there is strong justification for the Prime Minister to accept the resignation offer of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support. Two specific promises were made by the Minister in that statement of 12 months ago. The first was the promise in relation to the completion of the award restructuring process. Twelve months later, has the award restructuring process been completed? The answer is no, it has not been completed. We are a long way from actually seeing anything happen as far as award restructuring is concerned. The second promise was that a number of enterprise agreements would be put into place. Have a number of these enterprise agreements been put into place on the waterfront? No, there has been only one-and one, incidentally, which comes from the Government's own stevedoring company, National Terminals (Australia) Ltd, and which in the last few days has been drawn into doubt because it appears that it will be renegotiated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister promised that there would be several enterprise agreements in place within 12 months. The fact is that there is only one. On both counts, the Minister, Senator Collins, has broken the promise, so one would think a resignation would have been in the offing as of yesterday. But, of course, there was not a resignation. A couple of weeks ago, in an interview on the Sunday program with Laurie Oakes, Senator Collins told us that he was not going to offer his resignation because, even though he said those things, he did not really mean to say them; what he really meant to say, he did not say; and, if he had said what he meant to say, it would have been different from what he had said. That all sounds kind of confusing. It is confusing, because the Minister is confusing. He is confusing the truth and he is confusing his credibility. </PARA>
<PARA> What would the objective judge say about the Minister, Senator Collins? He or she would have to say that, as a result of the Minister's promise made 12 months ago and his subsequent refusal to resign in keeping with that promise, Senator Collins has no credibility. Some would say that Senator Collins looks a bit of a fool. Some would say that Senator Collins is a buffoon. I think they are fair and sound comments to make about Senator Collins, because he did make that commitment, a commitment which he has not been prepared to live up to. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, if he were a man of fairness and a man of honour, would have demanded that Senator Collins fulfil the commitment he made 12 months ago. But, of course, the Prime Minister did not demand that Senator Collins resign yesterday. Why? Because the poor old Prime Minister needs Senator Collins's support. Why? Because there is a leadership challenge on within the Australian Labor Party. He cannot afford to put offside his own mates within the Australian Labor Party, because he cannot afford to offend anybody at present. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, the Prime Minister did not demand the apology and indeed the resignation that should have come from Senator Collins. Of course, because of the Prime Minister's weak position within his own Party, he decided to try to boost his standing within the community and the Party over the past fortnight or so since the House last sat. What has he been doing? He has been up to his ears trying to do a good deal for the wharfies, to get the union movement back on side with him. As a result, the Prime Minister has entered into negotiations on behalf of the unions with the employers to deliver a wage increase way in excess of community expectations at this time, in order to give our wharfies a better deal than they already have. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has been busy; he had a 19-hour marathon session with employers of waterfront labour and with the unions on Wednesday last week. That was an extraordinary thing for the Prime Minister to do; one does not often see that happening with a Prime Minister. Perhaps our Prime Minister has slipped back into the days when he was the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions; indeed, perhaps he is trying to do some favour for his old mates. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the case, the Prime Minister tried to describe what he did last week as enterprise bargaining. On no objective judgment could anybody claim that last week's effort by the Prime Minister, the unions and the employers of waterfront labour could be termed as enterprise bargaining; a better description would be enterprise bullying. What possible enterprise bargaining could be considered to be fair and normal when the Prime Minister and the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support were engaged in it up to their ears? It certainly was not that. </PARA>
<PARA> One has to say that the Prime Minister was involved only because of his close and long association with his trade union mates. One has to realise that the waterfront is a sacred site to the labour movement of Australia. People within the Labor movement of Australia will go out of their way to do good things for their wharfie mates. Why on earth would they, the average Australian would ask, when these people are so well off in relation to the rest of the community? For example, would the Prime Minister have exerted the same sort of effort for our farmers? When the live sheep export industry was going down the plughole, did the Prime Minister try to do anything to fix that up? No, he did not. Did he try to do the same thing for our wheat industry when it was facing heavy subsidies from the United States Government? Did he go across to the United States leading a delegation with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson)? No, he did not do that. He would not go out of his way for the wheatgrowers or the live sheep export industry because they are not Labor mates. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past fortnight we have seen the true colour of this Labor Government coming forward. It is the true colour which will ensure that the wharfies will receive a total of 8.6 per cent wage increase over the next 15 months. In addition to that 8.6 per cent increase, it must be realised that the national wage increases between now and 15 months time will also be included. It is fair to say that this will probably bring the wage rise to 14 per cent or 14.5 per cent over the next few months. Where on earth will the 14 per cent or 14.5 per cent come from? It will not come from the pockets of the stevedores; they will only pass on that cost to the users of the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> At Question Time today we heard the Prime Minister say that he had involved everybody on the waterfront in the negotiations over the past fortnight, and how happy and delighted they were with the deal. However, the Prime Minister forgot to mention the one group that actually pays for it all-the users: the farmers, manufacturers, retailers and consumers who will pay for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, they are not important. For goodness sake, they are not the Government's mates. Its mates are the wharfies so it will do a good deal for them. Honourable members can see a wage rise coming forward for the wharfies, which will be around $100 a week when it is finally completed; $100 a week is not bad. This wage rise comes in the midst of the worst recession we have had since the Second World War. One might say, `Thank goodness we have a recession'; had there not been a recession, what sort of a wage rise would these people have got from the Prime Minister? I suggest it would have been in the order of 30 per cent to 40 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Who pays? The farmers pay 20 per cent of the cost of everything that goes on in the Australian waterfront. What is the average family farm worker earning in the current financial year? The answer is $100 a week. That is an interesting figure, because it precisely matches the size of the wage increase that the wharfies will get. </PARA>
<PARA> The wages that wharfies get are, of course, only a part of the package. Their package includes many allowances. The Prime Minister, having spent a fortnight negotiating the position for the wharfies, got a good deal for his mates. He did so at the expense of farmers, manufacturers, retailers and so forth. What is he doing? He is promoting their upper middle class lifestyle. That is all he is doing. Do honourable members know how much wharfies earn? Last year on average wharfies earned $824 a week for a 27-hour week. Last year the average wage earner earned $485 per week. Wharfies earned $339 a week more than the average wage earner-some 70 per cent more. So it is an upper middle class group that the Government has been supporting so strongly over the last fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA> These people are doing well at everybody else's expense. They have a job which one might say is very well paid. It is a job which one might say is not highly skilled. Even people on the other side of the House could perform the tasks of a waterside worker. Even the wages earned by people on the other side of the House could pale into insignificance when compared with the wages earned by people on the waterfront. When we talk about a wage of $825 a week we also have to remember that waterside workers who become foremen and supervisors can earn up to $100,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this was designed to get waterfront reform back on the rails. What will be the position when the waterfront is back on the rails? Two months ago in this House we had a debate on this same subject. At the time, the Government had, of course, admitted that waterfront reform had fallen behind pace-that it was not proceeding with the speed that had been hoped for. The Government said that there were to be 500 redundancies last September. The result was zero redundancies. By March of this year there should have been 1,000 redundancies. We had all been told to expect 451 redundancies by the end of March, although the original expectation was 1,000. I am sorry to say that we have some bad news. The expected 451 redundancies did not actually happen. Instead of that, we ended up with redundancies of only 361. There has been a little bit of a shortfall. </PARA>
<PARA> If we balance that with the fact that the Government has enabled the waterfront to employ an extra 213 people, we suddenly realises that the net reduction in waterfront workers over the last year and a half of so-called Government reform amounts to 148 wharfies. That is all we have got out of all of the rhetoric and hoo-ha from that side of the House. This is hardly what we would call keeping waterfront reform on track. Yet, that is exactly what the Prime Minister told us he was doing. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, a genuine government that is involved in genuine reform has been able to achieve significant things. The New South Wales Government has been reforming its Maritime Services Board-its port authority. Over the last 18 months, out of an initial work force of 2,920 people 1,322 have gone. Nearly half of the Maritime Services Board's work force has actually left over the last 18 months. That is what we call genuine reform-not the 148 out of a total of some 6,000 on the Australian waterfront that this Government has been able to achieve over the last 18 months. It simply does not stand up to the test. </PARA>
<PARA> If we test what this Government hopes to achieve over the few months that remain of the waterfront reform program, we will see that our reform programs under this Government pale into insignificance when compared with other programs around the world. We stand to achieve efficiency levels in Australia of only about half that of our trading competitors. The port of New Orleans in the United States of America can handle 37 containers per hour. The goal that Senator Collins has set for himself in Australia is 20 to 25 containers per hour. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that the goals that this Government has set for itself under its waterfront reform program are inadequate. The promises made by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support have been proven to be unfulfilled and have been broken. As a result of that, there is a need for this Government not only to live up to the claims that it makes but also to undertake genuine reform for the benefit of Australia. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw `genuinely nice man', which is what the honourable member asked for. The Opposition has put a position on waterfront reform and I take it that this is what we are now to understand the Opposition to mean when it talks about enterprise bargaining. The position is this: if workers agree to substantial changes in work practices and productivity is substantially increased, not just on the waterfront but in any business, they will not be permitted to receive a wage rise. This is apparently the position now being put forward by the Opposition. We can interpret it in no other way. The extra six and a bit per cent relating to each of the tranches can only be achieved after there is delivery of changes in those areas. They are the only terms under which that can be achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under our formula for enterprise bargaining, no wage rises can take place unless they are preceded by genuine changes in work practices and staffing levels which improve the productivity of an organisation. That is the basis on which we operate. It does not matter how much one is paid. The simple fact of the matter is that a very substantial proportion of the work force on which there needs to be a concentration in the productivity area via the enterprise bargaining process happens to be among the most highly paid in our community. There is no question about that. Sometimes this is because the people involved are in a semi-monopoly situation in terms of the companies or authorities that employ them; sometimes it is because they have substantial skills which they have for sale. So if the position is put to them and the public generally that under enterprise bargaining we expect productivity changes for no achievement as far as they are concerned in respect of wages, there will be no achievement of enterprise agreements. That is all there is to it. </PARA>
<PARA> To this point the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has paraded around this country saying that what he stands for is beneficial to the country, beneficial to management, owners and shareholders and beneficial to the work force. To this point, that is what he has said is the intention of Liberal Party policy on enterprise bargaining. But we now have the Opposition spokesman on shipping and waterfront matters saying effectively, in a question he asked the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and during debate here, that that is irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the Opposition is concerned, we will get enterprise agreements that improve productivity but absolutely none of the gains will be returned to the work force. That is just simply one of the many areas in which Opposition industrial policy is away with the fairies. It is away with the fairies in terms of commonsense as to how one approaches one's fellow Australian citizens; it is away with the fairies in terms of ever being able to achieve an outcome as far as productivity in this nation is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The objections that have been raised here about the waterfront reform process are as about as silly as we have heard from the Opposition on any matter that it has brought before this House. The first six or seven minutes of the speech of the honourable member of Gilmore (Mr Sharp) were devoted to a silly call for the resignation of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins). Anybody who has had anything to do with the employers, the shippers and the unions has nothing but praise for the way in which Bob Collins has handled that specific portfolio task. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Sharp" NAMEID="AJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr Sharp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about his promise?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to get on to that. We have been told that he should keep a promise. I will tell the House what his promise was. He said at the time that he would resign if there was not one agreement in place. He did not say that he was going to resign unless there had been the achievement of a total Government package. Of course, since he has been the Minister he has achieved those positions and there are some agreements already in place. Not all are going to be achieved, but some are already in place. I go to one of them-the one with National Terminals (Australia) Ltd (NTAL).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again we get no analysis from the Opposition of what that agreement with NTAL involves. That agreement involves a 34 per cent reduction in the work force associated with the company-a 34 per cent reduction-in return for a 60 per cent improvement in productivity. So we have fewer people operating on the waterfront, a massive change in work practices associated with it and a 60 per cent improvement in productivity. That is an agreement gained in part through the activities of Senator Bob Collins as the relevant Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gilmore did nothing more than carp for seven minutes of his speech to make one passing political point about the matter and hope that nobody actually analyses what Senator Collins had to say. In the parliamentary process honourable members opposite, as an Opposition, oppose us in government, and we explain ourselves and oppose them. That is fair enough, and in that debating process there is the odd comment such as, `Ha, ha, ha'. But the fact of the matter is that the honourable member for Gilmore devoted almost half his speech to a trivial point-and, as it happens, erroneously as far as Senator Collins is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> What else have we had from the Opposition on these waterfront reform proposals negotiated by the Prime Minister, among others, last week? We had from the honourable member for Bennelong-and God knows where we are going to get enterprise agreements or anything else out of the Liberal Party if it ever gets into office-this statement: `The process shouldn't have been taking place at all. It should have been purely a matter for the employers and employees'-not, I might say, the shippers. He did not have anything to say about the shippers. He said, `purely a matter for the employers and the employees'. The shippers have been added as an afterthought by the Opposition spokesman who has participated in the debate here today. </PARA>
<PARA> So the position of the honourable member for Bennelong is, `We will achieve enormous changes in industrial relations by doing nothing'. This is very convenient. That was the Liberal Party position when it was in office. It had attitudes; it was a Government with attitudes. Invariably on a wage case issue before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission when a general proposition was put forward on wages, the response that came forward from the then Liberal Government was, `It ought not happen. There ought to be no wage rises; there shouldn't be any increases. The work force ought to be de-unionised; they all ought to be sacked'. Of course, nothing occurred. It was just attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> What did occur were 18 per cent wage rises with no productivity gains, on the basis of mindless speeches about the resources boom being upon us. That is what happened. Mixed signals were being sent all the time and there was absolutely no government involvement. That is convenient; it means that attitudinally those in government can always be right even if governmentally they are always wrong. But at least honourable members opposite will be able to point back to their marvellous speeches during the period when they were in government about what they were attempting to achieve and say that somehow the situation created itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we all know that situations do create themselves. In recessions wages go down if left to themselves. In booms wages go through the roof and of themselves produce other recessions in pretty short order without any other factors impacting on the economy. That is basically where the Opposition leaves itself. In its industrial policies it would chalk up some runs on the board, provided the country was in recession or permanent recession. If it entered into a boom period without government jaw-boning through a process like the accord, the system would have the guts ripped out of it and there would be no real benefits in terms of the achievement of an improved industrial infrastructure in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the position of the Opposition. It does not quite have a total hands-off position, because it recognises that simply declaring the waterside workers union no longer compulsory, that one is not obliged to be a member, or simply removing over 12 months the guarantees of employment or something like that are in themselves meaningless acts, unless they happen to be enforced on the waterfront, and that it would have to do something else. In the Opposition's heart of hearts, it knows that. It might work in some industries. If it goes down to a poor old bunch of shop assistants or if it goes out into the bush and tells workers that they cannot join the Australian Workers Union-I have worked on a couple of the farms that the honourable gentleman talked about-yes, it would work. Those workers will not join the unions. However, the workers on the waterfront will just have a huge laugh at the Opposition, and the waterfront is obviously much more critical to the future productivity of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Opposition has a solution. It knows in its heart of hearts that its waterfront policy is unworkable. And its solution is to bring in the troops. Again this is just off the top of the Opposition's head. I wish that we on this side of the House could say that this was just a piece of alarmist baloney. I wish we could say that in this place. Unfortunately we cannot, because several Opposition spokesmen have said that as a fall-back the Opposition would have that in mind. The trouble is that the fall-back would be the policy and the only policy it could pursue. So rather than have the Prime Minister engaged in a genuine effort to get the employers together and to get some productivity in the place, the Opposition would discover that it had not achieved productivity and would put in the soldiers. Let me tell honourable members opposite: one has to be very careful when one puts in soldiers. Firstly, they do not like it. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Broadbent interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and I am going to tell the honourable member opposite about it. I have had personal experience in connection with it, so the honourable member opposite can learn from my experience. I will go into it for him. One has to be very careful because, in the first instance, the soldiers do not like it. Their view-the soldiers, sailors and airmen-is that their duty is to defend the people of this country. Unlike the Opposition, they do not find it in their hearts to regard the workers-who are their fathers, their cousins, their uncles, their mothers, their daughters and their sisters-as enemies. It is very, very difficult. They have an entitlement, even though they are under discipline, to be as assured as anyone else that what they are doing is well supported in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we put in the airmen, we did not train up airmen to fly Boeing 737s or Boeing 727s. We did not do that, even though we knew we confronted a long strike. In that confrontation we used the airmen to man their own equipment. Let me tell honourable members that one has to think these things through. In addition to that, we had the solid support of the trade union movement, so that aircraft were refuelled, the baggage was handled, the goods or whatever that were transported on the aircraft would be picked up and taken away from the airport to elsewhere. We did it on the basis of that support from the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition should try it on the waterfront and see what happens. Is it going to have the troops to bring the trains down to the waterfront? Is it going to have the troops to do the warehousing? Is it going to have the troops to make sure that the goods taken off the waterfront are not black-listed? Is it going to have the troops to bring the trucks into the waterfront and take them out? The Opposition does not have a defence policy which anticipates a defence force component of 500,000 men. It does not have the troops, therefore, to perform these tasks. It may have the troops to perform the tasks on the waterfront itself, to cross those picket lines, to enter into that period of great bitterness. It may have them. But they will be hating the Opposition every minute as they do that, and their discipline effectively will be subverted as they do it by the feelings that they have towards the Opposition, because the ordinary soldiers will be the ones unloading and the ordinary soldiers drift out of the Army into precisely these sorts of jobs in the transport industry. They do not go into the waterfront industry; but that may well happen under our reforms. They will have that opportunity open to them. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition thinks that they will persist in its policies in that regard, it has another think coming. But that in the end is the Opposition's only policy on the waterfront. It abused the Prime Minister for genuine achievement in this area, and it has no policies itself on the waterfront. It had better think that through, because it is going to have to argue it. Simply putting in the troops is not of itself an answer. It can solve some problems, but it is not anything other than a double-edged sword and it is not necessarily the easiest thing to do. But that is the only policy that the Opposition has as far as waterfront reform is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the coalminers-and I will just conclude very briefly on that-again the rest of the union movement was supporting what was done by the Government at that time. But the troops did not like it, and all the things that I say apply to this situation applied to that situation as well. The fact is, we are getting waterfront reform. We will get European best practice through this process. We will get those productivity gains-we already have them-in the bag as far as a whole series of these agreements are concerned. They will be of enormous benefit to this country and we have got them the hard way and the only way. The only way these gains are going to be brought about is by solid hard work by governments, not by government with attitude and government with attitude based on the terrible inexperience in industrial matters which the Opposition shows in the sort of high school standard questioning that it delivers against the Prime Minister and other people in this place, somehow thinking that it is making points. It is not, and this is a ridiculous matter of public importance. </PARA>

<PARA> It should be obvious to the Government that Australia is a trading nation. It lies in the Southern Hemisphere, distant from most of its trading partners.

He recognised it from day one when he got in, as we just heard from the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp). Let me refresh the memories of Government members-I think there are three in the chamber now. The headline in the Sunday Territorian of 6 May stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Collins threatens to quit. </PARA>
<PARA>And the article following says:</PARA>
<PARA>Territory Senator Bob Collins says he will resign as Shipping Minister within 12 months if he cannot achieve significant reform on Australia's troubled waterfront. `If there has not been a significant amount of improvement in the reform process I'll resign after one year in the job,' he said. `I'll quit-promise.'</PARA>
<PARA>Asked what he meant by `a significant amount of improvement', he said:</PARA>
<PARA>`If after 12 months the award restructuring process is not complete . . .</PARA>
<PARA>and these are his words:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . and we haven't wrapped up at least one major enterprise agreement, then I'll quit. I'm dead serious.'</PARA>
<PARA>He may be dead, but he certainly was not serious. In the Sun-Herald he says:</PARA>
<PARA>`If the award restructuring is not finished and at least one significant enterprise agreement negotiated within 12 months, then the Government's three-year productivity targets aren't going to be met'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Centralian Advocate of July last states:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins had no hesitation saying that unless he can bring about substantial reform in the areas under his direct responsibility in 12 months he will quit. </PARA>
<PARA>`I won't need anyone to sack me. I will do it myself'. </PARA>
<PARA>The reporter said he so told them in his usual forthright way. I turn to the Age of May last year:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins conceded that the reform process was going too slowly at present. </PARA>
<PARA>`If there hasn't been the completion of the award restructuring process and if there hasn't been a number of these enterprise agreements put in place, after I've been in this job 12 months, I quit,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>He is still there, of course. I suppose the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) set an example for breaking promises. We have all heard: no child will live in poverty by 1990; there will be no capital gains tax; and all this sort of nonsense. So we perhaps cannot blame the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some examples of what is going on on the waterfront. If one wants to ship cars from Melbourne to New Zealand, it is cheaper to ship them via Hong Kong or fly them from Melbourne to New Zealand than to send them on the trans-Tasman route. Even if one sends them that way, chances are they will have dents in the roofs from waterside workers walking around on top of them. It is absolutely outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gilmore highlighted 27 hours work for $40,000 to $45,000 a year. But the Inter-State Commission found that many waterside workers are working only 20 hours a week. There are cases where there are two drivers employed to operate cranes that are designed for one operator only. There are things like nick-off days where they draw straws for having a day off on full pay and so on. These are absolutely outrageous practices that the Government knows full well about, that it has promised to resign on, but it is doing nothing about them. It ought to crawl away in shame at its performance in this area. This Government is unlikely to do anything about it because it cannot understand certain things about the waterfront, or it misrepresents certain things about what is happening there to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> We had an outrageous answer by the Prime Minister to a question in Question Time today when he said that things have improved on the waterfront. He is comparing the outrageous practices on the waterfront today with the super-outrageous practices which existed on the waterfront before. Australia is a trading nation. We have to compare ourselves with the rest of the world-not by Labor Party standards. </PARA>

But what did the deal involve? More pay rises. </PARA>
<PARA> We have just heard from the honourable member for Gilmore that there is another $100 a week, which means the waterfront has the most highly paid group of blue collar workers in Australia. It is money guaranteed up front, yet we still have not seen the colour of any productivity improvements at all. As the honourable member for Gilmore said, this is not enterprise bargaining; this is enterprise bullying. </PARA>

At least we would have had a much more discerning, sensible and relevant contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The waterfront arrangements that we have heard about from the last three speakers were created by National Party Ministers. It is rather significant that this afternoon we have had two contributors from the National Party-the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) and the honourable member for Parkes-pursuing virtually vintage Peter Nixon, the former National Party Minister for Transport and former member for Gippsland. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of the existing arrangements shows that they were all brought into being under National Party Ministers-the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the former member for Gippsland, and the former member for Gwydir. The former member for Gwydir was probably a more constructive Minister in his way than the present member for Gwydir is as a member. But it is interesting that this afternoon the two previous speakers from the National Party have yet again, after all these years, done their constituencies a great disservice. They have yet to understand what the waterfront is about; they have yet to understand the background to the practices and the operations that occur there; they have yet to develop sensible solutions; and they have yet to come forward with a program for the implementation of those solutions. Rather, they choose to blackguard people working on the waterfront, be they tallyclerks, wharf labourers or crane drivers-whatever role they are performing-for working in a system that former National Party Ministers created. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard reference to idle time-27 hours a week, 20 hours a week. If honourable members opposite hunt around Australian ports they will find that, as a result of their legislation and arrangements, there are even less actual working times. They designed the system called idle time in which people were paid for being available for work. Whether or not work was done depended on what happened at the port and whether there were ships to be worked. That is their system and arrangements. They and their industry and terminal operators saw those operations and arrangements as appropriate to the circumstances at the time. It took this Government to recognise that those arrangements were not appropriate to today's circumstances and that they had to be changed. The National Party has been concealing its responsibility for the inefficiencies of the waterfront and trying to divert attention to other people and to this Government by a personal attack on good Australians carrying out the job under arrangements set for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition refers to Thatcher changes in the United Kingdom. Let us look at them. It is a nice throwaway line. The port that is generally referred to by the Opposition is Felixstowe. That port was never in the national dockside labour scheme. It developed as a privately owned container port, designated as the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Co. and owned by the P &amp;O group since 1987. That port alone handled 1,278,000 twenty equivalent units (TEUs) in 1988. It is the sixteenth largest container port in the world. That terminal alone handles almost as many as all of the terminals within Australia. The Opposition compares that port with Australia where we have been trying to get like performances in productivity. This is the idiocy, the nonsense and the dishonesty of the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the size of Australian ports and how many containers are handled by them. Felixstowe pays a bonus wage to its employees. It has always paid a higher wage than the national dockside labour scheme, so it has been outside comparison with the Australian scheme. It handled 1.3 million TEUs in 1988. In Australia in 1988-89, Melbourne handled 710,000 TEUs; Sydney, 631,000; Burnie, 85,000; Brisbane, 172,000; Fremantle, 132,000; and-a great performer!-Adelaide, 34,450. Does the Opposition seriously suggest that, with the spread of capital equipment across all of those ports and such small numbers being handled, we are going to get the same productivity and economies of scale and utilisation of equipment that are found in Felixstowe?</PARA>
<PARA> If we want to look somewhere else, let us look at Los Angeles. That port alone handled 1.7 million TEUs in one year. Singapore handled 3.5 million; Hong Kong, 2.3 million back in 1985; Yokohama, 1.3 million in 1985. Does the Opposition seriously suggest that we are going to achieve the same economies of scale and utilisation rates here in this spread of little ports as is being achieved in those very large single ports around the world? The Opposition knows it cannot. It is a totally dishonest argument and a grave disservice to the people it represents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am recognising the realities and the need for improvement. We are undertaking that improvement. We are not presenting a dishonest case to the people we represent, as those opposite have been doing. They have been concealing the facts that the waterfront industry situation is theirs. They deregulated the waterfront in 1977 to create greater competition and efficiency. They lied to the people and failed the people. They failed their own export industry and importers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us turn to what the waterfront is about. It is a reactor. It does not make anything. It does not build anything. It does not manufacture anything. It provides a service. People bring things to the waterfront by sea and take them away on land, and vice versa. The timetables are very much determined by those who use the waterfront, whether by sea or by land. It is not done by the waterfront; it reacts. What do we find? We have exporters turning up at the waterfront after the deadline for the ship has closed, wanting to get boxes or bags on the vessel. Why were they not there on time? Usually they have a minimum seven days notice, and often 10 days. Why did the cargoes not come in at an even pace over those seven or 10 days? Explain that to the exporters. Explain to them why 90 per cent of the trucks that go onto the waterfront are empty and come out full or go in full and come out empty. Why are exporters not getting a decent deal on transport service rates to and from the waterfront?</PARA>
<PARA> Why is it that when goods come onto the waterfront they sit there waiting to be taken away? The first three days on the waterfront is free when goods come off the ship. Fifteen per cent go out on the first day, 20 per cent the second day, and there is a hell of a rush on the third day. Why? When that rush comes it generates a peak. It generates congestion. Who gets the blame? The wharfie. The exporters say, `Everybody is tucked in behind the big shed-blame them. We did not get our goods to the wharf on time. We did not check with our agents to see whether we could get a better rate by having the goods there a few days earlier. As importers we did not check whether we could get a dedicated time for our ship's arrival so that we could get an even spread of ships arriving at the terminal, thus reducing the peaks and the congestion. None of those things have been done'. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite are just so dishonest. I say to the honourable member for Gilmore: `You are an intelligent man; you have ability. For God's sake, if you want to make a contribution to improving transport efficiency in this country, forget the personal trivia you went on with before, forget the misrepresentation, and concentrate on the real issues of educating exporters and importers'. Those opposite are living in Rip Van Winkle land. They have some childlike and ignorant belief that, once a box arrives on the wharf, somehow-miraculously-it will get to them. Somebody will care for it-maybe God, maybe heaven, who knows? Once their box is picked from the factory, miraculously it will get to its destination. They do not check the best rate. </PARA>
<PARA> So much needs to be done by exporters and waterfront users themselves. The waterfront has problems. Those problems are being addressed expeditiously by this Government. Waterfront users have a greater potential for improvement and efficiency but they are not addressing it. If there is one area alone in which the Opposition, when in government, excelled in port productivity it was the growth of bottom of the harbour tax rorts. That is the only area of port productivity that those opposite did any good in. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Introduction</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Telecommunications Bill 1991 is the first in a package that I am introducing today affecting the telecommunications industry. Before addressing the detail of the legislation it is useful to put these reforms in context. The package gives effect to the reform package which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced to this House on 8 November last year. These telecommunications reforms are a central plank of the Hawke Government's fourth term commitment to micro- economic reform. In introducing network competition into this industry, we will not just be improving the efficiency of a major domestic industry; we will also be aiming to lift dramatically the performance of a key infrastructure industry. </PARA>
<PARA> All three of the current carriers-Telecom Australia, OTC Ltd and Aussat Pty Ltd-have a good technical record but have not been as responsive to customers, as innovative, or as export-oriented as they might have been. The carriers themselves recognise that they can do much better in terms of quality of service, productivity and price of services. </PARA>
<PARA> As long as the present carriers have a monopoly on the public switched trunk network, there is only modest pressure on them to minimise costs and to develop new products and markets. Telecom's and OTC's profitability has been largely based on historical accounting conventions and regulated monopoly pricing. Competition across the network will force the merged entity to become more responsive to customers' needs, to reduce costs and to find better ways of providing existing services. </PARA>
<PARA> These reforms, though, go beyond the scope of structural reform, important though that is. The reason for the Government's focus on this industry is that we realise the critical long term importance for Australia of getting the regulatory framework for this industry right. First, telecommunications now provides a vital part of the infrastructure for all business operations, be they domestic or international. Having access to internationally competitive telecommunications services is therefore essential if our firms are to be able to meet their opposition in the marketplace. Second, with the globalisation of the world economy, and the explosion in information technology, it has become increasingly obvious that telecommunications will be one of the key global industries of the next century in its own right. </PARA>
<PARA> New telecommunications services are revolutionising the way people do business. Mobile communications are growing at a phenomenal rate as are the range of value-added telecommunications services. The introduction of intelligent network services is ushering in a whole new range of sophisticated services for consumers. The future for telecommunications companies lies in integrating information technologies and telecommunications networks to connect people and information around the world. Remaining a simple provider of a telephone network is no longer an option for telecommunications companies that wish to survive, let alone prosper. As a result, governments worldwide are giving reform of the telecommunications sector a high priority. In turn, the deregulation of telecommunications markets in Western countries is advancing the trend towards globalisation of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunities in this industry are enormous. The Asia-Pacific region is now experiencing a staggering increase in demand for telecommunications. Some estimates of this growth range as high as $130 billion in the next five years. Half of the world market in fibre optic cables, worth about $13 billion during the 1990s, will be laid in North and South Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has an excellent opportunity to exploit the anticipated growth in the region. We have the skills to design, plan, source, construct, operate and maintain telephone networks. Both Telecom and OTC have been successful in winning lucrative export contracts. It is important that we now build on this early success. </PARA>
<PARA> The next century's telecommunications will not only be global and dynamic; they will also be very competitive. Many of the world's major economies, including those of Japan and the United States of America, have already broken up their telecommunications monopolies and introduced competition. The Government has carefully observed the experience in those countries and is convinced that its reform package does the job better. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government's strategy for the industry, then, aims at producing important efficiency gains for Australia in the short term, the `main game' is positioning Australia's telecommunications industry to be globally competitive in the next century. Certainly, there will be immediate short term benefits for the economy as a whole and for consumers from these reforms. However their real impact will be felt in a decade or so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's strategy for achieving this has two basic, closely related features-</PARA>
<PARA> * to introduce genuine and sustainable network competition for the benefit of the wider Australian economy; and. </PARA>
<PARA> * to create a world class telecommunications company that has the ability and ethos to compete vigorously in what will be a key industry in a very competitive global environment. </PARA>
<PARA> A third important element of the Government's strategy that has yet to be finalised is the industry development arrangements that are to apply to the carriers. I am not in a position to give the precise details of these arrangements yet, as their final resolution is linked to the sale of Aussat. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the key selection criteria for the Aussat sale is that the bidders submit network development proposals that demonstrate how they propose to assist the development of Australian industry. There are two reasons for the importance which the Government places on these industry development proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> First, one of the main reasons for fundamentally restructuring the industry now is that we intend Australia to become a significant international telecommunications centre. To exploit fully the potential embodied in the other elements of the Government's reforms, it is essential that the carriers be able to turn to a dynamic local industry, with a research and development ethos that looks beyond Australia's boundaries, for necessary support. A local industry that is innovative, forward-looking and has a commitment to excellence will also be necessary if we are to take full advantage of the opportunities that telecommunications will present in the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we recognise that Telecom's policies to date have contributed in no small measure to the development of a significant electronics industry in Australia and a research and development base. It is important that we build on this. For these reasons, the Government will be examining the bidders' industry plans on this matter closely, with a view to formulating an appropriate industry development plan for inclusion in carriers' licence conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> In developing its framework for reform, the Government has remained mindful of the social importance of telecommunications to Australian society. The Prime Minister has already guaranteed that no ordinary consumer of the telephone system will be disadvantaged as a result of the introduction of competition. This assurance can be given for two main reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the Government will preserve the merged Telecom-OTC in full public ownership. This enables the Government, in its capacity as shareholder as well as regulator, to ensure that the dominant network provider will continue to meet the Government's social objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, the price cap arrangements for Telecom-OTC in the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Bill (AOTC Bill) 1991, in combination with the new entity's universal service obligation in the Telecommunications Bill, will ensure that the price benefits from competition will be distributed among consumers in an equitable way. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, as I mentioned earlier, competition is likely to produce significant gains for all consumers. The overwhelming evidence from Western nations that have introduced network competition is that the real price of telecommunications services to business and household consumers has fallen and the quality of service has improved. </PARA>
<PARA> The package of Bills that the Government is introducing today is designed to maximise the benefits for Australia from its telecommunications industry. It will create a robust, globally competitive industry which is capable of seeing Australia into the next century. At the same time it will deliver improved services at lower prices to both the wider economy and ordinary householders. </PARA>
<PARA> The Telecommunications Bill 1991 replaces the Telecommunications Act 1989, which is repealed by the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1991. As such, the new Telecommunications Bill will provide the general regulatory framework for the provision of telecommunications facilities and services in Australia. Certain specific regulatory matters relating to pricing arrangements that will apply only to the merged Telecom-OTC are dealt with under the AOTC Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> During the process of developing the Bill, an extensive process of public consultation has been undertaken. This has involved the circulation of an exposure draft of the legislation for public comment and consultation with key affected community groups. The Bill gives effect to the Government's November 1990 decisions in the context of a process which has taken into account legitimate concerns of the main groups with an interest in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say at this stage that I very much thank the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), who has entered the chamber. The honourable member was chairman of our working group and also chairman of my ministerial advisory committee. I thank the members of that group and the advisory committee, which was very broadly based, for the advice which they have given us on these matters. Of course, the Bill has been available more generally than to just those groups, and a great number of people have had an opportunity to have a chop at it and make suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicated at the time that the Government viewed the exposure drafts without any sort of extremity of personal defensiveness, and we have made substantial adjustments on the basis of what both of those groups and some of the users have referred to, such as the private network operators-like Australian Associated Press-which would be bidders for the second carrier. All sorts of people have had an influence on our processes. Above all, I thank those sections of the Department that have worked on this. They have done an extraordinary job as this is an extraordinarily difficult Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>General Principles</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In policy terms, this Bill essentially does eight things:</PARA>
<PARA>1. it provides a framework for fostering genuine and sustainable network competition;</PARA>
<PARA>2. it provides a framework for fostering competition among all service providers, whether carriers or not, consistent with fostering sustainable network competition;</PARA>
<PARA>3. it ensures that certain specific social objectives in telecommunications-in particular delivery of the universal service obligation and continued access by residential consumers to the option of untimed local calls-will continue to be met, but on a more secure legislative basis, and in a more efficient and transparent manner;</PARA>
<PARA>4. it provides for a licensing scheme for telecommunications carriers;</PARA>
<PARA>5. it allows, with minimum attendant bureaucracy, for greater public input into Austel processes, commensurate with Austel's enhanced regulatory role and powers;</PARA>
<PARA>6. it gives the carriers, on an equal footing, certain exclusive rights and powers. These include rights to install certain types of telecommunications facilities; and certain powers in relation to land and immunity from laws;</PARA>
<PARA>7. it provides an effective and appropriate enforcement regime; and</PARA>
<PARA>8. it re-enacts, with some additions and modifications, parts 5 to 8 of the 1989 Act relating to technical regulation, Austel investigations and Austel's constitution. These provisions have generally worked well. </PARA>
<PARA>My following comments address the key features of the Bill against this framework. </PARA>
<PARA>Network Competition</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The central feature of the Bill is the framework it provides for the introduction of genuine and sustainable network competition in the shortest time possible. It does this in three ways:</PARA>
<PARA>(i) Licensing</PARA>
<PARA> In contrast with the 1989 Act, the Bill allows for network competition by giving the Minister the power to license Australian trading corporations as general carriers. A general carrier will have complete freedom to use whatever technology that carrier chooses to deliver the full range of telecommunications services-other than public mobile services, unless it also holds a public mobile licence. The general carriers, which are recognised in the objects of the Bill to be the primary providers of Australia's telecommunications networks and the primary providers of Australia's telecommunications services, will also have certain exclusive rights and powers. I shall discuss these rights and powers later. The Bill provides a similar licensing regime for public mobile carriers with respect to the primary supply of public mobile telecommunications services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives the Minister a wide discretion as to the grant of licences. As announced by the Prime Minister, the Government has taken the view that the goal of genuine and sustainable network competition is best served through licensing a single network competitor to the merged Telecom OTC prior to full competition in 1997. The chief reason for this is that the Government has taken the view that the creation of one strong competitor is the best way of achieving genuine and sustainable network competition quickly in a market the size of Australia's. The aim is to ensure that by 1997 there is a significant, recognised network competitor to Telecom-OTC. Accordingly, on commencement of the Bill, the Government will be licensing only one competitor to Telecom-OTC.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill therefore anticipates, but does not attempt to prescribe, the post-1997 environment. As already announced, this will be the subject of a review by the Government prior to 30 June 1997. In accordance with the recommendations in Austel's report on public mobile telecommunications services, the Government intends to issue only three public mobile carrier licences before 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>(ii) Access and interconnection</PARA>
<PARA> The second main feature of the Bill which is intended to promote network competition is the inter-carrier access arrangements in part 8. Overseas experience, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, has shown that the most important element in introducing genuine and sustainable network competition in the long run where there is an established telecommunications monopoly is to have appropriate interconnection and access arrangements between the carriers. It is widely acknowledged internationally that the arrangements proposed in the Government's decisions of November 1990 will be the most rational, pro-competitive and equitable interconnection arrangements that have been introduced anywhere in the world. The framework provided by part 8 enables those decisions to be implemented while allowing flexibility for dealing with changing market circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The short term aim of the arrangements is to assist the second carrier in overcoming the formidable advantages associated with Telecom-OTC's control over the customer base, infrastructure and access to information so that the second carrier will be able to compete from as level a playing field as possible. The longer term aim is to create the basis for an open network framework for the provision of telecommunications services. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 8 creates two broad categories of access rights. The first is the basic right of any carrier to interconnect its network to that of any other carrier, and to have that other carrier carry and complete calls on its behalf. This right is fully mutual between the carriers and also applies between the general and public mobile carriers. The second, or supplementary, class of rights covers matters relating to supplementary services affecting a carrier's control over the customer base. This is capable of being made carrier specific and in practice will apply only to the provision of supplementary services by Telecom-OTC while it remains the dominant carrier. </PARA>
<PARA> The part also allows for disallowable ministerial determinations on special pricing arrangements that are to apply between the carriers. This power will be used to set out the details that implement the general principle that the second carrier should have access to Telecom-OTC's facilities and supplementary services at directly attributable incremental cost following Austel's report to the Government on this issue in June. </PARA>
<PARA> These rights will be given practical effect by giving a carrier the right to ask Austel to arbitrate on a dispute that it has with another carrier concerning access and interconnection matters. The Bill provides for extensive procedures governing the way in which such arbitrations are to be conducted, although the general principle is that they are to be conducted in a way that is fair, just, informal, economical and quick. An arbitration will generally be conducted in private. However there is provision for Austel to conduct a public inquiry on a particular issue where Austel considers that this will have a significant and direct impact on consumers, and that the inquiry will not significantly delay the arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA> Carriers will, in effect, be required to register all access agreements with Austel. These agreements will be public, to the extent that normal commercial confidentiality principles permit. So as to ensure that all agreements actually promote the long term interests of consumers of telecommunications services, Austel will have the ability to refuse to register an access agreement where in Austel's opinion it does not further the objects of part 8.</PARA>
<PARA>(iii) New Austel functions</PARA>
<PARA>The third way in which network competition will be enhanced is by giving Austel a charter with a number of pro-competitive functions. The most important of these new functions is given in clause 37 which charges Austel with the function of promoting competition within the regulatory framework established by the Act. In relation to network competition, Austel has the role of promoting competition between the carriers; of protecting carriers from the misuse of market power by other carriers; and of arbitrating disputes between the carriers. Austel is, therefore, being given a clear mandate to create the conditions necessary for genuine and sustainable network competition between the carriers and is being authorised to take appropriate action to ensure that this occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> Austel is also being given a number of other new powers and functions which are related to the promotion of competition. The most important of these is Austel's powers in relation to accounting and charging procedures in division 5 of part 5. This requires Austel to draw up a chart of accounts and a cost allocation manual. The primary function of these documents will be to ensure full accounting separation of those areas of a carrier's activities that do not face strong competition. Austel will be able to decide on the extent to which a carrier should be made subject to the accounting separation regime. This is because it is likely that for the first few years of its operations the second network carrier will face strong competition from Telecom-OTC in all of its main business activities. There may, however, be reason to apply a degree of accounting separation to the second carrier when the third mobile operator commences operations in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 39 of the Bill gives Austel the function of managing numbering. Austel will be required to establish a numbering plan for telecommunications services provided across carrier networks, consulting, where appropriate, with the Standards Association of Australia which also has a role in relation to certain services. In establishing the plan, Austel is required to have regard to its other relevant functions which would include promoting competition and protecting consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> A further Austel function given by clauses 40 and 399 will be that of reporting annually to the Minister on the operation of competitive safeguards and carrier performance. As the Minister is required to table the report in Parliament this will ensure that the public is aware of how the competitive safeguards regime is working out in practice. It also ensures that Austel maintains an appropriate level of interest in competition and carrier performance. The fact that this reporting obligation, which also has a consumer protection dimension which I will discuss later, has the status of an Austel function, indicates the importance which is placed on it. </PARA>
<PARA>Service Provider Competition</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>While the main long term goal of the new regulatory framework lies in fostering network competition, the Government has also moved to foster competition from other service providers, in a manner consistent with that primary goal. The chief reasons for this are to encourage innovation and diversity in the provision of telecommunications services and to give the fullest possible degree of flexibility to consumers in the way in which they use telecommunications services derived from carriers. The Bill has a number of features for achieving this end. </PARA>
<PARA>(i) Resale</PARA>
<PARA>One of the key differences between this Bill and the 1989 Act, both in policy and conceptual terms, has flowed from the Government's decision to remove all restrictions on resale of domestic and international telecommunications capacity currently contained in the Telecommunications Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the 1989 Act, only the carriers are permitted to provide so-called reserved services. Even where a person obtains a basic service from a carrier, that person cannot use the basic service to supply another service unless that service can be classified as a value added service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's resale decision was intended to remove that artificial distinction, and allows for much more efficient use of capacity within private networks. This is a very significant liberalisation of existing arrangements and the approach of the Bill to resale is among the most liberal, if not the most liberal, in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to allow resale is given effect by ensuring that the Bill does not apply any restrictions on the supply of services other than those contained in an Austel class licence issued under part 10 of the Bill. These restrictions are primarily intended to deal with:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) technical and operational matters, so as to ensure the technical integrity and efficiency of public telecommunications networks is maintained and relevant international standards are met;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) the provision of international services, to prevent the misuse of market power by foreign carriers through resale; and to ensure that the agreements that carriers enter into with international cabling consortia cannot be used to achieve effective bypass of the carriers; and</PARA>
<PARA>(c) services provided over radiocommunications facilities that are connected to a carrier's network and that have been privately installed. The reason for this restriction is that the Bill, again in contrast to existing arrangements, allows complete freedom for anyone to install radiocommunications facilities and otherwise use radiocommunications services. In the absence of a safety net there is a danger that such facilities might be used to erode significantly the practical value of the carriers' reserved rights. </PARA>
<PARA>(ii) Unbundling of basic carriage services</PARA>
<PARA>The second main feature of the Bill designed to promote competition from service providers is the approach in division 2 of part 9 towards the controlled unbundling of basic carriage services. BCS is one of the central concepts in the Bill, so I will take some time to explain its functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to allow full resale has essentially been implemented by framing the carriers' reservations-apart from public mobile services and satellite services-in facilities terms, and imposing no restrictions on the persons who may provide services over those facilities. This fulfils the twin objectives of giving the carriers' licences practical value, while allowing resale as long as the carriers are allowed genuine control over their facilities and are able to exploit the economies of scale and scope inherent in them, at least to provide basic connectivity and carriage services. Clause 237 underlines the carriers' prerogatives in this regard by giving them the ability to refuse to supply particular BCSs that are not included in the carrier's BCS tariff. </PARA>
<PARA> The BCS concept is essentially a functional description, from the point of view of the service as delivered to the consumer, of basic connectivity and carriage services, on which all commercial telecommunications services are necessarily built. The Bill calls all services that are not BCSs, higher level services (HLS). The conceptual distinction in the Bill, and the basic reasons for it, reflect the thinking proposed by Austel in its report to me on resale of 14 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> This ability of a carrier to refuse to supply BCSs, while necessary to maintain the practical value of the carrier's rights and thereby to promote network competition, nevertheless has the potential to have significant anticompetitive consequences in markets for other telecommunications services. To address this, the Bill has a procedure under which Austel, on its own initiative or on application, can direct a dominant carrier to supply a particular BCS. This unbundling regime has two main purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> First, it will prevent a dominant carrier that is supplying a BCS from precipitately withdrawing that service where this will have significant consequences for existing users of that service. Second, it will allow for a structured process for unbundling of BCSs. Unbundling in this context means requiring a carrier to make available lower level BCSs that are necessary to provide other telecommunications services. This process will promote competition by allowing service providers to use these building blocks to construct other telecommunications services from an equal base. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, however, important that such unbundling of BCSs actually benefits the long term interests of consumers by taking proper account of what is technically practicable, and of the need to promote genuine and sustainable network competition between the carriers by ensuring that their rights have practical value. Once a service has been unbundled in this way, a directed carrier will have to supply that service on reasonable terms, and will be required to supply the service to itself on the same terms as to all other service providers. This requirement applies automatically-but in a more limited way-to any BCSs that a carrier itself is using to supply an HLS. </PARA>
<PARA>(iii) Safeguards for service providers</PARA>
<PARA> The third main way in which the Bill fosters service competition from service providers is by giving them, along with other consumers of telecommunications services, a number of targeted safeguards against particular abuses of market power by carriers. The first safeguard is that a carrier that is in a position to dominate a market for a telecommunications service will not be able to discriminate between customers in that market unless that discrimination can be justified on a cost basis. Furthermore, carriers in general will not be permitted to discriminate against a person for the reason that the person is or wants to be a service provider. </PARA>
<PARA> The second safeguard is that carriers will be required to tariff their BCSs, and will have incentives to tariff their HLSs. (Extension of time granted) This will make it easier for consumers to obtain information about competing carrier services and in combination with the discrimination provisions, will provide incentives for a dominant carrier to keep its charges down. A carrier that is in a position to dominate a market for a BCS will be required to charge strictly in accordance with its tariff. A non-dominant carrier will be able to charge below its tariff but not above it. The existing carriers will have six months in which to tariff all their existing services following commencement of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The third safeguard is that the carriers are under an obligation to connect a service provider unless another carrier is supplying the connection service. </PARA>
<PARA>Social Objectives</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> While the main thrust of the Bill is directed towards introducing a more competitive framework for supplying telecommunications services as the best means of meeting consumers' interests in the long term, the reforms also aim to improve the regulatory arrangements for delivering certain key objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>(i) The Universal Service Obligation</PARA>
<PARA> The most important of these is Telecom's universal service obligation (USO). In my statement of November 1990 I gave the commitment, on behalf of the Government, that:</PARA>
<PARA>* community service obligations (CSOs) would be maintained, in particular to rural and regional areas, to pensioners and to people with disabilities;</PARA>
<PARA>* Telecom-OTC would be required to continue to provide and maintain its basic telephone services to residential and business customers throughout Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA>* the management and funding of community service obligations would be considered by an interdepartmental committee chaired by my Department, and that the IDC, in preparing its report, would have regard to the notation to the Australian Labor Party policy that the cost for the competitor to interconnect into Telecom-OTC's network should underpin Telecom-OTC's community service obligations on a pro rata basis. </PARA>
<PARA>After full consideration of the IDC's report, the Government decided that the most appropriate and least administratively complex way of giving effect to its aims in the continued funding and delivery of universal telephone service would be:</PARA>
<PARA>* to obligate Telecom-OTC to continue to provide a standard telephone service between places in Australia, including pay phones; and</PARA>
<PARA>* to require the second carrier to pay Telecom-OTC a fee which covers an equitable share of Telecom-OTC's costs of fulfilling its universal service obligation with a payment to be in direct proportion to minutes of interconnect time between each carrier's trunk international network and all local access networks. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 13 of the Bill gives effect to these decisions. This empowers the Minister to declare a carrier to be the universal service carrier for Australia. Telecom-OTC will be designated as this carrier. Clause 292 makes it a `prescribed carrier obligation' of the universal service carrier's licence to fulfil the USO. The USO has two strands:</PARA>
<PARA>* the obligation to supply the standard telephone service to people in Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA>* to supply pay phones in a way that ensures that they are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis. This can be backed up by a ministerial determination that pay phones must be installed in specified places. </PARA>
<PARA>This has the effect of placing the USO on a more secure legislative basis than under current arrangements, where their management and delivery are largely at Telecom's discretion. This is because any person may complain to Austel about a possible breach of this licence condition. If Austel finds that the carrier has unreasonably failed to fulfil its USO, Austel must direct the carrier to fulfil it. </PARA>
<PARA> The net costs incurred in fulfilling the universal service obligation are to be calculated by participating carriers using a long term avoidability methodology. These are the costs that will be used by Austel, along with the number of minutes of interconnect time, to determine the pro rata contribution of all participating carriers in the levy. For practical purposes, interconnect time is to be measured as the number of minutes of timed traffic interconnected by a carrier. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government decided in December 1989 that an avoidability methodology should be used in future to determine the costs incurred by Telecom in delivering its universal service obligation. Accordingly, this Bill enshrines in legislation the requirement that a universal service carrier-in this case, Telecom-OTC-calculate its net costs using a long term avoidable cost approach. This will require Telecom-OTC, in calculating its USO costs in a particular area, only to take into account the justifiable net costs it thinks it would not have incurred had the services not been provided to that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements, as proposed, give Austel the responsibility for auditing the net costs and timed traffic figures provided by the carriers. However, with the Government's dual aim in mind of, on the one hand, delivering the universal service obligation to the highest standard and at the least cost possible and, on the other, of making the arrangements as open and transparent as possible, the Bill also requires Austel to make available to the public, and to participating carriers, information about the basis and methods of assessment in as much detail as it thinks appropriate, bearing in mind the need to protect a carrier's commercial or other interests. </PARA>
<PARA>(ii) Untimed local calls</PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 72 and 73 make it a licence condition of all general carriers that they offer residential customers continued access to untimed local calls as a payment option. </PARA>
<PARA>(iii) Quality of Service</PARA>
<PARA> Austel is to be given the new consumer protection function of developing indicative quality of service, or performance standards relating to the standard telephone service; services ancillary to the standard telephone services, such as directory assistance; and any other services Austel considers appropriate. While these standards will not be binding on a carrier-unless they were included in licence conditions-Austel will gather data and will use these standards as a key test of carrier performance for the purposes of its annual report to the Minister and to Parliament on carrier performance. </PARA>
<PARA>Licensing</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> One of the important features of the new Bill is that it establishes a licensing regime for carriers with broad discretions for the Minister to impose and vary licence conditions. However, it is important to note that a number of key licence conditions, in particular those relating to the USO and untimed local calls, have been included in the Bill and therefore will not be capable of change, except by an Act of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Other matters likely to be dealt with in licence conditions are listed in subclause 63(4). They include:</PARA>
<PARA>* the term of a licence;</PARA>
<PARA>* industry development;</PARA>
<PARA>* foreign ownership or control;</PARA>
<PARA>* supplementary access rights-for interconnection purposes;</PARA>
<PARA>* consumer inquiry and complaints procedures-such as a requirement that a carrier develop a code of practice for handling such inquiries and complaints;</PARA>
<PARA>* compliance with technical standards;</PARA>
<PARA>* law enforcement issues; and</PARA>
<PARA>* geographical limitations on a licensee's scope of action. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also intended that there will be licence obligations on Aussat relating to remote commercial television services, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's homestead and community broadcasting satellite service, and defence and aviation requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of issues on this list, which is not exhaustive, are clearly going to require further detailed work. Others will be issues to be negotiated during the sale process for Aussat and will be the subject of a commercial contract. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that there will be many occasions where a public process would be desirable to assist in clarifying the issues involved with important licence conditions. Clause 69 effectively encourages a Minister to request Austel to conduct a public inquiry before the Minister varies an important licence condition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also recognises that carriers have a legitimate interest in regulatory stability in order that they can make sensible investment decisions. To this end, clause 68 requires a Minister to consult with a carrier before varying a licence condition. Clause 70 allows a Minister to enter into an agreement with the carrier about the way in which the Minister will exercise a particular licensing power. At the end of the day, though, it is not appropriate to unduly fetter the Minister's ability to impose or vary licence conditions as there may be important issues of public policy at stake.</PARA>
<PARA>Public Processes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In general the Bill adopts a more open approach to policy formulation than the 1989 Act. The following measures have been adopted, in addition to those in the 1989 Act, to achieve this:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) A new part 14 of the Bill has been added to give Austel a simple and straightforward public inquiry process. This is largely intended to codify Austel's existing practices, although some new features of the Bill-for example, unbundling of BCSs-will depend on a public inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>(b) Austel will be required to keep a simple and publicly accessible register of complaints and investigations under part 15 of the Act. This will also assist Austel in meeting its annual reporting obligations. </PARA>
<PARA>(c) Austel will be required to keep a register of access agreements between the carriers. </PARA>
<PARA>(d) Carriers will be required to keep a publicly available schedule of BCS tariffs and to file these with Austel. They will have substantial incentives to include their standard terms and conditions in these tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA>Carriers' Exclusive Rights, Powers and Immunities</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Under the Bill the carriers' exclusive rights are essentially based on a facilities reservation only, rather than a services and facilities reservation as in the 1989 Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The general carriers will have the exclusive right to install line links between distinct places. A line link essentially is any combination of connected wires or cables that is used or intended for use in carrying electromagnetic energy. A distinct place will be:</PARA>
<PARA>* any freehold or leasehold title; or</PARA>
<PARA>* any combination of adjoining freehold or leasehold titles that are occupied or principally used by the same person; or that are the subject of a ministerial determination, which is subject to certain limitations. </PARA>
<PARA>Division 2 of part 2 makes it clear that the network termination point, or network boundary, for a line link in a distinct place will be the main distribution frame or telephone socket as appropriate. The regulations will allow this to be changed both to take account of changing technology and to give effect to the Government's decision that from 1 July 1993 the network boundary will be the property boundary. </PARA>
<PARA> The general carriers will also have the exclusive right to be the primary suppliers of services that use satellite facilities. I say `primary supplier' because, of course, resale of such services will be permitted. Public mobile carriers will have exclusive rights to supply public mobile telecommunications services. The formulation of the reservations based on these concepts remedies a range of problems under the existing Act and allows for an appropriate level of flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The exceptions to the carriers' reservations remain broadly as they are under the 1989 Act with the following exceptions:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) the defence forces and the Civil Aviation Authority have been given special purpose exceptions to the carriers' reservations;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) a person who has an exception to a carrier's reservation will now be able to supply a service to a carrier or dispose of his or her facilities to a carrier;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) the exception granted to broadcasters has been widened to allow broadcasters to supply programs to each other by means of their own exempted line links and to use those line links in relation to the supply of ancillary communications services;</PARA>
<PARA>(d) the Government's international private satellite earth station policy has been formalised as an exception to the carriers' satellite reservation. Any person will be able to obtain an international satellite service from any satellite operator, whether or not a carrier. For the purposes of resale, these services will be treated in a manner that is directly analogous to other interconnected radcom services-that is, they will be subject to use restrictions under Austel's services class licence;</PARA>
<PARA>(e) Austel will be able to issue authorisations under ministerial direction, which is subject to certain constraints, for persons other than carriers to install exempted classes of line links or use satellite services. </PARA>
<PARA>The existing land access powers of Telecom under part 8 of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Act 1989 will be extended to the general carriers, with compensation agreed or assessed with a right of appeal to a State or Federal court. This is considered essential to carrier activities and to allow the second carrier to roll out its network. Telecom's pre-existing immunity from suit is removed. Any exclusion or limitation of tort liability becomes a matter of normal contractual principles and negotiation. Austel is empowered to determine appropriate ceilings in respect of tort liability. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom's exemption from State and Territory laws has been replaced by a more focused and balanced regime. Essentially, the regulations will be able to specify that certain network related activities are exempt from State and Territory laws, and a carrier will be able to engage in those activities, despite any State or Territory law. This will be balanced by a national code of practice for the carriers, to be discussed with the States and Territories, which will impose parallel obligations on the carriers to the extent that this is warranted. However, a carrier will not be subject to any State or Territory laws that discriminate against the carriers. </PARA>
<PARA>Enforcement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains new enforcement mechanisms that reflect the changed nature of the regulatory environment. Essentially, the chief sanction against a carrier is based on Austel's ability to direct a carrier. The sanction for a carrier failing to comply with an Austel direction is enforced by Austel having the ability to take the carrier to court for a civil pecuniary penalty of up to $5m, an injunction or a declaration. </PARA>
<PARA> Austel enforces licence conditions in a similar way-first, by investigating to satisfy itself that a breach has occurred, then issuing a direction to the carrier to rectify the breach. It is only if the carrier does not rectify the breach that Austel can go to court. The Minister also has the power to enforce licence conditions by taking a carrier directly to court-the same penalties apply-without the need for an investigation. However, this is intended to be a reserve power, and it is not envisaged that the Minister would normally enforce licence conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Austel has also been given certain powers of entry and seizure in relation to its technical regulation functions. The reason for this is that Austel's practical ability to enforce its technical regulation powers are, under the 1989 Act, very limited. These powers are necessary to give meaning to Austel's function in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>Re-enactment of Existing Parts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, parts 5 to 8 of the 1989 Act relating to technical regulation, Austel investigations, Austel's constitution, and miscellaneous matters have been re-enacted. The following changes are worth noting, however. </PARA>
<PARA> With technical regulation, Austel has been given the power, at ministerial direction, to formulate network standards. It is a condition of a carrier's licence that the carrier comply with any such standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Austel has also been given the power, at its own initiative, on application or on ministerial direction, to exempt certain types of equipment and customer cabling from the scope of technical regulation requirements where such equipment does not have the ability to affect the integrity or efficiency of a carrier's network. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Bill comes into force I intend to issue a direction to Austel under relevant provisions to exempt computing equipment and equipment in broadcasters' studios that are beyond an appropriate line isolating device. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to Austel's constitution, there are some minor changes relating to Austel membership and Austel finances. In relation to membership, the changes are intended to clarify the status of associate members. The new provisions relating to Austel finances are standard provisions relating to the financial arrangements for statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Issues</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> There are two other features of the Bill that deserve comment.The first relates to the Minister's general powers of direction to Austel under clauses 49 and 50 of the Bill. These powers of direction re-enact sections 28 and 29 of the 1989 Act essentially without change. These powers of direction were somewhat controversial at the time of passage of the 1989 Act, however their use has attracted no criticism subsequently. Section 28 has been used to give effect to the industry development arrangements for customer equipment. Section 29 has been used to direct Austel to undertake a number of studies and reports. These provisions play an important function in ensuring that Austel remains accountable and takes account of the full range of policy perspectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Another feature worthy of note is the international code of practice in division 4 of part 5. This is intended to give the Government flexibility in dealing with possible misuses of market power by foreign carriers that become possible with the advent of full resale. It is the Government's intention, however, to impose minimal restrictions on those carriers and trades where reciprocal rights of resale are permitted. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that the measures in this Bill which give Austel new functions will require additional expenditure on Austel of $4.6m in the 1991-92 financial year and $3.8m in the following financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is expected, however, that the increase in expenditure on Austel will be more than offset by the additional revenue raised from the carrier licence fees imposed by the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Bill 1991, and the fees imposed under the Telecommunications (Application Fees) Bill 1991 and the Telecommunications (Numbering Fees) Bill 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures in the Bill which introduce competition are expected to have a major financial impact on Australia's telecommunications industry, with new players entering the market and greater efficiencies in the provision of services. The increased efficiency in the telecommunications industry and the new services likely to be offered by the players in the industry as a result of this Bill are designed to enhance the long term competitiveness of the entire Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of financial impact on the ordinary customer, no householder or ordinary subscriber in rural areas will be disadvantaged by the reforms. All residential consumers who currently have access to untimed local calls will continue to have that access. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a companion piece of legislation to the Telecommunications Bill 1991, and imposes a levy in connection with ensuring the future delivery of the universal service obligation in Australia as defined in the Telecommunications Bill 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill allows for a carrier to be declared to be a participating carrier for a particular financial year and for a carrier to be liable to pay an amount equal to the carrier's levy debit balance. Details of the assessment, collection and distribution of the universal service levy are contained in part 13 of the Telecom- munications Bill 1991, as is the formula to be used by Austel to calculate levy credits and debits. Briefly, the formula allows levy credits and debits to be calculated based on the net costs incurred by carriers in delivering the universal service obligation, and apportioning liability for those costs to each carrier according to minutes of interconnect time. A levy is payable, therefore, only where a carrier's liability outweighs its net costs incurred. </PARA>
<PARA> In combination with the Telecommunications Bill 1991, this Bill will enable effect to be given to the Government's commitment to the future funding and delivery of the universal service obligation, and to its decision that the second telecommunications carrier should contribute on a pro rata basis to the costs of providing universal service. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The relative contributions of participating carriers will depend on the carriers identifying loss-making areas of their operations where they have a universal service obligation, the extent of those losses and the amount of interconnect time between the carriers' trunk and international networks and all local access networks. Accordingly, it is impossible to quantify what amounts will be payable under the levy. It can be expected, however, that as the second general carrier's business grows, its contribution to cover the net cost of loss-making services will increase. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The primary purpose of this Bill is to permit the amalgamation of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation (Telecom) and OTC Limited (OTC). The new corporate entity will be named the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation. The merger was one of the central elements of the parliamentary statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of 8 November 1990 on transport and telecommunications reform. Further details were spelled out in my own announcement of the same date. This Bill requires that the new company remain in full public ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a central tenet throughout the Government's reform processes that a strong public sector presence in Australian telecommunications be maintained. The decision to retain the merged company in public ownership will enable the Government to meet the guarantee that no householder or ordinary subscriber in rural areas will be disadvantaged by the introduction of competition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only through public ownership that the Government can ensure that the requirement that a standard telephone service be available to all residential and business customers throughout Australia is met. Public ownership allows direct control over this universal service obligation to the clear benefit of the people of Australia. If the Government were to privatise our national carrier, we would have to forgo the right as the Government to require that carrier to continue to meet such important social goals. </PARA>
<PARA> Retention of the new company in full public ownership will also mean that Australian taxpayers will continue to receive dividends in their capacity as shareholders. This means that future generations of Australians will continue to benefit from the rapid growth in telecommunications which this package of reforms will engender. </PARA>
<PARA> The major focus of this package is introducing competition, not privatisation for its own sake. The experience of other countries that have simultaneously attempted to privatise telecommunications companies and to introduce competition has been that competition has always been compromised. This package reflects our view that the fundamental issue is to get the regulatory framework right. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision to merge Telecom and OTC followed consideration last year of the review of the ownership and structural arrangements among the government owned telecommunications carriers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends that the merger of Telecom and OTC not represent a mere amalgamation of the two carriers. It is far more than that. The Government is seeking to bring these two carriers together to create a new entity with a streamlined organisational structure, which is capable of being not only an efficient national carrier but a major player in the telecommunications trade in this region. </PARA>
<PARA> This company must operate in a vigorous new competitive environment. It must therefore develop a genuinely competitive ethos and an overriding commitment to meeting the needs of Australian users. To do this, it is essential that the board and management of the new company pursue the achievement of standards of technical quality, service and price which are not only better than those achieved by Telecom and OTC individually but are equal to the best in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that significant synergies will be realised by removing the current distinction between domestic and international telecommunication services. A united entity, exploiting the existing abilities and expertise of Telecom and OTC, will be able to provide customers with a comprehensive, globally interconnected service. It will also provide the foundation for an increased export focus within the Australian telecommunications industry by building on the successes so far of Telecom Australia International and OTC International. </PARA>
<PARA> The first stage in the merging of Telecom and OTC commenced with the appointment in December 1990 of an `interim board' comprising representatives of both the Telecom and OTC boards. The interim board's primary task is to advise the Government on the corporate and management structure which will best facilitate the merger of the two organisations and to prepare Telecom and OTC to face a competitive environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The interim board is progressively refining its position on a proposed structure for the new company. The board aims to ensure that the new structure will provide focus, accountability and authority so as to achieve strategic business objectives. As well, the structure of the new company will promote transparency of revenues, costs and assets to support accountability. A further aim will be to ensure that the new company's performance in regard to prices, costs, productivity and quality of service is comparable with the best in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The new entity will be established, as a company with share capital, under normal corporations law processes. Consequently, the fiduciary responsibilities of the directors of the company will be the same as those applying to directors of private sector companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The operation of this Bill is directed at vesting in the new company all the rights, property, staff and liabilities of Telecom and OTC. It is the intention of the relevant provisions of the Bill that the new company be recognised as the legal successor of Telecom and OTC. In effect, the new company `stands in the shoes' of Telecom and OTC in respect of all their contractual arrangements. Provision is expressly made to ensure preservation of the rights, accrued entitlements and continuity of service of all Telecom and OTC staff transferred to the new company. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a deliberate policy decision of the Government that the merger provisions of the Bill will not commence until a day to be fixed by proclamation rather than commencing automatically after 6 months from the passage of the Bill. This is so that proclamation can be made to coincide with the certification by Austel that appropriate interconnection and equal access arrangements between the networks of Telecom and OTC and the second carrier have been settled. This approach recognises that the terms and conditions of interconnection are fundamental to the successful launch of the second carrier. In short, there is a powerful incentive on Telecom and OTC to move quickly on interconnection as they will be required to continue to operate as separate entities until the Austel certification is issued. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to emphasise that this merger is not simply about subsuming one government owned organisation into another. The merger is concerned with the creation of a new organisation that will be much more than a simple `adding together' of OTC and Telecom. I have previously stated that the Government is interested in achieving the creation of a dynamic, customer driven, commercial entity. I reiterate that our goal is exactly that, and I am confident that it will be realised. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill I am about to introduce empowers the Minister for Transport and Communications to give directions to the new company in relation to its operations when it is in the public interest to do so. This emphasises the Government's commitment to providing the Australian consumer with the most efficient and responsive telecommunications carrier possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, this provision should be viewed as primarily providing the Minister with a reserve power. Indeed the whole thrust of our competitive reforms will ensure that the board, management and staff of the new company will have every incentive to ensure that the new company performs efficiently and is responsive to customer requirements. If the new company is not responsive to the community's expectations it will inevitably see its market share and market power diminish. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also empowers the Minister to regulate charges levied by Telecom or OTC-or by the new company after the merger-for a telecommunications service or facility. This provision continues existing arrangements. At present, Telecom and OTC are subject to price cap arrangements which work to keep average price increases to consumers well below the inflation rate and thereby encourage Telecom and OTC to actively pursue improvements in their productivity. In the case of Telecom, control is also exercised through the notification and disallowance powers of the Minister in relation to a number of reserved services. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the price cap and notification and disallowance arrangements will continue until 1 July 1992, when the number of services regulated by notification and disallowance of charges will be reduced with greater emphasis on the price cap mechanism. The price control mechanisms are included in this Bill rather than in the Telecommunications Bill as they apply only to Telecom and OTC and, following the merger, the new company. This reflects the fact that as long as Telecom and OTC retain substantial market share, it is necessary and appropriate to be able to influence their pricing practices. It can be expected that as the market presence and power of the second and subsequent network providers grow, the need for these provisions will diminish. Ultimately they will be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA> In opening the telecommunications sector to more competition, the Government has been conscious of the need to create, as far as possible, a level playing field between the two general carriers. Accordingly, the Government gave careful consideration to which laws and policies should or should not apply to the new company. Because it is being established as a company under the corporations law, the new company will be automatically subject to certain laws which Telecom, as a statutory authority, was not. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, some exemptions from Commonwealth, State and Territory laws are carried over in this Bill and further exemptions may be accorded by regulation. Such exemptions will be kept to a minimum and will only be provided in cases where the cost to the new company of complying with the particular legislation would be particularly onerous and would result in substantial flow-on to customers; where the introduction of effective competition would be hampered; or where an exemption is essential in order to satisfy other government policy objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> A provision in the Bill also requires that the new company submit its annual report and financial statements to the Minister for Transport and Communications. It is my expectation that the directors of the company will include in those financial statements a full consolidation of the accounts of all subsidiaries and all joint ventures, including where the company only has a minority shareholding, of the new company. I consider it entirely appropriate that a Commonwealth owned company should conform with the highest accounting standards possible. In any event, when the Parliament passes amendments to the corporations law covering consolidation of subsidiaries, the new company will be obliged to compile financial statements in this form. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards financial impact, direct Commonwealth outlays will be minimal, being essentially limited to the costs of establishing and registering the new company. As regards additional revenue to the Commonwealth, a fee will be paid to the Government as a result of the merger of Telecom and OTC. The level of that fee will be set by the Government following consideration of advice from the interim board on the likely financial results of the merger. The Bill provides for certain exemptions from Commonwealth, State and Territory taxes with regard to the succession process, recognising there has been no change in beneficial ownership of the carriers. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend this Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In continuation of my support for the Appropriation Bill (No. 5) in particular, I wish to proceed in expressing to the House the importance of Federal funding for flood mitigation works in western Sydney's flood prone areas, particularly in regard to house raising schemes. Before my speech was interrupted by the adjournment debate during the previous sitting, I mentioned a house raising subsidisation scheme which is administered by the New South Wales Rural Assistance Board. Under this scheme, loans are available to house owners in flood prone areas of up to 90 per cent of the cost of raising or relocating homes above flood level, subject to a ceiling amount of $10,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, according to the Review of Floodplain Management Practice in NSW, a discussion paper dated May 1989, the scheme was generally seen as restrictive and unfair. I quote from that paper:</PARA>
<PARA>Most occupants of flood liable homes feel that it is not their fault that they live in such a dwelling. The residents were generally not parties to the original building approvals, and often were not aware that the site was flood liable at the time of purchase. </PARA>
<PARA>The paper concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA>More direct encouragement to people to help themselves, by raising the flood liable parts of their homes, and review of the existing house raising scheme in this light is deemed worthy of consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>Many residents who need financial assistance to raise their home above the one in 100 year flood level are pensioners or low income families who cannot afford to repay even the Rural Assistance Board's loan of $10,000. Moreover, conditions which apply to a loan application impose an extra financial burden on an applicant who invariably must arrange additional finance to cover the total cost of the house raising. </PARA>
<PARA> Fairfield City Council wrote to the New South Wales Premier, Nick Greiner, on 19 October 1988 requesting that the Rural Assistance Board loan be increased to $20,000 and that the `means testing restrictions' be removed. This was refused. What I suggest now and have suggested in the past is that indexed grants of $20,000 be made available to those people who own homes in the flood affected areas and who can ill afford to have their houses raised or relocated. There are 380 houses in the Lower Prospect Creek area which require funding for house raising. The estimated total cost to raise these houses is $4.3m. </PARA>
<PARA> Fairfield City Council allocated $600,000 in this financial year's budget to contribute towards house raising under the 2:2:1 funding arrangement between the Federal, State and local governments. The former Minister, Senator Peter Cook, advised Fairfield Council of the Commonwealth's agreement to fund house raising in this manner. However, until as recently as 23 April, the State Government of New South Wales had not agreed to the arrangement. Now, with the State election called, the New South Wales Liberal coalition Government has finally decided to come to the party and has provided Fairfield Council with ministerial approval for house raising to be eligible for flood mitigation funding-subject to formal approval from the State Minister for Public Works, I might add. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, however, the New South Wales State Government's 16 month delay in deciding on this matter has meant that administrative arrangements for house raising projects must be set back further and must now come under the 1991-92 financial year flood mitigation program. Under the Fairfield City Council's Lower Prospect Creek Floodplain Management Strategy, it was proposed that a reasonable approach to the house raising issue would be for a subsidy in the range of $3,000 to $20,000 to be offered to property owners to raise their houses from the available flood mitigation funds. The level of subsidy would be proportional to the expected damage which would be sustained by the unraised house over its remaining lifetime. In some locations, additional structural works comprising deflector banks and road raising are recommended to facilitate access and emergency evacuation from the raised houses. </PARA>
<PARA> The flood mitigation strategy recommended that the house raising proposal be implemented as soon as practicable, so that the wishes of those residents who were on waiting lists for the schemes could be met. The action of subsidising house raising would mean that people could remain in their homes; the Government would be seen to be solving these problems quickly; councils would continue to receive rates from the property; communities would continue to prosper; and money allocated in this way would achieve more value for the dollar spent. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are a number of practical details which have to be resolved before this house raising scheme can be implemented. These include, just to give a few, that a subsidy must be payable only on the condition that houses are raised above the one in one hundred flood level plus freeboard; that any additional costs to enlarge or upgrade the house would be the responsibility of the owner; and that the owner may, in some cases, be allowed to demolish and rebuild above flood level, rather than raise an existing building. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea of subsidising house raising has been welcomed by many flood-affected residents in my electorate as well as lobby groups such as the South West Region Flood Action Group. In a recent press release issued by Fairfield City Council, the mayor claimed that New South Wales councils were:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . missing out badly on flood mitigation funding from Canberra . . .</PARA>
<PARA>and that:</PARA>
<PARA>Federal funding had failed to keep pace with State Government allocations, falling short by $8 million in 1990/91. </PARA>
<PARA>The press release also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>State and Local Government funds, unmatched by Federal funding, (in the 2:2:1 program) ultimately costs ratepayers an extra $133,000 for every $1 million spent on flood mitigation. </PARA>
<PARA>According to that press release the executive of the flood mitigation authorities of New South Wales wants:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Canberra to provide $10 million in its next budget for urgent flood mitigation in NSW for the 2:2:1 (program). This will give a real boost to the Councils in reducing annual flood damage costs. </PARA>
<PARA>There are 35 local government areas within New South Wales, with a combined population of nearly 2 million persons, which have urgent flood mitigation backlogs totalling $275m. Financial assistance is needed from both State and Federal governments to subsidise flood plain management studies and capital works in these areas which require more funding than the councils alone can provide. </PARA>
<PARA> Although modern flood plain strategies and future planning are being adopted by councils, the flooding problem in existing residential areas will not be overcome without more financial assistance from State and Federal governments to allow the implementation of substantial flood mitigation works. Major river flooding in New South Wales directly affects about 45,000 urban properties. (Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA> In the time that I have left I would suggest that the proposal suggested that the Commonwealth and State governments should each pay an annual contribution of $7.2m and the affected councils should pay an annual contribution of $3.6m. Needless to say, this proposal was never heeded. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of Federal funding of flood mitigation works in western Sydney will not disappear in the near future and the problem of flooding will not be solved overnight. However, significant progress can be made towards preventing further flooding disasters and hardship in western Sydney if action is taken by Federal, State and local governments now. It is for this reason that I commend the Appropriation Bills to this House and hope that a decision to increase funding for flood mitigation works in New South Wales, and especially in western Sydney, will soon be made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to spend my time today in discussing Appropriation Bill (No. 5) in talking about communications and, specifically in Appropriation Bill (No. 5), the fifth item of additional appropriations which is the $25m agreed value for the purchase of Telecom's equity in Aussat. The Government purchased Telecom's 25 per cent equity so that it can sell Aussat together with the second network carrier licence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have just heard the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) introduce a series of Bills that will give effect to the Government's decision to partially deregulate the telecommunications market and partially effect a form of privatisation. The coalition will respond to those Bills in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> We do know now what the Government will do. The Government will sell, or attempt to sell, Aussat and in doing so will attempt to create a form of competition. That sold Aussat will compete with the merged Telecom-OTC. The Government intends to maintain the duopoly that would then exist until 1997 at least and it has stated that it will keep Telecom in Government hands. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand the coalition policy on telecommunications is starkly different and quite clear. Our first priority in telecommunications is to achieve full and effective competition, and that means not a duopoly but the ability of anybody to be able to enter what we hope will be a contestable market. Within that framework of full and effective competition, we will proceed with the privatisation of Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> The timing, pace and conditions of the privatisation of Telecom will be determined having regard to all the relevant circumstances and the capital market's ability to provide the funds required for the privatisation of Telecom. That privatisation of Telecom would be managed so as to ensure that Australians retain majority ownership and control of strategic telecommunication assets. In the pri- vatisation process employees of Telecom will be given preference in acquiring shares. </PARA>
<PARA> The community service obligations in telecommunications will be paid for by direct and specific appropriation made in the Budget. The community service obligations will ensure the provision of comprehensive, reasonably priced telecommunications services to rural, regional and remote areas. Competitors in telecommunications will be required to obtain licences from the Australian telecommunications authority, Austel. These licences will entitle the licensees to compete in the entire field of, or specific areas of, telecommunications. Licences will be issued against criteria established, including the competition and services proposed by the applicant, and the merits of the application. </PARA>
<PARA> A specific matter that will be taken into account in the awarding of these licences will be the degree of Australian ownership of the applicant. The coalition parties will treat the telecommunications industry as an industry of strategic national importance for the purpose of foreign investment guidelines and each licence application will be subject to a case-by-case examination. The coalition parties commit themselves to the independence of the regulatory body, Austel, which will have a very significant role in enabling full and effective competition to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> Austel, therefore, will have, firstly, adequate powers and resources to ensure that competitors to Telecom will be able to connect to the Telecom network on non-discriminatory terms and fair prices and, secondly, a charter to encourage competition. Austel will also retain its essential function of determining technical standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Our emphasis, so far as the telecommunications industry in the future is concerned, is on full and effective competition right across the board. We want to see anybody who is prepared to offer telecommunications services to the Australian public have the ability to do so. We want to see a properly contestable market with anybody who wants to compete in that market having access to it. Full competition is a prerequisite to privatisation. The coalition parties will proceed to privatisation of Telecom only after they are satisfied that full and effective competition is either in place or can take place; in other words, that there is a properly contestable market. </PARA>
<PARA> The privatisation process is misunderstood by the Government. The Government regards privatisation as essentially a revenue raising exercise. But privatisation is not only about raising revenue and providing an appropriate return to the taxpayers of the funds that they have invested in Government business enterprises; it involves greater competition, greater efficiency and benefits to consumers. By benefits to consumers, we mean lower prices and better services. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Victorian public transport system-a government enterprise which operates as a monopoly-we have a wonderful example of the way in which we should be using the market to open up and to provide better services to consumers. In that transport system there is a lack of competition, shocking delivery of services, and an immense cost to the Victorian public and, in a sense, to the Australian taxpayer in the form of a loss of $1.2 billion last year. That is an extra tax of $1,100 for the average four-person family. The Commonwealth Government now has an opportunity to lead the way in privatisation, but already it has made an extraordinary mess of trying to part-privatise the airlines-all this before the process has even begun. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the part-privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank appears to be proceeding smoothly, it offers an opportunity for a successful transfer of all the ownership of the bank at a time when the Government has squibbed that issue by offering only a portion of the bank to what will be an eager public wishing to invest in it. The next coalition Government will embark on an orderly program of returning property and enterprise to the people. We will encourage the States to follow suit for the sake of efficiency, lower prices and better services to consumers. We emphasise the consumer benefits; we emphasise the beneficial effect of competition; we emphasise the effect that more efficiency will have; and we emphasise that lower prices and better services will almost certainly follow the opening up of markets to competition and the transfer of ownership of government business enterprises to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> We should make mention of the aspect of funding. It is now clear that governments are trying to do more than they can or should do. Government resources are limited and should be employed in providing social services to the community, to look to establishing a safety net for those people who cannot look after themselves, and to providing those services in our just and compassionate society. All of these government business enterprises will need additional funding in due course; any successful business requires additional funding. The fact that both Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines now have such an appalling ratio of debt to equity, quite out of step with their private sector competitors here and with what is happening in the industry in other parts of the world, is an indicator that the Government is either unwilling or unable to provide the necessary funds to bring those debt equity ratios into balance. Any successful business requires additional funding. By transferring these government business enterprises from the public sector to the private sector we obviate the need for the taxpayer to provide those additional funds. </PARA>
<PARA> A further aspect of the privatisation program is the fact that we want to encourage employees in those organisations to participate in their ownership. The Government lectured us in Question Time today about relations between employer and employee and our approach to this. On the contrary, our approach to industrial relations, with its emphasis on enterprise bargaining, that is, entering into relationships between employer and employee at an enterprise level, will make it easier for communication to take place between employer and employee and almost inevitably will improve the relationship between them. If we go further-as we propose to do-in the privatisation of government business enterprises by requiring or asking employees to participate in the ownership of the enterprise, we will further improve the relationship between employer and employee. </PARA>
<PARA> Another benefit we see from privatisation is that we can encourage a more widespread ownership of the assets of our country in the hands of its citizens. There have been some articles recently in the Australian Financial Review that suggest that, with the part-privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank, there could be 300,000 to 400,000 new shareholders in the bank. That compares with 187,000 shareholders, I think it is, in our largest listed public corporation, the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. So we want to see greater employee participation and a wider spread of shareholding of these enterprises in the hands of all our citizens when they are transferred to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> A further benefit from the transfer of these government business enterprises to the private sector is that we will have leaner government and less need for people to be involved in overseeing these enterprises. Leaner government will mean a more competitive, more effective and better managed government sector. Finally, in terms of benefits, capital markets will become more responsive as these large enterprises are floated or sold into the private sector because capital markets respond very actively to new issues, and particularly to issues of many of these corporations which, as we know, are great Australian enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> If I summarise briefly a recent paper by Des Moore of the Institute of Public Affairs on the six points that have led to the worldwide privatisation movement, it will further encapsulate what we believe are the benefits that will arise from the privatisation process. They are, firstly, the recognition that there can be government failure as well as market failure; secondly, the deterioration in economic performance in those countries that accompanied the expansion of government over the last generation; thirdly, the apparent failure of government intervention to overcome social problems such as poverty; fourthly, the poor performance of government trading enterprises; fifthly, the development of public choice theory, suggesting that there is an in-built tendency for government and bureaucrats to act in ways contrary to the best interests of the community as a whole; and, sixthly, the realisation that powerful interest groups, whether business or union, can capture government and government enterprises and persuade them to protect their positions, again contrary to the interest of the community as a whole. The privatisation movement has developed as a counter to this capture that has taken place in the public sector and of government business enterprises</PARA>
<PARA> We plan to privatise the following government business enterprises: Aussat Pty Ltd, Australian Airlines, the Australian Industry Development Corporation and the Australian National Line. We plan to complete the process of privatising the Commonwealth Bank, the airport terminals, Medibank Private, the Pipeline Authority, Qantas Airways Ltd, the Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. In due course we will develop and expand the appropriate mechanisms that will apply to the privatisation of those government business enterprises and the appropriate method of marketing to ensure that their transfer is a success and that the taxpayer is appropriately rewarded in terms of the return of the proceeds from the sale. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, an essential part of the privatisation process is the contracting out of services to Australian business enterprises and to small and even one-person contractors of those functions now performed by the bureaucracy. This process of contracting out will encourage competition, provide more flexibility and give greater service to the consumers of those services. Amongst the targets for contracting out are things such as cleaning; security functions; computer services; fire protection; laundries; stores management; training; property management, construction, maintenance, valuation and mapping; waste collection; and laboratory analysis. All these functions are presently delivered by government but could equally be contracted out to the private sector, thus introducing competition and providing better services to those consumers to whom those services are directed. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be happy to encourage tenders for the supply of food and drink in Parliament House, for example. Our highly skilled staff in the dining room would be able to earn more if their efforts could be rewarded by a more efficient system. Workers will soon come to learn that flexibility and better service mean higher incomes. For example, in the United States of America highly successful contracting-out programs have been conducted in such areas as prisoner rehabilitation. The Salvation Army has a wonderful record in this respect. It has saved the United States taxpayer large sums of previously wasted expenditure. The coalition parties look forward to budgets which incorporate coherent and widespread programs of privatisation and contracting out, thus giving to the Australian people lower prices and better services. I believe that that view is shared by the Australian public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Appropriation Bills, I take the opportunity to congratulate the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on its relentless efforts to acknowledge and implement Australia's international human rights obligations. Over the last 12 months-my first year in parliament-I have been convinced more than ever that it is absolutely essential that this Parliament address itself seriously to human rights and that raising the profile and effectiveness of the Commission is the best way we can do this. It is true that Australia has a solid international reputation on human rights issues, and deservedly so. In January this year we began a three-year term as a member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. This will further raise our profile internationally. I hope it will also help focus our attention on human rights abuses in our own backyard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has been turning the spotlight on human rights abuses in Australia. Disturbing reports have been tabled in this House on behalf of Mr Brian Burdekin, the Human Rights Commissioner, on the social and material needs of Queensland-New South Wales border towns and on homeless youth. Just last month the Race Discrimination Commissioner, Irene Moss, tabled a damning report on racist violence in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to maintain our international reputation into the twenty-first century, we have to consolidate what we have already achieved. We have to raise the status of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. As a Queenslander, I am particularly concerned about community awareness of human rights in my State. The objectives of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission are as follows: first, to increase the understanding, acceptance and observance of human rights and equal opportunity in Australia; and, secondly, to promote a fairer society by protecting basic human rights and ensuring that Australia complies with its human rights obligations under international law. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to say that it makes it extremely difficult for the Commission to fulfil its charter in Queensland, where there is only one office in Brisbane to serve the entire State, especially when nearly half a million Queenslanders live above the line across from Townsville to Mount Isa. For this reason alone there is an urgent need for an office of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to be established somewhere in north Queensland. Obviously, this will involve an increase in funding for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I will certainly be lobbying my colleagues in the Government, particularly northern Queensland members-the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler) and the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay)-to make provision for this in the forthcoming Budget. However, apart from demographics, there is a compelling argument for an expansion of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's presence in Queensland, particularly on the basis of need. </PARA>
<PARA> My electorate of Kennedy is in Queensland. It extends from the Northern Territory border across to the Atherton Tablelands and south to Blackall. It takes up about 45 per cent of the Queensland landmass. Because of the size of the electorate I am entitled to two offices. I have one in my home city of Mount Isa and one in Mareeba, which is about an hour's drive inland from Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA> As all honourable members in this House would know, a wide range of people with a wide range of problems venture through the doors of electorate offices. Because of the breadth of my electorate I also receive an incredible amount of mail from constituents. What has concerned me over the last 12 months is the number of constituents who have sought my advice and assistance on matters that have involved serious breaches of human rights. I have been approached about blatantly racist treatment of Aboriginal constituents, about more subtle racism against Filipino women, about sex discrimination in employment, about child abuse and indeed about shameful treatment of elderly people. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not in a position now to say whether the incidence of human rights abuses in my electorate is any higher than anywhere else. However, I can say that Queensland as a whole fares a lot worse than other States in relation to human rights abuses. It is fair to say that Queensland has suffered 32 years of right wing fundamentalism under the National Party Government-a government that had 32 years to introduce anti-discrimination legislation but did not. As I understand it, Tasmania is the only other State that has failed to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the National Party, Queensland did not have a State-funded office dedicated to women's issues, prompting the Commonwealth to set up an outpost of the Federal Office of the Status of Women in Brisbane some time ago. The Bjelke-Petersen Government was openly hostile to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as indicated by the Koowarta case in which the Queensland Government refused to sell land to an Aboriginal community group. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland was one of three States surveyed in a study undertaken by the National Inquiry into Racist Violence, which quite disturbingly found that police systematically beat young Aboriginal detainees. A survey of some 200 Aboriginal youths found that between 82 per cent and 94 per cent had been assaulted by police. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor is the Queensland record on sex discrimination anything to cheer about. In a paper given at a seminar held by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on sex discrimination legislation, Marg O'Donnell, Director of the Queensland community justice program, past Director of the Queensland Office of the Status of Women and conciliator with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, presented the Committee with these disturbing statistics concerning Queensland's record on sex discrimination: Queensland has the highest unemployment rate for women of any State in Australia; in Queensland women have the lowest rate of pay relative to men; and Queensland has the highest percentage of sexual assaults against women of any State in Australia. Those are disturbing statistics indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same paper, Marg O'Donnell told the Committee that because the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act specifically did not apply to employment in that State, many Queenslanders, especially in remote areas, believed that it did not apply in Queensland at all. The Queensland Attorney-General, Dean Wells, summed up the mood in Queensland under the previous National Party Government when he described the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission as `courageously implementing the Federal legislation in Queensland'. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the above, I guess it is not surprising that so many apparent human rights abuses have come through my offices, and I am very pleased to see that in March this year the Queensland State Cabinet approved the preparation of legislation which will outlaw discrimination on grounds of race, religion, sex, age and disability. In fact, the Queensland Government recently announced plans to negotiate with the Commonwealth to enable complementary administration of the State's proposed anti-discrimination laws with Federal laws. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess this now gives us the perfect opportunity to redress the 32 years of neglect by the National Party and make a concerted State and Federal attack on all forms of discrimination. As I said, for human rights abuses to be seriously challenged in Queensland, and indeed Australia-wide, the Commission must have a higher profile. One way to achieve this in Queensland is to open an office in the northern part of the State. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is fair to say that we must go further than this. We can have an office in every city and town, providing information on human rights and successfully conciliating instances of human rights abuses, but unless the Commission actually has the power to enforce its determinations in those critical situations where conciliation fails, those offices are indeed mere facades. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission must be given more teeth. The fact is that, when it comes to sexism, racism, ageism or any other form of discrimination, we have to change people's ideas. It is not sufficient to rely on the view of ourselves as a nation of battlers where everyone gets a fair go. Just because we see ourselves as an egalitarian society does not make us one. Similarly, to legislate to the effect that people should not discriminate on the basis of sex, marital status, age or race does not mean that such discrimination will cease. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not so long ago that Australia unquestioningly maintained a White Australia immigration policy. No doubt, this official racism was reflected in individual prejudices that in some cases still linger today. Some form of compulsion to rethink fundamentally racist views is necessary so that people can see that change can occur and anarchy will not reign. The same can be said in relation to sexism and other forms of discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a fundamental problem in regard to the power of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission: the determinations of the Commission are not enforceable by that Commission. As well as its own Act, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission administers the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, as well as the Privacy Act 1988. The emphasis in the legislation is on the settlement of complaints by `conciliation'. When the conciliation process fails to achieve results, the Commission has wide powers to conduct its own inquiries and either dismiss the complaint or find the complaint substantiated and make certain determinations. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate the merits of conciliation. According to the Commission, by far the majority of complaints are successfully dealt with by conciliation. In fact, in 1988-89, 97 per cent of the complaints brought under the Sex Discrimination Act were either successfully conciliated or not proceeded with. However, it is an unfortunate fact that the cases which attract publicity are those which cannot be conciliated and which go to a formal hearing. The outcome of these cases is therefore vitally important in terms of the public perception of the effectiveness of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences of the current legislative arrangements have been amply illustrated in the case of one Lynette Aldridge who made a complaint to the Commission under the Sex Discrimination Act. I will outline briefly the path of Lynette Aldridge's complaint, as I believe it actually tells its own story.</PARA>
<PARA> Lynette left her job in a bakery in January 1986, and in March 1986 she made a complaint under the Sex Discrimination Act against her employer, one Grant Booth. After all attempts at conciliation failed, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission held a formal hearing on 5 November 1986 and found that Lynette's complaint was substantiated and that the incidents complained of were unlawful under the Sex Discrimination Act. The next day the Commission awarded her $7,000 damages for humiliation and injury. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Booth actually refused to pay the money. Because of the constitutional constraints, the Commission could not make him pay. Under the Constitution, judicial powers cannot be conferred on administrative bodies, so section 81 (1) of the Sex Discrimination Act and section 25z of the Racial Discrimination Act specifically state that the Commission's determinations are not binding on the parties. For the order to be enforced the matter had to be referred to the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA> Lynette successfully applied for legal aid and an application to appeal was filed with the court on 9 March 1987. Constitutional questions arose in relation to the status of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and other matters which resulted in the then Attorney-General and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission intervening in the proceedings. After numerous Federal Court appearances, during which it was decided that the Court was required to rehear all the evidence, the matter eventually went to trial in August 1987 and was heard over seven days between August and October 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> This meant that Lynette had to go through the whole humiliating episode again in a formal court, dominated by men, in which the experience she complained of was peripheral to the heady questions of constitutional law being debated. Much to her relief, some seven months later, in March 1988, the Federal Court found in her favour and imposed an identical order to that of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be comforting to end the story there. However, Mr Booth has again refused to pay up on the basis that he could not afford to, even if he wanted to do so. So, after an oral examination, Lynette's application for legal aid to enforce the Federal Court's decision has now been refused. To my mind, this whole process is an abuse of human rights. Lynette has absolutely no reason to believe she had any rights at all, certainly none that this Parliament is serious about enforcing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aldridge and Booth case is of particular concern to me in light of a recent Commission hearing in my electorate in Mareeba. A complaint was made by a number of my constituents, who are Aboriginal, who had been refused service in two Mareeba hotels. In December 1990 the Commission found that the hotels concerned had unlawfully discriminated against Aborigines under the Racial Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to say much more than that here, as I understand that the publicans concerned have refused to pay the compensation ordered by the Commission. This leaves the complainants in the same position as Lynette, where they will have to apply for legal aid to have the matter reheard in the Federal Court. I believe this situation is totally unsatisfactory. The Government is well aware of the problem. In a submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the Attorney-General's Department states that it is arguable that the fact that the Commission's determinations are not binding undermines the effectiveness of the Commission's role in eradicating sex and race discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> The submission made the very disturbing comment that in recent cases respondents have exercised the option of withholding their evidence but assessing the complainant's case in the hearing before the Commission, ignoring the Commission's determination and then developing or patching up their own case in the Federal Court. The submission makes the obvious point that, as more and more respondents learn that the Commission's decisions are indecisive, there is a risk that they will use their financial superiority over the complainants to force repetition of proceedings in the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA> So the question has to be asked: what do we do? I believe that there are a number of short term measures that can be implemented almost immediately. Firstly, the need for complete rehearings in the Federal Court can be limited. The submission of the Attorney-General's Department to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs stated that the Government is giving consideration to a means whereby some of the more onerous effects of the need for complete rehearings in the Federal Court can be alleviated. Secondly, the need for the complainant to take action on his or her own behalf to have a determination of the Commission enforced in the Federal Court can be shifted to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission by providing the Commission with sufficient resources to run its own appeals. </PARA>
<PARA> In conjunction with these initiatives, I believe we need to look at the wider question of the status of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the context of constitutional reform. A guarantee of basic human rights was identified by the Constitutional Centenary Conference held in Sydney earlier this year as one of the 12 key issues to be pursued in the constitutional reform debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of how human rights are to be guaranteed must be addressed in this context. Bodies such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission must be given clear and appropriate powers, and our courts must be given clear and appropriate direction. These issues have to be addressed in the context of constitutional reform. I, like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, cherish my freedom of speech and my freedom from discrimination. But I wonder whether Lynette Aldridge or my Aboriginal constituents in Mareeba would say the same thing. As an Anglo-Saxon, tertiary educated male, my world experience does not include the discrimination experienced by a single mother harassed at work or an Aboriginal person desperate for a job or who just wants to have a drink in a hotel. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to say that we live in rapidly changing times-times in which the global demand for human rights is gathering momentum. If Australia is to keep up with the rest of the world we must be seen to be doing more than simply sermonising. We have to establish an office of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in north Queensland to meet the desperate needs of nearly half a million Australians who are entitled to reasonable access to the Commission. We have to urgently address the problems facing complainants seeking enforcement of Commission determinations. The current situation is totally unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, I believe we have to act now. As things stand, my constituents in Mareeba face a similar soul destroying experience, as did Lynette Aldridge. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission must be given the support it needs to fulfil its charter so that we can maintain our international reputation on human rights issues. As the Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, said in the Commission's annual report for 1989-90:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the existing structure-</PARA>
<PARA>of the Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>can be improved upon. What is essential, however, is a better understanding in the general community and at the political level of the need for human rights machinery, given the limitations of our court system to provide affordable and effective remedies for many of our most disadvantaged Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, we must act now to ensure that there is an office of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission opened in north Queensland as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91 and cognate Bills in the context of Australia's present national circumstances, I am reminded of the words of the famed British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey who, on the eve of the First World War, on 3 August 1914, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.</PARA>
<PARA>Today, on 7 May 1991, the lamps are going out all over Australia. They are going out because of the most disastrous combination of adverse forces throughout the 1980s which have made that decade the most dissipated and forgettable in our 200-year history-a decade dominated by the incompetence of Federal and State Labor governments, widespread official corruption, the repulsive excesses of corporate entrepreneurs and the arrogance of militant unions, which have given us the politics of expediency and the economics of greed. </PARA>
<PARA> The resultant net foreign debt of over $130 billion, crippling interest rates, endless mergers, takeovers and then crashes and mindless industrial disruption have all but destroyed our once great farming, mining and manufacturing industries. Not that any of this has apparently worried members of Australia's various Labor governments. Even the more responsible and rational Labor members have gone along with the policy direction of the 1980s-if one can dignify it with that term-and, in Parliament and in Caucus, faithfully followed W.S. Gilbert's dictum in HMS Pinafore:</PARA>
<PARA>I always voted at my party's call, and I never thought of thinking for myself at all. </PARA>
<PARA>If individual Labor members had thought for themselves, they would have realised that one cannot build a great nation and an enduring economy on the financial services sector, tourism, casinos and taking in each other's washing. However, the Australian Labor Party does not have the dubious status of being solely responsible for the near ruination of this country. The corporate fringe dwellers, the entrepreneurs such as Bond, Skase, Herscu, Spalvins and others, with empires built on the sands of debt and not on the rock of real wealth creation, must be held just as accountable. Taking full advantage of Labor's excessive and incompetently implemented financial deregulation, the subsequent absence of proper prudential controls and spurred on by the yuppie element in the financial institutions, the corporate entrepreneurs engaged in the most extensive exercises of economic destruction, not production, and disgraced the hitherto good name of Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA> To Labor's incompetence and entrepreneurial rapaciousness must be added the blind arrogance of the militant unions. Not only have they, with a Luddite passion, undermined or blocked sensible reforms to work practices and the operation of the labour market, but on occasions also placed the livelihood of entire industries at risk by the most idiotic and incomprehensible industrial action. Not so long ago in my own State of Victoria we had a classic illustration of this form of industrial action when the tomato growing industry was put at risk by an absolutely pointless dispute at the Heinz factory. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the now totally discredited roulette economics of the 1980s, Australia faces the coming decade with a massive foreign debt, an impotent economy and drastically weakened public institutions. The terrifying consequence of this awful combination is a massive erosion of our national sovereignty. In the immortal words of the Scottish poet, Robert Burns, we are losing `the glorious privilege of being independent'. All those responsible for this betrayal of Australia's freedom to act in our best interests will stand condemned in the eyes of the electorate and the generations to come. </PARA>
<PARA> However, not content with playing its part in destroying our economic independence, the Hawke Labor Government now proposes to further undermine our national sovereignty by taking away even the capacity to properly defend ourselves. There can be no doubt that the steady sapping of our defence capability has been sensed for some time, especially by the handful of us in this House-and, believe me, it is only a handful-who take any serious interest in defence. Despite Government protestations about increasing Australia's defence self-reliance and posturing about new capital equipment programs, there has been growing evidence of a developing crisis in our defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the 1980s we have witnessed such disturbing events as the early decimation of the Army Reserve by the quite stupid tax on Reserve pay; the rising resignation rate amongst experienced officers and non-commissioned officers in all three regular services; the growing parlous manpower, equipment and stores situation within the infantry battalions of the Regular Army; the severe restrictions on both Royal Australian Air Force flying time and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) steaming time; the scouring of the Army for sufficient boots for the force that went to Fiji; and the ransacking of naval stores to provide adequate supplies for the RAN task force that went to the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> Most recently, we have seen the abolition of the Army's 3rd Division headquarters in Melbourne and the accompanying unit abolitions and amalgamations of the Army Reserve, which are impacting most heavily upon Victoria. The implications of all this are most disquieting because it is 3rd Division headquarters that was instrumental in the development of the Vital Asset Protection (VAP) doctrine for such assets in northern and western Australia. It is the headquarters that has the greatest experience in the operation of that doctrine. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people who are indifferent or even hostile to Australia's defence requirements give two totally predictable responses to this gravely deteriorating state of affairs. The first of these predictable responses is that Australia faces no imminent threat of mainland invasion or other significant defence contingency. Clearly, though, there are many disturbing scenarios, short of invasion, that can suddenly arise, as the Falklands War, Fiji, the Gulf and our near involvement in Bougainville all patently demonstrate. </PARA>
<PARA> A second response is that our allies, most especially the United States, will look to Australia's safety in any foreseeable emergency. Leaving aside the obvious fact that we are ostensibly a nation in our own right and not a tributary vassal in an American empire and that we require the respect of our allies and not their contempt, it also has to be said that there are numerous localised or even regional defence contingencies where United States protection or support could not be taken for granted. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we could resort to that fine European tradition of centuries past, also practised in the Roman empire in its final years, of ensuring Australia's national defence by hiring mercenaries. Knowing the predilection of the Hawke Labor Government, they would, of course, have to be Japanese mercenaries, possibly retained as part of an overall package deal on the multifunction polis or the very fast train. Levity aside, when the House hears what I am about to say about the further destruction that the Federal Labor Government intends shortly to wreak upon the Australian defence forces, my colleagues in this place and the Australian people will realise that hiring foreign mercenaries may ultimately be the only defence option that this country has left. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In essence, the crunch point in the run-down of defence has come. This Government's years of starving the Australian defence forces of essential resources, of disinterest in defence, of poor political leadership in military affairs and of continuing confusion over strategic aims have made this terrible day inevitable. What is more, the Hawke Government cannot plead ignorance of its imminent arrival. No less a figure than the nation's most senior serving soldier, General Peter Gration, Chief of the Defence Force, told the Parliament prior to Christmas that it was coming. In evidence before the defence sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on 17 December 1990, on page 1262 of the transcript, General Gration is reported as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>As the Committee knows, since the 1987 White Paper actual defence funds have fallen well short of the anticipated 3 per cent per annum real growth that we foresaw in 1987. As a matter of historical fact, we have had more like zero per cent real growth and we have had zero growth this year. We have, therefore, been trying to implement this total force under conditions in which we were contracting both the size of the Defence Force and our investment plans. In this climate, difficult judgments were necessary and the Reserves, as part of the total force, had to take their share of the hurt. The hurt was apportioned not on the basis of whether particular units were regular or reserves but on the priority of their contribution to the defence of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This was the background to the reductions in the Reserve in Victoria in the context of the 1990-91 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>At this juncture I must interpose my own observation. Notwithstanding General Gration's distinguished record, I must take issue with him on his last remarks. The Army Reserve in Victoria was undoubtedly singled out for peculiarly brutal treatment. Major-General Mike Jeffrey and others saw to that, as I have pointed out earlier in this House. Nevertheless, I continue with General Gration's testimony on page 1267 of the transcript of evidence of 17 December last, where his expose develops as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>I will just pick up a couple of things there. I think you have to be very careful in distinguishing between percentage of gross domestic product and percentage growth. You used both figures there. The figure that I was talking about was predicted annual real growth. At the time of the 1987 White Paper the Government guidance was to plan on plus 3 per cent per annum real growth. There was a separate figure given of keeping defence outlays between a range of figures of gross domestic product, but I was talking of percentage growth and I think you were as well. Without making any comments on whether it is good or bad, the simple historical fact is that since 1987 we have had about zero per cent real growth this year. If you do the arithmetic, the difference over the first five years of the program between the program of plus 3 per cent and a program of about zero is indeed the figure you mentioned-$1.7 billion. It depends on the assumptions you make on inflation, but it is of that order. </PARA>
<PARA>Therein lies the crux of the crisis now upon us. The Hawke Government supposedly laid out finite financial parameters for recent, present and future defence spending levels. On that basis, certain major capital equipment projects were entered into or planned and it was expected that a particular force in being could also be effectively maintained. That those financial parameters for defence spending were laid out as stated by General Gration in his evidence is utterly beyond dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The commitment to 3.1 per cent real growth over the five-year defence program is clearly set out on pages 161 and 163 of the Dibb report on Australia's Defence Capabilities of March 1986. Likewise, the additional capital equipment acquisitions that flow from these financial arrangements are laid out on pages 164 to 166 of the Dibb report. These cover every conceivable item, from the light patrol frigates to the over-the-horizon radar. Confirmation of the framework for the five-year defence program is then given on pages 102 and 103 of the subsequent 1987 Defence White Paper. Furthermore, later on at paragraph 9.15 of the White Paper, the Hawke Government makes a commitment to an overall allocation of resources to defence, generally within the order of 2.6 per cent to 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that resource allocation has not in recent years been of this order of magnitude and is currently around 2.3 per cent of GDP. In fact, the highest level defence spending has been at as a proportion of GDP in the last decade was 2.7 per cent in 1982-83, the last year of the Fraser Liberal Government, and 2.7 per cent again in 1985-86 under the present Government. Of special interest in the present perilous circumstances is paragraph 8.4 on page 103 of the 1987 White Paper. Prophetically, it reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The FYDP must take account of changes in the level of Government's financial guidance to defence and differences between this guidance and actual budget allocations. This Government recognises that considerable waste and inefficiency in defence planning is inevitable when unrealistic guidance is given as a planning basis for defence spending. The Government is committed to more realistic financial guidance, for defence planning, although some adjustments will still need to be made when settling annual budgets. </PARA>
<PARA>The Hawke Government, having reneged on its own unequivocal commitments, is now crucified by its own words. What did it expect was going to happen in the 1990s? Had Hawke Labor Ministers expected the coalition to win the Federal election of March 1990 and then, as we moved into this decade, the coalition was to be blamed for the enveloping shambles in defence? Whatever the motivation, as General Gration succinctly pointed out, the reality is that Australia is now faced with a $1.7 billion defence bungle. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, by reneging on its White Paper financial commitments and simultaneously proclaiming a doctrine of self-reliance and expanded defence capital projects, the Hawke Government has propelled the Australian Defence Force into acute crisis. The Federal Labor Government, in the foremost area of its responsibilities to the Australian people-national defence-follows its State counterparts in Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria into a growing Labor litany of political incompetence and financial mismanagement. This disastrous destruction of Australia's defence is now to be dressed up as structural reform by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) in a statement presently scheduled for 6 June. </PARA>
<PARA> It is predicted that the current force structure review will recommend the reduction of the Regular Army by at least 6,000 personnel and Royal Australian Air Force regular manning by well over 4,000. There will be major reductions of both Regular Army and Reserve manpower in all Army commands, especially the training and logistic commands, with a no more than three or four regular battalion structure a likely result. Overall it is expected that the 69,000 strong regular force will be reduced by a hefty 12,000 personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> A so-called ready reserve force is proposed to be raised, initially with a brigade of 3,000 personnel, or possibly more, over the period 1992 to 1995, with considerable confusion existing as to how this will be practically achieved. I will return to this strange proposal later. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally in respect of the Army Reserve, it is expected that Reserve command and staff colleges and officer cadet training units will be restricted to the east coast, the university regiments will be downgraded, one infantry battalion in Queensland and another in New South Wales will be abolished, and supporting arms and services will be reduced. Across the Army at large various schools and training centres are facing closure while all military district headquarters around Australia will be dis-established. Not since the 1930s have the Australian Army and the Air Force faced such debilitating cuts to their operational capabilities and logistic infrastructure. Only the Navy's recent Gulf involvement and the need to man the new submarines, frigates and aircraft, for which commitments have been made have saved the RAN from a similar fate. </PARA>
<PARA> The so-called ready reserve referred to earlier is certainly no answer to these appalling inadequacies. According to an Army signal of 22 February in my possession ready reserves are seen to have the potential to provide a third option for manning appropriate parts of the Australian Defence Force. In fact, the ready reserves are neither fish nor fowl and if implemented will detract from both the existing regular and reserve forces. This is especially so given that the ready reserves are expected to have regular officers but draw on the general resources of the reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> The same signal states that ready Reserves would `undergo full time service for about a year' and then give `six weeks without evening and weekend training and three weeks with some weekend and evening training'. Given the known reluctance of many employers to release employees for Reserve training, especially in the present economic climate, their enthusiasm for a heavier and more jumbled release arrangement is highly questionable. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Hawke Government apparently aims particularly at attracting ex-Regulars and potentially unemployed school leavers to the ready Reserves. However, the record over many years shows that very few ex-regulars move into the Reserves as they are too busily establishing themselves in their new civilian careers. Moreover, as far as the attitude of school leavers to the ready Reserves is concerned, the Government's own ANOP Research Services Pty Ltd survey found that the major reservation many young people had with the concept was concern at the prospect of having to fight. </PARA>
<PARA> It has to be said that the ready Reserve concept does not sound as though it will be all that ready. Nor will this nation be ready for any form of defence contingency unless this accelerating destruction of our Defence Force is halted and reversed forthwith. Not only will Australia lack the balanced and adequate capability to project military power that the Gulf crisis amply demonstrated we still need, but we will become incapable of defending even the mainland. Future generations will curse those responsible for this betrayal of our fundamental ability to sustain our sovereignty as a nation. I seek leave to table the Army signal which I have quoted from during my speech and which the Minister already has in his possession. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA> Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and related Bills seek additional provisions to meet payments for additional services. Expenditures covered include such things as the Gulf war and emergency aid for victims of that ghastly but necessary conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to see that the appropriations include an amount of $12.9m for trade training, of which $10m is for additional pre-vocational course places at technical and further education (TAFE) colleges and $1.8m for out of trade training centres. In my electorate of Hunter, in addition to three TAFE colleges at Maitland, Cessnock and Singleton, we have the Hunter Valley Training Co. Pty Ltd, which operates out of Maitland and spreads throughout New South Wales, training young apprentices and hiring them out where their services are required. </PARA>
<PARA> As at 31 March this year, the Hunter Valley Training Co. had 905 apprentices on its books and trainees under the Australian traineeship scheme had completed their training. Last year, the Federal Government funded the Hunter Valley Training Co. with some $1.3m for group schemes plus craft and off-the-job training. Funding in the 1990-91 financial year so far is $182,500 for apprentices and $15,000 for Australian traineeship scheme participants. Additionally, nearly $776,000 has been allocated for off-the-job training. At a time when job losses are being experienced, we must not lose sight of the fact that we need a skilled work force. We cannot let our skilled people fall by the wayside. That would be to Australia's detriment when recovery commences. Despite the prophets of doom opposite, recovery will commence sooner than they would like. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that it has been the Hawke Government that has introduced a national training scheme. Last November, after more than three years of working towards more consistency in training, the State Ministers accepted the Federal Government's suggestions to develop a national core curriculum for training across the nation and to establish a national framework for national consistency in the recognition of skills and accreditation of training courses, and agreed to review TAFE to ensure it operates in a commercial way and is responsive to industry needs. These decisions will open up the training system to enable it to better meet the nation's needs for new skills. One might ask, when there are so many jobs being lost, why this training is so important. As I said earlier, Australia cannot afford to lose its skilled work force. It will be that skilled work force that will be in such demand and will help turn Australia's economic situation around. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major initiative of the Hawke Labor Government to increase Australia's capacity to compete in the world with a more highly skilled work force is the training guarantee, which came into effect on 1 July 1990. The training guarantee requires businesses with a payroll of more than $200,000 a year to spend one per cent each year on approved training. That amount would rise to 1 1/2 per cent next year, but I believe everyone will recognise that training of the work force is an investment to which all businesses and enterprises should contribute a fair share. The net result of training is increased productivity; and the Government, unions and business recognise the benefits to be gained from an increase in productivity across all sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> An additional $28.7m is required in Appropriation Bill (No.4) for Austudy. This sum is needed to cover the increased number of students in the latter half of 1990 and the increased number of students furthering their education in the first half of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the greatest achievements of the Hawke Labor Government is the number of young people staying on to year 12 to complete their secondary education. The Budget projected that there would be 338,000 secondary students, but this has risen to 353,000 students. The Budget projected that there would be 407,000 students in higher education, but this figure has risen to 422,000 students. As well, covered under other assistance programs there are 44,000 Abstudy students, 9,000 migrant students, 2,000 veterans' dependants and 13,600 isolated children receiving assistance. I wonder whether such worthy schemes would continue if those opposite were given the opportunity to hand more money to the wealthiest members of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government certainly can be proud of its record in education. As a direct result of Labor Government policy, the year 12 school retention rate has risen from a low 32 per cent in 1982 to 64 per cent in 1990. This means-and it has often been quoted-that about two out of every three students go on to complete year 12 these days, whereas under government by those opposite only one student in every three went on to complete secondary school education. </PARA>
<PARA> By 1992 Federal funding for schools will increase by almost $500m in real terms under the Hawke Labor Government. I am sure parents and students out in the community appreciate that fact. More than $2 billion a year is now spent on government and non-government schools, including special needs based programs for disadvantaged schools, disabled students, and hostel accommodation for isolated students. In higher education the Government will soon spend almost $4 billion a year on our nation's universities, and all this funding is being spent wisely. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that this represents an increase of 25 per cent in funding for higher education since 1988, the year preceding the major expansion announced in the Government's White Paper, which is an increase of 42 per cent since 1983. We are spending 42 per cent more on higher education than the conservatives were prepared to spend. They preferred, and this is their judgment, to give pensions to millionaires. Between 1988 and 1993 about 70,000 additional student places will be created for Australian students, which is the equivalent of creating seven new universities. Yes, the Opposition is rightly shamed by the magnitude of this Government's achievements. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable members on the other side that the Australian taxpayers fund our universities and therefore universities should be accountable for their activities to the taxpayers. The Government has ensured that institutional autonomy and academic freedom are protected. Funding of universities has been enhanced through annual funding negotiations between the Commonwealth and individual institutions on broad teaching and research profiles, thereby achieving a more equitable distribution of funds. Research is of vital importance and it is worth noting that funds for research purposes will be 156 per cent higher in real terms in 1993 than they were in 1989, and 247 per cent higher than was the case under the coalition government in 1983. The Opposition knows the need for funding for research, but never provided more than a pittance when it occupied the treasury bench. </PARA>
<PARA> The May 1989 science and technology statement committed the Government to providing increased funds for research infrastructure and postgraduate research awards. Further funds for postgraduate research awards were provided in the 1990-91 Budget. These statements should quell any doubts that research is being downgraded under the new arrangements; the evidence gives the lie to that fear. This Government recognises the value of research and is committed to funding research in our universities. </PARA>
<PARA> I came across some other interesting statistics which indicated that the number of arts students increased by 33 per cent, from only 83,000 in 1980 to 110,000 in 1990, with the most rapid growth being in the bachelor and higher degree levels. I could say a great deal more about education, but I am afraid my time is slipping by rather quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into greater detail about the report brought down by the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training other than to say that I am delighted the Committee has decided to look on the current parental income formula used to assess eligibility for the Austudy allowances. There is no question that that matter needs to be re-examined. </PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid I cannot say much more about such matters; however, I want to speak on matters other than education. I note that in Appropriation Bill (No. 5) $75m is required for natural disaster relief. This amount will bring the Commonwealth allocation to $155m this financial year. Earlier this year widespread flooding occurred particularly in New South Wales and Queensland. Only two weeks ago I attended a meeting of delegates from the flood stricken areas of New South Wales, and it struck me how wildly unpredictable our weather is. There we were in the midst of a drought talking about flood mitigation works, but I agree with the delegation that now is the time to talk about flood mitigation works to prevent disasters such as those which occurred at Nyngan, Dubbo and other parts of New South Wales and north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to see that the figure for New South Wales includes $28m for restoration works in Newcastle following the devastating earthquake of December 1989. Members unfamiliar with the Newcastle area will be delighted to learn that people there have worked courageously and successfully to restore their city's pride and beauty. It is also pleasing to note that this Government has made considerable expenditure outlays towards road works severely damaged by floods, and to help farmers and small business people who are receiving assistance for the restoration of damaged working assets. </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriation Bill (No. 5) also includes an amount of $14m for a higher level of assistance for pharmacy restructuring. I am glad that fight has been resolved and that everything seems to be working fairly harmoniously within the pharmacy industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I had the pleasure of accompanying the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) on a visit to my electorate. The purpose of the Minister's visit was to present plaques to the Returned Services League (RSL) sub-branches in Maitland, Cessnock and Singleton. At each venue the Minister was welcomed by considerable numbers of ex-service men and women. The Minister explained the concept behind the move to make the repatriation general hospitals State based. Although there is some dissension among the RSL movement, Sir William Keys and the overwhelming majority of RSL personnel in my electorate have supported the concept. I think the leaders of the RSL movement need to come out to country areas and see what the membership thinks. After the Minister had explained the situation fully to the people whom he addressed, there was general support for what he was proposing. </PARA>
<PARA> Other matters regarding the Veterans' Affairs portfolio were addressed by the Minister. I am pleased to say that most of the veterans and returned service personnel in my electorate are most satisfied with the way in which the Minister is trying to benefit them. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted that the Singleton army base in my electorate has been so well treated. I am very pleased about the close liaison and friendship that I have developed with so many defence personnel in the Hunter Valley. Mr Deputy Speaker, the time available to me has gone too quickly. </PARA>

<PARA> The Budget was brought down on 21 August last year and in the short time that has elapsed Australia has gone into deepening economic crisis. That deepening economic crisis has meant that most of the fundamental economic assumptions underlying the Budget and the Budget strategy have changed significantly. Yet, the Government seems paralysed, unable to come to grips with the changing, deteriorating state of the Australian economy and unable to show any leadership to the Australian people who are suffering so badly at the current time. </PARA>
<PARA> We have in rural Australia a crisis as severe as we have ever seen-a collapse in prices in wheat; a collapse in prices in wool. This feeds into country service centres where people who service rural producers are no longer able to make good incomes. We are seeing a basic wind-down in rural infrastructure. The mood in rural Australia at the moment is one of desperation. And rural Australia looks to this Parliament, it looks to this Government and it finds no answers. </PARA>
<PARA> We see this crisis in rates of bankruptcy. When the most recent bankruptcy statistics were released-those that went to March 1991-we found that the increase in bankruptcies to March 1991 on March 1990 throughout Australia as a whole was 52 per cent. That increase of 52 per cent of the March 1991 quarter over the March 1990 quarter did not come off a low base. It came off a base that was already up to record highs. Yet, there has been a wave of bankruptcy which has gone through the Australian community.-Bankruptcy is the very last step taken by a person who is in desperate financial circumstances. It is a step that people take when they cannot pay the money that they owe to creditors. Significantly, they put most of their personal assets on the line. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been pressing the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to provide figures in relation to company liquidations. He is unable to do so. But if we were able to look at company liquidations, we would see a similar story. Company liquidations are a measure of the financial crisis that is confronting small and medium sized business in Australia at this very time. The ANZ Bank's annual report shows that a large provision had been made for bad debts. The chairman who brought down that report made it clear that many of those bad debts were in the small and medium sized sector of the Australian economy. Yes, we have heard about the major corporate collapses-the collapses of the big corporate conglomerates. But as was pointed out in that report, a surge of liquidation has gone through small and medium sized business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, in that respect, the chairman of the ANZ Bank referred to a shopping precinct in my electorate, namely High Street, Armadale, once the premier speciality shop area in the city of Melbourne and now devastated because of harsh financial times and depressed consumer sentiment. It is suffering the double whammy of not only the Federal Labor Government but also the disgraced and discredited Victorian Labor Government. If one were to walk up that shopping centre at the moment one would see empty shops, not because the proprietors in those shopping centres have behaved irrationally or intemperately but because they were victims of a deliberate government strategy to wind up interest rates and depress consumer demand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has sent surging through the Australian economy, as a result of his interest policy, a wave of bankruptcy, a wave of forced business sales and a wave of company liquidation in what rates as one of the worst recessions that Australia has ever had. This Government has hung out to dry the small and medium sized business sector in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, in its defence the Government says that as a result of this high interest rate policy, as a result of this determination to dampen consumer demand, we are starting to see some good effects-a wind back in the rate of inflation, a wind back in the balance of payments. The balance of payments figure that came out this week showed a loss of only $1.2 billion. A great improvement! For that month we showed a loss of only $1.2 billion. It is a mark of how bad things are in Australia when we now welcome a loss for one month of $1.2 billion as a great result which is consistent with the Treasurer's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though that result showed that there was now a surplus in merchandise trade, what is driving the current account into deficit month on month, year on year, is the accumulating foreign debt that we owe. And month on month, year on year, Australia must service that debt. Even if Australia breaks even on its monthly trading account, the money it sends out to service past debts drives that current account into deficit and that deficit on the current account drives that debt higher. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 net foreign debt stood at about $23 billion or 13.7 per cent of gross domestic product. By 1990 it had risen to $126 billion or about 34.3 per cent of GDP-about a threefold increase in the percentage of GDP over the term of the Hawke Labor Governments. As a result of that, each month Australia has to service past debts, which takes away from its current trading position. </PARA>
<PARA> This country is in a debt trap. The situation is akin to a householder who, unable to pay the interest component on his mortgage, adds the interest to capital. The capital continues to rise, the cost of servicing continues to rise and month after month the debt increases as past servicing costs are not met and future servicing costs are increased. A householder in a debt trap eventually loses the house. A nation in a debt trap eventually loses control of its own domestic economic policy. This is the crisis that will confront Australia unless strong and decisive measures are taken to reverse it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly regrettable that we are now seeing the effects of the Government's economic policy flow on into the labour market-an unemployment rate of 9 per cent which will probably shortly go to 10 per cent; and youth unemployment at record levels. The official rate of youth unemployment-that is, people under 20 years of age looking for full time work in Australia-is around 25 per cent. That means that one in four young Australians is unable to get a job. But if we extract figures out and produce a real rate, that is, adding back job losers who did not become listed as unemployed and who otherwise disappear from labour force estimates, we find it is as high as 35 per cent and in the city of Melbourne it is 45 per cent. In other words, nearly one in two young people under 20 is unable to get full time employment. These figures are of crisis proportions. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Treasurer introduced his Budget Bills, the Appropriation Bills Nos 1, 2 and 3, on 21 August 1990, he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia has negotiated a difficult transition over the past 12 months-from an economy where spending and growth were overblown to an economy with lower activity and fewer imports. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight I am able to report-</PARA>
<PARA>said the Treasurer-</PARA>
<PARA>that we are emerging from this phase in fundamentally better shape having succeeded in this transition. </PARA>
<PARA>Some transition; some success! He went on to say, on 21 August 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>Economic policy has worked and is working. </PARA>
<PARA>The faith the Australian people exhibited in the Government at the election is now being repaid as the economy adjusts to a sustainable rate of growth without a catastrophic collapse. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course we have no real growth in Australia at the moment; we do have a collapse. Then the Treasurer boasted:</PARA>
<PARA>This year inflation will fall further, the current account deficit will markedly improve and employment will pick up. </PARA>
<PARA>On 21 August 1990, `employment will pick up'. Look at the unemployment rates in the meantime. We are nearly eight months into this financial year, and employment is not picking up. The Treasurer boasted:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . in short, the kind of outcome the Government was seeking, delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession. </PARA>
<PARA>This was delivered with the misery and the despair of high unemployment and a savage recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer stands condemned by his own words and the people of Australia want to know how did he get it so wrong; how did the Treasurer, with all of the vast resources that he had in the Treasury Department and all of his wisdom, stand up on 21 August 1990 and get it so wrong? How is it that Australians have had to pay for the errors that the Treasurer has forced upon them with his economic policy?</PARA>
<PARA> In Australia we have had a serious level of corporate collapse. Some of that corporate collapse has involved straight-out, old-fashioned fraud, and whilst that was going on, this Government was turning a blind eye. When I hear in this Parliament of the 15 June 1987 fundraising lunch with Premier Burke, Mr Roberts of Multiplex, Laurie Connell, Alan Bond and Mr Dempster, I do not think that Mr Burke was at that fundraising lunch lecturing on the need for high corporate standards in Australia. He was not there on 15 June telling those people that what we needed to avoid in the Australian economy was warehousing, exorbitant management fees, high debt in companies and explosive gearing. He was there courting those people, giving an imprimatur to those kinds of activities and a kind of activity that has been very destructive in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course we see a level of financial collapse which is very disastrous throughout much of southern Australia. Not only do we have the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters looking into corporations that were involved in questionable deals, but also in South Australia we have an investigation into how the State Bank in that State there managed to lose-what was it-$700m or $800m. In Victoria we have a royal commission trying to look at how the State Bank of Victoria was wiped out by the operations of the Tricontinental corporation, which was a merchant banking arm government owned through the State Bank. And, of course, in Victoria it was not just Tricontinental; there was also the OST Friendly Society that went down and the Pyramid Building Society, which figured in a level of financial collapse that we probably have not seen since the 1890s. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things I regret is that the term `entrepreneur' now has nasty connotations in Australia because it came to be applied to those people who, during the bull run on the stock market in the 1980s, geared companies with gay abandon for shareholders and creditors. As a result, the word `entrepreneur' is tarnished. But what we need in Australia is more entrepreneurs, honest entrepreneurs-people who are prepared to take their savings and invest them in a business, create a job, sell a product and get this economy moving again. Until we have an environment in which people feel that they can go out and look after themselves and create a job for somebody else, we are not going to do anything to get this economy moving. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we do with people who want to go out and look after themselves and create a job and create a product? We charge them rates; we levy charges; we impose sales tax on their products. They pay workers compensation premiums. If they get big, they pay payroll tax. They take income tax out of their employees' wages for the Australian Taxation Office. They pay fringe benefits tax to the Taxation Office if their employees have fringe benefits. If they make any money, they pay income tax. If they sell off their business, they have their capital gains taxed. If they have employees, they take 3 per cent out of their wages for superannuation, and now another one per cent will be taken out for a training levy. I often wonder how it is that we have people in Australia who are brave enough to go out and create jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government seems to think that employers are just the goose that will continue to lay the golden egg, that it can just keep piling obligation after obligation onto the employment relationship for whatever goals it happens to have at this particular time, and that somehow these businesses will just continue to function and continue to provide jobs and maybe make a profit at the end of the day. The Government cannot do it. It cannot ask people to assume all of those social obligations, to assume all of those economic penalties, to look after themselves, and at the same time to make a profit and create employment. What we need to do in this Parliament is rediscover the real entrepreneur; we need to rediscover where wealth is created in the community; we need to think a little bit more about creating wealth before we think about spending it. </PARA>
<PARA> I heard the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), say how the Government had spent this and the Government had spent that and that it was great that this Government had spent so much money. This was not the Government's money. The Government did not manufacture it; it did not earn it. What the Government did was tax people who were out there making it and earning it. If there is nobody out there making it and earning it, the Government is not going to be taxing it; and if it is not taxing it, it is not going to be spending it. </PARA>
<PARA> There ought to be a general reassessment on the Government side of the House as to where the wealth, the jobs, the profits, the investments, the products and the recovery are going to come from in Australia over the next 12 months. This is a Government marked by absolute complacency, a Government that is complacent in all of its dealings, a Government that has lost sight and really lost hope-lost hope about doing anything in relation to getting that productive environment in Australia going. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) this afternoon talking about how it was necessary if waterside workers were going to accept detrimental changes in their conditions that they be rewarded for doing so. Nobody could dispute the proposition that employees ought to be rewarded for work. I think what the Government has forgotten is that it is not the waterside workers, with whom it seems to be obsessed at the moment; it is the wage and salary earners right throughout Australia who need some kind of incentive to produce more and to work harder. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no way in Australia at the moment that, if one is covered by an award, works hard and works more productively, one will get a pay increase. The way one gets a pay increase under an award is that Bill Kelty sits in the Cabinet room with Paul Keating and they work out an accord mark 6, 7, 8, 9, 9B, 9C, 9D or whatever it is going to be. Then one might get a pay increase. But one does not get a pay increase aside from that if one happens to be working well or more productively down in the enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have to get down in the enterprise is some kind of reward for effort. Personally, I am and always have been a great believer in employee share ownership plans, plans by which employees have a direct stake in the enterprise so that they know that their efforts, if they produce profitability, will come back to them in increased remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA> That would be one of the ways in which you could get some incentive for wage and salary earners back at the enterprise level. But the deal that this Government has in mind, negotiating macro wages policy with Bill Kelty in the Cabinet room-whether it is sanctioned by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission or not-is never going to produce that kind of enterprise, incentive or reward for the wage and salary earners of Australia. We have to direct our thinking to the wage and salary earners of Australia, to the entrepreneurs, to the small and the medium business sector. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to give those people an incentive to lead Australia back into recovery. One of the best things that this Parliament could do for a recovery in Australia is to vote out the Government. This Government is tired and complacent with a leadership that is defeated and divided as it looks to the next election, wondering whether it will go with Keating or with Hawke, with both of them, or with neither. This Government is paralysed by ongoing scandal. It is a Government which has lost the capacity to have strong and decisive leadership. This Government wasted time and in time it will be wasted. The people of Australia are looking for leadership. Unless they are given that leadership, and given it shortly, Australia will be very much the poorer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. He gets rolled on a number of issues. I would like to speak on a number of aspects in relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91, Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1990-91, and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1990-91 which are before the House. It gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak in support of Appropriation Bills (No. 4) and (No. 5) with the common theme that they encompass, that of ongoing dedication to the initiatives which matter most to Australian families. These are the people issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The people of Australia today need to be assured that the Government is giving more than just tacit support to the reforms and measures they read about in the daily paper. They need to know that the much needed restructuring of the country's pharmacies, for instance, is going to ensure that they have access to the medication that their families need when they need it. In these Bills, $14m is provided for a higher level of assistance for pharmacy restructuring. The assurance of access to needed medication was ratified on 6 December 1990 in an historic agreement between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia on a revised remuneration package and a restructuring of the retail pharmacy industry. This agreement saw the establishment of the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority to oversee the smooth reorganisation of pharmacy outlets and to ensure that ready access to needed medication was maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Under that restructuring, costs are to be shared between the Government and approved pharmacists. With the agreement ending differences between the Government and pharmacists, there came to the pharmaceutical supply area a new era of stability and cooperation, to the significant benefit of consumers, which is of course very important. </PARA>
<PARA> Users of pharmaceuticals also benefited through revised remuneration arrangements: a reduction in the mark-up of drugs from 25 per cent to 10 per cent; reductions in the average cost margin, that is, the mark-up plus the fee, from $4.63 to $4.25; fees to be frozen for 18 months, after which time the fee would be indexed every six months by movements in award wages and the consumer price index, and a commitment by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to review remuneration by 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to any closures, I believe it needs to be emphasised that all closures or amalgamations of pharmacies are purely voluntary and that assistance is available to those eligible pharmacists who apply to the Authority. Eligibility is to be determined by the restructuring authority with the bottom line requirement being that no pharmacy that is deemed to be an essential pharmacy will be allowed to close to the detriment of people residing in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot stress this point strongly enough in light of the shameful scaremongering by some members of the Opposition which only serves to undermine the constructive reform measures that have been achieved to date. One only needs to look at the figures which document the success of these reforms to see how far off the mark the claims by these members of the Opposition really are. </PARA>
<PARA> Up to the end of March, 456 applications had been received for financial assistance towards the cancellation of approvals to supply benefits where pharmacists had chosen to close. There were 97 applications for the amalgamation of two or more pharmacies. This response from the retail pharmacy industry confirms the original judgment of the Guild and the Government in relation to the number of pharmacies operating at a less than efficient level.</PARA>
<PARA> Quite contrary to the claims of some members of the Opposition, the Government is genuinely concerned for those people living in remote areas with regard to their access to medical supplies. The payment of an essential pharmacy allowance has been specifically designed to achieve this. To the end of March, 226 pharmacies had also lodged applications for the essential pharmacy allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> Aside from those in need of medication, there is the other side of pharmacy closures-that of the staff currently employed in pharmacies earmarked for closure or amalgamation. Therefore provision is specifically made in the agreement with the pharmacists for packages to be made available to affected staff. In fact, the payment of financial assistance to a pharmacist who chooses to close or amalgamate is conditional upon the pharmacist agreeing to provide redundancy packages to affected staff. </PARA>
<PARA> One final point I wish to raise regarding the baseless claims of these uninformed members of the Opposition is that the Government has no control over pharmacy trading in isolated areas. It cannot compel people to trade and it cannot prevent the unassisted closure of essential pharmacies. The Government can work with pharmacists in a constructive way to ensure a guaranteed supply of pharmaceuticals to all Australians. The information I have provided shows that the Government is doing just that. </PARA>
<PARA> Parents need to know, when it comes to their children wanting to further their practical skills to enhance career prospects, that they will not be limited by a shortage of places. Through this legislation a further $12.9m is proposed for trade training, of which $10m is for additional prevocational course places at technical and further education (TAFE) colleges, and $1.8m for out-of-trade training centres. </PARA>
<PARA> Reflecting the Government's desire to have a well-skilled work force in a wide range of areas, it is proposed that this money be spent in a broad range of practical skills areas. One measure, that of assistance for employers to retain apprentices who are vulnerable to dismissal, is scheduled to commence in 1991-92 at an expected cost of $1.6m. Our proud commitment to practical skills training continues. There is an additional $0.6m in 1990-91 and $1.2m in 1991-92 to assist unemployed apprentices and trainees complete their theoretical training in TAFE. There is an additional $1.8m in 1990-91 and $7.2m in 1991-92 to assist unemployed apprentices complete both theoretical and practical aspects of their training at non-TAFE centres. There is an additional $0.5m in 1990-91 and $1.65m in 1991-92 to encourage employers to engage unemployed apprentices and trainees. There is an additional $10m in 1990-91 and $40m in 1991-92 for the provision of prevocational training places in TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's emphasis on skills-based training to ensure Australia has the best prepared work force for our future is something which is bringing success across the country. I pay particular tribute here to the work of the practical skills outlets in my electorate of Oxley. Great success has been achieved in practical courses conducted jointly between the Ipswich TAFE and the local Skillshare funded unit, YUPI, which stands for young unemployed people of Ipswich. It is pronounced differently by different people. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of these courses include a successful catering outlet, which they have actually called Tuckerbox, and a fibreglassing course which produces canoes which are, in turn, hired out at Lake Wivenhoe, which is a large dam north of Ipswich. Money is raised from the courses they run from these ventures on Lake Wivenhoe. It is a very successful venture indeed, and it certainly gives the young people a lot to do. As well they learn a lot of new skills. Reflecting this success was the recent announcement at YUPI's annual general meeting that in its first three years of operation the unit's annual turnover has more than quadrupled to over $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> In another part of my electorate of Oxley, recently I presented certificates to graduates of a storeman's course conducted through a Goodna unit funded via Skillshare. Importantly, the job placement rate on completion of courses is in the range of 80 to 90 per cent in most instances, which is a testament to the fact that the Government's push for practical skills training is the necessary ingredient for preparing Australia for long term stability in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> With such success, it is surprising then that recent comments by Senator Michael Baume appear to go quite against this thrust. As our youth leave school and are deciding their career paths, it is stable and relevant practical training that will best prepare them for the years ahead. I find the honourable senator's suggestion that the best way to achieve this is to reduce wages for young workers so that more people can be employed a rather draconian step that takes working conditions back to the coalmining days of over 100 years ago-and we heard plenty over the last weekend, which was our traditional Labor Day Celebration, of what the trade union movement has done over the last 100 years. For a start, if there are more workers, the amount of time that can be spent on each one is less and the standard of tuition suffers. </PARA>
<PARA> This is aside from the issue of wages and conditions people should have to work under. That this issue has been raised in the centenary year of the Australian Labor Party is very timely, for at a time when we are reflecting on the achievements that have been won by the union movement in Australia in the last 100 years it is repressive to suggest that those basic rights be taken away and sweatshop conditions be put in their place, as suggested by the industrial relations proposal of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to another phase of continuing education, reflecting the Government's desire to increase accessibility to Austudy for those students wishing to further their education, the legislation before us seeks to provide an additional $28.7m for Austudy, reflecting increased numbers of recipients in the latter half of 1990 together with an anticipated increase in the first half of 1991. The Austudy program has been very successful since its commencement in 1987. It is expected that over 350,000 students and their families will receive assistance in 1990-91. This represents a 9.5 per cent increase over the previous year, with the money provided for Austudy in this Bill catering for this higher than expected increase in the number of students receiving assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in the number of beneficiaries has been caused by a number of factors, including higher than expected enrolments in the tertiary education sector; higher retention rates for years 11 and 12; improved marketing and information materials leading to increasing numbers of eligible secondary students applying under the scheme; increased program recognition-a recent survey by the Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls Pty Ltd found that Austudy has the highest level of recognition amongst 15-to 24-year-olds of all government programs directed at youth. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst speaking on Austudy, I would like to add my support to some comments mentioned earlier by honourable members in relation to the recent report on Austudy by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, because it is an outstanding report and a credit to those members on the Committee, and certainly the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), who chaired the Committee. These achievements in education in a practical and tuition sense clearly show which side of politics has the people side of decisions in mind when planning an education framework. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier today, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) introduced some Bills in the House, and I now turn to that question. To prepare Australia for the overhaul of our telecommunications framework and to ensure that the subscribers to telephone services are provided with the smoothest possible transition to the new system, there is provision in this legislation for $25m for the Government to purchase Telecom's equity in Aussat Pty Ltd. While the parts of this Bill that relate to the Government's decision to purchase Telecom's 25 per cent shareholding in Aussat following the decision to sell Aussat together with the second network carrier licence are essentially mechanical ones, there is behind this a genuine concern that consumers of telecommunications services be given enhanced services with the greatest expediency and efficiency. One only needs to look at the standard adopted by the Australian Labor Party in relation to tele- communications at the special national conference last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Encompassing those principles, this Government is committed to providing universal access to telecommunications services across Australia. The Government considers that, further to this, services should be provided efficiently and at the lowest possible cost to consumers with quality of service and in a manner consistent with the early introduction of new technologies. Telecommunications is very much a people issue. Elderly people who live on their own rely on telephones for conversation, keeping in contact with their friends and relatives, or simply for peace of mind to know that it is there in times of need. Similarly, telecommunications allow people who are isolated to obtain information. It gives them an avenue for social interaction; it keeps them in touch. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate of Oxley, there are people who are less than 150 kilometres from the State capital of Brisbane; yet had they not ready access to a telephone, they may as well be 1,050 kilometres away. These people are sometimes the last surviving descendants of a family who settled in the area more than 100 years ago and it becomes an issue of family pride for them to remain in their homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year, there was the same dependence on efficient telecommunications services when flash flooding in the south-east corner of Queensland meant that people living in the Brisbane Valley area and surrounds were temporarily cut off from Ipswich, the nearest large city. I am grateful that these residents were subject to flooding only for a matter of days and not weeks, as was the case with some of the more severe flooding that occurred in other parts of Queensland and New South Wales. In any case, for these people the provision of basic telecommunications services is not a luxury but a necessity. I am pleased to speak on legislation which relates to part of the restructuring which will ultimately see a much improved telecommunications network in Australia with ensured access to the services people need. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is extremely mindful of the lessons learned from overseas experience in telecommunications reform and has specifically ensured that consumers will not be disadvantaged through the guarantee of community service obligations, particularly to rural and regional areas and, of course, to pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Another facet of the telecommunications restructuring that will bolster the provision of services for all Australians and prevent a deterioration in access to telecommunications services is the Government's intention to maintain Telecom in full public ownership. In addition, should it become necessary to sell either in part or in full, or merge any other facilities to develop an effective competitive framework, the Government will do so. It is the Government's view that the maximum possible Australian involvement in the telecommunications industry should be strived for so as to further develop the industry locally. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end the Government is pleased with the positive views of overseas interests and will seek firm commercial proposals by bidders for Australian ownership arrangements and levels, and will subsequently negotiate appropriate binding commitments with the selected licensees. This will allow the Government's firm commitment to ultimate majority ownership within five years to be achieved on a commercially realistic basis. On interconnect arrangements between Telecom-OTC and the second carrier, Austel will be asked to determine initial prices by mid-June 1991, prior to bidders submitting proposals. This allows bidders to develop more realistic business plans and submit firm bids. Austel is also examining technical arrangements for customers to choose equally between the two carriers and will advise further on revised regulatory provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> So as not to inhibit Telecom in the new environment, the Government will be removing from Telecom any government imposed constraints which may limit its ability to respond effectively to competition and which do not serve the broader national interest. With regard to the second new carrier, the Government announced recently that detailed proposals from interested parties were being sought to establish a second telecommunications carrier based on the purchase of Aussat. Again, the people side of telecommunications reform is reflected in the Gov- ernment's continued consideration of appropriate commercial arrangements to ensure maximum benefit for service users. Bidders will be asked to show how their proposals will lead to development opportunities for Australian industry, particularly in areas such as export, research and development for Australian manufacture. </PARA>
<PARA> Consumers of telecommunications services are to be further protected through the encouragement of future competition. This is exemplified in the Government's requirement that, where the second carrier's licence will require it to continue providing existing Aussat services such as remote area broadcasting, defence, Civil Aviation Authority and pay television, this will be on a commercial basis with charges reflecting the full cost of service provision. The second carrier will also be required to honour Aussat's contractual obligations to provide these services, with charges being subject to Austel arbitration where necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also concerned for Australia's former service men and women and their families, as is reflected in the $41.3m set aside for the increased demand and fee increases for non-departmental hospital care for veterans, together with the increased costs in veterans' medical services. This money will specifically be spent on payments for veterans' medical services, reflecting the Government's recognition of an increase in demand for services, and $14.5m in payments is for patients in non-departmental institutions due mainly to increased demand and increased charges in public and private hospitals. These are the people who have given so much in their time of service and stood alone, along with many of their mates who gave the ultimate sacrifice. </PARA>
<PARA> The ones who did not return were recently remembered at the Anzac Day services across Australia. I place on record once again my thanks for the efforts made by our defence service men and women in the years gone by and, of course, by our existing Defence Force as well. As was reflected in our recent involvement in the hostilities in the Middle East, the Australian defence forces are a strong unit of which we can all be proud. It is only fitting, therefore, that for their contribution to Australia they be cared for adequately at their time of need. Through the provisions of moneys such as those proposed in this Bill this is being achieved. This commitment builds on many of the initiatives for veterans put in place by this Government since coming to office in 1983. A whole range of these issues have been covered previously. </PARA>
<PARA> The areas I have covered tonight are but some of those for which funding is provided in these Appropriation Bills. We see that common caring for the people implicated by decisions is at the heart of all the Government's initiatives. In today's complex society, it is so often the figures that take prominence in decisions. Yet it is the view of the Government that people are the most important part of decisions. Whether it be ensuring the supply of pharmaceuticals, providing a stable education environment to provide for a solid future, making sure new technologies are adapted with minimum disruption to users or caring for those citizens in need, this Government is intent on making the people the first priority when making decisions. </PARA>

<PARA> Before starting it is worthwhile saying a few words about the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott). He wanted to rake up one of the old Australian Labor Party hardy annuals about sweatshops. If ever one wants to put an indictment on the Australian people who vote, start telling them that they have a chance of being returned to sweatshops. That says that they do not have one ounce of intelligence between them. I do not have much to say for the voters of the electorate of Oxley, because somehow or other they managed to elect the member for bogong moths. Nevertheless, I guess some of them there know what is going on. If they had a little more intelligence they would have elected someone a bit smarter, and there would be no way in the world they would accept a sweatshop environment. By international standards, we have a highly educated community. They will not buy it, and they do not have to. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition parties are talking about giving those people a fair go. Is it not funny that the best paid manual workers in Australia are in places that do not have trade union representation? There used to be a time when trade union leaders were trade union leaders. They came up from the shop floor. Today they have all come straight from university. They have never done a day's work in their life. We have a line-up of them on the other side; I have called on them before. The honourable member for Oxley might not like this but I ask him whether he has ever done any manual work for a living. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is one of the few. Nearly every honourable member opposite with a trade union background has never got one bit of grease under his fingernails. The reality is that they are trade union bureaucrats. Most of them are much more interested in their jobs than in the welfare of the people they are supposed to represent. The other night Bill Kelty told the collective trade unionists, `If we let the Industrial Relations Commission get away with this, we will lose all our power'. He used the word `power', and that is their problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Lincoln Electrics has been operating successfully in Australia for 70 years. It is a successful competitor on Middle East markets and in other parts of the world. What do we find here? There are no trade unions, but a business deal where the workers get 25 per cent of the pre-tax profits. They do not need Bill Kelty to hold their hand when they deal with the boss for the simple reason that they know about the 25 per cent. They do not have to change the 25 per cent in the Industrial Relations Commission every year. The harder they work, the more they improve the profits, the more money they get. They do not want the second cousin, first removed, of the honourable member for Oxley as a safety officer with a featherbedded job. They do not want him because they are not prepared to share the cake with him. They are prepared to share it only with productive workers. </PARA>
<PARA> For a long time, until Mr Goss got into power in Queensland, the workers at Power Brewing had a pretty good deal too. They were earning an extra $60 or $70 a week over and above the award. But that did not suit the mob opposite; it did not suit Mr Goss, who of course has 60 per cent of his preselection judged by trade unionists. We know that that is the way the Labor Party is structured. Not one of those opposite would be here without having suckholed up to the trade union movement. It has them where it wants them, but that is the problem of those opposite. Those opposite are so busy looking after the bureaucracy and the power of the trade union movement that they forget about the little people. </PARA>
<PARA> The first group of people that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) looked after were some of the elite of the industrial relations system-the wharfies. He got an increase for the best paid but he does not really know how to get something for the least paid. If anybody wants to be a wharfie and benefit in that wonderful pay scale, he can try but he will not get in. The unemployed cannot take their turn and get a little bit; it is a totally closed shop, a privileged elite. That is what the honourable member for Oxley is arguing for. And he talks about sweatshops. He would not know what one was. There is no need for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policy says, `Let people get some spending power back. Let them get it through productivity agreements and bonuses'. That is what we are talking about. The best thing that the honourable member can do for his wife and all the other women that go shopping in his electorate is get down the price of the goods that they buy at the supermarkets. Ninety per cent are manufactured by Australian workers. Every time those opposite jack up their wages without appropriate productivity improvements, the only beneficiary is the tax man, who gets his. All that those opposite want to do is boost wages to boost government tax revenue but they leave Mrs Brown with less buying power at the supermarket every time they do it. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite talk about sweat shops and this and that. The only people who have a genuine concern for individual Australian workers are the people on this side of the House. We want them to have more money. We know the only way they will get it is through productivity-not by borrowing $100 billion from the rest of the world to create another 1.5 million jobs, which are now all disappearing because those opposite cannot afford to borrow any more money. This Government has never created a real job. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in my opening remarks, I want to talk about State finances. This legislation sends more money to the States. Two States in particular, Victoria and Western Australia, have thrown away billions on bad and corrupt business deals. We have been hearing about it with the WA Inc. royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I take honourable members back to some remarks I made in this Parliament some time ago. It became quite traumatic for me. Having criticised one of the WA Inc. players, Robert Holmes a Court, who was the first to get his very sophisticated, highfalutin snout in the trough, I saw one of the creeps of the Western Australian Labor Party, Norm Marlborough, attack my son and put his job opportunity and future at risk. He made scandalous remarks about my son being caught stealing software. When I asked this blockhead Marlborough, who has been a trade unionist and has followed that path into the Western Australian State Parliament, on radio what software was, he could not tell me. Under parliamentary privilege he was prepared to accuse someone of stealing something, but he did not know what it was. Of course, he was fed that information by the Holmes a Court family. An announcement was made on about page 10 of the West Australian the other day. Those opposite do not want too much said about it. The State Government Insurance Commission has now lost every cent of value of $150m worth of Bell bonds that it purchased in that outrageous deal it did to save the Holmes a Court family fortune. </PARA>
<PARA> Every penny has now gone. The bonds are worthless, as they were on the day they were purchased. But here was the State Government Insurance Commission, with $64m worth of assets, sitting down with the Labor Party's biggest WA Inc. donor, Robert Holmes a Court, finding $800m to buy the assets that he had to sell because he was flat broke. He had ramped up the value of everything until the share market crashed, he had no cash flow and he needed money desperately.</PARA>
<PARA> Because the chairman at the time- Wyvern, or Ollie, Rees-has lied continually to the Australian public and lied two days before the Auditor-General over there eventually came out with the actual documentation to prove his lies, we do not know how much the State Government Insurance Commission has lost on its other deals, namely, the $250m worth of BHP shares and the property it purchased. However, we know the loss on the Bell bonds must be about $230m, if we apply 15 per cent compound interest for the three-year period that they have gradually gone from their purchase price to nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say in this Parliament again that that very wealthy lady and widow of the late Robert Holmes a Court, Mrs Janet Holmes a Court, can still give the money back. She is out there swanning around as one of the richest women in Australia, getting her name in magazines and the paper every day, and it is to their shame that they give her the credibility that they do. Every penny that she has she owes to the Western Australian taxpayers, to people whose kids cannot get proper places in schools and to elderly people who cannot get proper treatment in hospitals because the Western Australian Government has not got any money. </PARA>
<PARA> It is noticeable that today one can drive around Perth and find that at nearly every second set of traffic lights one stops at some of the lights are not burning. The Government has not got enough money to keep up those safety features in Western Australia. That is because billions have been sucked out of the system by the WA Inc. players, with the concurrence of successive Labor Premiers, including the present one. It is an outrageous situation. </PARA>

He said, `Isn't it dreadful to have these people using the privilege of the Royal Commission to say scurrilous things about poor old David?'.

Every time one gets a bit close to some of the players, it is old Norm who gets up and starts to go crook and use scurrilous attacks on one's kids. I know a bit about him, too. He was in the trade union movement in the Pilbara. Every employer there has marked up his file `never to be re-employed'. I will tell honourable members the reason why. When there was industrial trouble and someone wanted to fix it in a hurry, he would go and see Norm and sling him a few dollars. It did not cost very much; he was such a meagre and horrible person. One could buy him off. I wonder whether he should be called before the Royal Commission, because one wonders what backhanders he has been taking. If he has not, it appears that he is the only one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should not get into this, otherwise I will blame him as well. Does he want to defend these people? Those opposite have been carting money over here in chaff bags to help their election campaigns. I do not know, but I assume the honourable member did not get any. He is one of the few that did not. When we look at the list we see all the money that was dragged out of people. I say `dragged out of people'. The rule was very clear under Brian Burke in Western Australia: if one did business with government, one had better sling to the Labor Party. I have got letters on file. Consultants who had been dealing with government departments for years wrote to me during that time complaining that they had been given that sort of treatment: donate or else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, there is an involvement for this Federal Government, because a substantial amount of its 1987 election campaign was funded from the Burke grants. The Prime Minister has stood up in this place and has said, `I sat down with four of the biggest scallywags in Western Australia'. I know them all; they are good blokes. I drink with them and I would trust their word ahead of the Prime Minister's. However, the Prime Minister sat down with them for lunch. It was a good team. There were two reformed drunks, both of whom are punters. For the information of the House, Brian Burke made his living, before entering parliament, selling tips at the races. That is his background-when he was sober enough to work it out. All of a sudden this person sits down with the Prime Minister and four entrepreneurs and they wanted to know about gold tax. And the Prime Minister tells us that they never raised the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell this Parliament something: those four businessmen are also known to have a bet. When they have a bet, they bet with the bookies. I will tell honourable members why they bet with the bookies: they want to see the price; they want to know what value they are getting for their money. The Prime Minister comes into this place and says, `I never raised the subject of the gold tax; trust me on that'. Those blokes would not have let him out of the room with a million bucks if they thought they had not got a promise. In fact, it was not a million; it was $950,000, because one present, John Roberts, said, `I shouldn't have to donate the full quarter of a million. I haven't got any gold interests'. And they did not talk about gold, they did not talk about money! They would not have talked about anything else. It is a scandal and it is a shame, because the big losers are those people I started talking about-the little people. </PARA>
<PARA> A thousand million dollars have been lost in Western Australia, and possibly it will be more by the time we get to the end of it. We have situations where thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars were being accounted for on the back of an envelope, but the envelope has now been conveniently lost, and memories seem to improve one day and disappear the next. That is just a simple fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me also refer to the infamous fishing trip. I do not know why the Prime Minister feels it is necessary to distance himself from Laurie Connell, but any suggestion that a Prime Minister goes out on a fishing boat, miles from shore, and does not know who is going to be on the boat is ridiculous. He would want to know for social reasons; he would want to know for security reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day I asked the Prime Minister whether he had contacted Laurie Connell before that particular trip and I mentioned Wardleys Bank in Perth. While Laurie Connell was there on about 17 June-I cannot remember the date exactly, but it is diarised-at a special meeting, during that meeting he was called out, against his instructions, to take a phone call. I know that Connell was being urged to attend that fishing trip, either by the Prime Minister or the Premier of Western Australia on the Prime Minister's instructions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time the Prime Minister came clean on these issues. They are not fundamental to the case; they just demonstrate his total lack of credibility on this issue. It is all right for the Leader of the House to get up today and try to throw some mud at Nick Greiner and others. There is a simple difference: when Nick Greiner was first asked whether he received corporate funding he answered, `Absolutely'. There was no beating about the bush, as the Prime Minister and others have done. He admitted it. Furthermore, I can bet that the money that was donated, whether at his request or someone else's, went into a bank account, not a manila envelope. This is the outrageous situation that we have here. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat, because my time is running out, that the thing I am most concerned about is getting Mrs Janet Holmes a Court to give back the money that her husband robbed from the people of Western Australia, because he was the biggest donor to the Australian Labor Party and he could get the deal of a lifetime with valueless bonds and other items that were severely overvalued. I noted the other day that Mrs Holmes a Court is using some of those ill-gotten gains to buy Bell Freightlines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Arts, Tourism and Territories. There are some things which do not change in regard to the way this House conducts its business. Often those matters are best ignored, but later on I will pick up on some of the points that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) made early in his speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my speech back in 1986 I touched on six themes, which I want to revisit in my speech tonight. One of my colleagues to whom I indicated my intention earlier today said that I was taking very much of a risk and that it was, perhaps, not appropriate to go back to one's initial comments and to reflect on the movement that had taken place on those things which one had aspired to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> The six themes on which I spoke in my first speech in this place were: firstly, local government; secondly, the importance of child-care; thirdly, the special needs of migrants and ethnic communities in general; fourthly, occupational health and safety; fifthly, peace and disarmament; and, sixthly, the adoption by this Government of a social justice strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take some time to reflect briefly on each of those themes. As one of the many members who have previously played an active role in local government before coming to this place, I have long held the view that local government ought to be recognised as a partner in the implementation and planning of a wide range of services. Thus I welcomed the presence of local government at the Special Premiers Conference last year as a recognition of the role of local government in this partnership. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past three years the Office of Local Government and the Australian Local Government Association have been working together to identify how better to integrate local government in Commonwealth program planning. In 1989 the Government initiated annual consultations between the Commonwealth and local government to provide an intergovernment forum in which issues of mutual concern could be discussed. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a promising beginning, but there is a need for far greater effort to reform bureaucratic duplication and inefficiency due to the overlap of the three spheres of government. Partly, this is being addressed by the present discussions about Commonwealth-State relationships, which local government has been asked to participate in as a result of the Special Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that last week the Government rejected the recent Commonwealth Grants Commission proposal for the distribution of local government funding among the States. This would have had catastrophic effects, especially on local government in Victoria and New South Wales. I think that in fairness to the Commission I should say that in its report it recognised the shortcomings of the methodology that it used. It will now be for government to address some of the perceived inequities that led to the Commission's being asked to investigate the matters before it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need for redistribution of resources to areas of greatest need to enable councillors to provide increased support services. This simply cannot be done by a rejigging of the figures for funds distributed among the States, but it must take into account the overall possibilities and capabilities of local government throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The evolution of a more comprehensive role for local government, in partnership with both State and Federal governments, requires reform of local government practice. Tonight I will touch on two such areas. Firstly, local government should continue to think very seriously about the benefits of boundary restructuring. At the time of my first speech in this forum in 1986, in Victoria there was a rather emotive debate about local government boundary restructuring. That is a debate which has been shelved over the last five years. There is perhaps a need for local government to realise the benefits of rectifying the imbalances caused by the present boundaries, especially in Victoria, and to take an active role in suggesting ways in which those processes can be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area I would like to flag is my belief in the need for the introduction of freedom of information legislation to cover local government as an aid to opening up government practices at the local level. Often when one is involved in parliamentary committee inquiries, one comes across a number of local discussions about items of interest. For instance, in the inquiry into coastal management and land degradation we came across some such discussions. Often there was a perception that the processes of local government were not as open as they could be. I stress that these are perceptions and often they are incorrect. However, sometimes they have a basis. A form of freedom of information legislation for local government would ensure that the concerns of local communities would be eased. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area I would like to refer to is child-care. The Government has consistently recognised the need for affordable child-care. The number of child-care places has nearly tripled from 46,000 in 1983 to 125,000 in 1991. In the electorate of Scullin we have moved from one publicly funded child-care centre to five-plus one that will be built at Mill Park in the future. Industry has also been encouraged to become involved in assisting with the provision of child-care centres. It is interesting to note the release of a report showing that there is a change in attitude by industry to employer sponsored child-care. Now 45 per cent of private sector companies support it. That type of support in principle is to be encouraged and turned into practical projects on the ground. I know that the successful project that was put in place by the Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd in Broadmeadows was of benefit in providing child-care places not only for its work force but also for the neighbouring community. </PARA>
<PARA> By 1995 there will be a quarter of a million funded child-care places, including long day and before and after school care programs. Recently two after school care programs were commenced at Norris Bank Primary School and Diamond Creek Primary School in my electorate as a joint project with the State Government. These are examples of successful implementation of what is seen as an important type of child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> The fee relief system in particular has ensured affordable child-care to low and middle income families. During 1990 the upward ceiling for fee relief was raised. This benefits some 90,000 families. In addition, a further 30,000 families will benefit from the decision to allow commercial child-care centres to participate in the fee relief scheme. The Government will introduce a national accreditation scheme to ensure that high standard, quality care is given in the centres. </PARA>
<PARA> The third theme I wish to turn to is the provision of services to the ethnic communities. Some 31 per cent of the population of the electorate of Scullin was born overseas. In 1989 the Government outlined a continuing commitment to access and equity in its multicultural agenda for Australia. We must renew our efforts to pursue the goals of the national agenda. All Australians should enjoy equal life chances and have equitable access to and an equitable share of the resources which governments manage on behalf of the community. All Australians should have the opportunity to participate fully in society and in the decisions which directly affect them. A great deal more work is needed before it can be said that these objectives have become a reality. </PARA>
<PARA> Economic hardship strikes hardest at those most disadvantaged. Often people from migrant communities are among the most disadvantaged job seekers. In the present economic climate that is most clearly illustrated. Many of the people who are subject to redundancies and loss of jobs from my electorate are migrants who came here in the post-Second World War period. They are people who have been at their places of employment for 20 to 30 years. They are often people who will have difficulty re-entering the work force because of their lack of literacy skills. Whilst they have been part of a company for 20 or 30 years which has engendered a family spirit that has given them a sense of belonging and a sense of being able to cope with their limited skills, now that they are out in the competitive world trying to make the best of limited job opportunities they are very much a disadvantaged group that stands out and calls for attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is tackling the difficult issues such as the recognition of overseas qualifications, as well as optimising migrants' English levels, with a greater emphasis on English acquisition immediately on arrival. It must be emphasised that there is a need for further significant strengthening of the access and equity strategy. I am pleased to note that currently the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) is conducting community consultations on the settlement needs of migrant Australians. I think that is an appropriate way in which the views and needs of migrant Australians, and the ethnic communities in general, can be assessed. I hope that out of this community consultation the Minister is able to put together proposals that can be considered by the Government that will ensure that the hopes and aspirations of migrant Australians can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth theme that I spoke about in my maiden speech was occupational health and safety. It was in the context of a problem within the Public Service with repetition strain injury, which was reaching epidemic proportions. The Government has demonstrated a commitment to improving the standards of occupational health and safety by reducing the incidence and severity of occupational injury and disease. One of the most important initiatives has been the establishment of Worksafe Australia-the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. Worksafe Australia has a number of important tasks which include developing common approaches to occupational health and safety legislation, coordinating national preventative strategies, conducting research, education and training, and collecting and disseminating information to workplaces. </PARA>
<PARA> Worksafe Australia has developed strategies to attack major occupational health and safety priorities such as occupational back pain, noise-induced hearing loss, occupational skin disorders, the management of chemicals at work, and mechanical and equipment injury. Whilst the honourable member for O'Connor berated the comment of the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) about the return to sweatshop conditions, one has only to consider the Hoechst Australia Ltd dispute in the western suburbs of Melbourne to remember the problems with incorrect and careless management practices in the handling of dangerous chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not say that what we engender by the talk of sweatshops is a picture of late last century and before, but certainly industrial practices such as have been seen earlier this year at Hoechst indicate that there is a real need to ensure that work practices and the occupational and health considerations of Australian workers are very much to the fore. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth theme that I spoke about in my maiden speech was foreign policy, especially matters of peace and disarmament. The dramatic events of recent years have led to what many regard as a new world order based on greater cooperation between nations and, in particular, an enhanced role for the United Nations. This new order, such as it is, has yet to stand the test of time and meet the challenges of peace, more importantly, as well as war. Just as Australia played a role through H.V. Evatt in the founding of the United Nations, Australia can play a role in ensuring that the United Nations rises to the challenges and fulfils the role originally intended for it. </PARA>
<PARA> This is also an historic opportunity for Australia to assert its independence on the world stage, an independence that perhaps has not been clearly demonstrated of late but that certainly is one we can work on and establish in global and international discussions on a wide range of foreign policy issues. On the morning of my maiden speech in 1986 there was an incident involving the bombing of Libya. The Middle East is still very much in our thoughts. I welcome the decision of the Government yesterday to send medical teams to assist in the Kurdish refugee camps. </PARA>
<PARA> The sixth theme that I touched upon in my maiden speech was a call for the adoption by the Government, especially the Australian Labor Party, at a national level, of a social justice strategy. At the conference that was held in June of that year the Party adopted a social justice policy. Subsequently, the Government adopted a comprehensive social justice strategy. The significance of this strategy has been increasingly felt in all aspects of government administration. There is the importance of social justice impact statements not only in the Budget but also in legislative processes. That is an indication of the Government's ongoing commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> Social justice issues become even more critical in hard times. Some of the aspects of the policy that have not been picked up as yet perhaps need emphasising because they are important and they will be important to the longer term goals of our social justice strategy. One is the notion of a national planning advisory council that could assist government by giving appropriate advice and feedback from the community about those goals that the community sees as very important. </PARA>
<PARA> To build on the basis of what we have done already over the past three years in the social justice area, we need to look at our goals and priorities for the next decade to the turn of the century. One of those key priorities is to address the problems of the ever-increasing urban areas of Australia. There is often a mismatch between the opportunities that are presented in those areas and the needs-a mismatch between the location of employment and the location of prospective employees, and between the location of training centres and those that can attend them. We have to make cities more equitable for the life expectations and chances of our community. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need to develop a national revenue strategy to ensure that government revenue over this decade will be adequate to meet the designated social justice goals. In my first speech in this place, I quoted the words of James Henry Scullin, after whom my electorate is named. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Justice and humanity demand interference whenever the weak are being crushed by the strong. </PARA>
<PARA>In the type of economic climate we have at the moment, I believe those words can be no more important than when James Henry Scullin wrote them back in the 1920s and 1930s. We need to be pro-active, we need to look at the types of policies that will create jobs and we need to look at ways in which we can encourage investment. I believe that, if we leave it to the private sector alone, we will not see the appropriate and needed type of investment injection into a number of things that will see Australia through to the twenty-first century. I have often talked about the need to direct in a small way superannuation investment as superannuation becomes an important income support source. </PARA>

The appropriation on these two items totals $107,829,000, yet the accompanying statement of savings nominates savings of a bare $218,000, a minor 0.2 per cent. Considering the lack of progress in these areas, it is scandalous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to remind the House what these appropriations cover. The explanatory notes on this portfolio say:</PARA>
<PARA>This Program enhances the competitiveness of the maritime and other sectors through promoting change directed to the safe, reliable, efficient and cost-effective carriage of freight and passengers to and from Australia and around Australia's coast; and the provision of more productive and reliable shore-based shipping operations. </PARA>
<PARA>That may have been the intent, but nothing has happened. The policy got lost-like the J-curve, like the bacon that never got home, and like the $8 billion surplus. They were all lost. </PARA>
<PARA> A little while back we had a statement called Building a Competitive Australia. That was also a fizzer, mainly for what it did not say. It did not address unemployment, interest rates, real taxation reform, our disastrous foreign debt or our over-regulated businesses. It did not adequately address dumping of products on our markets. It did not say, `We are the sick man of the Pacific'. It did boast, however, of success on the waterfront, and that is drivel. It is $108m down the drain. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is congratulating itself on the deal, which it claims is a good deal for both employers and employees. What about the customer? There is no thought for or consideration of the most important people of all. The deal was not even accepted by all employees. Some do not like it. I quote from the 6 May `Wharfie Bulletin':</PARA>
<PARA>Tas Bull, John Coombs and the three Sydney Federal councillors Jim Donovan, Ron Anderson and Ken Rowsthorn owe it to the members to resign. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the `Bulletin' is disgusted with the deal that has been negotiated. </PARA>
<PARA> The $108m for waterfront reform is scandalous. Nothing is being achieved. People need only look at the other sectors of the community not receiving this sort of funding. Many people throughout this nation are desperate-in particular, farmers and small business people-their whole lives shattered through no fault of their own. They face ruin. They have lost everything, including, in some cases, even the will to struggle on. They are hurt, their health suffers, they are angry, they cannot sleep, they believe their plight has been ignored. And they are right. This institution has failed them completely. </PARA>
<PARA> All they hear and read from this Government is, `We are on track, our performance is the envy of the OECD'. Like me, they do not believe it. They still have to pay taxes. They still have to pay a myriad of State taxes. They still have to pay 50 per cent duty on their fuel and outrageous freight and handling charges. These charges are over and above the $107m appropriation in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole country knows that Australia is the sick man of the Pacific and that micro-economic reform has not been implemented. The honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) admits that even in his electorate there are huge problems, especially unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> When historians reflect on the record of this miserable Government, the area they will undoubtedly select for greatest condemnation is its abysmal record on micro-economic reform. Indeed, there are few matters which are more deserving of the attention of this Parliament than the structural flaws inherent in the Australian economy. The monumental incompetence of a government which has presided over the economic mismanagement of recent years will long remain testimony to its own self-serving greed and the supine attitude of its industrial masters, the trade union bosses and high flying financial subscribers. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us reflect for a moment on the record of the past few years. In September 1987, during an interview on the Midday Show, the world's greatest Treasurer, demonstrating his usual modesty, announced that he had engineered the great coming of age of Australia. According to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the future was to be the golden age of economic change. As the Duke of Wellington replied when approached by a stranger in Hyde Park and asked whether he was Mr Smith, `Sir, if you believe that, you will believe anything'. </PARA>
<PARA> Nowhere is the pathetic posturing of the Hawke Government more evident than in its failure to confront the fundamental question of labour market deregulation, rising levels of national indebtedness, waterfront and land transport reform, dumping of imported products, inflation, and the insidious influence of the monopolistic union power. Australia must face the fact that our prosperity and living standards depend on our ability to compete successfully in the global economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The enormous economic potential of this nation and the resourcefulness of its people are being slowly strangled by an ever-tightening noose of statutes and regulations. Labor's pandering to vocal, unrepresentative, single-minded interest groups further adds to the growing burden of bureaucratic interference-the cost to business, disincentives to invest, and penalties for the hardworking and the thrifty. </PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of the century, when this Federal Parliament was first constituted, five million Australians enjoyed the highest standard of living in the world. Since then, and particularly since 1960, our relative wealth and prosperity have been in marked decline. At the same time, national indebtedness has reached alarming levels-33 per cent in 1989 compared with less than 2 per cent in the early 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> Nations that we once regarded as poor relations and that made inferior products are now amongst the world's most productive and efficient economies. At the same time, large sections of our economy, particularly those not exposed to international competition, are grossly inefficient and are handicapping Australia's exporters and those sectors competing against imports. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past year, business confidence has been adversely affected by the deepening recession and the policies of this Government. Despite claims to the contrary, the Government is well aware that business profitability and cash flow have been severely affected by what is quite obviously the worst recession since 1930. Once again, the Government stumbles about and Australia remains the sick man of the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> As ordinary Australians are thrown out of work and businesses are sent into bankruptcy, this miserable and inept Government can only babble about `the recession we had to have'. In contrast, however, nothing is too good for the mates on the waterfront. While farmers slaughter their flocks and organisations such as the Salvation Army are besieged by people in desperate circumstances, 55-year-old wharfies with 25 years experience receive redundancy packages of 247 weeks pay. These are the workers whose efforts have earned Melbourne the unenviable reputation of the world's third worst port, exceeded in awfulness only by Leningrad and Genoa. Indeed, there are few more telling examples of the depths to which Australia has sunk than this tragic juxtaposition of farmers and wharfies. Even the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has been forced to concede that the protests of miners and farmers about problems on the waterfront are justified. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian prosperity, which was built on the sheep's back, has been undermined by the ball and chain of an uncompetitive waterfront, inefficiencies in land transport, attacks on small business and an industrial relations system which emerged from the utopian dreams of the 1890s and the early Commonwealth era. It is widely recognised that our farmers and miners are amongst the most productive in the world. Our farmers sell their wool and wheat on competitive world markets and must be constantly mindful of the vagaries of international commodity prices. However, traditional labour myths of `the hungry mile' and oppressive work conditions `under the hook' continue to surround the waterfront and maritime unions. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1991, organisations such as the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia (WWF) are still characterised by their attachment to what is essentially a nineteenth century view of craft unionism. It is therefore no surprise that Australian ports are renowned for their inefficiency and restrictive work practices. They are only 50 per cent as productive as European ports and 40 per cent as efficient as ports in Asia, yet just a 20 per cent improvement in productivity would boost the nation's gross domestic product by $1,100m. Why does it require between 103 and 107 pieces of paper to get one container through the Port of Melbourne? The Circumlocution Office of Charles Dickens looks like a model of business efficiency in comparison with our waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> Research by the Inter-State Commission found that the average productive working week of many waterside workers is a mere 20 hours. However, demonstrating its usual weakness, the Government rejected key recommendations put forward by the Commission; just to make absolutely sure the Commission did not stray from the Party line again, the Government axed it altogether. Nothing, of course, must be done to offend the sectional interests of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and one of its most powerful constituents, the Waterside Workers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> Only a few weeks ago the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy admitted to a Herald-Sun journalist that waterfront reform was moving at a grindingly slow pace. Evoking visions of Haig's flawed and costly strategy on the Somme in July 1916, Kerin went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I'm sure we'll break through this year-or not at all. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet another triumph of hope over experience, although, unlike Haig, I think it is unlikely the Minister will ever be rewarded with an earldom. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 the Business Council of Australia found that port inefficiencies in handling bulk cargo were costing $300m annually, while inefficiencies in the handling of containers and roll-on, roll-off cargoes cost a further $400m. Chronic overmanning, demarcation disputes and inflexible rosters typify the problems afflicting the Australian waterfront. How can a government which beats its breast and claims to represent the workers of this country allow the pampered thugs of the WWF to institutionalise work practices such as the following? When a contractor requires his own driver to operate his own equipment, a WWF driver is also employed, but does nothing; when members of a work gang draw straws for an expensive prize-nicking off home on full pay-while in some cases two drivers must be employed in derrick cranes which have three operational levers and only one seat. The cranes are designed for one operator, yet the union insists on two. Another example is that of trucks queuing outside the Port of Melbourne, which costs the community $21m a year, when the introduction of a modern computer system on the waterfront would save $500m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems plaguing the Australian waterfront and the snail's pace of reform were recently summed up by Ivan Deveson, the Chairman of the Australian Shipping Users Group, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>In my life I have never seen an industry where the customer is so irrelevant as I do in Australia's waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA>Deveson went on to describe the waterfront as:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the most rampant cost-plus structure I have ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or even the world's greatest Treasurer could tell the House how the overburdened taxpayers and small business people of this country can afford to subsidise the inefficiency and waste that they know only too well is endemic on the waterfront. Why is it that the first 500 exits from the industry under the redundancy packages are now almost five months overdue? Could the answer be that this Government is just too cowardly to do anything that might upset the already overindulged wharfies?</PARA>
<PARA> When we examine the record of other countries we see that the task of micro-economic reform is not all that difficult, providing one can muster the political will in the first place. In Britain, Associated Ports, which controls 22 ports, was established when the Thatcher Government sold the British Transport Docks in 1983. Needless to say, productivity and efficiency in British ports has improved dramatically in recent years. In New Zealand the leadership of Roger Douglas has resulted in a successful program of reform on the waterfront. These reforms included an enterprise employment system, the abolition of the New Zealand Port Authority and the formation of port companies to buy and operate the commercial facilities of the harbour board. Additional legislation allows the privatisation of these companies so that New Zealand ports are now able to operate on a competitive and commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Why can we not do the same? Why has this Government been prepared to embrace so enthusiastically the deregulation of financial markets but is unrelenting in its refusal to touch what is surely one of the world's most over-regulated economies and one of its most over-regulated labour markets? As Terry McCrann put it recently:</PARA>
<PARA>The whole of the 1980s is a picture of the distortions that emerge when you do things piecemeal. Deregulating the financial market and leaving everything else rotten in place sent money straight into assets speculation, not industrial development. </PARA>
<PARA>Fundamental to this whole debate is the question of the proper role of government in a modern democracy. Why do governments in Australia feel compelled to do so much? Indeed, if we examine their record of management in respect of ports and harbours, railways, telecommunications, electricity and so on, we see that in general it has been one of inefficiency, bureaucratic meddling and waste. Much of the traditional rationale for public ownership in Australia relates to the argument that ports, railways, telecommunications, electricity and so on constitute natural monopolies which can be run only by government. In practice, however, the disease of public ownership has resulted in the gradual impoverishment of this nation. The dead weight of the public sector, coupled with high interest rates and an anti-business, anti-savings tax regime has seen this country sink once again into a deep recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The Appropriation Bills have again evaded the question of our horrendous foreign debt. Since the election of this Government in 1983 our foreign debt has increased by over $100 billion. This means we have borrowed over $1 billion per month on average for the past eight years. This $1 billion per month is approximately 10 per cent of the nation's wages bill; that is, 10 per cent of our work force is effectively being paid by overseas creditors. At the end of last year our foreign debt had risen to a new high of $131 billion. It is imperative that this situation is reversed, but the words of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer hardly inspire us to believe that the Government has the fortitude to tackle this problem. Australians have the right to ask where the tangible benefits of the investment boom of the 1980s are. The answer is that a large proportion of the borrowing has directly or indirectly been used to finance consumption rather than adding to our productive capacity. Moreover, the present decline in investment is occurring against the background of a continued current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hardly surprising, therefore, that in the lifetime of this Government, Australia's credit rating has twice been downgraded. There is little prospect that these assessments will be reversed in the near future. The net result of this is that Australian borrowers have to pay an extra premium on their external borrowings while the higher costs are passed on to all borrowers, from home owners to business people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Appropriate Bill (No. 4) 1990-91 and the statement of savings reveal all in the micro-economic reform. This Government continues to spend huge sums of money for what? A Conaust deal that has now fallen apart. It is scandalous and the Government stands condemned as the worst this century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, who is at the table, says, it may well have been the 1860s. Some of the comments that were made earlier today in fact would reinforce that view. I hope to find time later in this debate to comment in some detail on questions of micro-economic reform and industrial relations. I can assure the honourable member for Dunkley that, if time does not allow me to do that in this debate, I will certainly do so during discussion on the industrial relations Bills that will come before this Parliament shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Appropriation Bills before the Parliament this evening provide a timely opportunity to review economic policy and the direction of our economy. The Appropriation Bills themselves deal directly with Government fiscal policy. In my address this evening, I will discuss some fiscal policy aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, whilst addressing the difficult economic times we are in, has maintained a social security system which has ensured that those in less well off positions, those most hurt by the current difficulties, are in fact provided with some assistance and are able to maintain a quality of life and a standard of living which would otherwise be denied to them. We have been able to ensure that pensions have increased to what is now their highest level since 1949. Age pensions now are at a level in excess of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings-a long held target of the Australian Labor Party and one that has been reached historically only under Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that during the term of the previous Liberal Administration in Canberra the Fraser Government reduced age pensions as a percentage of average weekly earnings. This Government has turned the tide on that trend and in fact we have now seen an increase to what is the highest level since the end of the 1940s. </PARA>
<PARA> The August Budget, of which these Appropriation Bills in a sense form part, provided for tax cuts for all wage and salary earners. These cuts were, in the end, increased and implemented from 1 January. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might recall that the cuts were increased as a result of negotiations with the trade union movement and employers following release of the consumer price index (CPI) figures at the end of last year. The Australian Council of Trade Unions decided to forgo a wage increase application before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and in return the Government introduced some increased taxation benefits. It is that sort of responsible approach to industrial relations and economic management which those opposite have clearly failed to come to grips with and which the honourable member for Dunkley obviously has no understanding of, given the comments that he has just made in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The bottom rate of taxation has been slashed from 30 per cent when we came to office to a 20 per cent level at present, with the top rate being cut from 60 per cent to 47 per cent. As I mentioned, extra savings were provided as a result of the September 1990 CPI figures. Those reductions in tax rates have been of benefit to all wage and salary earners and have only been able to be offered because of the efforts of this Government in closing the various tax loopholes which were built into the system over a period and which, during the life of the former Liberal Government, became something of a growth industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Quality child-care is now available to thousands of families throughout Australia at affordable prices because of initiatives which this Government has taken. Working parents may now be eligible for fee relief of up to $85 a week for a maximum of 50 hours supervision. Working parents may now earn up to $56,200 and still be eligible for part fee relief. The Hawke Government has raised the income test ceiling for maximum fee relief from $270 a week to $370 a week. These represent major improvements to the provision of quality child-care, which is a substantial benefit to ordinary working families throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has, in addition, improved the benefits available to families for the support of their children by way of the family allowance and the family supplement. There are now some 3.7 million children benefiting from these schemes. The family allowance varies from $20 a fortnight for one child to $113 a fortnight for five children. The family allowance supplement, introduced by this Government as an additional means of assistance to low income families, is worth $53 a fortnight for each child under 13 years of age and $77.30 a fortnight for children aged 13 to 15 years. Both of these payments are tax free. They represent very substantial improvements in the quality of life of those families whose ordinary wages and salaries are not able to provide them with a standard of living which we in Australia would regard as acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> I should add that they represent an improvement in the standard of living which does not show up in the sorts of surveys that we saw published recently which referred to income gaps between the rich and the poor. These measures constitute the social wage and in many cases are directly attributable to the accord. They are a testament to the benefit that the accord has provided to ordinary Australians and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> The unemployment benefit in these times of difficulty has been maintained at realistic levels by the Hawke Government. Of course, these payments continue for the long term unemployed. Importantly, for those in ill health, the Government has maintained Medicare for all Australians no matter where they live, how poor they are or how old they are. When we consider the fiscal situation within this country, it is important to note that this Government has returned three surplus Budgets in a row. No other government in the history of this country can lay claim to that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal in a moment with the Liberal Party's record in government and its policies. In fact, I should start by referring to the position of the Liberal Party in regard to fiscal management. What would the Opposition do if it had the opportunity to act in this area? In February, only a few months ago, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), announced that we should reduce expenditure by $3 billion. The Australian of 19 February reported as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Reith's clarification of the Opposition's stance on fiscal policy-that it would both increase taxes and cut spending during a recession-means there is now a growing gulf between the positions of the Government and the Coalition on the role of government spending during a recession. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very true-there is an enormous gulf between the position of the Opposition and the Government in these matters. I might say on that point that there is an enormous gulf between the Opposition and every economist in the country. No-one else in this land is going around saying that we should reduce government expenditure by $3 billion and increase taxes. It is economic lunacy in times of difficult employment circumstances and during a recession to advocate that policy, as the Liberal spokesperson on tax matters did only a few months ago. This demonstrates the total lack of understanding of our current situation and/or a total disregard for the welfare of ordinary Australians. But it gets better. The Australian went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Reith would not say yesterday when the Opposition's new tax plan would be released, other than that it would be `all in due course'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a bit reminiscent of the old health policy that the former health spokesmen on the other side of the House was going to introduce prior to the last Federal election. It was in the top drawer as well. The sums on that had been worked out, and of course they did not add up either. Now we find that the tax policy is in the same drawer and it will come to light in due course, but it will involve cuts of $3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same article we learnt a little bit more about the Opposition's plans for the administration of our fiscal policy. It read:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Reith said the Opposition was concerned about the `loosening of fiscal policy (that has taken place) and in our view, that is a lever that they (the Government) ought to be pulling'. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ET4">Mr BEVIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the Opposition's policy; members opposite should listen carefully to this. It goes on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Tightening fiscal policy would provide some real benefits and it's one of the things, one of the policy prescriptions, that they ought to be employing. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition's policy is to cut expenditure. Every time members opposite get up in this place and complain about the lack of expenditure for the rural sector, the roads, the health scheme, the defence budget, they should bear in mind their own policy to reduce by $3 billion the outlays in this financial year. They should have a look at the Appropriation Bills that are before us now and identify which $1 1/2 billion they want to cut out, because that is the only honest position they can put in this place, rather than come here with the hypocritical positions they have advanced throughout the last few weeks on a range of issues. They should hop up now and tell us which is the $1 1/2 billion they want to cut out. When they have identified that $1 1/2 billion, we will go to the people. And I know who will win there, because the people will not wear that sort of lunatic economics in times of economic difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> But of course it does not end there. We turn to the difficulties of the unemployed. We have heard so much from those opposite telling us about their deep concern for the unemployed. What is their policy towards the unemployed?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Simmons" NAMEID="FJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ET4">Mr BEVIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Their policy towards the unemployed is to eliminate the benefits. They say, `If you are long term unemployed, you are guilty; it is all your fault and we are going to cut the benefit out. You can survive on the Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul or wherever you think you might be able to get a meal'. Those opposite who hop up here and shed crocodile tears about the difficulties of ordinary working Australians who are hard pressed to find a job say the next day that we should eliminate unemployment benefits. It is yet another example of the hypocrisy of members opposite and when it is exposed to the people of this country, they will reject them out of hand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But of course we have heard the tough rhetoric, and some of it is worth repeating. I think one of the most notable comments we have heard in the last few months about government expenditure has to do with Medicare. I mention Medicare as one of the great achievements of the Government and a great benefit to all Australians because it is universal; it is available to all; and there is no health risk rating. It is a good scheme, and Australian people know it is a good scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable members on the opposite side of the Parliament are not too sure about it, though. They still want to abolish it. It was only a couple of months ago that their health spokesperson was telling us, `We'll do away with Medicare and we'll introduce health vouchers'. When he was quizzed about that on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, he said, `Well, yes, some people will be worse off, but worse off by choice'. Now, think about that. The people out there are going to be worse off by choice. They are going to want to be worse off. We have a country of masochists who are just waiting for members opposite to take Medicare off them so they can choose to be worse off. That was the quote from the Opposition's own health spokesperson. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the final nail in the Opposition's coffin when it comes to fiscal policy was the comment of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) about company tax. There was that famed interview in which he said, `Well, the goal, the aim that we're seeking to reach is in fact to eliminate company tax. And where are we going to raise our revenue? We'll raise revenue from a broad based consumption tax'. That will be a broad based consumption tax that affects all people in this country on every single thing they buy; not selective, but a broad based consumption tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should go out to the people in his electorate and tell them that he intends to increase the price of the bread they buy every day of the week, their milk, their eggs, their clothes, their petrol, their car. Every single purchase they make will have an additional charge on it. All of the service charges will go up: their taxi fare, their bus fare-the entire works. It will be a broad based consumption tax that will hurt the poor more than anybody. Yet in debates such as this members opposite stand here with crocodile tears and express their concern for the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think something should also be said about monetary policy because, in terms of economic management, we all know that there are three important arms to proper economic management: fiscal, monetary and, of course, wages policy. I do hope time allows me to speak about wages policy because it is in that area where the differences between our Party and the Opposition's are demonstrably great and where the people of Australia will choose to support our policy because it provides them with a protection. But let me speak first about monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times, in spite of the history that honourable members opposite want to refer to-and there have been increasing interest rates that have caused harm to a lot of people and have not brought joy to anybody in this place or elsewhere-it is a fact that interest rates are falling. That is something that those opposite bemoan. They had hopes beyond hope that the economy will get worse and worse, for their own political gain. They have not at any stage in the last 18 months demonstrated any concern for the people of Australia in these matters. They have throughout sought to make political gain at every single announcement, at every single opportunity. I will speak about a couple of those opportunities, but before I do I just want to bring the House up to date on what has in fact been occurring with interest rates. We have seen a fall in interest rates of some 7 per cent in the last 14 months. The short term interest rates have come down by 7 per cent. The long term rates are now at a 10-year low. So I ask members opposite not to talk to us about high interest rates. I ask them to read the latest economic bulletins and to understand that interest rates have trended down for the last 14 months and that long term rates are now at a low for the decade. </PARA>
<PARA> What is more, as those rates have come down, home loans have also reduced and we are now witnessing a situation in which many commentators are speculating that home loan interest rates will fall below the old fixed rate of 13 1/2 per cent. Inflation is falling, trending down to its lowest level for 20 years. The Australian Financial Review of today quoted Westpac's acting chief economist. It said that he:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . yesterday predicted that the March-quarter CPI figure, due for release on May 15, could be the `lowest for a generation'. </PARA>
<PARA>We are now entering a phase where inflation will reach a low level that we have not seen since the 1960s and will provide us with the opportunity to have a sustained recovery that will be of long term benefit to all Australians. But the Liberal Party has in fact opposed this Government's efforts to reduce interest rates. It sits on the other side of the House in debates such as this and complains about high interest rates that we have had to endure. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us see what members opposite actually said when interest rates started to come down. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), on 29 November last year when interest rates were coming down, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, I in the end come to the view, yes, if we were loosening off on monetary policy without fiscal policy changes, then you would end up with higher interest rates. In other words, I would not take the rates off. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the shadow Treasurer said in November of last year: he would not take the rates off. Keep the interest rates up was the Opposition's policy in November last year, as we were bringing them down. Yet members opposite sit in this place and complain about high interest rates. I ask them to reconcile those two things. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in the minute or so available, I do wish to say something about wages and micro-economic reform, although clearly I will not be able to address the issue properly. The accord has provided this country, the workers of this country and the employers of this country with wage stability, a fall in unit labour costs in real terms-and that is something people opposite have failed to acknowledge throughout the last five years. It has provided a dramatic fall in industrial disputes and, of course, it has facilitated award restructuring and micro-economic reform, which has not yet been universally applied but which is progressively being applied throughout industries on an industry by industry basis. </PARA>

Philosophically I do not agree with him at all, but we all understand that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But I could not for the life of me understand why he became involved in the royal commission, why he suddenly tried to be something that he is not-a head-kicker. All of a sudden he said that Robin Gray should resign. He was really saying that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) should influence Robin Gray to resign. As we all know, we on this side thought that Brian Burke should resign in view of the implications that were coming out of the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in Western Australia. We thought his behaviour extreme, to say the least. But Brian Burke is an ambassador; he is not a politician. Robin Gray is a politician. </PARA>

If the honourable member for Denison kept away from the murky side of politics he would get on a lot better, and I would greatly respect him. To try to imply that Robin Gray should resign, to try to involve politics in the royal commission down in Tasmania even before it is touched upon, I find quite incredible. His comments are reported as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Mr Kerr said Mr Tronson had admitted Mr Gray held on to a substantial cash donation from Edmund Rouse which was not formally handed over to the Liberal Party until about two months after the election. </PARA>
<PARA>He was making no judgment on issues before the Tasmanian royal commission other than on those matters already put on the record by Mr Gray's political advisers. I suggest $10,000 is a lot different from $1.5m. I know the allegations against Mr Brian Burke are yet to be proven, but I cannot see the comparison. Politicians are going through that royal commission ad infinitum. Every day there is a different one going through. To point the bone at Robin Gray, and to bring it into the political arena, is to make a mockery of what Mr Field has said in Tasmania-that the Commission is out to find whether there are guilty people, but it is not a political game to try to catch politicians.</PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid the honourable member for Denison has done himself a lot of harm in Tasmania. He has also brought the royal commission down to the dirty part of politics where an attempt is being made to implicate somebody before a decision has been made. I leave it at that. I hope the honourable member for Denison will come into the House and explain why, out of character, he should get involved in such a messy affair, and explain why he was trying to implicate the former Premier of Tasmania, just one politician, when there are other politicians who will appear before the royal commission. </PARA>

<PARA> Within the rugby league code of football the State of Origin competition has all but surpassed test match activity as the pinnacle of the game. Tomorrow night we will see the first of this year's matches. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland has a very proud history in State of Origin football. Queensland has managed to win most of the matches which have been played since the inception of State of Origin games. The concept was pioneered and in fact drawn up by a Labor senator, the late Senator McAuliffe-Rugby Ron-who, as President of the Queensland Rugby League and as a vice-president of the Australian Rugby League, was a great administrator with the foresight which enabled this contest to be organised. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a contest which Queensland has been fortunate enough to dominate, by and large, throughout the years it has been played. I am a bit sad to say that in recent years Queensland appears not to have been up to the task of beating the Blues, and I must give credit to New South Wales. That State has produced some excellent football teams in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the teams being fielded for tomorrow night's match, one would have to concede that New South Wales is again favourite for the game as it has a very strong array of test players and many seasoned footballers who are well accustomed to State of Origin football. Unfortunately for Queensland, approximately half of our team is playing a State of Origin match for the very first time. That is going to place some significant burden on those players. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the experience, of course, of one of the greatest footballers ever to put the jersey on-Wally Lewis, who is captain of the Queensland side. At 31 years of age he has no doubt lost some of the pace that he had, but as a general on the football field I think he would rank with the best in any era of the game. He is truly one of the top rate footballers the nation has produced. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had the good fortune to attend many a game at Lang Park to watch the State of Origin games. Regrettably, that will not be my lot tomorrow night. Having been at those games, and having enjoyed the atmosphere of the Lang Park crowd on State of Origin night, I hold great hopes for the ability of the members of the Queensland team to do wonderful things with the maroon jersey on their back. In front of a Lang Park crowd, with Wally Lewis as captain-in what may in fact be his final series as captain for Queensland-we will find a Queensland rugby league team committed to its task tomorrow night. Queensland will make a very good game of it. It will, I think, be the great spectacle that we have come to expect from State of Origin rugby league over the years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise an issue which is of great concern to people in rural Australia. I am pleased that the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) is at the table so he may report to his colleague, the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is not with us at the moment, on the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in country areas of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to refer specifically to the price variation between the city of Melbourne and country areas like Bendigo, where the price difference was 13c per litre last weekend. I know that the market has been deregulated, and I have no argument with that, but I raise this issue with the Minister because it is of concern to country people. The price of LPG in Melbourne last week was 18.3c per litre. Yet, in country Victoria, particularly around the Bendigo area, it was 13c per litre higher at 30.9c per litre. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VT4">Mr REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct: 18c per litre in Melbourne, yet in country parts of Australia we are looking at 30.9c per litre. To give an example, with unleaded petrol there is about 4c per litre difference between city and country. In those areas freight charges are around 2c per litre for petrol from Melbourne to Bendigo. I understand that freight charges for LPG can be slightly higher because of the smaller payload and the specialised pressurised vehicles which carry that gas, but 13c per litre difference between Melbourne and Bendigo seems to be an enormous difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It begs the question of what margins the companies are operating on that enable them to have a price differential like that. It is causing great concern to people in country areas who rely on LPG for their heating and the operation of their cars which have been converted to LPG. I know that the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority are carrying out an investigation into LPG prices but, according to a recent newspaper report, it was stated that officers from the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority would be expected to visit Bendigo in a few weeks. I would have thought they could get there a little quicker than that. I ask the Minister to ensure that they investigate those matters quickly, because 13c a litre is too big a difference and the impost that that is placing upon country people is quite marked. </PARA>
<PARA> I am receiving a tremendous number of complaints about this. There is a need to look at the margins some of these companies are operating on and whether they are using LPG as a loss leader in some types of situations, as some of our supermarkets do. The sooner this matter is investigated and some resolution is obtained the better it will be for people who use LPG gas in country Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to pay tribute to a wonderful group of women, the Logan Netball Association, who hosted the Queensland junior age championships over the weekend. The Logan Netball Association is located in one of the most disadvantaged areas of our State. It has struggled against a very hostile city council, the Logan City Council, which is well known for turning down moneys from this Federal Government simply because it does not wish to have money from a Labor government. So women, particularly, and men in that area have had great difficulty in organising any kind of recreation and sporting facilities. The newly elected council will no doubt continue that tradition, since it seems to be more of a progress at any price type of council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, despite all of this, the Logan Netball Association has worked enormously hard; and I am delighted to say that I am its patron. I have also been responsible for getting for the Association a small grant which has enabled it to build very modest toilet facilities and a small canteen, which surely is not very much to ask for the young people who gather there on weekends-usually in the region of 2,000 to 5,000 of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of this work has been done through the instigation of a very energetic and very versatile president, a lady by the name of Phyl Grant, and her secretary, Janelle Moorehead, plus the hard work that has been done by the Snell family. Mr and Mrs Snell, over 14 years, have hung in there to ensure that this organisation has grown from a very small group of 10 or 15 people to the kind of organisation which it is now. </PARA>
<PARA> The opening of the championships on Saturday morning was presided over by the international president of women's netball, Miss Deidrie Hyland, who also lives in my electorate. We had the Queensland president, Pat Winton, and our local Logan president, Phyl Grant. People came from all over Queensland-from Mount Isa, Townsville, Herbert River, from as far west as Biloela, and from the south, the Tweed and Tweed Heads, to participate in the Queensland championships. We had people from under 13 to under 17. It is very important to acknowledge that this sport is the most popular sport in Australia. It is the sport which has the most participants, and on any one weekend in Australia 1 1/2 million people play netball--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On any one weekend 1 1/2 million people play netball. I know that our newspapers would not indicate that. We see photographs of horse races and of the three codes of football, but the two sports in which most people participate are netball and ladies bowls. That is something which perhaps our sporting commentators should take more notice of. However, I am pleased that the ABC at long last has acknowledged the immense skill and excitement that there is in the game of netball. It now shows-usually at about 5 p.m. on a Saturday-some of the netball finals. The games are very exciting and, if people watch, they will learn the skills and experience the terrific thrill one gets in following a team. Certainly, there was no shortage of thrills and excitement on the weekend at the Queensland age championships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was delighted when the Logan under seventeens came home to glory. That is an indication of how hard they have trained and how much work they have put in and the kinds of skills which they have. It gives me great pleasure to commend the Logan Netball Association for the enormous work it did over the weekend in the provision of fantastic facilities and fantastic support and in providing an opportunity for a couple of thousand people to explore their skills and their friendships, and to have a healthy and wonderful weekend. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I generally try to use the adjournment for matters which concern me within my own electorate. I do not want to be classed as being too parochial, but weeks ago I did raise a matter in the House concerning the Buladelah Fire Brigade and the Buladelah Rescue Squad. I want to thank the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) for his response to me concerning a beeper that both organisations are seeking and that will work in that particular locality in New South Wales. It has been pointed out to me that, because there is not a transmitter on the mountain adjoining the township, both organisations are finding great difficulty in advising their voluntary members of an accident or a fire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have no great objection to Telecom being made a corporation, but we are finding today that, every time we make representations concerning a public telephone booth or a letterbox, we get the answer that from the commercial point of view it cannot afford to put one in. The same thing is occurring here and I am very concerned about it. I am told by the Department that it will cost approximately $10,000 to place a transmitter or equipment on the mountain to make this service available. I again appeal to the Minister-because I have not received a direct reply to the representations I made to the Department-to see that the matter is reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate the fact that he is the Minister and that there is a corporation there and that they are controlling their own domestic affairs. But thousands of vehicles pass through this township on the Pacific Highway every day. It is a bad piece of road and there are many accidents. Many people are killed within the vicinity of Bulahdelah. Many people damage themselves and their vehicles in that area. In this case the Department should make available the necessary equipment so that these beepers can work properly. I speak of Mr Kevin Johnson, the Chairman, and Mr Lansdowne, another man associated with the bush fire brigade. They work voluntarily for 24 hours each day. They make available a service not only to local people in the community but also to many thousands of people travelling from the metropolitan areas in Brisbane through the township each day. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very concerned about it. I want to help them. I know the work that they are doing. They do not seek a lot of publicity. As I said earlier-and this is the important thing-they are giving voluntarily their time to save the lives of people and property damaged by accident or by fire. I therefore appeal to the Minister-to date he has been cooperative-to convince his Department to look at the situation sympathetically as these people are doing voluntary work. They are saving lives and they are serving the community. Money is what seems to matter, but to me it is saving lives and property that is important. Whether a Department is a commercial enterprise or not, it should give some consideration to these problems in country areas. I am sure that the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons), who is at the table, has similar situations in his electorate of Calare where a department says, `No, it is not a commercial thing therefore we cannot approve it'. I want the situation at Bulahdelah re-examined so that something can be done to help these people who are doing voluntary work 24 hours a day. These men and women make their services available to save lives on a highway. I appeal to the Minister to do something about it. </PARA>

<TITLE>Access to Coastal Areas: Crayfishing: Radio Australia</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AG4">Mr RONALD EDWARDS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Stirling)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.53 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first matter I speak about tonight is an environmental concern. There is a tendency around the coastline of Australia for many fishing and surfing spots to be purchased privately. People are then denied access to those places. Increasingly-it is an unfortunate trend-areas that were once available to the public on a relatively free basis are now often closed to the public. The answer is relatively straightforward; that is, where there are particular recognised surfing and fishing spots used by members of the public, that State governments gazette them and, in effect, declare them as places for which there shall be permanent access for the public. It has to be understood that good surfing and fishing places are a very scarce resource. They should not be prejudiced by the private purchase of those places. That problem is emerging. It has been drawn to my attention in Western Australia. It is a big problem. People have been accustomed to going somewhere but because a new owner has acquired the property access has been denied because the new owner has simply decided to deny access. I can understand the owner's concern about the proper management of the area so that it does not degrade. But by gazetting it, State governments would take responsibility under their conservation and land management program to look after that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter I refer to is the concern in the crayfishing industry in Western Australia. Many of the fishing people who use bait bags throw those over the sides of the boats. These bait bags are all over the coastal regions of Western Australia, where crayfishing is very prolific. So far, without success, I have taken this matter up at both the industry level and at State government level. I recommend that State governments simply pass a regulation which requires that cray fishermen remove the bait from the plastic bag before they go out to sea and leave the plastic bag on shore. That would then eliminate the carriage of the plastic bag and the bait straps, which are even more of a threat to the environment. These would have to be left on shore. The bait would then be put into very large bins and then used. This matter needs to be addressed because it is a very serious concern to the marine and coastal environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter is that currently Radio Australia provides services. On a Saturday it takes 3LO feed from Melbourne and provides that service around the world. On Sundays it takes the 2BL feed from Sydney and provides that service around the world. In effect, on Saturday there is an Australian rules football coverage mixed with a coverage of races and on Sunday there is the rugby league coverage from Sydney. That is a very successful service, only inhibited by the deficiencies in Radio Australia transmitters around Australia. That needs to be addressed. Radio Australia is a very cost efficient and effective organisation on a worldwide basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I am alarmed-I have had correspondence with Radio Australia-as it is proposing to remove those services. It believes that it ought not to be providing a service for Australian expatriates. That is very short-sighted. Australian expatriates need a link with the Australian mainland. Sometimes they have not gone overseas of their choosing. That is the first thing to recognise. The second thing to recognise is that Australia is known for its sport, particularly our proficiency in Australian rules and rugby league is known worldwide. By projecting those sports into these various regions of the world and by having them as a topic of conversation, we in fact advance Australia's interests. </PARA>
<PARA> I am often very concerned about this tendency to pocket Australia's interest into something specifically about information or cultural programs. I understand that they are very important. But it is a very narrow definition of culture that says that I can remove the role of sport from the definition of culture. As I said earlier, sport is a very significant phenomenon in Australia. Those two sporting codes are known on a worldwide basis. I also acknowledge that rugby union has a worldwide appeal but we ought to make sure that this coverage is provided for Australian expatriates. </PARA>
<PARA> Incidentally, many people on the Australian mainland who cannot get very effective radio or television transmission rely on Radio Australia coverage. As a by-product of that service, people in remote localities are being serviced. The net effect is that Radio Australia currently provides a very good service. I am alarmed that it might cut back that service. We should press it to continue that service. We should also assist by improving its transmitter facilities. That would be of assistance to people. </PARA>

I take the opportunity to salute Win for her irreplaceable contribution to local youth activities and, in particular, for her contribution to the Mercury Theatre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Galleries and establishments worldwide are supporting an art initiative by Win's daughter, Sharon. The initiative is called Artists for Life. For the first time the world's artists are collaborating on a common theme to focus attention on the plight of the earth's endangered species. As a central focus of this event a major art exhibition will tour the world commencing in 1993 and will feature paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures and ceramics by distinguished artists from many countries. This is the first time that artists of this calibre will have cooperated to create a collection on a single theme on a global basis. The impact of such an art experience progressively touring the world will also help to consolidate a common purpose in countries of differing political and philosophical doctrines. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted that the Minister responsible, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons), is at the table. I say to the Minister that already over 40 prominent international art galleries have assisted and have expressed an interest in holding supporting art exhibitions. Similar support has been expressed by 100 art galleries in Australia as well as many art societies, et cetera. The Premier of New South Wales, Mr Nick Greiner, has given early support, as indeed has my senatorial colleague from New South Wales, Senator Bishop. I urge anyone who can contribute in financial or artistic terms to write to Sharon, at Post Office Box 306, West Ryde, New South Wales, 2114.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The total cost of `The Wood for the Trees' was $51,725 (including overtime and penalties, excluding salaries).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The cost of the hire of the helicopter was $4,554.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) 34 minutes and 40 seconds of film were shot from the helicopter, of which 3 minutes and 1 second were used in the finished program. Unused footage has been retained in the Four Corners archives; (b) no film was shot from the ground during the helicopter hire.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The ABC decided to produce the program on 21 May 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) Approximately 45 people were contacted by `Four Corners' during production of `The Wood for the Trees'. I am advised that ABC practice is not to name sources of information obtained in the preparation of programs.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Mr J Briggs, Mr R Bunning, Dr G Chittleborough, Mr A Drake, Mr M Johnson, Dr J Leigh, Mr P Llewellyn, Dr E Schultz, Dr S Shea, Mr A Syme, Mr P Toyne, Mr E Valom and Mr A Walker were interviewed during the program.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The first contact with CSIRO scientists was made on 29 May 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) There were several contacts after 29 May 1990. The two scientists were interviewed by `Four Corners' on 7 June 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Dr Schultz did not help `Four Corners' to plan `The Wood for the Trees'. Like other people contacted during preparation of the film, Dr Schultz provided information, contacts and documents-a fact she has publicly acknowledged.</PARA>
<PARA> Contact with Dr Schultz during production of `The Wood for the Trees' was initiated by `Four Corners', whose reporter Mark Colvin spoke with her on 23 May 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Contact was made with Dr Schultz on several occasions between 23 May and early June 1990. ABC records do not show the dates.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) The ABC does have a file on forests and forest management in the south-west of Western Australia. As a standard practice in journalism, research files maintained by `Four Corners' cover a wide range of subjects.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Yes. The ABC has completed investigation of all complaints.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) Complaints were made by the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM), the Western Australian Minister for the Environment, representatives of professional forestry organisations, forest industry bodies, Bunnings Ltd, a conservationist, a trade union, academics from a tertiary institution, and a number of members of Parliament and members of the public. Of these, six complaints alleging errors of fact in `The Wood for the Trees' have been dealt with under section 82 of the ABC Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) Yes. The ABC has dealt with all errors of fact that were made in the program.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) The Controller of TV News and Current Affairs, Mr Peter Manning, answered letters from members of the public praising or criticising `The Wood for the Trees'. His replies referred, inter-alia, to the findings of the ABC's internal inquiry into detailed allegations made against the program by CALM. Those allegations had been the subject of considerable publicity. Of the 44 complaints from CALM, the ABC inquiry subsequently found two to have been sustained. Mr Manning included this factual information in his responses.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the complaints handled as part of the internal inquiry, six separate complaints alleging errors of fact in `The Wood for the Trees' have been formally investigated under section 82 of the ABC Act. The Act requires that such investigations be undertaken independently by the ABC's Principal Community Affairs Officer. Mr Manning did not comment on either the formal section 82 complaints, or the independent investigations of each that were then in progress.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) (a)``The ABC's internal inquiry into CALM's allegations against `The Wood for the Trees' was conducted by the Assistant Managing Director, Mr Stuart Revill, and the Acting General Manager Corporate Relations, Mr Derek White, assisted by the Head of Legal and Copyright Division, Ms Judith Walker.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The report was written by them, except for material identified in the report as being written by other parties, for example Appendixes A and B.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) No persons outside the ABC were contacted about the complaints during the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA> (17) Section 82 of the ABC Act requires that complaints in relation to errors of fact be dealt with as soon as practicable by the Principal Community Affairs Officer, and that, where a complaint is justified, the Managing Director ensure publication of a prompt retraction or apology in appropriate terms. The ABC has advised me that it has met these requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> (18) See answer to (17).</PARA>
<PARA> (19) Within the framework of existing complaint procedures the ABC appears to have fulfilled its statutory obligations.</PARA>
<PARA> (20) Claims were made that the program had slandered persons or organisations. These persons are free to seek redress through the Courts.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have sought from the Trade Practices Commission the information requested by the honourable member, and have been advised as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) and (b)-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the TPC has received 5 complaints which would fall within the scope of the honourable member's question-one from Western Australia and the remainder from elsewhere. The Commission has not been made aware of other specific instances involving suggestions of the use of ``undue pressure'' of the kind referred to in the honourable member's question.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the nature of each complaint, and the action that has been taken in relation to the complaint is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) A complainant in NSW alleged that Telecom had improperly interfered with a contract that it had previously negotiated with a customer. Following discussions between the TPC and Telecom staff, Telecom reimbursed money to the complainant.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) An allegation was made that Telecom in Melbourne had discriminated in favour of its own operations in the allocation of exchange lines for the supply of competitive equipment and services to the detriment of the complainant. The allegation was not substantiated by the customer. The matter was referred to Austel for general monitoring action.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) An allegation was made that, when a Melbourne customer had contacted Telecom to arrange for new exchange lines to be provided for a telephone system which the complainant had partly relocated, Telecom insisted that, unless it completed the relocation, exchange lines would not be provided within the shortest possible time. After investigation the TPC came to the view that no breach of the Trade Practices Act was apparent, and that the allegation was not borne out by the evidence. However the matter was referred to Austel for monitoring and action on the manner in which Telecom records orders for competitive and reserved services.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) An allegation was made that Telecom technicians had attempted to sell to the complainant's customers a `music on hold' system even though a system had already been ordered by a customer from the complainant's agent. Enquiries conducted by Brisbane Office staff did not disclose evidence of a breach of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) A complainant in Perth alleged that Telecom's competitive equipment supply operations had access to reserved service information which gave it an unfair advantage by providing `leads' to potential customers. The complainant raised this matter with both the TPC and Austel and requested that both agencies liaise on the matter. This general issue is an ongoing Austel investigation of which the TPC is aware, and there have been discussions between the two agencies. The matter is being left to Austel in the short term.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Austel has been involved in the manner described in (ii) (b) (c) and (e) above.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr Howe</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Caries severity has traditionally been measured by the Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth (DMFT) Index. Observations for this measure are collected as part of the care of children by the School Dental Services of each State or Territory in Australia. When DMFT measures are being calculated for an age group, say 12 year olds, within a State or Territory, no weightings are required to estimate the mean score for children in the State or Territory under the care of the School Dental Service. However, when scores from all States and Territories are combined to calculate a national or Australian estimate, the scores from each State and Territory are weighted.</PARA>
<PARA> The weights are numeric in nature and reflect the proportion of the Australian child population (aged 4-13 years) resident in each State or Territory. In the preliminary estimates of caries severity presented in the answer to question (2), the same weight has been used for each of the years 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989. These weights were: NSW 0.343; VIC 0.271; QLD 0.152; SA 0.086; WA 0.090; TAS 0.030; NT 0.010 and ACT 0.018. For 1990, the nature of the weighting will be similar, however, no national weighted estimates have been compiled for 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No national figure of caries severity rates for 12 year old children has been published for the years 1986 (not for full year), 1987, 1988, 1989 or 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> The Dental Statistics and Research Unit assumed responsibility for the Child Dental Health Survey data in March 1989. It has since obtained, from the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health, the necessary data for 1986, 1987 and 1988 to calculate the national figure for the DMFT of 12 year olds. The sampling, data processing, analysis and reporting of caries severity was redesigned when the Dental Statistics and Research Unit assumed responsibility for the data collection. One State, Western Australia, delayed introduction of the new data collection methods. Data have recently become available from all States and Territories allowing calculation of the national figure for 1989. The processing and analysis of data for 1990 will not be completed until mid 1991. The figures for those years where they are available are presented below:</PARA>

<PARA> (4) Professor John Spencer is a nationally and internationally recognised oral epidemiologist and dental health services researcher. Professor Spencer has qualifications in Children's and Preventive Dentistry, Public Health and Research. It was as part of Professor Spencer's research for a Doctor of Philosophy degree that work was undertaken on prediction of rates of dental decay.</PARA>
<PARA> This work was completed in 1984, although some scientific papers arising from it appeared in 1986 and 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> Professor Spencer established a data set comprising all findings of mean caries severity of samples of Australian adolescents over the period 1965 to 1978; these included 21 studies involving surveys, clinical trials and analysis of service records of dental programs. Professor Spencer hypothesised that the age-specific DMFT scores, and in some cases scores for socio-economic groups at an individual age, could be explained by a number of predictor variables related to fluoride exposure such as proportion of lifetime exposure to water fluoridation, regular use of fluoride supplements and use of fluoride containing toothpaste. Hence, each mean DMFT score was linked in the data set to mean estimates of these fluoride predictor variables.</PARA>
<PARA> The resultant cross-sectional time series data were analysed by multiple regression procedures and the results of how predictors had behaved in the past were used to extrapolate into the future.</PARA>
<PARA> In order to estimate the caries severity in future years, Professor Spencer attempted to track patterns of exposure to the fluoride predictor variables, extrapolate their trends and apply estimates of their likely magnitude within the multiple regression model. In this way, estimates of future caries severity of Australian adolescents up to 1990 were calculated.</PARA>

<PARA>mid 1991</PARA>
<PARA> These data commence at 1979 because the last year of data used in the research was 1978.</PARA>
<PARA> The results can be seen to initially be lower, then gradually higher than caries severity obtained in the Child Dental Health Survey.</PARA>
<PARA> In Professor Spencer's report on this work in 1984, he pointed out that his predictions were built on data reflecting all children, while the Child Dental Health Survey captures data only on children under the care of the School Dental Services. Hence, although the comparison is convenient, it is not necessarily an apt comparison. Biases may exist in terms of the children who are included in the dental care program of the School Dental Services. As the School Dental Services in most States and Territories were expanding, the nature of the social mix of the children whose caries severity was captured in the Child Dental Health Survey also changed across these years.</PARA>
<PARA> In an article in the Australian Dental Journal in 1986, Professor Spencer reported that the steeper decline in the Child Dental Health Survey data between 1979 and 1983 than predicted for all Australian 12 year old children may have indicated that factors other than fluoride, not included in the predictive model, may be associated with the greater decrease observed in the Child Dental Health Survey data. It was, therefore, well recognised by Professor Spencer that ``the future national predictions presented in this study are conservative'' (Spencer Australian Dental Journal 1986; 31(4)262-7). Other factors which may have been operating across that time (and on through the intervening period) to reduce caries severity include</PARA>
<PARA> * use of professionally applied fluorides (not modelled)</PARA>
<PARA> * an increase in the use of fissure sealants in School Dental Services to prevent caries on occlusal (biting) surfaces</PARA>
<PARA> * greater targeting of School Dental Services to higher risk children, maximising the potential to effectively prevent caries, and</PARA>
<PARA> * a change in Dentistry toward a philosophy of minimum intervention, ie., when faced by uncertainty about disease presence, not intervening with restorative services.</PARA>
<PARA> In the spirit of a statement made by Professor Spencer in 1984 that ``this study will be kept under review to further validate its findings and also identify areas within the research that may be improved'' Slade, Spencer and Dooland conducted in 1989 further research on changing patterns of caries severity in South Australia. Dr Slade is the Consultant Oral Epidemiologist to the Dental Statistics and Research Unit, while Dr Dooland is Director, Statewide Dental Services, South Australian Dental Service.</PARA>
<PARA> This research is different from Professor Spencer's earlier work in three fundamental ways:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. As it was conducted in 1989, it used more recent data in order to understand changes in caries severity and predict future caries severity;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. It used only data from the School Dental Service in South Australia. It is, therefore, entirely appropriate in this case to compare the research predictions with the subsequent data available from the South Australian School Dental Service which has, in the late 1980s, provided care for a relatively constant percentage of the child population at 12 years old.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Whereas Professor Spencer's earlier work was on understanding and tracking changes in fluoride exposure which in turn determined future caries severity, this more recent research uses changes between ages and across time to predict future caries severity. Hence, it does not seek to explain why caries severity is changing; it seeks only to understand how caries severity is changing.</PARA>
<PARA> The data assembled for Slade, Spencer and Dooland's work were again a sequential time series of cross-sectional surveys covering children aged six to 12 years cared for by the South Australian School Dental Service between 1976 to 1988. Multiple regression analysis was used to estimate age, cohort and period effects within Adelaide and non-Adelaide parts of South Australia. The outcome was again a formula that could be used to predict future caries severity in each part of the State. The following table presents the comparison of Slade, Spencer and Dooland's prediction of caries severity against the results of the Child Dental Health Survey for all South Australian 12 year old children.</PARA>

<PARA> These predictions appear to be tracking closely the actual caries severity of South Australian 12 year old children. However, it should be noted that although this approach captures past changes in caries severity associated with age, cohort and period effects, it cannot anticipate fundamental changes in the antecedents of caries, or the manner in which it is observed and treated in the School Dental Services. Such changes would be bound to reduce the accuracy of the predictions.</PARA>
<PARA> A further note of caution is necessary when interpreting estimates which are based on extrapolated data. It is always the case that a single estimate for any year represents a point within a range of figures, and any other figure within that range would constitute a statistically valid prediction. In many instances, the true range of any single predicted estimate (cited above) encompasses the actual observed caries severity, or the range within which another predicted estimate would fall.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) (a) The Australian Institute of Health's Dental Statistics and Research Unit was set up in 1987 and began operating in 1988. The Dental Statistics and Research Unit is an external unit of the Australian Institute of Health, being located within the Department of Dentistry at the University of Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Its core funding comes from the Australian Institute of Health. Additional funding is obtained through competitive application for research funds and contracted research.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The role of the Dental Statistics and Research Unit is to improve the range and quality of information available on the dental workforce, oral health, use of services and dental practice in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The aims of the Dental Statistics and Research Unit are:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. To establish a national minimum data set on dental personnel and provide descriptive statistics on labourforce activity;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. To establish and maintain the national child dental health survey;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To provide information on all data available in Australia on the dental labourforce, dental practice, use of dental services and dental health status, facilitating reviews from time to time; and</PARA>
<PARA> 4. To conduct supplementary research as deemed necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> The priorities for the Unit reflect the aims. The areas of data collection, preparation, analysis and reporting on the dental labourforce and oral health status equally have highest priority, followed by supplementary research and the broader `clearing house' role on dental statistics.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The ready availability of basic planning information on the potential requirement for services is a major factor needed to improve the delivery of dental care and the dental health of Australian children. Monitoring the caries severity of Australian children and predicting future caries severity is an integral aspect of preparing information for such planning. This has become a major feature of the School Dental Services in Australia, through their evaluation and planning systems which draw upon the Child Dental Health Survey data.</PARA>
<PARA> The School Dental Services seem to have overcome three common deficiencies in the use of caries severity data for service planning. First, there is a general awareness of how such data might be used to improve the delivery of dental services within the School Dental Services. Second, the data which are collected are made accessible to the potential users, in an appropriate form, and without undue delay. Third, the skills necessary to manipulate and interpret such data are usually available within the service environment.</PARA>
<PARA> Data on dental caries severity are used to provide new insights and descriptions of what is known and what is predicted about the potential requirement for dental care for use in the planning of dental services. Improved data sources, methodology, and techniques of analysis and prediction provide a basis for better elucidation of the service delivery issues. The data also identify issues that require further study to gain a better understanding of problems, encouraging others to dispute and discuss findings. This process not only improves the information generated, but improves decision-making on the delivery of dental services.</PARA>
<PARA> Effective planning is possible only if the circumstances under which decisions on the future are made can be predicted with reasonable accuracy. This is always difficult in the long term planning of dental health services. Estimates of the size and the structure of populations may be in error, while new understanding and developments in dental care may change patterns of disease and service requirements in fundamental ways. On the other hand, the provision of key resources in the delivery of dental health care, i.e. facilities and a trained dental labourforce, are subject to substantial lead times. This paradox can only be resolved if the preparation of plans incorporates a wide range of assumptions about the future, and is an activity which is kept under continuous review as more recent information becomes available.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) Since the answer to question No. 20 (Hansard, 21 August 1990 page 1208), there has been substantial progress with the three year Pacific video training program, Pacvideo. A review of the project in Suva on 2-4 December 1990 found the project to be well-run and providing good value for money. Between July 1989 and December 1990 15 courses, involving 131 participants from Pacific Island countries, were run in various aspects of video production.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In November 1990 the Government decided to:</PARA>
<PARA> - Amend the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 (the Act) to enable Australian ratification of Montreal Protocols 3 and 4 of 1975, which introduced increased liability limits given in terms of the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Right (SDR); and,</PARA>
<PARA> - Amend the Act to fix the Australian dollar equivalents of the gold franc liability limits established in Article 22 of the Warsaw Convention (as amended by the Hague Protocol) in terms of the SDR (1 gold franc equals 0.0664 SDR).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes, the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act is to be amended as soon as practicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Australia will ratify Montreal Protocols 3 and 4 as soon as the Act has been amended.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The limits of liability for personal injury or death are currently:</PARA>
<PARA> - for contracts of carriage to which the unamended Warsaw Convention applies-125,000 gold francs;</PARA>
<PARA> - for contracts of carriage to which the Hague Protocol applies-250,000 gold francs.</PARA>
<PARA> The limits which apply to damage to baggage and cargo were not amended by the Hague Protocol. These are:</PARA>
<PARA> - for registered baggage and cargo-250 gold francs; and,</PARA>
<PARA> - for objects in charge of a passenger-5000 gold francs.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the main reasons for amending the Act is to provide a more certain basis for converting these gold franc limits into Australian dollars. Currently, the dollar value of the limits depends on the price of gold selected by the courts in conversion, which could be either the last official price or the current market price.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Six of the 19 Speakers and 5 of the 16 Presidents prior to 1983 were honoured with the award of Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. The Knight/Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG/DCMG) ranks three levels below the Companion of the Order of Australia (AC). The Companion of Honour (CH) and Knight/Dame Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB/DCB) come between these two awards.</PARA>

<PARA> (5) AO and AM rank lower than the KCMG. Decisions to confer awards and the levels of awards conferred in the Order of Australia are made by the Council for the Order. Details of deliberations of the Council for the Order of Australia are confidential.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The Council for the Order of Australia determined at its first meeting in 1975 that, as a general rule, it would not recommend awards to incumbent Members of Parliament. This was done to avoid the Order being viewed by the public as an instrument of political patronage and to preserve the independence of the Council and the Order. There have, however, been exceptions to that general rule.</PARA>
<PARA> This answer has been prepared in consultation with the Secretary of the Order of Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) Sections 16 and 24 of the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 provide guidelines for the conduct of Board and Committee members when handling matters involving conflict of interest. These guidelines require Board and Committee members to disclose direct and indirect pecuniary interests in matters considered or about to be considered by the Board and its Committees. Members are required to leave the meeting during discussion of such matters and not to take part in determining such matters. The Act also requires such disclosures be recorded in minutes of meetings.</PARA>
<PARA> At the time of appointment, Board and Committee members are required to sign a declaration that they will comply with the requirements of sections 16 or 24 respectively, of the IR&amp; Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these guidelines, the IRDB has established``Procedures for the handling of matters involving conflicts of interest''. A copy is at Attachment A.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Details of successful grant applications and favourable tax concession decisions involving significant conflicts of interest are itemised at Attachment B. Corresponding details about insignificant conflicts of interest are at Attachment C.</PARA>
<PARA> Each of these attachments consists of two parts: an earlier part from July 1986 to December 1988 and a later part from January 1989 to December 1990. The methods of collection and presentation of data differed between the two periods.</PARA>
<PARA> A conflict has been treated as `significant' if a direct beneficial link exists between a project and a member. This includes not only substantial shareholding and employment with a company grant applicant or generic grant collaborator, but also high position in a research organisation which is a grant applicant.</PARA>
<PARA> In each of the two periods seven per cent of successful grant applications or favourable tax concession decisions involve a significant conflict of interest. Insignificant conflicts occurred with fifteen per cent of successful grant applications or favourable tax concession decisions during the combined periods.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) As can be seen when examining Attachments B and C, in most cases the nature of the conflict is a remote association between a member and an applicant. This reflects the fact that the Board is scrupulous in its handling of conflict of interest issues. Members are excluded from all discussion or decision making of matters in which they have declared an interest. Their position on the Board or Committee should, in no way, unfairly assist or prejudice an application.</PARA>
<PARA> The Board's procedures have been enhanced several times in recent years and I will ensure that this vigilance is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, I consider that the current conflict of interest guidelines applying to the IRDB and its committees are appropriate and do not require strengthening.</PARA>

<PARA> What action has been taken to implement each of the nine recommendations at pages 89-91 of the ``Report of investigation into the search and rescue incident for the yacht Rockin Robin'' which was presented to the House on 18 October 1990.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3189" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="MACQUARIE">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Sea Safety Centre, which co-ordinated the search for the Rockin Robin, is now part of the newly established Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA). I am informed by AMSA that the following action has been undertaken to implement each of the nine recommendations arising out of the Report.</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATIONS RELATING TO FEDERAL SEA SAFETY CENTRE ALONE</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Arrangements should be established to ensure that a person occupying the position of Director (Sea Safety Centre) or the position of Controller (Sea Safety Centre) is available to maintain oversight of the conduct of a search from start to finish.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Sea Safety Centre continues to be manned by experienced search and rescue (SAR) operational personnel on a 24-hour basis. In addition, roster arrangements have been established by AMSA, whereby one of the persons occupying the position of Director or Controller of the Sea Safety Centre is available to oversight the strategic direction of a continuing search from start to finish. Appropriate out-of-hours arrangements, including remuneration aspects, have been recently approved by the Department of Industrial Relations.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Operational procedures for the Federal Sea Safety Centre should be reviewed to ensure that appropriate emphasis is given to:</PARA>
<PARA> * the need for active pursuit and analysis of information from all relevant sources (including crews on scene)</PARA>
<PARA> * the need for active consideration and periodic review of all possible measures for effecting rescue and for supporting persons in distress pending the completion of a rescue</PARA>
<PARA> * the need for liaison with the CAA to ensure that aircraft crews involved are briefed and debriefed with respect to any specifically maritime aspects of a particular incident</PARA>
<PARA> * the need to periodically check that all reasonable measures have been undertaken, or at least considered, by crews on the scene, and</PARA>
<PARA> * the specification of checks to be undertaken as preliminary to any consideration of a possible discontinuation of a search.</PARA>
<PARA> All procedures and associated documentation for the Sea Safety Centre have been reviewed and updated. Emphasis has been given to the recommended principles for the conduct of searches, including the need for active pursuit of relevant information from all sources and a thorough analysis of information obtained. All search and rescue staff of the Centre have been reminded of their obligation in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Training arrangements for Federal Sea Safety Centre staff should be reviewed with the aim of ensuring that staff are encouraged to adopt a rigorous and broad ranging approach to incident analysis.</PARA>
<PARA>  Training arrangements have been reviewed and updated and are designed to ensure that staff take a wide ranging approach to the analysis of problems. All staff have attended an initial training course, with more advanced courses programmed for the near future.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Management of the Federal Sea Safety Centre should periodically assess staff capabilities and performance and consider appropriate re-training opportunities where this is likely to assist the maintenance of staff performance levels.</PARA>
<PARA>  The management of AMSA and the Centre are aware of the need to assess staff capabilities periodically, particularly of persons in key SAR roles within the Centre. Retraining of staff to update knowledge and assist the maintenance of performance levels is being undertaken when necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Public education campaigns relating to small boat safety should continue to emphasise the importance of persons on a distressed craft remaining with the craft as long as possible and regarding any lifesaving equipment (e.g liferaft, dinghy) as nothing more than a last resort means of survival.</PARA>
<PARA>  A comprehensive Safety Education Article entitled `Abandoning ship and rescue phase' was issued by AMSA in January 1991 and widely distributed to fishing vessel and pleasure craft organisations and owners. The article emphasises the importance of persons on a distressed craft remaining with the craft as long as possible and reiterates the techniques of survival in a survival craft. When appropriate, this theme will continue to be emphasised in future education programs and material.</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATIONS AFFECTING OTHER SEARCH AND RESCUE ORGANISATIONS</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Procedures governing information flow between SAR organisations should be reviewed with a view to ensuring in particular that</PARA>
<PARA> * the full contents of oral reports from the aircraft on scene are communicated to the Federal Sea Safety Centre</PARA>
<PARA> * the Federal Sea Safety Centre is a standard addressee on all formal debriefs submitted by crews of search aircraft</PARA>
<PARA> * debriefs are despatched as soon as possible after the completion of a search task and not later than the end of the same day.</PARA>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) have revised relevant internal documentation to reinforce procedures to ensure that the information flow to the Sea Safety Centre is efficient and that full information from crews on scene is despatched to the centre in a timely manner. Sea Safety staff now utilise phone-patch facilities to talk direct to crews on scene when appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The standards for Air Sea Rescue Kits should be reviewed with a view to providing for the inclusion of appropriate homing devices in all kits used by SAR organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>  Standards for Air Sea Rescue Kits have been examined and tests on the inclusion of homing devices have been carried out recently. Radio beacons are being progressively included in all kits used by the RAAF and CAA. These beacons operate on different frequencies to the normal Electronic Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) but will enable positive identification and tracking by aircraft subsequent to the dropping of liferafts.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The feasibility of establishing supplies of pumping equipment suitable for dropping to small craft in distress should be investigated.</PARA>
<PARA>  Several pumps and associated equipment capable of being dropped to vessels taking water and in distress have been purchased and established at strategic locations around the country. The pumps are intended to be dropped to assist vessels taking water and in distress to remain afloat pending the arrival of a rescue craft. Training of aircrews in the specialised dropping techniques has been undertaken and is now part of CAA ongoing training.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The feasibility of more regular liaison between SAR staff at the working level in the Federal Sea Safety Centre and the Civil Aviation Authority should be explored</PARA>
<PARA> * including the suggestion by CAA that, where possible, an appropriate liaison officer be provided from SeaSafety to a Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) and from CAA to SeaSafety to assist in relevant matters during a major incident.</PARA>
<PARA> Opportunities for liaison between operational staff of the Sea Safety Centre and regional staff of the CAA are being taken whenever possible and will continue to receive priority. AMSA and the CAA have agreed that liaison officers will be made available to assist in incidents where considered necessary and when appropriate officers are available.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1,320 places were initially allocated early in 1990/91 to the Middle Eastern component of the Refugee and Humanitarian Program. Overall, the Program was set at 11,000 places, including a contingency reserve of 1,000 places.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to changing requirements for refugee and humanitarian places in late l990/early 1991, I adjusted the allocations for individual regional programs and activated the contingency reserve.</PARA>
<PARA> The Middle Eastern component of the Program now stands at 2,839 places. As a result, it is now the second highest component after Indochina. It provides for people from a range of countries and situations in the region, including needs which may emerge as a result of the crisis in the Gulf. Within the overall numbers, flexibility will be maintained to respond to changing needs and priorities arising from the unpredictable nature of political events which give rise to refugee movements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A simple calculation suggests a single rate of around 7 1/2 per cent applied to an adjusted private final consumption expenditure base would raise sufficient revenue to replace that presently collected by the existing wholesale sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA> The base used here excludes from private final consumption expenditure on health, education, financial services and dwelling rent, however, inputs into these exempted categories are included in the base. It is further assumed that no net revenue is collected from excisable products (petrol, tobacco and alcohol) following the introduction of a consumption tax, effectively excluding them from the base.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The ``Advance Australia'' and ``Australian Made'' logos are an integral part of the ``Advance Australia'' and ``Buy Australian'' campaigns administered by the Advance Australia Foundation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no legislative bar. However, I am advised by the Secretary of the Order of Australia that the Council for the Order of Australia determined at its first meeting in 1975 that, as a general rule, it would not recommend awards to incumbent Members of Parliament. This was done to avoid the Order being viewed by the public as an instrument of political patronage and to preserve the independence of the Council and the Order. There have, however, been exceptions to that general rule.</PARA>
