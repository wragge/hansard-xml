<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the House is a package of six Bills-the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill, the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill, the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Bill, the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Bill, the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill and the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``the House is of the opinion that the Bill should not be proceeded with until the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration conducts a thorough inquiry into, and reports on:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the regulatory and prudential requirements necessary to ensure that life and general insurance funds are operated so as to maximize returns to policy holders and protect their investments, and on proposals to achieve the same and the costs and benefits of such; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the costs likely to be borne by policyholders in funds levied under the associated levy proposals, the benefits to policy holders in funds receiving the benefit of the levy and the general desirability of the proposed levy''. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that superannuation is assuming greater importance in the national financial structure of Australia. Superannuation is to be encouraged. If people are able to provide for their own retirement they have the opportunity to provide for themselves a better standard of living in their retirement. This has commensurate benefits to the national accounts. If people provide for their own retirement this will, in due course, lessen the costs to the revenue in terms of aged pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a matter of dramatic importance in Australia as the proportion of our population ages, as proportionately more people go on to the aged pension or go into retirement compared with those who are in active working life and paying taxes.  It is of vital importance in this country that people are encouraged to take up superannuation arrangements. It is estimated that, as at December 1990, $125 billion will be invested in superannuation funds. The former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), has estimated that there could be as much as $600 billion by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to encourage people to provide for their own retirement and take up the option of superannuation, one thing we need to do above all else is ensure that there are stable rules which govern superannuation and life insurance-rules that are laid down in advance that people know about so that they can make their own decisions when taking out policies and investing in superannuation. There need to be rules that have certainty. People who invest today need to know that the rules that apply to the benefit they are going to receive in 20 or 30 years time-maybe more-will still be applicable. </PARA>
<PARA> People need to be able to make informed decisions in the knowledge that the rules will be stable and will guarantee the integrity of the decision making process. They need to know that they have the opportunity to choose a good investment rather than a bad investment. They need to know that they will be protected against fraudulent activity which may rob them of their lifetime insurance or lifetime superannuation. They need to know that there will be rules which will maximise returns to them and provide the best possible benefits to them in their retirement. They also need to know that their assets will not run the risk of dissipation by reason of fraud or fraudulent conduct of one kind or another. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vitally important that this Parliament gets it right-that it gets it right by establishing long term stable rules for the benefit of policyholders and also for the benefit of those administering the funds. The people administering the funds need to be able, in the best way possible, to look after the interests of their policyholders. </PARA>
<PARA> In this respect, the Government has dragged its heels. The Government has not paid sufficient attention over the last couple of years to ensuring a proper prudential and supervisory regime in relation to the life insurance and superannuation industry. The Government has not paid enough attention to protecting the interests of investors. </PARA>
<PARA> This package comes forward today not because the Government has been carefully and in a measured way trying to put into place that framework, as it should have been doing over the last eight years of its term of office, but because of what can only be described as a scandal in the life insurance and superannuation industry. Make no mistake about it, this package of Bills has come forward now in response to a specific crisis in relation to Occidental Life and Regal Life funds. </PARA>
<PARA> As is common knowledge and as has been reported widely in the press, the Battery Group was to settle the sale of two life insurance companies-Occidental Life and Regal Life-in September of last year. An amount of $65m was to be paid as a deposit for the purchase of the funds on that day. The $65m was in fact paid. The Battery Group upstreamed that in reduction of its liabilities to the Commonwealth Bank, which received the sum of approximately $57m. The ANZ Bank received the sum of approximately $8m. It now appears, however, that the $65m deposit to be paid by the purchaser of the funds came out of the funds themselves. The assets of the purchase were used for the purchase transaction. This has left those statutory funds short to the tune of $65m. </PARA>
<PARA> Litigation is currently proceeding to unravel liability in relation to that. I do not comment on what the outcome of that litigation may be. But litigation has been commenced against those who may have had an involvement in this transaction and against the financial institutions through which the transfers were arranged. For my part-and I believe for the part of the Government and members of the Opposition as well-I hope that these proceedings result in an outcome which will protect the interests of those who had their savings in the Occidental and Regal groups. </PARA>
<PARA> We have profound sympathy for those who had invested in the Occidental and Regal groups, those who had placed their savings in those funds, those who now run the risk of not having those entitlements paid out because of conduct which appears, on the face of it, to be fraudulent. We hope that as a result of that litigation those moneys can be returned and those investors can be protected. </PARA>
<PARA> I should make it clear that the $65m has not disappeared. It has not been taken by a fly-by-night character who has removed it from the jurisdiction. The $65m is still there. It is held by the Commonwealth Bank and the ANZ Bank-admittedly in reduction of liabilities that were owed to those banks by the Battery Group, but the money is there. I have always thought that there was a simple solution to this problem; that is, if the transactions were reversed, the $65m would come back to Occidental and Regal, the liability of the Battery Group to those banks would stand, and nobody would be in a worse position than they were when this transaction took place. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not suggest for a moment that the banks have no right to keep that money. Under principles of law, they do. But there is a way out of this impasse that would leave nobody in a worse position than they were as at 27 September 1990. I do not know what the Government has done to investigate that possibility. The former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, was questioned about this in the Parliament, but he took the view that it was no responsibility of his to try to have those funds returned. In fact, when the former Treasurer was questioned in this Parliament back in November 1990 he was adamant that there was no need to return the funds because the whole thing would be fixed up by a voluntary levy on other life insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA> I questioned the Treasurer on whether the other funds had voluntarily decided to levy themselves to make good this loss or whether they had been coerced into it by the threat of legislation. The Treasurer was adamant that there had been no threat of legislation against the life offices at that stage. They had voluntarily come forward to impose this levy upon themselves to fix up the problem. He said on 7 November that the life offices understood the gravity of this position, that the life offices spent a lot of time and gave a lot of attention to them, and that they saw the importance to their industry. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it did not require any . . . pressure or arm twisting from the Government to bring the major life funds into this issue. They brought themselves into it. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, on 12 November the Treasurer was asked whether the life offices had been told about possible legislation. `Not that I am aware of', said the Treasurer. The matter was again revisited in a second question on 12 November 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> One can imagine our surprise, having had those assurances from the then Treasurer that there had been no spectre or threat of legislation, to see legislation actually introduced into this House to levy the funds to make up the shortfall in Occidental and Regal Life. One can imagine our surprise when this package of Bills came forward. Make no mistake about it: although it is a package, and only two of the six Bills refer to a levy, this package has been brought forward by those events in relation to Occidental and Regal. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a report made on the whole transaction surrounding the Occidental and Regal saga by Mr R. Grellman, who took office as a judicial administrator of the funds. To my knowledge, that report has not been tabled in the Parliament, and I am surprised at that. There was no reference to it during the Minister's second reading speeches; no attention seems to have been paid to the recommendations that were made; and one cannot help getting the feeling that the Government, by reason of the levy which it now proposes, would like to sweep this sad and sorry saga under the carpet. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Grellman reported that he thought there should be an examination pursuant to section 597 of the Corporations Act. He was concerned about the transactions regarding the sale. He said all transactions exhibit the common feature that the company is not presently in possession of sufficiently complete information to ensure protection of the interests of policyholders. He was scathing in his report as to the way in which these funds had been administered. This raises the spectre either that the regulators were not performing properly or that the legislation was not sufficient to allow them to perform properly. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not seen any statement of concern or, indeed, any interest from this Government about those particular issues. There is no reference at all to the Grellman report in this package of legislation. The Government ought to come in here, table the Grellman report, state quite clearly who it considers to be responsible, state quite clearly what it intends to do about sheeting home liability to those responsible, and state quite clearly that it will give every support to the regulatory authorities-the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the Australian Securities Commission and other regulatory authorities-who have a responsibility in this area to investigate and to bring to justice those who are responsible. Its failure to do so is a major shortcoming in relation to those Occidental Life and Regal Life investors, who at the moment are $65m short. Those who are responsible ought to be brought to justice and the Government ought to concentrate and focus its mind very clearly on bringing to justice those who were involved. It owes that to the Occidental and Regal policyholders-and not just to them; it owes that to the community. After all, the Government is charged with administering the law. It owes it to the community to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice. </PARA>
<PARA> I have this worrying, disturbing, nagging feeling that the Government would like to see this problem go away rather than engage in the very hard work of identifying where it went wrong and what its responsibility was and rather than indicate quite clearly what it intends to do about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has deep and pressing concerns about the proposal for the levy in this legislation. What is proposed is that the Parliament will enact legislation enabling life and superannuation companies to be levied up to $65m to provide a fund which could be drawn down by those administering the Occidental and Regal funds to make good the shortfall. As I understand it, there is provision in the Bill for those moneys to be repaid in the event of the litigation proving successful and the $65m coming back through the law into the funds themselves. But there are a lot of questions about this levy that is proposed in relation to life and superannuation companies. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, if $65m is drawn from the other life and superannuation companies, what is the effect of that on those policyholders? Does this mean that policyholders in other funds are going to be $65m poorer; that they are going to see the dissipation of some of their own investments to cover this particular fraud? What is the effect in dollar terms of this particular levy? Secondly, what is the value of this levy to those who have policies in Occidental Life and Regal Life? Will it enable them to get 100c in the dollar? How much will it cover?</PARA>
<PARA> I take great heart from the fact that the levy is not supposed to cover bad investment decisions; and, as we know, there have been bad investment decisions in Occidental Life and Regal Life which may have created a liability even in excess of the loss of the fraud. How much; how far will the $65m go in protecting those particular policyholders? We need to know what the costs are; we need to know what the benefits are; we need on the public record a statement by the other life and superannuation companies as to what their attitude is-whether they consider this a proper discharge of the obligations they owe to their policyholders; whether they consider it is in the interests of their policyholders; how it is going to affect their policyholders. Policyholders in the AMP and the National Mutual and other funds have a right to know what the effect of this particular legislation is going to be upon their investment. </PARA>
<PARA> We have recommended that this legislation go off to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, so that the Committee can investigate it, take evidence and get on the public record the attitude of the other funds and the attitude of the judicial administrator. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it clear: we do not for a moment want to hold up this proposal. We want to know whether the proposal is a good one. If the evidence is taken, and it appears from the public evidence that it is a good proposal, then there is a warrant for the Parliament proceeding, but at the moment it is being asked to punt in the dark. We do not think we should treat the policyholders, in the funds which would be levied, with such disregard. We think that the Parliament ought to show an interest in their views before it legislates in this matter. That is why I urge the Government to support our move to refer this legislation to the House of Representatives Standing Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the package concerns acquisitions and takeovers in relation to the insurance industry generally. This Bill will provide for a control over the acquisition of assets or shares in insurance companies. The Bill is quite extensive and it confers very wide powers upon the Minister. It provides that there is to be a trigger point of 15 per cent, where a person is to increase his control by 15 per cent in relation to shares and assets. That has to be notified. The Minister can give a temporary stay order, or a permanent one, on various grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not for a moment want to criticise the drafting of this particular legislation, because it is a complicated area, but the provisions are very complex. We believe that they warrant investigation in order to see how they will work and whether they will work. For example, the Minister will have the power to grant a permanent restraining order if satisfied that the change in ownership of shares or assets is contrary to the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 5 of the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill 1991 tells us what is deemed to be contrary to the public interest. Something is deemed to be contrary to the public interest if, for example, it is `likely to result in an unsuitable person being in a position of influence over the company'. What does that mean? What does it mean when it says, `an unsuitable person being in a position of influence'? What does it mean when it says that the person is unsuitable? We should remember that this is at the Minister's discretion. What does it mean when it says `a position of influence'?</PARA>
<PARA> Another ground on which an acquisition can be prevented is where it is likely to unduly concentrate economic power in the Australian general insurance industry. What does that mean? What is the threshold test? How is the Minister going to decide it? I know the Minister can lay down principles, but how is he going to decide what those principles should be? This is very wide legislation. How does it mesh with other controls over the insurance industry? For example, there was a proposed merger between the ANZ Bank and National Mutual. The then Treasurer intervened to stop that, not under this particular legislation, but under his control of the banking industry. </PARA>
<PARA> How will these proposals sit with controls over the banking industry? How will these proposals sit with controls in the Trade Practices Act, which also has another test of mergers and acquisitions? There is also a provision in the legislation for the Minister to stop an acquisition if it is contrary to the national interest. What does `contrary to the national interest' mean? That could mean absolutely anything. I do not criticise the drafting of the legislation, because the draftsmen have, no doubt, acted on the instructions that were given to them, but it is poorly thought through. This shows all the signs of a knee-jerk reaction to this crisis in Occidental and Regal. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not know whether it will work well-or whether it will work at all-how it will mesh in with other provisions and what it will mean in practice. The Government cannot give us any answers to those questions because, if it is honest, it does not know either. That is why we say the matter should go off to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. That Committee has done an inquiry into the banking industry, and it is looking at supervision and prudential controls in that industry. It can in the course of that inquiry look at supervision and prudential controls in the insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to make a determined effort to get these rules right, to mesh them well together, to make them comprehensive and to lay them down in a thoughtful way rather than in a knee-jerk way. The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill deals with prudential controls. That too should be examined. The supervisory levies, which increase the amount that insurance and life insurance companies pay for supervision, can be examined. We need to know how much this will cost; how much will be recovered by way of the supervisory levies; whether the levies, as set, are adequate or whether they are too high; what the cost will be; and what the level of recovery for this supervision will be. </PARA>
<PARA> All the facts point to the result that we should have a thorough inquiry into these proposals. If the Minister wants to say that the Finance and Public Administration Committee is the wrong committee or that it is too busy, we will accept that, but he should put a proposal as to what committee can carry out an inquiry. We would even support the Minister if he wanted to have a select committee of people who perhaps are not so busy as those on the Finance and Public Administration Committee. I see the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) there; he might volunteer for that committee. No doubt he would have some interesting views on this. How will we mesh this and how will we put it all together? These are the questions that desperately need to be answered.</PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday's Budget outlined proposals for increasing taxes on employers who do not pay superannuation, designed to force superannuation from employers and produce more funds for superannuation investments over the future. Obviously the Government is very concerned about the level of prudential supervision that will be conducted in relation to the moneys that will be raised. The Government ought to be very concerned about its proposal because the proposal is misguided; but, given that the proposal will go ahead as a Budget measure, this Government being the current government, it is concerned about prudential controls. </PARA>
<PARA> I was astounded that yesterday, as part of the Budget release, we had a statement by the Treasurer on prudential supervision of the superannuation industry. The Government says that it does not believe it can, or should, attempt to guarantee funds. I think that it is going down the right track there. It goes on to say that we should minimise risks and that there should be adequate legislative sanctions. We have common law controls on trustees, we have the corporations law control on trustees, we have the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, and we have the Trade Practices Act. Where is the thought about meshing all of those into a coherent platform?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government itself does not believe the package is right, because riddled through this statement are announcements about further investigations the Government has to make. On page 2 of paper No. 1 attached to the statement on prudential supervision of the superannuation industry, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, while prudential policies should lessen the risk of fraudulent or criminal behaviour, action to remedy such behaviour must ultimately be addressed by law enforcement agencies rather than prudential supervisors. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Government said yesterday: law enforcement agencies should protect against fraudulent or criminal behaviour. Today there is no proposal for a law enforcement agency to do anything about Occidental and Regal Life, but there is a proposal for a supervisory levy. The Government's own statement of yesterday conflicts with the thrust of its legislation today. Paper No. 1 goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a need to ensure that the prudential framework for the superannuation industry is appropriate . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is a need to ensure that. The Government says it will look at that. On page 5 the document says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government proposes to develop a prudential framework which fosters rather than inhibits competitiveness . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course the Government ought to be developing a prudential framework to foster competitiveness. Yesterday's statement said, `We are proposing to develop it'-so let us do it. The Government will get our help. Why would the Government proceed with this legislation when it is saying in its Budget statement that there is a lot of work to be done-`We are proposing to develop it.'? In its statement of yesterday the Government is not saying, `It is already done; it is here in this package': it is saying, `We are still proposing to do it; it is yet to come; there is more work to be done'. Of course there is more work to be done. That is why these Bills are not adequate at the moment and should be referred for further discussion. The statement goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is examining improved and more direct enforcement powers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is still examining more direct and improved enforcement powers. If the Government is examining them, why do we not send this proposal to a committee and examine them? Why pass legislation here when the Government admits that it is still working on a package? This is half-baked and the Government runs the very real risk of getting it wrong. We know we are going to have to come back here anyway, so why do we not get it right? The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is also considering possible measures to control entry to the superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is currently examining the possibility of requiring superannuation funds and institutions . . . to be subject to additional solvency. </PARA>
<PARA>The whole of the Government's statement of yesterday contradicts the thrust of this legislation. Anyone who gives adequate thought to this will know that this package is not sufficient. The Government does not even know whether it is necessary. It has real problems in the area and it ought to cooperate with the Opposition to get the whole supervisory framework right. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government ought to support our calls to get it right from the outset in a measured and considered way, rather than react in a knee-jerk way with the real and present risk of creating major problems down the track in relation not only to prudential and supervisory requirements but also indemnity against fraud. This package is not ready for passing by this Parliament and it ought to be referred to a House committee. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am attracted to the idea that at last recognition has been given to the role played by parliamentary committees in looking at legislation and a range of issues that come before this place, and that at last there is recognition that backbenchers in this place-people from both sides of the Parliament-can develop an area of expertise and that they can bring that area of expertise to bear onto legislative requirements and legislation that has been introduced into this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am attracted also to the suggestion by the honourable member and shadow spokesman that in this area of insurance and prudential supervision it is the committee which I have the privilege to chair that has developed the expertise and the fundamental responsibility for looking at issues. To that extent, I find that I do have a degree of sympathy with the view that he has put. But I would like to go to some of the issues that he has raised and then we may see that the options associated with that are not necessarily closed off by the work that is being done at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The heart of what was being suggested to us this morning by the honourable member for Higgins was that there was a need to ensure that the prudential supervisory regime is put in place not only for the insurance Bills that we are debating but also for superannuation. I take it a step further in terms of the role being played by the banking industry in this country. We can extend it into the financial sector of the Australian economy, because over the past several months, during our inquiry into the Australian banking industry, we have taken a great deal of evidence, and I have spoken on a number of occasions in different forums, about the need to enhance prudential supervision in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I have taken it upon myself to raise a few issues in public forums to see the sort of response that I would get. I think it is worth spending a bit of time on that particular issue now. As it stands at the moment, in this country essentially three levels of supervision exist. The Reserve Bank of Australia is charged with the responsibility of supervising banks as defined by the Banking Act. In that way, it takes into consideration the four major banks, the foreign banks that are operating in this country and also, by an arrangement, the State banks. The Reserve Bank therefore has the role of looking after the prudential supervisory requirements of those organisations. It imposes capital adequacy ratios; it requires information to be made available so that on a day-to-day basis it can supervise the banks of this country in such a way that people can sleep well at night knowing that their money basically is safe. </PARA>
<PARA> At the second level, we have the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. It is that body which is directly responsible for the supervision of insurance and superannuation, to which the honourable member for Higgins was referring to in his contribution today. In the legislation before this House, we are seeing changes in the solvency ratios for both life insurance and general insurance. Therefore, we are seeing the ante being upped in terms of prudential guidelines in reference to insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> As pointed out yesterday by the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) in his Budget speech, we are also seeing the Government flagging that there are to be changes in superannuation prudential supervision as well. Therefore, the responsible body-the Insurance and Superannuation Commission-which will take the role of supervising and ensuring that the guidelines are adhered to by life insurance companies, general insurance companies, superannuation funds and the like-will have those guidelines in place as a result of the measures we are debating in this package of legislation and in the measures which will come forward in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> At the third level, we have this new body called AFIC that has been developed. AFIC is going to be a body responsible for looking after building societies, credit unions and friendly societies. Again it will put in place general guidelines and prudential supervisory regimes but with the proviso, of course, that State governments, which have the responsibility for administering prudential supervision of those particular bodies, will have to pass legislation at the State level to set those guidelines in legislative form. It would be responsible for having a supervisor, whether it be in a Ministry for Consumer Affairs, Ministry for Housing or whatever it might be, responsible for the day-to-day supervision of those forms of financial institutions in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> That sounds all well and good. In fact, it is the Treasury and Reserve Bank line that that is what we should have in this country. It is the line that has been put to our inquiry, to which the honourable member for Higgins would rather see these Bills also directed at this point in time for further examination. It is the line seen in the Budget statement which came down yesterday with its reference to changes to superannuation prudential supervision. It is interesting that it would come down at this time because another issue-the honourable member for Higgins touched on this and it is directly related to this-is the plethora of supervisory bodies that have been established. As I have mentioned, there are three bodies that are directly responsible, but then there are a whole range of others that are associated as well, particularly when one starts looking at the fraudulent area: the Cash Transaction Report Agency and all the rest that have been established over time. </PARA>
<PARA> As we go down this path in Australia at the moment of financial conglomeration taking place, with banks tying themselves to life and general insurance companies and getting involved with superannuation funds and so on, because at the end of the day we might see some over-arching financial conglomeration being at the base and at the heart of what the Australian finance industry is going to resemble- one has to question whether we in fact need so many of those supervisory bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> I throw that up again because it is an issue which our Committee is giving consideration to as we prepare our report on the Australian banking industry for tabling in Parliament in November. Whilst some people might criticise us and suggest we have gone outside our terms of reference and that we are, after all, only supposed to be looking at banking, I can say now that with the growth of superannuation and life insurance there is the need to bring these supervisory and prudential standards into play through legislation today, and as has been targeted by the Treasurer in the statement that he released yesterday as part of the Budget, because the banks and the financial intermediaries in this country are becoming more blurred. Financial conglomeration is a fact of life not only here but also in Europe, the United States, Canada and everywhere else. We have to be prepared for it. </PARA>
<PARA> I go to another point, one on which I do agree to some extent with the honourable member for Higgins. It is well and good for us to look now, with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight and of knowledge of what has happened in the past, and to suggest the sorts of things that we need to put in place now. We can all do that. But we must also have a little bit of forward thinking, a little bit of vision. If we are to see this relationship between financial institutions in this country becoming more and more a real part of financial Australia, we have to be sure that the regulators are performing properly, that the regulators have the guidelines in place to meet the needs of and to protect the deposits of those people who choose to put their money into banks, superannuation funds, insurance or whatever it happens to be. We must be satisfied that the Government does have the appropriate mechanisms in place to meet those needs. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that the honourable member for Higgins has left the chamber. I am convinced that as far as insurance is concerned, by increasing the requirements associated with the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1991 in respect of solvency and minimum capital requirements and so on, we are meeting some of those needs. By boosting the actual level of solvency required in each of the insurance companies and so on, we are taking the appropriate steps to see that fly-by-nighters will not simply come into the marketplace, rip people off and then disappear, thereby creating the same problem as has been identified with Occidental Life and Regal Life. There must be a legitimate business, it must have legitimate solvency ratios and it must have legitimate capital ratios and capital adequacy before there can be a start. That is appropriate to meet the needs of the 1990s and beyond. This legislation does that. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the concern I have about the whole question of supervision, the whole question of the blurring of financial conglomerates in this country. I come to the point about whether perhaps a megasupervisor is required to look after all those things. That is an issue which our Committee will examine. It is an issue that we have talked about to date. We will come to a conclusion about it and we will possibly make a recommendation to this Parliament about it, based on the evidence we have now. </PARA>
<PARA> In reference again to the Opposition's amendment, which seeks to send to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration this whole package of Bills for re-examination, I might say that our Committee has been looking at the banking industry, at financial conglomeration, at the role played by banks in getting into superannuation and life insurance, which these Bills are concerned with, since October last year. We are in the last three months of our inquiry, the last three months of examination before bringing down a report in this Parliament. It is a bit late in the day for those on the Opposition side to now raise their concerns in this Parliament and to say, `Let's stop the legislation going through; let's hive it off to that Committee because it is examining these sorts of issues'. We have been doing it all along. </PARA>
<PARA> I might just say to the honourable member for Higgins that the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), who is Deputy Chairman of our Committee and who sits on the Opposition side of the Parliament, has been raising these issues in public hearings. He has been raising these issues with the banks and with superannuation fund managers and a range of other people. </PARA>
<PARA> The option the honourable member for Higgins would like-namely, examining these sorts of issues, such as the regulatory and prudential requirements necessary to ensure that life and general insurance funds are operated so as to maximise returns to policy holders and protect their investments and so on-may still happen even after we table this report. One of the recommendations that might come forward, which we are toying with at present and on which we will be gathering evidence next week in the United States and Canada, is the issue of whether, because of the important role played by financial institutions in this country-be they banks, building societies, credit unions, superannuation funds, et cetera-there is now a need, as in the United States and Canadian parliaments, to have a permanent banking and finance committee established. </PARA>
<PARA> Had there been such a committee, this package of Bills might, if the Minister so determined, have had the opportunity to examine the implications of what was being proposed. Given the level of expertise now being developed by backbench members of this Parliament who have taken the time and effort to read submissions and all the information that is around on issues such as superannuation, banking, life insurance and their interrelationships and so on, they should be given the opportunity to examine these sorts of issues. That may be something that will come out of our committee inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> It will not be too late-as has been suggested by the honourable member for Higgins-to look at some of the things that are necessary in relation to superannuation as announced by the Treasurer yesterday. They are still under consideration. We are still looking at the way in which things need to be done. It is still possible to achieve that aim, not necessarily now but a little later on, and it is probably desirable that that be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> One or two other issues were also raised by the honourable member for Higgins in his presentation this morning on behalf of the Opposition. I refer particularly to the acquisition and takeovers legislation that we are dealing with here in respect of insurance companies. The 15 per cent rule is in place. We have already seen that the Treasurer has had reason in the past to look at that rule very carefully. Again, it is in reference to banks and relationships established between banks and life companies over the last 18 months or so. Honourable members will remember that there was a proposal for a merger between the ANZ Bank and National Mutual. The Treasurer of the day determined that it was not in the national interest for that to proceed, but I notice in recent media speculation that they are starting to talk again, looking at a new arrangement that might be entered into. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen a relationship entered into between Westpac and Chase AMP where AMP insurance is now going to be offered by the Westpac Bank through its 3,000 branches. In response to that, people have said that that is good because they will have the opportunity of going to their local Westpac branches right around Australia to get information on insurance packages being offered by the AMP Society. That is fine as far as it goes, but the point is that that 15 per cent rule we have instituted through the legislation today is appropriate to meet the needs and the circumstances of the changing financial situation of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The public interest and the question of fit and proper person-who is the person who can ensure that the funds are being operated appropriately-was also raised by the honourable member for Higgins. For his benefit, the concern the Government has as to who is a fit and proper person goes to the very heart of what he was arguing at the start of his presentation, that is, the problem about fraud and fraudulent activities. The fit and proper clause that has been included here basically prevents companies from appointing people who have been convicted of offences or dishonest conduct as principal executive officer or director of a life or general insurance company. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what a fit and proper person means here. We do not want crooks in the system. We do not want people who have been convicted of being fraudulent in the past. We are taking appropriate measures to see that they do not get their grubby little hands on the levers of the top half of the company and then drive them down and cause problems for people who have invested their hard-earned funds in these sorts of insurance companies. The honourable member should not worry any longer about a fit and proper person and those sorts of people who are likely to come into influential positions within life insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to where I commenced. Whilst I have a great degree of sympathy-I am pleased that the Opposition has recognised the standing of the Committee which I have the pleasure to chair; my colleague the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), who will follow me in this debate, is a very valued member-I believe that referring this package of legislation to the Committee at this stage would not necessarily achieve the aim that the honourable member for Higgins would like to see. I am saying to him that the issue in general terms is now being examined by the Committee. We are looking at it. There is a real opportunity and a real likelihood that we will be making recommendations about this question of prudential supervision of not only life companies but also superannuation funds, the banks in general in this country and financial operations as well. Again, I say to the honourable member: do not be too excited if the Government does not accept this amendment, although I am always pleased to receive more work for our Committee. </PARA>

<PARA> There is no problem about putting this package of Bills through at the moment but we have to put in place something in the meantime. To that extent, I commend the Treasurer for bringing these Bills into the House for debate today. I think it is a welcome and necessary part of the changing financial circumstances of this country that we take on board the need for further examination and consideration of prudential supervision and that we put in place appropriate standards and guidelines, not only in life insurance, as we are today, but in superannuation, trust funds and certainly in the banking industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), I observe at the outset that two Bills in this package of six insurance Bills are designed to protect the policyholders of the Occidental Life and the Regal Life insurance companies from the consequences of the collapse of those two companies. Other Bills in the package seek to enhance the prudential standards required of the industry and provide for greater supervision of the industry by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Bill and the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Bill provide for the levying of registered life insurance companies in Australia. The levy is to be based on the total assets of each company and paid out of the assets of the companies' statutory funds. These funds will be placed in a life insurance policyholders protection fund under the auspices of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The fund will be used to cover the losses of Occidental Life and Regal Life. The total amount to be raised this way has been limited to $65m. The levy is said to be a one-off affair that will cover only the loss due to the alleged fraud from the statutory funds of Occidental and Regal Life. </PARA>
<PARA> The Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill puts in place mechanisms for screening changes in the ownership and control of life insurance and general insurance companies. Any changes in ownership or control above a 15 per cent threshold will now require the notification of and approval from the responsible Minister. The Minister is to be required to make a determination on any matter within 30 days to allow the change to go ahead or to prohibit the proposed transaction or to place conditions on that transaction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill increases the minimum capital solvency requirements for general and life insurance companies under the existing legislation. The Bill increases the minimum amount of paid up share capital for general insurers from $500,000 to $2m. The amount by which the value of the assets of a company incorporated in Australia must exceed its liabilities is increased from $1m to $2m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian assets of any company must also exceed its Australian liabilities by $2m under the new measures being increased from the $1m provided for under the existing legislation. The minimum capital requirement for a life company with share capital has increased from $2m to $10m. Companies without share capital must maintain assets of at least $10m. Registered life offices must now also maintain an excess of $5m of assets over liabilities to be held outside statutory funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill and the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill provide for increases in the statutory upper limits for the setting of supervisory levies, accompanied by phasing in arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> This package of Bills and the exceptional circumstances that led to their introduction in this place raise two main issues. The first is the question of who, if anyone other than the policyholders themselves, should pay for the bail-out of the policyholders of Occidental Life and Regal Life. The second issue is what regulatory arrangements, if any, should be put in place to prevent this sort of thing happening again and how such arrangements can be made to work. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of who should be required to support the bail-out of Occidental and Regal Life is an extremely difficult and complex one. This is because the circumstances in which $65m worth of Occidental and Regal Life policyholders' funds went for an unscheduled walk around a number of financial institutions are so bizarre that it is difficult for anyone outside the Government, if not impossible, to fairly assign full responsibility for these events. It is absolutely extraordinary that Occidental Life and Regal Life should be purchased with their own statutory funds. This is testimony to the elaborate nature of the confidence trick that was perpetrated against some of the parties to these transactions. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal participant in this affair, Mr Phillip Carver, somehow caused the Bank of Melbourne to draw $65m from the account of Occidental and Regal in part payment for the purchase of the same two companies from the Battery Group Ltd on behalf of Carver's shelf company, Heath Holdings. These funds were drawn in favour of two banks and were passed on immediately by Battery to those institutions as repayment to them of outstanding loans. When further funds in support of the sale failed to materialise, Battery stopped the sale but not before $65m was safely in the hands of Battery Group's bank creditors. Naturally, the banks feel under no obligation to return these funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The net result of these transactions to date is that the life offices are now technically insolvent and a judicial manager has been appointed to preside over them. The Battery Group has posted losses of $132m after writing off funds owing to it as a result of the aborted sale of Occidental and Regal. How these transactions were authorised and which of the parties acted improperly is now the subject of a massive legal wrangle between Occidental and Regal, the Bank of Melbourne, the Battery Group and some 19 other parties to the dispute before the Supreme Court of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to have been reluctantly agreed that, in order to maintain confidence in the insurance industry, the policyholders of Occidental Life and Regal Life should be supported by a one-off rescue package. Without such a package, the policyholders of these two companies will each clearly suffer considerable losses. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this legislation, it will be the policyholders with other insurance companies who will foot the bill for the aborted sale of these two companies. Needless to say, this is an entirely arbitrary imposition. There is no particular reason why policyholders with other firms should be required to bail-out the policyholders of Occidental Life and Regal Life, other than that they happen to be in the same industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The inequity of this arrangement was largely responsible for the failure of the industry itself to put together a voluntary rescue package for the two companies, using its own resources. It may be that there are legal reasons for not doing so but no-one from the Government or industry will give a full explanation, and that is one reason why we would like the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in the absence of a satisfactory legal settlement, it is difficult to nominate any other party who should be required to foot the bill, assuming that that party, or parties, would still be in a fit financial state to do so. There is a strong argument from some that the taxpayer should foot the bill for this bail-out, on the grounds that the aborted sale was the result of a failure by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to properly supervise the relevant transactions. It is argued that the Government already levies the industry to pay for various supervisory mechanisms and so the industry is entitled to some sort of return from that service, rather than being levied yet again to finance the failure of those mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure is not so much the fault of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission itself; it is a failure by the Government to provide adequate resources to the Commission to enable it to carry out its assigned tasks. I hope to find the time to address that important subject in more detail in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The main point to be made is that no matter who pays for the rescue package, it sends out the wrong signals to industry participants. Although this levy is billed as a one-off measure, unlike the permanent scheme that has now been instituted in the United Kingdom, the precedent has been set for government sponsored rescues of business failures such as these. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems of Occidental Life and Regal Life have not been confined to the loss of $65m at the hands of a confidence trickster. Both companies were already suffering from poor performance which greatly contributed to the disaster that was to follow. The statutory funds of Occidental Life had low solvency margins and a mismatching of assets and liabilities was evident in its actuarial valuation report well before the aborted sale. There were disproportionately large and risky investments being held by the company's capital guaranteed funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Regal's position was propped up by a change in the basis of accounting to the Commission of certain classes of investment account policies. Otherwise, it may well have been in deficit well before the aborted sale took place and that would have been abundantly apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hardly surprising that the Battery Group was so keen-and, in the event, overly keen-to sell these two companies. In an interim report from the judicial manager, Mr Richard Grellman, it is estimated that policyholder obligations could exceed assets by somewhere in the range of $96m to $237m for the two companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The signal that the bail-out sends to the industry is that poor business practices and even fraudulent transactions will not be subject to the usual market discipline. Instead, the Government has indicated that in this situation policyholders in well-run companies can in future be expected to foot the bill. Indeed, the levy turns some of the victims of a scam into its beneficiaries, while its costs are socialised across the industry. The levy also sends a message to policyholders that they need not exercise any supervision themselves of the firms in which they place their trust since the Government can be expected to rescue them should any difficulties arise. </PARA>
<PARA> If sound business practices are to be fostered, it is important that both policyholders and industry participants be subjected to normal market discipline. Whatever the Government's assurances to the contrary, there is no reason to expect that future Labor governments will not do the same thing again in similar circumstances now that an effective precedent has been set. The industry as well as present and potential policyholders should clearly understand that the coalition in government will not be bound by such a precedent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government defends this levy by pointing to the other measures contained in this package of Bills which will improve prudential standards in the industry and subject the industry to greater regulation by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The first thing that needs to be noted about the new prudential standards and supervisory mechanisms is that they would not necessarily prevent another debacle of a similar nature from occurring again in this industry at some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Presumably, these regulatory measures will make any future fraud or commercial disaster in the industry less likely to occur. But these regulations are by no means foolproof and so the effectiveness of any of these measures must be carefully weighed against any costs that the regulations impose. </PARA>
<PARA> The danger is that too much faith will be placed in the existing regulations, as well as those proposed in these Bills, at the expense of prudent commercial practices. As the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner, Mr Richard Beetham, has said:</PARA>
<PARA>When you focus on regulation and supervision of an industry there is a tendency to forget that the primary responsibility for the prudential supervision of an organisation rests with the board of that organisation and the senior management. They are the people who have the primary responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been a tendency to blame the whole of the Occidental and Regal Life debacle on the confidence trickster who perpetrated the sting. In the event, there were many people who were responsible for what happened and who failed to exercise due caution in their commercial and other dealings. Legislation can do little to address bad business practices and we should not try to compensate for people's failings through regulatory frameworks. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be several costs associated with this legislation that will work to the detriment of the industry and policyholders. There can be little doubt that in levying efficient industry participants to bail out less efficient companies, these Bills will result in a less efficient industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The present provisions of the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill will effectively raise barriers of entry to an already uncompetitive industry. AMP and National Mutual together control 60 per cent of the life insurance market, with a number of smaller firms competing for the remainder of market share. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that one of the goals of these Bills is to prevent, according to the Minister, `undue concentration of economic power in the Australian life insurance industry'. Yet these measures could well increase such concentration if they reduce the industry's overall competitiveness. This loss of industry competitiveness will also contribute to a less efficient industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The takeovers and acquisitions provisions afford the Minister an enormous amount of discretion in relation to any changes in the structure of ownership in the industry. The end result of that discretion obviously depends upon how it is used but that in itself is a problem. The existence of ministerial discretion will become a major source of uncertainty in the commercial decision making of those in the industry. Such uncertainty can result in bad investment decisions and sub-optimal business practices. The discretion afforded the Minister in these Bills should have been heavily circumscribed so as to minimise the degree of uncertainty in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that there is a need to raise prudential standards and enhance supervisory mechanisms for the insurance industry, these regulatory measures need to be adequately funded. There is no point in having these regulations and their associated costs if they cannot be adequately enforced. Indeed, the regulations may do even more harm than good if compliance with the regulations effectively becomes optional, thereby generating more uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the principal difficulties faced by the insurance and superannuation industry is not so much the inadequacy of the regulatory framework as the failure of that framework to be adequately funded and therefore enforced. The main regulatory body is the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. It is widely accepted that this body is grossly underfunded for the task it is expected to perform. We saw this most recently with the delays experienced by the ISC in the mailing out of notices of reasonable benefit determinations for recipients of eligible termination payments, potentially affecting some 500,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA> Due to the inadequate resources of the Commission, employers and superannuation funds have not been made fully aware of their obligations to their employees, particularly with regard to the tax file number system. This has led to some 35 per cent of determinations being sent out with invalid or no tax file number information. Under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act, the ISC Commissioner is able to make an interim determination that the whole of an eligible termination is excessive and thus taxable at the individual's marginal rate where incomplete tax file number information is given. Taxpayers have been given 60 days to inform the ISC of their tax file number or the interim determination sent out by the ISC will stand. </PARA>
<PARA> This has meant that thousands of lump sum superannuation recipients are at risk of losing favourable tax treatment due to the under-resourcing of the ISC. The Government allocated barely $17m to the ISC in 1989-90, most of which was given over to the administration of our complex occupational superannuation regulations. Under these conditions it is hardly surprising that we should see a failure of regulation in the insurance industry, and while this funding situation continues we can only expect further shortcomings in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The supervisory measures in these Bills will not perform the role expected of them if enforcement of these measures is not adequately resourced. It is disturbing that these Bills, which are designed to bail out Occidental and Regal Life, will be closely followed by regulations to freeze redemptions from unlisted property trusts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I listened. What would the honourable member for Curtin do to deal with this? Would he write nasty letters or make loud noises? How would he deal with all those policyholders with Occidental and Regal Life who will not be covered? There was the stigma of nasty government sponsored rescues and the bad signals that these would send out to the industry. However, in the end, when one is in government or one has to make decisions, one is required to make a choice, and the choice here is between providing protection of policyholders or not: to say to all those people who are holders of policies in Occidental and Regal-and everybody else in the country who has a life policy or a general insurance policy-that there is no certainty in that policy, that one can be subject to fraudulent activity and, indeed, if that is the case, the industry is not then in a position, nor does it think it important enough, to take responsible action to protect people in those circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I support the view that an ongoing policy of protection for policyholders would send the wrong signals out to the industry. There could be the expectation that the insurance industry was guaranteed by the Government; there could be a removal of incentive for insurance companies to undertake sound practices; and there could be the belief that well managed companies would be paying for those that are poorly managed. It would send out the wrong messages and discourage those companies that have through a lifetime of prudent management established strength and reputations that people rely on. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the view that some sort of ongoing protection mechanism is not an appropriate response. What is an appropriate response to what has happened is a once-off situation whereby the burden of the cost is shared, whatever it might be-and unlike the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) I am not certain that it will be $65m; that is the maximum outside figure and depends on a whole lot of litigation and court proceedings presently being undertaken, and on the outcome of the judicial management of these businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not certain what that will be, but I think it is an appropriate response in this circumstance for that burden to be shared among all policyholders in that area and for the industry to be levied appropriately. A large number of industry members supported a voluntary levy; it was unfortunate that such a procedure was unable to be established. However, the Opposition has come in here today and has said, `What we need is more uncertainty and to defer this matter, put it off, and all those people who are policyholders with Occidental and Regal can wait and sweat'. That is not an appropriate way to deal with this legislation, and I think that what is being done is responsible in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the honourable member for Higgins gave a thoughtful speech. Like the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), who is the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I was attracted to the view that the Committee should look at the supervisory role and the prudential role of Australian business. It is increasingly becoming the case that the lines between the superannuation industry, the insurance industry and banking and non-banking financial institutions are becoming blurred. It is appropriate that we have some consistency in the prudential framework for all those areas of business, but that is not a reason for us to defer this package; it is not a reason for us to take appropriate steps at this time which can strengthen the supervision and prudential requirements, provide protection for those policyholders of Occidental and Regal Life, ensure that measures are undertaken that will mean that changes of ownership will be scrutinised by the Government and the effect will not be detrimental on the affairs and conduct of insurance and of the insurance industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what this package of measures is about and it is an appropriate package because it will do all these things. It does not solve the problem correctly identified by the honourable member for Higgins that we do not have a substantial and consistent framework for prudential management of the whole spectrum-superannuation, general and life insurance, banking and non-banking financial institutions and the financial sector in general. There is a requirement for that to be undertaken and I believe it would be an appropriate reference for the Committee at a later date, but it in no way defers the importance of our passing this package of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing supervision now in place in this country is encompassed by two pieces of legislation. First, there is the Life Insurance Act 1945, which regulates the operations of life insurance companies to protect policyholders. Indeed, the requirements laid down in that legislation are for levels of solvency, for registration of life insurance companies and for the maintenance of statutory funds. Those statutory funds are to be kept separate from the other funds of the business and there are certain restrictions on the use of those statutory funds. In the case of Occidental and Regal, it was those statutory funds which were misused and used in an unauthorised way. </PARA>
<PARA> That legislation, the Life Insurance Act 1945, also has a requirement for quarterly and annual returns. The Commissioner has the capacity to investigate and direct and, if he feels it is appropriate, he can elect to have judicial management in particular circumstances. Indeed, for the first time in 46 years-the time in which that legislation has been operating-that has been necessary in this case. That legislation has probably served us fairly well, but with the increasing complexity of business and business affairs it would be absurd to expect that it would not need changing and improving and upgrading. </PARA>
<PARA> The other piece of legislation that broadly provides the existing supervision is the Insurance Act 1973. This Act establishes minimal financial standards for general insurers, a minimal amount of paid-up capital and minimum solvency requirements. It provides for continuous supervision and requires annual returns and quarterly returns to be produced. It also provides for formal investigation of the activities of insurance companies and for the Commissioner to direct in various ways the supervision of those companies to be undertaken. Prior to 1973, what was believed to be the appropriate means of supervision was via deposits in the form of approved securities with the Treasury. It was when the Insurance Act 1973 was introduced that the effective solvency monitoring system was established. So we have had an evolution of legislation and, indeed, over a period we have had an improvement of the supervisory role. </PARA>
<PARA> This package of six Bills includes two Bills which relate to the supervisory level of general and life insurance companies. Basically, the legislation increases the upper limit of the supervisory levy and it also increases the rate of the supervisory levy. This will provide for increases in the staff and resources and strengthen the activities of the supervisory commission, and it is appropriate that this should be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin said that one of the problems in supervision was that the funding was inadequate. Two of these Bills provide for an increase in the funding. They provide for the supervision to be undertaken with funds that are obtained from levies on insurance companies. I would have thought that the user-pays principle that is inherent in that philosophy would be one the honourable member for Curtin would support. Indeed, if these Bills are to be deferred, as the Opposition is suggesting, it will be impossible for an increasing amount of funds to be applied to the supervisory role of the Commission. So it is appropriate that these two pieces of legislation should pass. </PARA>
<PARA> Two other pieces of legislation that relate to the protection of policyholders from Occidental and Regal Life permit regulations to be made to impose levies on life insurance companies. Those levies will provide for a measure of financial protection for those policyholders. We need to understand that the legislation provides for a mechanism of collection and it provides for the circumstances in which the money can be applied. Given that these funds will be supervised by members of the insurance industry, by the Commissioner, and also by the receiver-manager, the judicial manager, it can be seen that there is a great deal of supervision of this legislation and we can be sure that the funds will be applied if and when appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is the case that the position of Occidental and Regal warrants the levy process, the Commissioner has to be satisfied that their financial position is such that it is warranted. Indeed, the continuing investigations that are being undertaken and the court actions that are pending may change the circumstances in respect of Regal and Occidental. The possibility exists for the proposal put by the honourable member for Higgins that these transactions be reversed. It is, I am sure, a possibility, if indeed an outside possibility, given the framework of justice in this country. But if that were to occur, there would be no liability and no necessity for the levy to be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation provides the mechanism for the levy to be applied and it provides for the circumstances in which the levy can be applied. Given those two criteria, it is appropriate that it provides protection and assurance for those people who have policies with those companies. Indeed, it provides protection and assurance for everybody who holds insurance policies in this country, because they understand that there is some fairness and justice in the way in which the Government and, indeed, the industry have reacted to their plight, which is an unintended consequence but a result of unauthorised action by individuals or companies. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the prospect of an ongoing fund to provide that protection is something that has been considered. It was the sort of thing considered by the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System and rejected, for the reasons I mentioned earlier. I endorse the view of the honourable member for Curtin: it sends the wrong signals out to the industry and to the community if there is some understanding that the Government will guarantee the insurance industry. In this case, I believe an appropriate one-off response is one part of the Government's response to the problem. The other part is the increase in the supervisory levy, which will provide for more adequate supervision. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other significant aspects of these six Bills. Firstly, the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill amends the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1945, which I have already mentioned. It increases the capital requirements, the solvency requirements, and the frequency of actuarial investigations. The Bill provides for an increase in the capital and solvency requirements of life insurance companies and general insurance companies and it imposes an increased frequency on actuarial supervision of their activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The last piece of legislation that makes up this package is the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill, in respect of which a number of comments have been made by honourable members opposite. Again, the honourable member for Higgins made a valid point when he said that there needs to be a consistent framework in respect of company law and acquisition and takeovers legislation in different areas of financial institutions and the financial market. But that does not make this piece of legislation inappropriate; it underlines the requirement for it. Indeed, the whole Occidental-Regal debacle is indicative of the need for such legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation ensures that Australian life and general insurance companies will not be adversely affected in their conduct by changes of ownership or control. The 15 per cent rule which applies in this case is an appropriate way in which such changes of ownership or control can be overseen by the Minister. The legislation also applies one or two other safeguards. It applies the safeguard that unsuitable persons should not be in positions of influence over Australian life and general insurance companies. I do not think anybody in this place would say that that was an inappropriate measure. I am sure it would be supported by honourable members on both sides of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, it provides for prevention of undue concentration of economic power in the Australian life and general insurance industry and in the Australian financial system generally. Again, that is a consideration which is critical to having a fair marketplace and having a competitive financial structure. If the Government has an important role in regulating business and business activities, I believe its role should be to provide for fair competition and to provide every opportunity for those businesses that want to compete to know that there is a structure which provides for that. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept, as the honourable member for Higgins said, that the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill 1991, which undertakes to prevent transactions that would be contrary to the national interest, is indeed a broad brush approach. I suppose `contrary to the national interest' is open to wide interpretation. Perhaps in this environment that form of words provides the necessary discretion to the Minister to scrutinise takeovers and changes in control of insurance companies, because it does adopt a broad brush approach. Perhaps in the present environment that is an appropriate statement to make and it is an appropriate regulatory mechanism for the Government to wish to have. I believe the honourable member for Higgins is correct when he suggests that there is need for a more consistent and wide-ranging approach to these aspects. However, in view of the present circumstances and in view of our experience with Regal and Occidental, appropriate ministerial discretion is necessary and I believe it is a requirement for us to undertake the sort of supervision that is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> These six Bills provide protection and security for Occidental and Regal policyholders. They provide for increasing supervision; they provide for increasing prudential requirements on insurance companies, both life and general; and they provide for measures that will ensure that changes of ownership will not affect the conduct of affairs of insurance companies. Indeed, I believe these Bills constitute an appropriate package for the Government to be bringing forward. It will provide protection and security for people who are concerned about their insurance policies, particularly for those who are affected by this particular debacle. I believe it will provide a measure of supervision and protection which is appropriate at this stage. I agree with the view put by honourable members opposite that we need to further improve that supervision. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate so far demonstrates a considerable degree of cross-party support for what is essentially the proposition put to the House by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). His amendment would allow these Bills to be looked at appropriately by a committee of the House of Representatives, namely, the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. The primary problem is the lack of prudential and control arrangements within the law governing the superannuation industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that context I find it surprising, therefore, that the Government still proposes to proceed with this legislation willy-nilly, regardless of the fact that we are essentially addressing two fundamental points: firstly, the lack of prudential and supervisory arrangements; and, secondly, the specific events leading up to and resulting from the Battery company problems in relation to Occidental Life and Regal Life. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an almost surrealistic approach to this debate in the House. We are talking about the savings of many thousands of men and women-fellow Australians-who for many decades have been encouraged by all governments to contribute to superannuation and life insurance, specifically because members of this Parliament say it is in Australia's national interest that they should so do. These people, through no fault of their own, have now found themselves in a very difficult situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is an attempt by the Government to protect life insurance and general insurance policyholders who invested what was often their life savings in companies such as Occidental Life and Regal Life. The circumstances surrounding this legislation are extremely complex. There is a major case now before the courts involving the return of some $65m currently held by the Commonwealth Bank and the ANZ Bank, and joining them in the case is also the Bank of Melbourne. The Bank of Melbourne was holding the escrow funds in trust on 28 September 1990, when the Battery Group attempted to sell to Heath Holdings, a shelf company, the assets of the Occidental Life and Regal Life companies. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Bank of Melbourne handed $65m of insurance company trust funds to Battery, which in turn used it to pay off part of a debt of $80m to the Commonwealth and ANZ banks. This package, according to the Government, will implement a range of measures which will provide financial support to policyholders and increase the general level of the prudential protection provided to life and general insurance policyholders in the future. The package includes amendments to the Life Insurance Act and the Insurance Act to provide the financial and prudential standards which must be satisfied by life and general insurance companies. These objectives are strongly endorsed by the Opposition. But, as my colleagues the honourable member for Higgins and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) have said before me, it is a sad reflection that here we are once again closing the stable door after the horse has well and truly bolted. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions include increased minimum capital requirements and additional solvency requirements for general insurance, improved methodology for company investigations and measures to disqualify persons who have been bankrupt or convicted of offences relating to insurance law or dishonest conduct from acting as directors or senior managers of insurance companies. On this point, I reiterate the words of my colleague the honourable member for Curtin when he said that the primary responsibility must always rest with the boards and senior management of companies which get themselves into trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> In so many respects this legislation is symptomatic of the grave crisis in corporate Australia which we saw developing during the late 1980s and which so many hundreds of thousands of Australians, in all States, in all forms of activity, have had to suffer and bear the consequences of. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, too many people failed to exercise due caution, which cost Australians very dearly indeed. The Occidental Life and Regal Life arrangements which are currently being debated are merely symptomatic of that problem, but are in line with so many other crises that we have seen in the corporate sector affecting the savings of many thousands of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in fact a sad reflection on the inadequacy of the prudential and supervisory statutory rules, which have been in place for so long, that it took a crisis of this measure in the insurance industry, based upon what appears to be simply fraud, to galvanise a government to some form of adequate action. The deficiencies in the two Acts, which became evident only during the investigation into Occidental Life and Regal Life, have fortunately been based upon isolated incidents. But we have seen the experience in the United Kingdom and the United States over recent years, and unless there are adequate supervisory arrangements in place all the time and unless the statutory authorities responsible for the administration of those arrangements have adequate resources, there is no way any government can guarantee to the Australian people that their funds will be protected by the law. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of the financial disasters which have befallen Australia during the 1980s, we have seen too many cases of inadequate prudential and supervisory arrangements in the commercial sector. In relation to the banking sector, and now the life insurance and superannuation sectors, the only sensible conclusion is that for too long the Government has allowed these industries to run very close to the wind and it has not provided the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, nor the other regulatory authorities, with sufficient resources to enable them to supervise the industries and to protect Australian investors. No-one, least of all the policyholders of these two companies, should be under any illusion that the situation is fully stabilised. </PARA>
<PARA> Before coming into the House this morning, I discussed the current situation with the judicial manager appointed by the Federal Court to supervise the affairs of Occidental and Regal Life. I have been informed that there has been a freeze on policyholders with superannuation or investment policies receiving their full entitlement. Only policyholders who have mature policies, or are retirees in hardship categories specifically noted by the Federal Court, have been receiving their entitlements. Even in these cases, many have not received their full entitlements. Where pay outs are being made to the categories specified by the Federal Court, and dependent upon which statutory fund their investments were placed in, some beneficiaries are receiving 100 per cent of their entitlements; others are receiving as low as 35c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises the very serious question of whether the existing Department of Social Security regulations are adequate to take account of people caught in that impossible situation. As I read the income and assets tests and as I understand the way they are being applied, there is a tendency for the Department to simply say to people in those circumstances, `Hard luck, notionally you have assets which take you over the line in terms of access to some specific level of pension'. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the reality is that those people have no access to those assets. The hoped for reality is that, depending on the outcome of the cases before the courts and on the basis of the $65m being provided by the remainder of the life insurance industry, these people's circumstances will be improved at least to the extent of 90c in the dollar. But the sad fact is that, for the best part of 12 months or longer, beneficiaries in policies-life insurance or superannuation or whatever they may be-in these two companies in many circumstances have not had access to an adequate pay out on the basis of the contractual arrangements into which they originally entered. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I ask the Government to consider seriously whether some assistance can be given to those people-many of whom are my constituents and who have written to me saying that they are retired and in some financial difficulties and asking what can be done to assist them at this stage. If or when the funds are repaid, of course those payments can be repaid and, therefore, there should be no further difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the issue before us is a complex one. The Government members have claimed here today that there is no alternative. The Opposition is making the point that the best that can be said is that it is the worst best circumstance available to us. We have emphasised throughout the debate that the issues which have been raised are extremely complex and sensitive and really go to the fact that the supervisory basis for these arrangements is not adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> While this legislation may be seen as a stopgap measure, and nothing more than that, the final outcome surely is that a committee of this House should investigate in full detail the regulatory and prudential requirements necessary to ensure that life and general insurance funds are operated for the maximum return to the policyholders, and that the costs likely to be borne by policyholders in other funds levied under this legislation will not, in the long term, be to the disadvantage of those people. </PARA>
<PARA> In an interesting observation, the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) made the point that the alternatives really were whether funds should be provided by the taxpayer or whether funds should be provided by other policyholders. The line is not as simple as that. We are told by the Government that the levies collected will be paid into a protection fund and are to be tax deductible to life offices, and furthermore that these arrangements are being imposed because of special unusual circumstances involving the unauthorised dealing in statutory fund moneys in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> Those two points get to the very heart of this issue. Firstly, the very fact that tax deductibility is provided to life insurance companies providing the $65m on behalf of their policyholders merely demonstrates the fact that to a large degree it is the Australian electorate, through its taxes, which is contributing to this fund. Secondly, the essential legal problem rests on the fact that the system was open enough to allow unauthorised dealings in statutory fund moneys. </PARA>
<PARA> The case of Occidental and Regal Life will no doubt go down in Australian legal history as an important test case, but it raises fundamental issues. What is the responsibility of the taxpayer overall to protect the interests of policyholders? What is the fundamental responsibility of the industry towards its own members? Above all, the clear responsibility rests on governments to ensure that the statutory rules in place are adequate and that there is adequate supervision of those rules. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has made a number of important points in relation to this legislation. Firstly, he made the observation that some 60 per cent of superannuation and life insurance business in Australia is effectively controlled by two companies-the AMP and National Mutual. It is no secret that there are many smaller life offices in Australia today which would gladly close up business if they could. This is no suggestion that they are in financial difficulties, but merely an identification of the realities facing the industry-that is, because of decisions made during the 1980s, often involving capital funds, especially real estate and so forth, the industry no longer has the capacity to provide the productivity and the profitability which most people would expect of it, especially for investments over such a long period of time. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises the fundamental issue as to whether the Government has been talking up the industry too much over recent years. The former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), came out with his rather grandiose suggestion two years ago that by the turn of the century superannuation specifically would have investments in excess of $600 billion-a vast amount of money in terms of domestic savings in Australia. If we could get anywhere near that figure, clearly there would be some advantages because it would reduce our need to import other people's savings for Australian development projects. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, a more realistic interpretation would suggest that that figure could be as low as $400 billion. That bears out the fact that the present level of emphasis on superannuation in relation to the current Government policy is inadequate. The sad fact of the matter is that most people on average weekly earnings-around $30,000 a year or below-are, in many cases, not gaining an adequate return on their long term investments. This fact is being totally ignored by the Government and to a large degree has been exacerbated by the fact that the current superannuation taxation arrangements have militated against most Australians being able to see superannuation as a long term viable and worthwhile financial investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The realities are that, at the top end of town, superannuation, because of its tax deductible nature, is still seen as a worthwhile investment. But any examination of the realities of the social security costings and any serious analysis of the likely impact of an ageing population in Australia over the next 20 years or 30 years must lead us to the conclusion that whatever can be done to encourage all Australians to save for their retirement must in the longer term be of benefit to future generations of taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> The way that the Government has gone about this is to put much greater emphasis on the requirement for employers to fund superannuation, virtually completely. The proposals contained in yesterday's Budget are but another step in that sad direction which has totally ignored the fact that every time that there is an additional impost on employers the ultimate effect is that it can be inflationary; but, more relevant in today's Australian environment, more people will lose their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Various estimates have been put forward in that regard, some as high as 100,000 people. But one thing is certain: every time we increase the cost of taking on labour, we are effectively encouraging employers to look for alternatives, to look for cheaper, less costly means of achieving their objectives. Invariably, this means that fewer people will be employed-not more. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a very sad reflection on the Government that once again it has given in to the dictates of the ACTU in this area. It has taken an extraordinarily important area of policy, and it has clothed it in a political sheet which cannot be sustained under current economic circumstances. Therefore, the legislation before the House today is of considerable importance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly important because it goes to the heart of the question as to whether or not we are able to put in place in this country a legal regime which will encourage people to feel that their investments in life assurance and superannuation are being adequately protected and maintained. The point must be made that the Regal and Occidental case is a one-off. Fortunately, for at least the last 100 to 150 years, superannuation and life insurance management in Australia has been free of situations such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia we have developed an industry which in many respects is one of the most efficient and effective in the world. When we compare it with circumstances in the United Kingdom or, in particular, the United States where the housing and loan fiascos of recent years have not been limited to fringe banking but have also influenced the investment of life insurance and superannuation companies, we can be thankful that we have had so few cases in the past. But in no respect should this be seen as a defence of the Government which over 8 1/2 years has not seen fit to look in detail to amending the life insurance legislation until now. In the words of its own members, it is doing so in the environment of 1991 because of the cases which are currently before the courts and the fiasco which has been created because of the Battery difficulties. This should not have occurred in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government established the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and legislation went through this House, members of the Opposition urged the Government to ensure that there would be adequate regulation in place to enable the new Commission to actively carry out its activities. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has told us this morning, the recent Budget still puts a limit of $17m on the funding of that critical instrument of government policy, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. It is more than that-it is a critical instrument in place to protect the interests of hundreds of thousands of Australian policyholders. They are the people who have been prepared to make the commitment to put aside part of their income so that they will be less of a drain on future generations of Australians. Surely the primary responsibility of this Parliament must be to protect the interests of these people. Sadly, the Government has done too little far too late. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an interesting debate because it raises the whole function and role of government in supervision and regulation of activities of Australian citizens, areas in their lives that are vital to their future and that, if damaged, cannot be reversed. Generally, one would say that if a fraud is committed by one citizen against another, those two citizens ought to sort it out between themselves in court. That has been a practice in Australia and in business since business institutions began and our courts were established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today, however, we are looking at a circumstance where a fraud, or an assumed fraud, has been committed by an individual, or group of individuals within a financial institution, against people doing business with that institution. An insurance company, or those associated with an insurance company, were responsible for ripping off the deposits of their policyholders. That is a serious circumstance. What is the role of Government in these circumstances? Does the Government have a role at all or is it up to those policyholders to identify those who caused the trouble, bring them to book, and resolve the matter in the courts in the normal way?</PARA>
<PARA> In this instance the Government has intervened. The Government has had a responsibility through an organisation called the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The Government said, `This is an area where there needs to be some sort of supervision from government. We are going to plonk a body in there to keep an eye on things'. The Government is giving some assurance to the solidarity and ongoing expectations of those policyholders by saying, `We are concerned, because of previous cases of fraud, so we are going to put an organisation there to keep an eye on the activities of insurance and superannuation companies'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has given an assurance which has led to an expectation by people that there would be solidarity and security on their investment. If the Government had not acted, its hands would be clean. There would be no role for the Government in these circumstances. But the Government had, before and during the period of this fraud, inserted itself into that situation. Therefore, the Government carries responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The typical response of this Government in every circumstance such as this is to say, `How were we to know? There was a body supervising this jolly outfit and these organisations, but how were we to know? We are not going to ask taxpayers and we are not going to ask the Commission itself to take responsibility for their actions; we are going to dump the cost of this activity back onto the policyholders'. That is what is occurring here. This legislation allows the Government to wash its hands of responsibility. It would be interesting to have the Government defend the decisions it has made, in light of its own declared responsibility through the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> One could ask: how can a commission of this type be expected to know everything? One could not really expect a government organisation to know everything, especially those things which are illegal and are being kept from it deliberately. The Tax Commissioner does not know everything. How could the Superannuation Commissioner be expected to know everything? The area of government administration needs to be sorted out by way of discussion. A government organisation was in place and there was a responsibility, but the problem was not identified. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the House today seeks to give that regulatory organisation more powers and a more comprehensive role in supervising insurance and superannuation organisations on behalf of the Government. In part it also seeks to give to the policyholders of sound companies the responsibility for the loss created in the case of Occidental and Regal Life. Nobody knows how much those sound investors-the choosers of good companies-will pay as a penalty for choosing a good company to superannuate with or to insure with. So those who picked sound companies are penalised in favour of those who happened to pick dud companies. I do not know about the logic of that, but if the industry wanted to pick that and force it on the policyholders, maybe it should have come forward and said so. That is why the Opposition wants to establish a committee to examine these important matters. </PARA>
<PARA> A committee of the Parliament should be established. The Government has had time-who knows what has occurred. The Government has not been forthcoming in outlining the details of the effect of such a decision on the policyholders of sound companies. What will be the range of commitment or likely increase in annual premiums to policyholders of those insurances if this goes ahead? Will they be responsible for the full $65m? Will there be a recovery? What does the Government know? The Government says nothing. It provides no information to the Parliament and expects the Parliament to agree to such an arrangement without proper scrutiny. That is why the Opposition would like to see proper scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee needs to make an important decision on, firstly, the true responsibility of a government organisation raised to supervise an industry and, secondly, on whether the resolution of this factor is best achieved by dumping on those in the industry already holding sound policies the responsibility of funding the failures. Those are the issues that ought to be assessed by a committee of the Parliament. The Government is refusing to do that; in fact, it is acting too little too late. It is notorious for doing that in this area. Going back to the days of the Minister for Housing and Construction and Minister Assisting the Treasurer, Mr Hurford, I remember a matter that he had to fix up. He procrastinated for ages to introduce legislation to solve a problem in the insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we go again. Keating talked about it for ages and said, `Oh well, the industry will fix it up itself', or `We are going to suck more money out of the industry', or `We will establish a levy or a fund'. He speculated about it for ages but did nothing. It is typical of this Government's legislation. It announces things in press releases and then months later takes some action. In the eyes of the Government, the press release appears to bring about the legality of the situation. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the insurance policyholders protection levy is part of the Budget papers. I do not know whether the Government is going to claim that it is part of the Budget. This legislation is separate from the Budget and should be seen as separate. It provides that certain payments to life offices representing surplus money from the protection fund created by this legislation will be treated as non-fund-accessible income, so there will be a tax factor involved as well. The Government cannot let it go one way or the other; the Government has to tax it whether it is in this fund or not. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the legislation also provides for the Government considering changes for recording requirements for superannuation funds-changes such as whether the fund has been audited and the details of that audit are being sought, whether abridged financial information has been provided and whether there are arrears of contributions. All of these factors are interesting and very important to the proper prudential management of these significant organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the House that decisions on superannuation are often made 20 or 30 years before the date of draw down. Any changes that are made in superannuation affect people's lives long before they retire. The 47 changes that this Government has brought to superannuation in the period since 1985 is shameful because there are people out there on the verge of retirement and there are fund managers, operators and brokers with huge books trying to establish the circumstance for individuals as they come into retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has ripped billions of dollars out of the retirees of this nation by the activities that it has raised from time to time in the Budget. The former Treasurer (Mr Keating) is the person who is responsible for getting into the pockets of retirees and those who are about to retire. The certainty has gone; the reliability of superannuation in the eyes of the public has gone. By demand on the companies and businesses of Australia, the Government is imposing more superannuation but the employees do not trust it. Their trust has gone because of the Government's constant fiddling with superannuation. The Government has ripped about $4 billion out of that system in toto, I believe, to prop up the failing economic management that it has provided for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the last few days, the Treasury has provided a paper which sets out the Government's attitude to prudential standards. It has made clear that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission would be the primary prudential regulator for the superannuation industry. That is fine, except that the funding process for that supervision is a fraction of what the Government is currently supplying for the Australian Securities Commission. This year, it is applying $114.9m for the ASC and a paltry $17m for the operation of ISC. I know the scope and range of the activities of these two organisations differ, but not to the degree indicated by those figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in this Treasury paper it is interesting to note that the Government itself makes the point that it will not guarantee superannuation benefits to members. As with most investment, the final risk must lie with the investor. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the supervisory framework will minimise prudential risk, thereby reducing the risk of fund failure and maintaining public confidence in superannuation savings. It is a case of too little too late. If we do it now, the problem will be over. The attitude of the public is that it does not have the same confidence in the process of superannuation that it used to have. The fault lies in the hands of the Government for the massive number of changes it has made and its `too little too late' attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA> One not only has to look at this current situation but at the real administration of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. One only has to look at the requirements in regard to taxation to have real doubts about whether this is the appropriate body to administer insurance and superannuation. There is a requirement, which the Minister knows of, for people to submit to the Australian Tax Office final determinations in regard to the roll over and use of their funds during the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Over 100,000 determinations are still being waited for by the taxpayers of Australia. The computers in this outfit, the ISC, are consistently going down, or that is what we are told. Taxpayers are required to provide certain information before they can lodge their tax forms, and now we are into mid-August. Six weeks have passed since the end of the financial year and already many people are out of time as required by the Income Tax Assessment Act. The Government has been pressed to extend the period and has done so. </PARA>
<PARA> When will the Insurance and Superannuation Commission deal with the huge backlog, pursuant to its requirements under the Act, and provide information to people submitting information to the Australian Tax Office? The forms are complex. They are devised by people seeking to hide information rather than provide it. The final determination must be clear and complete because, in the process of self-determination in income tax matters, the final responsibility does not rest with the ISC; it rests with the taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> There are factors in these provisions that the taxpayer could not possibly know, such as: what is a reasonable benefit multiple? A constituent of mine phoned 101 organisations to make sure that 7.0000 was the right factor. Nobody could tell him, including the Superannuation Board, which said, `Ring the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and someone there will tell you'. If a person gets on the phone to ring this outfit-I have done it myself in Sydney-he can wait for half an hour before getting an answer. Last week-not weeks ago-this happened, despite the hot lines, ministerial statements, press releases and all the goings-on. It is a shambles, and the Government ought to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are people who have invested carefully. Labor Party supporters and public servants are coming to me in their retirement and are saying, `We never thought that the Labor Government would actually do this sort of thing to us'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pointing out that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission is hardly the appropriate body, unless it is funded or resourced properly and supplied with proper personnel and the right incentive, to be running things such as the prudential supervision of insurance and superannuation companies in Australia. We have started a process of giving to a body which has not demonstrated its competence the privilege of supervising and continuing to hold in trust those organisations which are responsible for the death benefits of Australians who are insured for life, the fire and general insurance risks of those whose properties or businesses are covered by general insurance, and the savings of people who work long years to prepare for their retirement. This outfit cannot even get its returns back before the end of the financial year so that people can make proper claims in time, and here we are giving it additional responsibilities under this Act, yet no additional resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I am making is that the Commission has not demonstrated its bona fides; that ought to be examined. The resolution of this factor, as the Government proposes, and its impact on policyholders, who will be required to pay perhaps $65m towards the cost of the mistakes in Occidental Life and Regal Life, together with the activities of those responsible in Occidental and Regal Life, are matters worthy of committee investigation. They could go to a select committee for quick investigation. The Government could come back here and assure the Opposition that what it is saying is right, that it has made reasonable decisions. It has not provided us with the information necessary to give us that assurance. </PARA>
<PARA> I assure the Government that if it keeps going in this way it will not get the assistance or support of the Opposition. It needs to have the confidence of the Australian community in this area. It is an area where the savings of people over one or two decades are involved; it is an area where the protection of their property is involved; and it is in an area where a payout on their death is involved. It is important that every citizen in Australia can be assured of the Government's appropriate actions, can be assured that those actions will not necessarily damage the investment people have made in sound insurance or superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Government to take up the Opposition's challenge in this regard. It should respond positively. What has the Government to lose? It has much to gain. It has the trust and support of people who do not understand what has occurred to gain; it has the trust and support of the Opposition to gain. That, above everything else, is worthy. The Minister should follow that course instead of giggling away there. He knows how serious these matters are. He is giggling because he is embarrassed by the activities of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the damage it has done to current taxpayers. He should be concerned about whether it can cope with the responsibilities being given to it by the Parliament,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before responding to the various remarks made during this debate, I apologise for showing signs of mirth at the end of the speech by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). At least he injected a genuine flavour of comedy into the debate. I thank the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), and the honourable member for Mitchell for their contributions to the second reading debate, particularly the two Government members, who made such substantial contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to address a number of matters raised by Opposition members, and I turn first to the contribution of the honourable member for Higgins, who claimed that Parliament had been asked to punt in the dark on these measures. I point out that these Bills were introduced in June and the details of the proposition have been available for public scrutiny since that time. I respond to his reference to legal remedies being a way out of this impasse by telling him that I am informed that full reports on all developments have been given to Federal police authorities, as one would expect. </PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of the availability of the report of Mr Grellman, I am informed that the judicial management report is a court document. It is not appropriate that that kind of document should be required to be tabled in the Parliament; it is available through the court. Any interested parties or, indeed, a member of the public could have access to it. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to the concern of the honourable member for Higgins about lack of industry support for these measures, I advise him that the industry shares the Government's concern that further instances of the kind that led to the need for drafting of this legislation should not occur again. The industry recognises the need for legislation to allow for appropriate monitoring of changes to ownership and control of insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out to the honourable member that the legislation was developed in consultation with senior industry representatives, with the Life Insurance Federation of Australia, LIFA, and the Insurance Council of Australia. Industry suggestions were sought and they were taken into account in drafting the legislation. The Bills have general industry support. I also point out that, in LIFA's annual report, the Chairman indicated that the industry believed that the legislation would address its concerns. I advise him that, during the implementation process, a committee involving representatives of LIFA and major players in the industry will be involved in that implementation process. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to the expression of concern by the honourable member for Higgins about the effect these measures might have on policyholders in other funds, I make the general point that all life insurance policyholders, irrespective of the company in which they have an investment, have an interest in the ongoing stability of the industry. Publicised references to possible action by the Government certainly helped to reduce the negative impact of the developments and helped to shore up investor confidence in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the amount that is to be raised by the levy. It has been limited to $65m. It is anticipated that the maximum that could be raised over the duration of the arrangements would amount to less than 0.1 per cent of policyholder assets. The proposed arrangements represent an appropriate balance between the interests of the policyholders in Occidental Life and Regal Life and the interests of policyholders generally. </PARA>
<PARA> I inform the honourable member that, with respect to the effect on policyholders in Occidental and Regal, payments to policyholders involving levy support could be up to a maximum of 90 per cent of the total claim under a policy. The actual percentage would depend on a number of factors, including the size of any realised shortfall and the nature of the claim. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Higgins also expressed some concern about concentration of economic power in the public interest test. The definition of concentration of economic power does give the Treasurer broad powers, but I point out that the Bill itself provides for the review of decisions made by the Minister under the Bill. Apart from temporary restraining orders, where a person affected by a reviewable decision is dissatisfied with that decision he may request a reconsideration of the matter by the Minister. Where the Minister subsequently confirms or amends the reviewable decision, an application for review of the Minister's decision can be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Higgins appeared to run out of steam because, with five minutes left in which to speak, he turned to the superannuation industry and had some remarks to make about the prudential supervision of superannuation funds. I point out that there are some quantitative and qualitative differences between the superannuation industry and the insurance industry. The quantitative difference is that there are 58 life companies in this country and around 170 general insurers. There are in the order of 100,000 superannuation funds. With the insurance industry we are dealing with an established industry, but with the superannuation industry, particularly in recent times and I hope also in the future, we are dealing with a developing industry. Supervisory arrangements for the insurance industry have existed since 1945. Supervisory arrangements for the superannuation industry were established in 1987. They are different industries and, consequently, they require their own specialist supervisory knowledge as, indeed, does the banking sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin expressed some concern that the legislation was creating a precedent. I point out in response to him that the former Treasurer repeatedly stated that this special one-off arrangement was not to be regarded as a precedent; it was drafted specifically with respect to the problems of Occidental Life and Regal Life. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the comments of the honourable member for Bradfield. He was concerned about policyholders experiencing difficulties with claims and spoke of delays in the order of 12 months. He expressed concerns about claims not having been met. I point out to him that that is exactly what this levy is for. Yet the Opposition, at the same time as it is complaining about delays and about policyholders experiencing hardship, wants to send this off to a committee. The capacity of the honourable member for Bradfield to look one way while going another is absolutely breathtaking. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bradfield made a more serious comment about the impact of the assets test. He pointed out that many of his constituents holding policies in these companies may be affected. That is a serious point. Given that they are his constituents, I assume that the honourable member for Bradfield would have done what any of us would have done, that is, made the appropriate representations to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson). </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the comments of the honourable member for Mitchell. He mentioned three matters that I would like to respond to. The first point concerns the Government's supervisory role in the life insurance industry. He said that the Government is responsible, that it has insinuated itself into the process and that it is all the Government's fault. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the honourable member for Mitchell that a supervisory role has existed in this industry since 1945 and that there has never been a problem before. The problem has been identified; the remedy is before the House. The honourable member's concern about the effect on policyholders in other companies has been dealt with; I gave him the figure of what the levy is estimated to cost policyholders in other companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member expressed concern about the level of funding provided to the ISC as against that provided to the ASC. But they are different bodies. The ASC is a body in the process of establishment, which I am sure he understands. The two bodies perform different functions, but I am advised that there is very good liaison between the two bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the substance of the Opposition amendment. The idea of referring this matter to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is really preposterous. How can the honourable member for Higgins propose a motion to send this legislation off to a parliamentary committee and, at the same time, accuse the Government of dragging its heels on this matter? At the same time that he professes profound sympathy for the investors and says, `I do not for a moment want to hold up the proposals', he wants to send this legislation off to the Martin Committee. The amendment is totally inconsistent with the honourable member's professed concern for the investors and his professed anger with the Government for allegedly dragging its heels. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the extensive examination which has already been undertaken by the Government to develop the measures contained in this package, the Government does not believe that it would be appropriate to delay implementation of these much needed measures by referring them to the Martin Committee. The Government's clear preference is to put in place measures which, on the basis of supervisory experience and investigations already undertaken, have been shown to be necessary and appropriate to increase the general level of prudential protection provided to life and general policyholders. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be noted that the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner has already put forward a submission to the Martin Committee outlining the role of the Commission and discussing a number of issues which may assist the Committee in its deliberations, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Macarthur during his speech. I would have thought that the Deputy Chairman of the Committee would have advised the honourable member for Higgins of that good news. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, of course, stands ready to look at any suggestions for improvement in the insurance supervisory arrangements which might be put forward by the Committee, the industry or, indeed, any other interested observer. In the meantime, however, the Government sees it as appropriate and highly desirable that the current measures be implemented without undue delay. Accordingly, the Government rejects the Opposition amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Question put:</PARA>
<PARA> That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Costello's amendment) stand part of the question. </PARA>

<PARA> As a consequence it may be possible for a change in the ownership or control of an Australian registered insurer to be effected through the acquisition of shares in a company having a significant shareholding in that insurer and without a requirement for that acquisition to be notified. It was always the intention that upstream acquisitions would be covered in this legislation. The amendments I have moved remedy that. I also present the supplementary explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a point for clarification by the Minister in relation to these amendments. As I understand it, the purpose of the amendments that the Government has moved to the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill 1991 is to allow the Australian Minister to effectively supervise share transactions in a foreign company which may, in fact, not even be domiciled in Australia. For example, a foreign insurance company may own an Australian registered insurance company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where there is a proposal to change the shareholding in that company or, indeed, where there is a proposal to issue shares in that company, there would be a responsibility for the Minister to be notified under the trigger proposal provisions of clause 23. I would like the point about whether that is the case clarified at the outset. If it is the case, it seems to me that this is going to be a particularly unwieldy proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us suppose that a Swiss based insurance company proposes to issue shares. It owns an Australian registered company and the shares in the Swiss based company are going to be issued, or 15 per cent of them are going to be disposed of. Is it the intention of the legislation to require notification of that share transaction to the Australian Minister? As I understand the legislation, it is. If that is the case, the amendments are seeking effectively to regulate share transactions in foreign companies in foreign jurisdictions, with foreign buyers and foreign sellers. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that a clause is to be inserted into clause 19 which effectively allows for the reading down of these provisions. That indicates that the Government itself is very doubtful as to whether the amendments which are being proposed would withstand constitutional challenge. It is already engaging in prop-up measures, as it were, to defend the legislation in the event of a constitutional challenge by effectively severing the provisions which it suspects may not withstand a constitutional challenge. That indicates grave reservations on the part of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicate that the Opposition has some grave reservations as to the constitutionality of these proposals. Of course, if the proposals are struck down it will open up, one would think, a very easy circumvention of this particular provision. This underlines the concerns we have as to the provisions generally. There may, in fact, be better ways of ensuring the constitutional validity of achieving the objective that the Government seeks to achieve than the drafting that has been proposed by way of these amendments. This underlines the concern that we have about how well thought out these amendments are. It underlines the concern we have that further advice and investigation be taken on these particular matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister may, in fact, be leading this Parliament into unconstitutional legislation with his amendments. He is providing an escape valve by reason of clause 19, but the escape valve is to effectively jettison the dubious proposals that he is now putting up. He is putting the proposals up with one hand and putting up a mechanism to take them away with the other. With the proposal that he puts up, he is in fact quite possibly leading this Parliament into unconstitutional legislation-a matter that does not fill us with joy and, I am sure, does not fill the Government, in its better moments, with joy. </PARA>
<PARA> Knowing the Minister as I do, I am sure that, although he has been given a brief from the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), he has secret doubts about this mechanism. I express my concern about it. I would like the Minister to deal with the question that I have raised. </PARA>

<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposal No. 6 (1991) and Excise Tariff Proposal No. 2 (1991).</PARA>
<PARA>The tariff proposals which I have just tabled relate to the proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and the Excise Tariff Act 1921. Customs tariff proposal No. 6, 1991, and excise tariff proposal No. 2, 1991, formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff alterations made by notices published in the Gazette during the recent recess. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes contained in these proposals were operative from 1 July 1991. Following representations from the general aviation industry that the Civil Aviation Authority's rescue and firefighting service was not required at the general aviation secondary airports, the CAA agreed to withdraw the service from 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA> This action was taken after extensive consultation with industry, local communities, unions, airport owners and users. The airports concerned are Essendon, Moorabbin, Bankstown, Archerfield, Parafield and Jandakot. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the customs and excise duty collected on aviation gasoline was regarded as an offset against the cost of providing the rescue and firefighting service. Excise tariff proposal No. 2 decreases the excise duty by the offset amount of 0.321c per litre. Customs tariff proposal No. 6 contains the complementary alteration to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. A summary of the alterations contained in these proposals has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the house. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can he give us an ironclad guarantee that no more Australians will lose their jobs as a result of the superannuation package he introduced into the Parliament yesterday?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="171" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am somewhat surprised at the position that has been adopted on superannuation by the Opposition. I would have thought that it would have recognised the great merit in this proposal. The reforms to superannuation announced in the Budget are absolutely fundamental to the policies of this Government in regard to retirement income for an ageing population. Under the arrangements that we have made there is provision for continuing wage restraint. I hope it would be noticed by the Leader of the Opposition that in the agreement that I reached with the leadership of the ACTU, together with my colleagues the Minister for Finance, the Treasurer and the Minister for Industrial Relations, it was agreed that in future what happened in regard to superannuation payments by employers would be taken into account in wage negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The restraint that has been exercised by the trade union movement since 1983 has been quite remarkable. There has been a 10 per cent reduction in real non-farm unit labour costs since 1983. That has occurred because of the restraint exercised by the trade union movement. As a result of that restraint there has been a massive shift from wages to profits. The facts are quite simple in regard to the level of company profits. When we came to office, company profits, as a share of gross domestic product, were down by about 11 per cent. Even at this stage company profits are still above the long term average of the last 15 years. That is the fact. It has been made possible-as has been recognised, to their credit, by major employer organisations-by the restraint of the trade union movement. We cannot have a 10 per cent reduction in real non-farm unit labour costs without there being a move to profits. It has been the case that the trade unions have been in a situation where they could have, if they had wanted to exercise their muscle, obtain significantly higher increases in nominal wage rates. They declined to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> The forecast for average earnings growth in 1991-92 is the lowest for over two decades. This represents a real saving for business. I am here to say, and so is this Government, that the workers of this country are now entitled to share in the benefits of their restraint. That is what it is about. The trade unions have indicated that in future wage negotiations what happens to payments by employers for superannuation will be taken into account. We do not have a situation where we will impose some additional payment in regard to superannuation on what would have been there as a wages outcome. As a result of this process of legislated superannuation, we will have an assurance in this country that all Australian workers will have retirement income security in the next century when an unprecedented number of Australians will be retired.</PARA>
<PARA> We have been sensitive in this matter to the needs of small business. A lower contribution level has been set for small business than for large. Of course, we have to remember that the many small firms in this country which are already paying 3 per cent will be unaffected by this measure in 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer will be talking next month with major employer groups, the trade unions and the industry. I believe that as a result of those discussions we will have an outcome which will be sensible, both in regard to the immediate future and in regard to the longer term interests of this country.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, may I say this in regard to the Leader of the Opposition: he has a very poor record of prediction in regard to what will happen in the economy as a result of what comes out of the accord. I remind the Leader of the Opposition of what he said at the time of accord mark VI. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said on 21 February last year:</PARA>
<PARA>Accord mark VI announced today will lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates. It will increase the likelihood of a major collapse of the Australian dollar.</PARA>
<PARA>Just look at the predictions of the Leader of the Opposition. He predicted higher inflation. Inflation is not higher-it has fallen from 8 1/2 per cent to 3.4 per cent. So his prediction was wrong on that. He said that interest rates would be higher. In fact, interest rates have fallen by 7 1/2 per cent. He said that the dollar would collapse. The dollar has been totally steady since that time.</PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition has no idea of what the economic outcomes are of accord negotiations. He was wrong in 1990. He is wrong again this year when he predicts unemployment as a result of what is in fact a far-sighted scheme in regard to providing superannuation for the whole of the Australian working population.</PARA>

<TITLE>Public Hospital Outpatient Charges</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4T4">Mr MELHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. Has the Minister seen reports of some State Premiers suggesting that they will introduce patient charges for public hospital outpatients? Do the Medicare agreements with the States permit the States to charge for outpatient services? What is the Government's response to the Premiers' claim?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="173" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; HEALTH, HOUSING AND COMMUNITY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Banks for his question, which deals with the possibility of the States imposing outpatient charges as a consequence of the changes that have been made with respect to general practice in the Medicare system. Let me say to the honourable member that the package that has been announced is essentially about general practice. The Government needs to remind the States that, in terms of what they do in this area, they are bound by the Medicare agreement. Having said that, the Government is more than willing to enter into discussions with the States to examine any consequences, or possible consequences, that might flow from the changes that we have already announced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important that the Premiers and the State health Ministers understand the context and the full details of the package that we have announced. We have in this country a major oversupply of general practitioners. That oversupply is imposing great competitive pressures on general practitioners, at least in our major cities. Secondly, the Government has announced cuts in Medicare rebates for general practice services of $3.50 and will permit doctors who bulk bill to charge up to $3.50.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the competitive pressures that have led to such high rates of bulk billing will continue and will ensure not only that bulk billing continues, but also that many doctors will not necessarily charge the proposed co-payment. Fourthly, the Government, with the medical profession, is committed to addressing the incentives in health insurance which lead to poor quality care and the oversupply of doctors.</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, the Government has announced an approach to an underlying issue of oversupply that needs to be linked to an approach in general practice that is open to discussion along with changes that the Government has made in relation to providing a price signal by way of that cut in the rebate and the opportunity that exists for doctors to charge the co-payment. This package is essentially about general practice and we hope it will be pursued in that context.</PARA>
<PARA> As we think about general practice, it is important to understand that there are treatments carried out in hospitals and in outpatient areas that could well be carried out within the context of general practice itself; for example, with respect to the treatment of asthma, equipment available within hospitals could easily be located within general practice, providing the opportunity, if there were an adequate capital base, for general practice to play a larger role in the treatment of people with chronic conditions such as asthma.</PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about this area, it is important that the States not jump quickly to conclusions that things can be done only one way, that they do not necessarily draw a link which contradicts previous experience where people certainly have not rushed off to outpatient wards and that they understand that we are about dealing with the question of supply but dealing with it in a way that introduces some price signals into general practice and presents a great opportunity, I believe, for the medical profession to think in a visionary way about the future of general practice in this country, restoring some of the status and dignity to general practice and, most of all, providing a better quality service to Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a long time since we have really seen family health care practised in this country. This is an opportunity for us to move in that direction so that we see in terms of general practice not the long queues, the line-ups and the minimal amount of time, but general practice geared to providing quality health care, taking over some of the functions that ought not be provided by hospitals, and providing the linkages to a modern health care system at a community care level.</PARA>

All of us in this House are on big fat superannuation packages and people on our income level and in many occupations in this country have tax deductions worth $3.35 billion a year. Seventy per cent of the people in this country have some superannuation, so let us not get too hypocritical about all the impacts of superannuation. Well over one-third-35 per cent-of people have over 5 per cent superannuation now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us just put some of these things into some sort of perspective. There are five people in employment now for every person over 65 years of age; in 20 years time there will be only three. Eleven per cent of our population is now over 65 and in 20 years time it will be 18 per cent. This superannuation scheme is the start of a scheme for the twenty-first century and we really do have to do something about it.</PARA>
<PARA> There is another plus side to this superannuation. It is about the mobilisation of savings; it is about putting to one side, once and for all, the savings task that needs to be taken on by the Australian population. There has been some non-compliance in this area. It escapes the Opposition that, right through the business cycle since 1986, there was award superannuation as part of the productivity-wages package; 3 per cent was awarded right through the award system, and there was non-compliance. It was not the time through the boom; it was not the time when the economies were coming out of recovery. It will never be the time, because the Opposition only has two solutions to every economic problem: cut wages and cut government spending. All that Opposition members can ever think of is almost a pavlovian response. Every time we try to reform and change the basic characteristics of this economy for the better and for the future, we get the same stupid response.</PARA>
<PARA> There is one point which everyone seems to be missing as well: we do not necessarily have to assume that superannuation is going to be an add-on to wages. Why? Because we are moving into a whole new devolved wages system whereby industry groups are moving to productivity and enterprise bargaining. The trade union movement, the people on award wages who have not been getting the 3 per cent they were awarded way back in 1987, do not want to increase unemployment and are prepared to lock themselves into the low inflation dividend that this economy has a chance of achieving and of getting some of the fundamentals right. It is against that background that there is very little need indeed to get into spurious modelling exercises to serve Opposition members' fantasies.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="174" SPEAKER="Baldwin The Hon P.J." NAMEID="MD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SYDNEY" MINISTERIAL="HIGHER EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question, and I would like to point to some of the things that we are doing in the higher education area. In aggregate terms, we are providing funding of $3.92 billion for higher education and $1.52 billion for student education assistance and income support in this financial year, which are increases of 10.1 per cent and 20.3 per cent respectively. Under normal circumstances, as some honourable members would be aware, the higher education system receives its funding on a rolling triennial basis, which would imply that funding for calendar years 1992 and 1993 would be now locked in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, as has been given some attention in the media, we have had a surge in the level of demand for places in higher education institutions. Partly as a consequence of that, partly as a consequence of labour market circumstances and partly as a consequence of a degree of institutional mismanagement, we have had to confront a significant problem of overenrolment in the system. There have been calls on us to address these issues and in response to them the Government has decided to make some additional significant injections of funds into the system over and above existing triennial commitments. We are looking at an increase in capital funding by $53m in 1992 and an additional $70m over four years in base operating grant assistance to enable institutions to deal with enrolment growth.</PARA>
<PARA> There are a range of other decisions which I will just briefly mention: $26m over three years for research over and above existing triennial commitments, which are running in excess of $200m already; a significant increase in the number of HECS exemption scholarships to 17,000; a pilot program for advanced engineering centres; and a pilot program for shared funding of higher education places between industry and government. In total, that comes to a package of $76m in the current financial year, which is on top of the funding of $119m that the Government had agreed shortly before the Budget to provide to fund substantial increases in academic salaries. We are talking about a totality of some $200m of new funds over and above existing commitments being injected into the system.</PARA>
<PARA> There is one point on which I would like to take issue with some of the media. There has been a lot of reference to the slight increase in the level of HECS contribution, which comes out when we take out the normal indexation adjustment in that at $144 a year. That raises $5m in 1991-92 and $12m in a full year. That has to be set against a net injection of funds of some $200m over and above existing commitments into the system. So some of the press reports that have talked about that slight increase in HECS revenue funding all these other measures are simply absurd.</PARA>
<PARA> I would also point out that these measures have been extremely well received by the system. We have had a few arguments with the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee over the last few months about some of these issues of overcrowding and academic staff shortages.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me quote from what the AVCC had to say about these Budget decisions in its press release yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government is to be commended for recognising, and acting upon, the difficulties facing higher education in Australia . . .</PARA>
<PARA> We particularly welcome the move to bring forward the capital funding program, which will allow much needed buildings to be constructed quickly. Additionally, the reinstatement of the renovation component will mean refurbishment of existing buildings.</PARA>
<PARA> We are pleased the Government has guaranteed flexibility in the way these funds can be spent-they will be targeted at areas of most need.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also begun to address the very serious concerns about future academic staffing by providing an additional 2,000 Higher Education Contribution Scheme exempt scholarships for postgraduates. This will help retain our best graduates and steer them toward an academic career . . .</PARA>
<PARA> The $26 million boost to the Australian Research Council Grants, over three years, will provide a significant boost to higher education and ultimately the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to comment on the changes that we have also introduced in the student income support area, which have greatly improved the targeting, equity and flexibility of student income support. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Professor McKinnon-</PARA>
<PARA>who is the Chair of the AVCC-</PARA>
<PARA>said the AVCC was pleased with the improvements to the Austudy scheme which should ensure more students will benefit. The new arrangements were consistent with AVCC recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA>Other parts of the higher education constituency have also praised those elements in the program. In particular, the students have welcomed the changes to Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA> That is the broad response to what we have done. It has been extremely well received. In conclusion, there is a stark contrast between the reception from the system for this package of measures, which have been hailed as being well targeted, well constructed and timely, and the response to the National Press Club speech by the honourable member for Goldstein a couple of weeks ago, supposedly setting out the Opposition's blueprint for higher education.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Prospect for her question. From my visits into her electorate-and this is not merely a formal acknowledgment-I can say quite sincerely that I know from my own experience how important these issues are to her.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1987 this Government delivered a major breakthrough, which was recognised as such, in reform to assist low income families by introducing the family allowance supplement. As the honourable member appreciates, as a result of that historic breakthrough, recognised in this country and abroad as a very significant reform, we have massively increased in real terms support for low income families. It is important to understand that this Budget builds on those foundational achievements.</PARA>
<PARA> We have made the family support system simpler; we have made it more consistent. We have increased assistance to low to moderate income families. We have provided stronger incentives to people to seek jobs, and we have, very importantly, delivered greater assistance to the primary carer, who is in the majority of cases, of course, the mother.</PARA>
<PARA> In the process we have delivered assistance to those families which have exercised the most restraint over the past eight years, and we have further improved the social wage. As I think the honourable member will appreciate, the major measures are these: an increase in the FAS income test threshold from 1 April of next year to $19,300-that means 109,000 low to moderate income families will gain an average of $12 a week-and combination of the family allowance and family allowance supplement into a two-step payment from 1 January 1993 at a cost of over $100m in 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA> That decision will significantly improve FAS take-up and, as a result, an additional 34,700 low income families will receive an average gain of $55 per week-a massively important change for those people who are in need and who deserve as much assistance as this community can give them. Family allowance supplement and additional pension and benefit will be integrated. These payments are currently, as the House knows, paid separately to low income working families, pensioners and beneficiaries. Their integration will encourage and assist pensioners and beneficiaries to move into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA> As part of the integration process, guardians' allowance will be paid to sole parents receiving FAS. This will provide an additional $13.90 a week to 22,000 sole parent families. The additional pensioner or benefit component will now be paid, as I have said, to the primary care giver, directing a greater proportion of income support to the person taking the major responsibility for children-generally the mother.</PARA>
<PARA> The families package is another illustration of this Government delivering a Labor Budget. As I have said, we continue to deliver on the Labor equation. In these times, the intrinsic worth, merit, decency and equity of these decisions should be recognised and contrasted with the proposals of an Opposition which talks about slashing $3 billion off government expenditure. Who would suffer from those cuts? It would be the poor and the needy. That is the difference between this Government and the Opposition.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very conscious of the fact that the honourable member's electorate is one of the fringe areas in terms of Australian cities. From the point of view of residents, the question of the cost of infrastructure and the provision of services is not an academic question; it has an urgency about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The objectives of the better cities program are to reduce the costs of infrastructure-that would be of benefit to industry and, obviously, governments and households; to reduce the cost of housing and provide a better choice of housing style and location; to improve access to work and services; to seek to reduce pollution and congestion; and better transport systems.</PARA>
<PARA> We approach those objectives on the basis of a number of initiatives the Government has under way. We have the national housing strategy, which is the most comprehensive review of housing since 1944. Under my predecessor we experimented very successfully in the Green Street joint venture, and with State and local government and the housing industry we are beginning to demonstrate different approaches and new ideas in smart housing. We have developed the Australian model code for residential development, setting new standards for housing regulation. We have developed and are carrying out an urban public transport program of great significance for fringe areas. We have identified and begun a process of leasing Commonwealth land within urban areas.</PARA>
<PARA> A program of this kind cannot succeed in any way other than on the basis of a partnership between three levels of government. So the agreement at the Special Premiers Conference regarding the need for urban consolidation and for a more efficient and equitable approach to the provision and financing of urban infrastructure and in coordination and planning is a very significant agreement, as is the agreement of industry with levels of government to seek reform and efficiency in the housing industry.</PARA>
<PARA> In carrying forward this very significant agenda, we need to pursue a process that will be complex and time consuming, and one that will involve various levels of government. We will be able to build on the foundations I have mentioned, and I believe that by November we will be in a position to finalise agreement with the States on areas for development under the better cities program. We will be acting on the recommendations of the Indicative Planning Council regarding the release of urban land and the redevelopment of existing land. We will be able to work on the basis of the national housing strategy in approaching a more efficient supply of land and housing. We will work with State, local government and industry participants to achieve further advances in industry efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA> Out of the national housing strategy we will soon see a major document on efficiency in the housing industry. I believe that that document will be a blueprint for significant reform where the Government, together with the private sector, will be able to charter an emphasis on efficiency so that quality housing can be produced at an affordable price.</PARA>
<PARA> We live in the country which, of all countries, has the greatest interest in reform of our cities. One cannot carry out that reform on a single level of government. One needs to approach it on the basis of partnership. One needs to involve other levels of government and the private sector. Because something is complex or difficult, or because it would take some years to achieve, is no reason not to start.</PARA>
<PARA> If there is a difference between this Government and the Opposition it is that we have been prepared in terms of Government policy to tackle problems that involve complexity, significant reform and other levels of government. It is one thing to parrot platitudes about so-called micro-economic reform; it is another to produce a national freight corporation; it is another to produce a national electricity supply network; it is another to produce significant waterfront reform; it is another to produce significant reform in the structure of our cities.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made a clear commitment, which it approaches on the basis of partnership with the States. The States will have no faith in those opposite, but I think they understand from this Government that we will be able to carry through a process of reform that will make a great difference to the quality of life in Australian cities and will help to achieve, on the basis of both new and existing infrastructure, very significant reforms in the efficiency of Australian cities.</PARA>

It is a question of timing that centres on the differences between the 4 1/2 per cent and the 6 1/2 per cent.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say at the outset-as the honourable gentleman knows, I have said this on many occasions, both personally and behalf of this Government-that we deeply regret the fact that we had to take the decisions that were taken and the pain that has undoubtedly been caused for many Australians in that process. As the honourable gentleman knows, we were faced with a situation where-given the lack of symmetry between growth in expenditure and growth in production-if we in this country had not made the decisions that we did to slow down the economy, then the world would have imposed a far more painful adjustment on us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no question other than that unemployment is a tragedy. The fact is that real jobs cannot be created tomorrow; they cannot be created overnight; they cannot be created, as I think the honourable gentleman appreciates and agrees, by artificial pump priming, nor may I say in respect of those opposite can jobs be created by a process of massive slashing of government expenditures. That is a recipe for further disaster in this country. Mr Speaker, as you would appreciate, the policies that we have followed have significantly reduced inflation and the current account deficit. We believe that this provides the only basis for sustainable growth in the creation of new jobs.</PARA>
<PARA> I think the point of the question by the honourable member and his interest comes from the transition to recovery. This Budget again demonstrates the commitment of this Government to social justice and a structural adjustment through a further transition and expansion in labour market programs. We are not simply saying, `Here is something that had to be done to slow the economy down'; we are undertaking massive changes and improvements in relevant labour market programs to deal with the problem of the unemployed and to put them in a better position to take advantage of the recovery that will undoubtedly come.</PARA>
<PARA> The key Budget measures, together with the substantial package that was announced in the March 1991 statement, provide for an increase in expenditure on labour market programs from $399m in 1990-91 to an estimated $598m in this financial year of 1991-92-in other words, almost exactly a 50 per cent increase in expenditure on labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA> There will be an expansion of the Jobskills program introduced in the March statement to provide training and work experience to 9,000 long term unemployed people. The training and skills program, TASK, will assist firms to retain employees in danger of retrenchment and provide them with industry related or basic workplace skills at a cost of some $15m in this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> I know that the honourable gentleman will be pleased to understand that in addition to that about $420m has been allocated to TAFE, including $40m in 1991-92 for extra TAFE places. A further $180m has been allocated to entry level in skills training, including $12m for measures to keep apprentices and trainees in employment. Those measures, as I know the honourable gentleman will appreciate, are designed to strengthen the skills of job seekers and workers, and thereby hasten their return to employment, and to ensure that skill shortages do not emerge in the recovery. From past experience we know the tragedy of coming out of a recession where employers have got rid of their apprentices that there has not been the skills base to take advantage of that recovery. That is what happened in 1982-83, and by these measures we are ensuring that will not happen again under this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> For those in extreme financial crisis, the Government has allocated an additional $3m for emergency relief over each of the next two financial years. We have also reduced waiting periods for rent assistance for the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to that relevant, compassionate and constructive series of measures which this Government is undertaking to deal with this problem, we are confronted with the hypocrisy of the Opposition which is portraying itself as having some concern for the less fortunate in the community. Mr Speaker, let me put this confected concern in its right perspective. It was, after all, this Leader of the Opposition who said on 19 October 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, most of the long term unemployed will be expected to accept jobs that they would otherwise find unacceptable or live by their own means.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, get out on the street and beg. That is the policy; that is the concept; that is the lack of concern of the Leader of the Opposition. What the Opposition would do in respect of the long term unemployed would be to cut off the unemployment benefit after nine months-just throw them onto the street. That is the concern of honourable members opposite. That is the revelation of the hypocrisy of honourable gentlemen opposite when they stand up in this place and pretend to be concerned about the unemployed in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On asset sales we have factored in a rather conservative figure, given the behaviour of the Opposition last year when it knocked off the sale of the Pipeline Authority, even though it was Opposition policy to sell it. That is what happened in the Senate. We have put in conservative figures this year. It is mainly represented by asset sales with respect to the airlines industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the Commonwealth Bank, there was no payment in 1990-91. That was deferred because of the upcoming float, which was very successful. In terms of the Reserve Bank, that figure is from 1990-91; it is not 1991-92. In terms of State debt, last year $1 billion was put onto the surplus; this year $2 billion will go onto the deficit. That will be a continuing process because we now have the States being responsible for their own debt. When we get into better or different arrangements between the Commonwealth Government and the State governments, those opposite will see these figures change.</PARA>
<PARA> The implication in the honourable gentleman's question is really that we should be cutting a lot more out of this Budget. All we know about where he would cut is that he would cut foreign aid and the ABC. If that is the case, I hope he has checked with Senator Robert Hill and Mr David Hill because, if the Opposition cuts both of them out, the hills will be alive with the sound of Hills.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Against the overall Budget context, I think there are some important initiatives that relate not just to farm families but to the rural sector generally. They are proposals that reflect initiatives that I said, on assuming this portfolio, I wanted to pursue. The overall Budget context will lock in the low inflation result we have achieved to date to ensure that those benefits, in terms of lower costs, flow on to the farmers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me come to some of the areas that I think are important. So far as social justice is concerned, we need to understand that in the area of assets tests and family support this Government has come to grips with the problem of people who are asset rich but income poor. For two years it has developed a program that will do this. This initiative will mean that for each family whose income is below the level of $13,078, plus $624 for each child-somewhere around $14,000-and who meets the liquid assets test, the asset test on family allowance will be waived. Not only will they get access to the $10 per kid that is associated with the family allowance but, in addition, they will get access to the family allowance supplement.</PARA>
<PARA> For those who do not understand the difference, the family allowance produces $10 per week; the family allowance supplement produces amounts between $26.50 and $38.65 a week. The Government has raised the asset test threshold to $600,000 to enable people at the income level I have described to get not just the family allowance but the family allowance supplement as well.</PARA>
<PARA> That is what we have done in terms of family support mechanisms-and the Deputy Leader of the National Party had the gall to say yesterday in the matter of public importance that we had done nothing for them. I hope that part of the record is set straight.</PARA>

The fact is that this Government has extended and simplified access to those payments.

It is a package of three proposals, costing $4.3m per annum, that develops agricultural and related business activities, particularly those that are export oriented and those that develop value adding activities. The honourable member should look at the detail of it.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CG4">Mr FIFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I wish to direct a question to you concerning the application of standing order 91 and the Budget debate televising arrangements. Is it a fact that standing order 91 makes special provision for the Leader of the Opposition, or a member deputed by the Leader of the Opposition, speaking in response to Government Bills and that in respect of the main Appropriation Bill for the year the special provision is for unlimited time? Is it also a fact that the practice of the House is where the first speaker in response is an Opposition member who is not the Opposition Leader or a shadow Minister deputed by the Leader, the special provisions are applied to the Leader of the Opposition or deputed member when he or she participates in the debate?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, can you confirm that the conditions governing the televising of proceedings require a fair and balanced presentation of proceedings and that this has always been a condition of access to our proceedings? Would this, in your view, indicate that any agency or group which chose to televise or broadcast `live' proceedings connected with the 1991-92 Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) would also, in the interest of fairness, be expected to televise or broadcast live the response to the Budget by the Leader of the Opposition?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="Mr SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had a quick look at standing order 91 which, for the information of honourable members, covers two and a bit pages of the Standing Orders. Standing order 91 does provide under the line `Second reading of a bill' that for the main Appropriation Bill for the year the mover, who in this case was the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), can speak for an unspecified time; and that the Leader of the Opposition or one member deputed by him can speak for an unspecified time. From my recollection, this is usually the amount of time that the Treasurer took to deliver his statement. So, under that standing order, the Leader of the Opposition would get that time whenever he made his speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not aware of any provision-though someone may be able to point out to me some precedent-that requires the Leader of the Opposition to lead. If someone other than the Leader of the Opposition rises when that Bill is brought in, I would call that member.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as televising goes, a number of statements in the rules for the taking of excerpts and the feed for televising the House relate to fairness, and those rules imply that there should be balance in what happens. In the past when the Budget debate or other important matters have been televised, the channels that have taken one side live have taken the other side live. My own view, which might not be the view of others and might not even be the view of the House, is that if a news organisation took one side live in any of those debates, either now or in the future, in fairness it probably should take the other side.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the other parts of the honourable member's question, I can only say there is no compulsion that I can impose on news media; it is up to them to do or take what they wish to do or take. I would not think that matter comes within the ambit of the guidelines I have laid down for the televising of Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time today, we saw a bumbling, trembling and ill-informed performance from the reluctant new Treasurer (Mr Kerin). I must say that I feel sorry for him. He has inherited Australian industry as a smoking ruin; he has inherited this desolate landscape at a time when the Government is hopelessly divided over the leadership. It is a Government that cannot even agree on who should lead it let alone agree on an economic strategy that will lead Australia out of the worst recession we have had for 60 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer is a reasonable bloke-a fair dinkum bloke, I think, by most standards. His frankness is a refreshing change from the hyperbole that his predecessor constantly inflicted upon us. But quite frankly, an honest attempt is just not good enough. This Budget has left Australia marking time when it has no time to lose. When the Treasurer rose to his feet yesterday to deliver his first Budget, the people of this country were looking to him not only for relief from this terrible recession but also for a clearly defined course for our future, but he failed them. They were looking to him in the most basic terms for a pointer on where the exit door is to this recession, and he did not raise a finger. They were looking for a strategy that would promote investment, and he told them that investment would fall. They were looking for something that would create jobs, and he told them that the dole queues would grow. </PARA>
<PARA> When the economic data is screaming a message at us that calls for fundamental reform, the Government's only response has been a Budget that promises more of the same. This Budget does not help Australia out of the hospital bed of recession; it beds the economy down for a long term coma. To the new Treasurer I say genuinely that he does his country a disservice. This is a good country. We have good people, we have tremendous natural resources and we have a stable political system. This country can have a good future. But it has been badly managed and it desperately requires some fundamental changes that will give us some hope and vision for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> In any Budget there are some measures that are better than others. In this Budget there were some measures which I think were reasonable-measures designed to help people who have suffered the burden of this recession. Benefits in the family allowance area will provide some people with some relief. In the Medicare area-perhaps the biggest decision for the Government-I think the Government has generally moved in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> But when we weigh up the good and the bad, not surprisingly the Budget has been widely condemned. We have only to look at a few of the headlines in the Sydney Morning Herald, such as `Why Kerin's Budget Fails'; or to listen to Bob Carr, the leader of the Labor Opposition in New South Wales, who says that there is precious little hope for the unemployed in this document and it is indefensible in Labor terms. Merle Mitchell of ACOSS I thought put it well when she said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Budget confirms that unemployment will get even worse in the coming months. The Government's response to this massive social and economic problem is woefully inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA>It sums up the general response, the condemnation from so many quarters of the Australian community based on their judgment of this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to pick up just three or four key issues in the Budget which I think highlight some of the problems which we face in this nation and which point the way to some of the solutions that I think we need to be adopting as a matter of urgency. The basic failure of this Budget is that the 831,000 Australians who are out of work today have been given no better chance of obtaining a job tomorrow and, even worse, their children have been given no better chance of gaining employment in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I substantiate that claim in two ways: firstly, by looking at the Government's own figures; and, secondly, by looking at the implications, the consequences, of this new superannuation levy or tax. I also substantiate it, not in a statistical sense, but on the basis of what people are telling me every day of the week about what is happening in their businesses and the likelihood of putting off staff in the months ahead. I do not believe that Labor backbenchers are getting any message other than the message that is clear, anecdotally, to us. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point is to look at the unemployment numbers simply on the basis of the Government's own projections. We have run these figures and the superannuation figures through the parliamentary statistics group. If one looks first at the Government's projected figures, and uses its participation rates for the year ahead, one will see unemployment rise, not to the 900,000 that the Treasurer very glibly brushed aside during Question Time today but, based on the level of 10.75 per cent, something like 920,000 to 948,000 unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> I hand to the Treasurer a table which we had prepared in the Parliamentary Library. We believe that, even on the Treasurer's own projections, unemployment will go through that 10.75 figure and rise to at least 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect of the unemployment issue is that the new superannuation tax will unquestionably add further to this increase in unemployment. We have done our work carefully so that we have a substantial proposition to put to the Treasurer. We have done the work on the basis of using Dr Chris Murphy's model, which has been made available to the Parliamentary Library. Dr Murphy is highly regarded. He used to be the chief modeller or forecaster in the Treasury, so he has a good background in the Treasurer's own Department. Furthermore, he is now a respected academic at the ANU. Interestingly, the work that he did at Treasury, of course, has been carried on, and in that sense the work that has been made available to the Treasurer has as its derivative the work originally done by Dr Murphy. My belief is that the results that we have are very close to those the Treasurer himself has had. </PARA>
<PARA> When the press reports came out last week about the likely shape of the Treasurer's superannuation policy, we put the 5 per cent across the board just to see the implications. It came up with an absolutely staggering figure: that with one decision, by one stroke of the pen, by one dirty deal done one night with the ACTU, the Treasurer would add to the unemployment queues in this country something like 101,000 people by the year 1993-94. Furthermore, there will be an inflation impact, on that assumption, of somewhere between 2 and 4.8 per cent. I recoiled at that figure. It seemed staggering that the Government should proceed down that track. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday when the figures were revealed we saw that the Government had introduced a transition period. I have no doubt that one of the Treasurer's advisers said, `You can't introduce a policy that deliberately increases unemployment by 100,000, and you ought to have some transition arrangement for small business', which the Treasurer has done and which was announced yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> We also put that through the model to see the implications. A very interesting result was obtained. On our calculations-and they are pretty conservative-that transitional effect and measure will see an addition to the unemployment figures of somewhere between 42,700 and 45,200. So in the transitional period, the figure is up towards 45,000, but over the longer term, because the Treasurer's measure is only transitional, the 100,000 is still a very relevant figure. </PARA>
<PARA> What made me fairly certain about the accuracy of our projections was that we took out the inflationary impact on that transitional measure. It is interesting that our result was 2.1 per cent, because we know, as a result of a leak in the Sydney Morning Herald, that the advice the Treasurer has received from Treasury was a figure of 2 per cent. Our figures are very close; clearly we are working on the same basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Here is the ironical twist in this Budget: we all know that tax reform is one of the many keys that need to be employed to turn this economy around and that it will provide more jobs, higher investment and higher living standards in due course. The only issue really on tax reform is: who has the guts to publicly advocate something that is in this country's long term interest?</PARA>
<PARA> Our hypocritical Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is now opposed to tax reform, because he has made exaggerated claims about the one-off CPI effect of such a measure. Yet here he is adopting such a measure in this Budget, with a transitional effect of at least 2.1 per cent. Why the hypocrisy? Very simply, the difference between us and those opposite is that in our tax reform package we will compensate people through offsetting pension increases and lower personal tax as a result of the policy decisions that we have taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has the gall to attack us for that when it is now introducing a policy change without one skerrick of compensation for the low income earners and disadvantaged who will be affected by this change. That is outrageous. That is gross hypocrisy, and I look forward to the Government's response on it. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the end of the matter. The Medicare charges are directed to problems of over-servicing, and I think that is a step in the right direction. But there is no gap insurance to offset that and, certainly, no offsetting for the CPI effect. The Government is deliberately putting people out of work, slugging low income earners and the disadvantaged and offering no offsetting changes that would provide people with opportunities or help. It is no wonder that in a moment of frankness last week, when asked about the future of this economy, this Treasurer said, `Your guess is as good as mine'. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I want to make briefly about this Budget concerns the impact of fiscal policy and the developments we have seen in respect of fiscal policy. One cannot, in any sense, understate the importance of this. We need to get interest rates down in this country. High real interest rates are the instrument this Government has used to bring on the recession. If we are to get interest rates down, one of the things that is an absolute imperative for this economy is to boost our national savings. What have we seen in recent years as a result of the impact of Government policy on savings? We have seen a massive deterioration in the contribution of the Commonwealth to the national savings effort. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times we have seen a massive increase in the public sector borrowing requirement. We had a surplus a couple of years ago of 1.6 per cent of GDP in 1988-89; now, in 1991-92, it is 4.3 per cent, on the Government's own rubbery figures, and that is a huge turnaround of a dimension we have not really seen in this country for many years. It is Whitlamesque, to put it in a broader historical context. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of national savings, the Treasurer ought to read the national accounts from the last quarter, because they say:</PARA>
<PARA>A feature of the preliminary 1990-91 estimates is the large decline in national saving, from $24.2 billion in 1989-90 to $9.3 billion 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>The rub for the Government's policy is where the accounts state:</PARA>
<PARA>Household saving fell by about $3.4 billion. However, more significant falls were in the general government surplus on current account. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has been pulling money out of national savings. In fact, the Government has not only got its hand in the pool of national savings; it has got its arm in right up to its armpits. This means higher interest rates for people who are paying mortgages and people who are trying to build up businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> A third feature of the Budget which I thought was worth commenting upon concerned the changes to the pension payment system in Veterans' Affairs. It has been the subject of a lot of controversy within Labor ranks-so much so that, if there was any question as to whether it was a good policy or not, one would be convinced by the fact that Senator Richardson is so opposed to it that he has been leaking his correspondence on the issue. He says about this decision to contract out a service:</PARA>
<PARA>It has effectively prevented us from countering the Opposition's plans to contract out welfare services. The telling points we were able to make about pensioners having to queue up in the foyers of major accountancy firms to have their pensions processed cannot be used any longer. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a telling point, and a relevant point. Of the savings that are available-of which there are many in Commonwealth expenditures-a big area of savings is to contract out more services. We accept the Government's acquiescence in the point that we made last year and that was so strongly made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) as he responded to the criticisms of the Government on that basic point. That is one of the savings that could have been achieved if the Government had gone further. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that there are many things in this Budget, but there are many things not in this Budget. What we did not have was some vision, some sense of incentive, some sense of hope for the Australian people. The Government could have undertaken major tax reform or given some incentive back to the system. It could have removed the tax on investment, which would have provided jobs and underpinned a long term recovery. It could have taken the tax off exports, if it were prepared to be bolder in tax reform. It could have moved further in industrial relations. It could have moved further by announcing a decent program of micro-economic reform that would build the productivity of this nation. It could have moved further in privatisation. Frankly, the Treasurer's first Budget is not good enough. It is a major disappointment. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) referred to leadership in the Australian Labor Party. I assure him that we will not repeat the example of the Liberal Party of Australia with the Howard-Peacock twostep, where they used to swap leaders at whim. From what I hear about leadership, the space we have to watch is not my side of the House but the one opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One point picked up by the honourable gentleman related to a statement I made the other day at a press conference. I happily admit that the words could have been better chosen. The question was: `So, Mr Kerin, do you think we are going to bumble along the bottom for a while?'. This was the third question in this vein about the turning point in the recession, as we come out of the recession into recovery. My answer was: `Well, basically your guess is as good as mine. I will be making the most accurate assessment I can of that in the Budget statements next week'. That is what I did yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> If anyone seriously thinks that any Treasurer, any economic forecaster, any economist can pick exactly when an economy will turn or is turning-when there are leading indicators and lagging indicators; when any exogenous shock, some external shock from overseas, can affect an economy; when we never know what price we will get for wheat or what the Europeans or the Americans will do-he is pulling someone's leg. </PARA>
<PARA> I well recall 1984, when we pulled this economy out of the Fraser-induced recession, where they had not only 10 per cent unemployment but also 12 per cent inflation. Mr Fraser lost his nerve and increased outlays in his last Budget by 7 per cent. There was panic from Howard and panic from Fraser. That is what those opposite did. I recall when we had to pull the economy out of recession then. In 1984 we were wondering when the economy would turn. </PARA>
<PARA> With hindsight, it had turned six months previously-at some time early in 1984. That is what I was getting at. There is enough evidence to say that the economy is turning and will certainly turn through the rest of the financial year. I was at pains to point out in my Budget Speech yesterday that the signs are tentative, they may remain so for some time, and the recovery will be slow. </PARA>
<PARA> The national account figures for the June quarter-and those are the figures that are most subject to revision-showed that recovery would be slower than some people had expected. They showed that the climb was much less in the second half of 1990-91 than in the first half of the financial year just past. Surveys of business and consumer confidence also show a bottoming out. The rate of housing loans and approvals has risen. The full effects of the eight interest rate cuts we have put in place since January 1990 still have not been felt. Exports are up and imports are down. We are getting on top of our current account deficit problem. Inflation is low, very low, and will continue to be, due to the cooperation of the trade union movement, the ACTU, award labour, through the accord. The Budget is, above all else, fiscally responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the debate about this Budget is whether we should have spent more money or cut more. The people opposite can only ever think of one thing-that we should cut and cut and cut the Budget and cut wages. It does not matter whether the economy is booming, whether we are doing very well overseas. It does not matter what sort of economic parameters we have in place, what the settings are, what the behaviour of the economy is. The only answer the people opposite ever have is to cut. There is not a word about what this Government has gone through in managing the economy against the external shocks. </PARA>
<PARA> We had to pull this economy out of recession; we had to cope with that massive terms of trade downturn in 1985 and 1986; we had to cope through the 1987 stock market crash; we had to cope with the boom again in 1988 and 1989; and now we have another terms of trade decline. Through all that period of massive assets price boom in the late eighties-through that period of corporate excesses and other excesses by people in the economy other than award labour-there was not a word from the Opposition. It was always the white shoe brigade who were inviolate. The conservative forces in this country were even backing Joh for Canberra in 1987. That is how bereft of ideas, ideals and views of Australia they were. </PARA>
<PARA> We also went through that enormous assets price boom. We were importing too much and we were getting more and more into debt to people overseas. The Commonwealth Government debt, of course, is quite low-the public debt is reasonably low. The private debt in this country is quite immense. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of economic management at this time are such that we really do have to be very fiscally responsible. Some people, including the Opposition, are saying we should cut a lot more, as well as put on a big new tax, which is the Opposition's cure-all. The other thing is that others are saying we should spend a lot more money on job creation programs. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who has just sat down, said that nothing in the Budget will give an extra job today. Nothing he said would give an extra job today-even if the Opposition had cut all that out of the Budget. The effects of this Budget will be effects six months down the track. That is why it is a matter of judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a turnaround in terms of the amount of money we are spending of $6.63 billion over the 30 June outcome of last financial year. The Budget surplus came in at about $1.9 billion. With a $4.7 billion deficit in this Budget, there is $6.63 billion feeding into this economy. We all know, of course, that employment is the last indicator to turn. Therefore, that is a matter of judgment, too-whether or not we need to pump up the economy now, which may be pro-cyclical if, indeed, the economy is turning around, as we believe it is. We understand that the avenues for investment at present are low due to the massive asset price boom that we have just gone through, because the effects of that have to wash through the system. One only has to talk to people in the financial sector to understand the level of non-performing loans. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition quite cheerfully ignores the fact that the financial sector has massive problems due to that massive assets price boom through the 1980s. It somehow ignores the fact that we have royal commissions looking into the activities of two of our banks at present. We have taken the decision not to pump prime beyond that amount. That is really about shock absorbing the recession. We believe that we will come out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is investment going into the mining industry because the prospects are good. The farm sector is very flat because of the terrible prices overseas. There is not going to be any investment in non-dwelling construction. The central business districts of the cities are full of office blocks unsold, which are all the result of the asset price boom. So there is no sense in us putting in figures or thinking that if we give massive investment allowances, depreciation allowances or massive company tax cuts this is going to suddenly turn the economy around and, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, give us jobs tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to act fiscally responsibly. There has never been a Budget that has been greeted well. If we had cut more or spent more, we would have been regarded as fiscally irresponsible. What we set out to do, as was quite clear in terms of this Government's Budget strategy, was to take into account the cyclical effects of the recession, to compensate people for those effects and to allow the economy to gradually turn around, with domestic demand factors driving the recovery-acknowledging that it would be slow. </PARA>
<PARA> If I could paraphrase what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is saying, it is really that the only people who can get some comfort out of unemployment and the economic recession are the perverse, the uncaring and, indeed, the Opposition. The shadow Treasurer's contribution to this MPI was pretty uninspiring, as we have now come to expect of him, and can be summed up in the phrase `the sour grapes of Reith'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me quote from the terms of this MPI and concentrate on what he would do and what would `give Australians real hope of improved living standards and employment opportunities'. Let me remind the House of some of the brilliant changes that the shadow Treasurer thinks would improve living standards and create jobs. First of all he thinks he will slash outlays. He wants to terminate government advertising. Brilliant! Presumably this is the mushroom-led approach to economic recovery. He will sell the whole of Qantas, Australian Airlines and the AIDC. Brilliant-the `nation of little shareholders' approach to employment opportunities. Then he will cut or abolish the ABC. I do not know where the employment opportunities are in that. That is rather brilliant too. That goes along with the `if times are tough, murder your aunty' approach to recovery. Then of course he will introduce a consumption tax. Brilliant! Times are tough, so it is a `look after your own class and beggar the rest' approach to recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> What is all this nonsense about compensation? The Opposition still has not answered the charge by the Australian Taxpayers Association that, to be compensated for a consumption tax at 15 per cent, an income earner on $23,000 would require a 63 per cent tax cut. This whole question of imposing a consumption tax on the Australian people and cutting government spending as some magic solution to provide jobs is absolute vapid nonsense. It will not provide any jobs. How will taxing the poor people more and cutting government spending give more jobs?</PARA>
<PARA> We heard all this nonsense over the years of not wanting to crowd out the private sector, so what did we do? We brought in four record Budget surpluses, the first time that has been achieved since 1953. We brought in more reform. But no, that was never enough-all we had to do was cut wages, cut government spending. They are the only things that honourable gentlemen opposite know. Just think of this consumption tax. Honourable members opposite are now running around the country saying that, after all, there is a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but wholesale sales tax is not the same as a retail tax. Of the goods bought from supermarket shelves, 70 per cent are not covered by the wholesale sales tax. It is as if honourable members opposite think somehow that a wholesale tax equates to a consumption tax. They are taken at a different stage. The difference between the two depends on the retail mark-up, or the percentage retail margin used. It is nonsense for those opposite to run around telling this to people. There is no need to run any scare campaign. They are setting up this straw man about our supposedly running a scare campaign on the consumption tax. When honourable members opposite have the guts to tell the people what it is really all about, the people will not be scared; they will be terrified by what those opposite are saying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is an absolute nonsense to talk about compensation. There is simply no way people can be compensated if a consumption tax at the level of 15 per cent is put on. There is simply no way; the figures do not add up. Here we have a major political party saying to the Australian people in a recession that they will impose a consumption tax, that they will cut government spending and that somehow this will create jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget is a responsible Budget. It does take people into account. It is a responsible Budget in terms of its fiscal integrity and in terms of its fiscal responsibility. This Budget provides support for low income families through this depression, especially those with kids, and that is why the families package has been put together. Outlays on assistance to families with children have increased from $3,208m in 1983-84 to an estimated $6.106 billion in 1991-92. As ever and as with all our social reforms, payments have been targeted to those most in need. That is where the compensation comes from in our budgetary approach, not by this imposition of a tax right across the board which means that people cannot possibly be compensated. </PARA>
<PARA> Between March 1983 and January 1991, for low income families, support for children under 13 increased in real terms by 54 per cent and for teenage children by 125 per cent. That is our approach. We are looking after people and we are putting the economy on track. We have still been able to initiate medium term reforms of great significance in health services, in cities, for the environment and, most significantly, in superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> For a Labor government, the reform job is never finished, and no matter how tight the situation is, we will make sure that we take the necessary steps and the fundamental changes for our economy and for our society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would seem that the game of puns is catching to those who pass through the Primary Industries portfolio. Today we had two from the ex-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, now the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), namely, `The hills will be alive with the sound of Hills', and `The sour grapes of Reith'. He will have to do a lot better than that, because in referring to foreign aid, by way of first response, let me say that his Government has increased foreign aid to countries beyond our region-beyond Asia, beyond the south-west Pacific-in a curious priority which does not reflect the coalition's priority or what intelligent people would want of an Australian foreign aid program. Our priorities on that particular aspect are correct. They will stand up to scrutiny and point the way forward for Australia to relate more to its region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the Treasurer's contribution, I do not dispute-nor does the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith)-that international factors have impacted on the Australian economy by degrees. But the truth of the matter is that the Australian economy went into recession ahead of the world recession. The truth of the matter is that many parts of the Australian economy are in a much deeper recession than those in similar OECD countries around the world. The very sad truth of the matter is that it is more than likely that we will come out of this recession after most OECD economies will have fired up. So we went in first, we went in deeper in terms of economic recessions, and we are going to be the last one out. We will suffer awful agony as a consequence, with so many people jobless, so many small business operators driven to the wall and so many farmers forced off their farms. </PARA>
<PARA> I address two other comments in the Treasurer's totally inadequate defence of a totally inadequate Budget-the Kerin-Keating Budget-which really does nothing for the jobless. He said, `All the coalition would do is put a new tax on'. He is referring to the fair goods and services tax in our tax reform package, which is all about more jobs and less taxation overall. His real crime is an intellectual one of some magnitude, because he knows in his heart that the correct course of action is the one that we are advocating-the abolition of sales tax, the abolition of indirect taxes on our hard pressed export industries, the boosting of the productive sector, and the tilting of the taxation system back in favour of the productive sector so that we will generate jobs, generate employment, and generate economic activity to turn this country around. So he has much to answer for. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is at variance with the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the ex-Treasurer-failed Treasurer Keating. Remember that man? Both of them in 1985 were out in the community trumpeting the goods and services tax of option C. What is more important, the Prime Minister said at that time in categorical terms that it is possible to properly compensate or offset in relation to the introduction of option C, a GST. So let us have more honesty from this Treasurer on this particular subject as we welcome him into the debating arena on the question of tax reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly his Budget has failed on the question of tax reform. It maintains a $9 billion sales tax impost on Australians and Australian export industries in part. The total revenue collection remains at over $9 billion, with many millions of dollars on transport, freight and transport equipment, adding greatly to the cost overhead and overburden of so many people living in regional and remote Australia who are trying to survive in this recession we did not have to have. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Treasurer referred to mining investment and how this was somehow magically picking up. I will deal with that more fully tomorrow. I simply say that mining investment in Australia is very fragile indeed. Even if the Government had the confidence to proceed and it seeks permission to go through all the processes, such as happened at Coronation Hill, it will create yet another umpire. The umpire reports and says that there will be no damage to the environment for proceeding with the renewed mining of Coronation Hill. It has already had 25,000 tonnes of ore taken out. It is easy to walk into the existing mined area of Coronation Hill. It would fit in an area which is smaller than the land that Parliament House occupies. I did so with Senator Grant Tambling 10 days ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the Government stepped in and said, `Because of the prospect of Bula and a range of other factors, we are going to deny this economic activity boost to the top end of the Northern Territory. We are going to deny jobs to the people who would have been provided for by way of the increased economic activity flowing from Coronation Hill'. The Government said no; it vetoed Coronation Hill. What confidence did that give to the mining industry? Clearly, this Budget is totally inadequate. It is steady as she sinks. It is a return to the Whitlam-Uren type budgeting we saw in the early 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the vision in this Budget? There is none. Where is the fundamental industrial relations reform in this Budget? There is none. Where are the responsible policy settings that pave the way for lower interest rates? There are none. The public sector borrowing requirement will increase massively, thus paving the way for interest rates to remain higher than the OECD average. Above all, where is the leadership required from Canberra, from this Government, in this Budget? Again, there is simply none. The crumbs we get were in part highlighted by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) in Question Time today, but that ought to be seen in perspective. Firstly, the Government is admitting that it was wrong last year with Keating's assets test proposal on family allowance. Secondly, it has driven the rural economy into such a deep recession that it has now had to come back with another package in relation to the assets test, the family allowance supplement and related matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic agony of Australia is set to continue under Labor as a consequence of this inadequate Budget. This is the only conclusion we can make from the Budget delivered by the Treasurer yesterday. The Government has simply given up its right to lead this country. It is more of the same-as the band strikes up the Australian ship of state steadily sinks. If honourable members think the Oceanos went down quickly, that is nothing compared to the economy. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) and I happened to be on board the Oceanos a few weeks ago but we got off before it went to South Africa and Davy Jones's locker. </PARA>
<PARA> Seriously, we all remember the last eight Budgets which were such a key component of our current economic plight. We remember in particular the 1988 Budget which was going to bring home the bacon. Some bacon! The Government should tell that to the jobless. Three years later the Government is proudly defending its Budget. After eight years of Labor we have a five-fold increase in foreign debt because of the Australia Inc. situation, which is equivalent to $8,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add, to be fair, that there are a couple of positive measures in the Budget, but they are few and far between. Clearly, the point of direction on the National Rail Freight Corporation is one of those measures. Overall, it is a totally inadequate document, one which does not stack up for Australia or the jobless who hold little hope, little prospect, of returning to full time employment under the settings laid down by this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> In many ways we can talk of Placido budgets, but we can also talk of placebo budgets. For those not in the medical profession, a placebo is a little sugar tablet which a doctor might prescribe but which does nothing for the patient. It is given to humour a patient rather than cure the ills. Treasurer Kerin has delivered a placebo Budget, a nothing Budget, a Budget which misses the point of the economic circumstance of so many Australians and leaves so many Australians facing absolute economic agony as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), the coalition and I are committed to an economic reform agenda which stacks up for Australia, abolishes sales tax, lowers fuel taxation on business input fuel, mining, farming, fishing and tourism to tilt the taxation system of this country back towards the productive sector, but which also looks after the family.

In terms of economic management and the quality of life for Australians in an economic sense, there are three important criteria, of which the Budget is one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Budget sets out the important fiscal policy measures of the Government. Monetary policy is clearly important, as is wages policy. The debate today focused heavily on the Budget and fiscal policy although there has been some comment about monetary policy which I also wish to address. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention has been made of interest rates and inflation in this country. It is worth recalling that interest rates have fallen by 7 1/2 per cent in the last year or so. Inflation is down to its lowest level in a generation. Home loans, often regarded as the important yardstick for the building industry, are now down to 13 per cent, a rate lower than the previously fixed home loan interest rates. Long term rates are now at a 10-year low. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also introduced a series of programs and schemes to assist those who are less well off, particularly acknowledging the difficulties of those who are unemployed. I am sure that there is no-one in this place on either side of the Parliament who takes any comfort whatsoever in the large numbers of unemployed in Australia at present. However, members on this side of the House have ensured that they are able to maintain a quality of living which would not be available to them under the policies of the Opposition. We have introduced various training schemes and expanded those in statements since the 1990 Budget and in the Budget delivered yesterday. Skillshare, Jobstart, Jobtrain and various other training programs are all designed not only to provide a standard of living for those out of work but to give them the opportunity to acquire skills which will enable them to enter the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the increase in unemployment which has occurred in recent months, it is true that the Government has created in excess of one million jobs since it came to office. In addition to taking those measures, the Government has also provided various forms of assistance for families outside the employment network. They include a family allowance supplement, the child-care fee relief, Medicare and Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth contrasting the initiatives and the record of this Government with the sorts of policies and practices that those opposite have espoused. We have claims from the Opposition that we need to do something to increase employment. It has put on the record various prescriptions which go nowhere down the track to achieving that goal, a goal which everyone in this place would accept as fair and reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, in February of this year the shadow Treasurer went on the record as calling on the Government to reduce its expenditure by $3 billion. The Australian of 19 February 1991 said:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Reith's clarification of the Opposition's stance on fiscal policy-that it would both increase taxes and cut spending during a recession-means there is now a growing gulf between the positions of the Government and the Coalition on the role of government spending during a recession. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite true. There is a growing gulf. It is not just a gulf between the Opposition and the Government on that point-it is a gulf between the Opposition and all economic commentators on that point. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's proposition that the Government should slash $3 billion from its expenditure in the financial year just ended demonstrates the lack of understanding and possibly compassion on the part of those opposite for the plight of those who would inevitably be thrown out of work. In fact, the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research carried out a study on what might happen if there was a cut in the last financial year, not of the $3 billion proposed by the shadow Treasurer but of $2.1 billion which, at the time, was the cut proposed by the Business Council of Australia. Using its estimates on a $2.1 billion reduction in recurrent expenditure, the Institute said that there would be an increase in unemployment of 60,000 people in 1992 and 80,000 people in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA> Bear in mind that that is based on a cut of $2.1 billion. The Opposition has in fact urged the Government to make a cut of $3 billion. If we make a simple adjustment to that and assume that there is some degree of proportionality, the Opposition's proposal to cut government expenditure in the last financial year would have led to an increase in unemployment of 90,000 people in 1992 and in excess of 100,000 in 1993. They are in fact the estimates of the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research. Not only would unemployment have risen; there would have been a decline in GDP of the order of $5 billion in 1992 and a decline exceeding $6 billion in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that the proposition that the Government reduce expenditure in times of economic difficulty runs counter to all of the accepted conventions of economic analysis. Yet the Opposition has stuck firm to that position, not only in February but in recent times. It will be instructive to listen to Opposition members when they respond to the Budget in a couple of days time and set out once more their plan to reduce government expenditure. I hope that on this occasion they will be a little more precise than they were last financial year when they ducked and dived and avoided any commitment as to which area they might cut. Hopefully, on this occasion, they will be a little bit more specific. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is not just in the area of government expenditure that the Opposition has gone off the rails. At every opportunity throughout 1990 and into the first part of this year the Opposition has criticised the Government when interest rates have in fact fallen. In January of last year, when interest rates were reduced, the now Leader of the Opposition attacked the Government. He wanted to know what the urgency was. On 23 January he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating is pushing the pace of interest rate reductions simply to suit his electoral timetable. </PARA>
<PARA>The now Leader of the Opposition opposed the reduction in interest rates in January of 1990. Not to be outdone, in November of last year the current shadow Treasurer also opposed the reduction in interest rates at that time. He said in November of last year:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, I in the end come to the view, yes, if we were loosening off on monetary policy without fiscal policy changes, then you would end up with higher interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to interpret that gobbledegook by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, I would not take the rates off. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what was said in November last year by the current shadow Treasurer when interest rates were in fact falling. He opposed the reduction of interest rates last year. But he now has the hide to come in here and attack the Government because, in his view, interest rates have not in fact fallen as fast as he would like. But the record shows that last year when they were falling the Opposition opposed it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn for a minute to industry policy. One would expect the Opposition to come up with some plans that might generate employment in this area, given the nature of the matter of public importance which it has proposed today. The Bulletin of 18 June this year included an article on the vehicle industry-a major manufacturing industry that has been the cause of some concern to many of us for some years. Under the headline `Libs pull the wheels off the car plan' the article explained the concern amongst Australia's vehicle manufacturers for the sorts of policies that those opposite promulgate. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's car-makers are running scared of a coalition victory in the next federal election. Causing the concern is an unreported speech to the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI) by the shadow minister for industry and commerce, Ian McLachlan, which bluntly warned of savage cuts in car industry protection after 1996 if a Lib-National Party government were elected in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to explain this matter in more detail-I do not have time to do that-the fears of the vehicle industry for loss of jobs if in fact those opposite were to have the opportunity to introduce their policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, the matter of public importance before us is a frivolous one. Worse than that, it is one which is embedded in hypocrisy. The Opposition's record in fiscal matters, in monetary matters and in wages policy belies its crocodile tears about seeking to enhance the quality of life and employment of Australians.

Mr Oakes misrepresented me by not only selectively quoting me but also quoting me out of context, as is quite clear from the record of the interview.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I made the simple point that, on the question of tax policy, political parties should state their policy in advance of an election. That should be their policy and remain their policy. The tax policy implemented in any parliamentary term in the future should likewise be declared prior to the next ensuing election so that the public is not ambushed and is not subject to taxation by stealth, as it has been under this Labor Government, which has massively increased income taxes and sales tax without ever having the honesty to first seek a mandate from the electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Opposition is totally opposed to this motion. This is a ludicrous attempt to change the order of the proceedings of this Parliament to try to force me to deliver our Budget reply at three o'clock tomorrow afternoon rather than, as has been a tradition in this place, at 7.30 or 8 p.m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, for almost four decades there has been a long standing practice and convention in this Parliament that the Budget is delivered on the evening of the first Tuesday of the second parliamentary term of the year and the Leader of the Opposition responds on the Thursday evening. But on this occasion, the Government has decided to change the time at which the Budget is delivered to three o'clock in the afternoon, as was done yesterday afternoon. The purpose of this motion is simply to try to force my hand and have me deliver my speech at three o'clock in the afternoon. One would have to ask oneself why the Government would go to so much trouble to break with four decades of tradition. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members- They're scared!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable members say, the answer is obviously that the Government is running scared. It is running scared because it does not want to have to be publicly accountable for the miserable mismanagement of this economy that it has subjected the people of Australia to over the last eight years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, if one listened to the Budget yesterday and read the press assessments of that Budget today, one can see why the Government wimped out. That Budget was a total disaster-a total wimp out. No wonder the Government tried to bury it at three o'clock in the afternoon when nobody would be watching. </PARA>
<PARA> The other reason is, of course, that the Government has decided as a matter of strategy to make the Opposition's life as difficult as possible. This is quite predictable behaviour by a group of blokes who are so far behind in the polls. It is predictable behaviour in the sense that they will take any step or measure to try to make our life as difficult as possible going into the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is particularly interesting and important to note that the Government will stop at absolutely nothing to make the Opposition's life impossible. We have just had Buffoon Bolkus in the Senate for a period of months arguing the case for an advertisement ban and the disclosure of political campaign donations, both of which moves were designed to make our life difficult. It has been interesting to me in the past several weeks how rapidly Buffoon Bolkus has been being backing  off--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which is the term-`Buffoon Bolkus'? I withdraw that and refer to him as Senator Bolkus. He has gone to any length, including an attempt to ban free speech in this country, in order to prevent the Opposition from getting its message out to the people of Australia. That is what this is all about; this is simply an attempt to force us into using a time of day for the presentation of the reply to the Budget which the Government believes will make it difficult for us to get any sort of significant coverage. In particular, the Government wants to deny us the major prime television audience time, which would be associated with the delivery at the conventional time of 7.30 p.m. or 8 p.m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is simply an indication of how desperate this Government has become. It is running scared and it is deeply divided by the poisonous leadership battles and confrontations that have totally preoccupied the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the point of advanced stages of paranoia. It was even described by the ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), almost in those terms. The Prime Minister sits here day after day in the Parliament and at Question Time is visibly nervous and shaken. Honourable members will have noticed how in the last couple of days since Parliament returned the Prime Minister has answered all his questions by looking at his colleagues. He is no longer prepared to turn his back on his colleagues and face the music on this side. The Prime Minister has taken to answering questions with his back to the Opposition so that no-one on the Government side actually gets up. </PARA>
<PARA> Have honourable members noticed how enthralled Government members have been? Have they noticed how the Prime Minister turns around and says, `I am spending all this money on family assistance', and members of the Government all sit there as though they were half asleep? That is what the Prime Minister has been reduced to. He is totally preoccupied and totally unable to run this country. We have no better evidence of that than a Budget that has absolutely nothing to do with the basic problems of this country; it does nothing for jobs. In fact, the only answer the Treasurer managed today in seven or eight questions when he was completely clean bowled by the shadow Treasurer was to whisper that maybe unemployment would go about 900,000. Louder-900,000! Actually, the number is 950,000 on the Treasury numbers. When one adds the 100,000 that will come from the superannuation deal, one is looking at over one million people unemployed on the Government's own numbers. Honourable members know how the Government has been fudging them over the past eight years. We are looking at two million Australian people who cannot work as much as they want to in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget had nothing to do with the fundamental problem of unemployment and job insecurity in this country. It did nothing for investment, for structural reform or for labour market reform. Indeed the Government did not even have a wages policy; the Treasurer stood up here today with three different wage numbers and was unable to tell us which one actually related to what and how they passed through the inflation rate. This is the bloke who is supposed to be running the country. He was up on his feet here today absolutely out of control, babbling on about this number and that number through the year and at the end of the year and before the year and the start of the year. It was ridiculous stuff; he was totally lost and out of control. That is what this Government has been reduced to-a group of people who are prepared to continue to try to hang onto power at any cost, and a Prime Minister who is prepared to subvert the whole Budget process to a series of deals designed to shore up his leadership and his job at the expense of the jobs of those two million Australians out there who either will be recorded as unemployed or are unable to get as much work as they want in this country. The simple fact is that they have no hope of getting their jobs back in this country until the Prime Minister loses his. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister is about making the Opposition's life as difficult as possible when it comes to taking our case to the people of Australia and in putting our argument to the people of Australia in the form in which we want to put it and in the most effective way we want to put it. So the Government is stopping us at every turn. The Government changed the postage allowance illegally in the last election campaign so it could direct mail en masse to its key concern marginal seats; it wants to impose the ad ban and attempt to force disclosure of political campaign donations-in part to hide its past donations from Western Australia and in part to make the Opposition's life difficult-and now we have this really cheap and shallow attempt by one of the aspirants for the job. He cannot actually decide which way to go when he listens to me talk these days; he does not know whether he wants Hawke knocked off or not. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was the pea. Just after the last election campaign all those articles and soft profile pieces appeared about how the Leader of the House was going to take over from the old fellow when he moved on. He was being groomed for the job, but he made an absolute mess of his portfolio and an absolute mess of the running of this Parliament. Then the penny dropped that the Leader of the House was not worth the effort anyway because he is sitting in one of the most marginal seats in Western Australia; the Government could not possibly have him having a run. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the other Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) is starting to smile; he figures he has an outside chance. If we could get him onto his feet, he would agree with me. He is such a modest and measured fellow, he would agree with me. Yes, he does; he is nodding. He reckons he has an outside chance. That is what has happened over on the other side. It is not just the Leader of the House who sees himself as the pea; the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean)-the guy with the R.M. Williams boots, who went out and got the gear, the checked sports coat and the tie, who went down to Deniliquin or somewhere and talked to farmers and who comes in here with cow pats on his shoes just so that we know he is legitimate-is another aspirant. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact the whole of the front bench members of the Government see themselves as aspirants. With this motion the Government is trying simply to make the Opposition's life as difficult as possible and make it impossible for us to get our argument across in the most effective way. As I said, the Government will stop at nothing to subvert what has been a four-decade convention and tradition in this Parliament that the Budget Speech is delivered on the evening of the first Tuesday of the second parliamentary session and the Leader of the Opposition's response is delivered on the following Thursday evening at the same time. If it takes banning free speech or cheating on postage or doing any one of a host of other things to hide the fact that the Government is fundamentally and poisonously divided, the Government will do it. The Opposition totally rejects this notion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was really and genuinely pathetic. This is the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) being semi-tough; this is the Leader of the Opposition trying to come into this place and do some sort of rough facsimile of the sort of confected horror that we used to be subjected to by the former Leader of the Opposition, who at least had the capacity to carry it off with a bit of style and elegance. He was not like some sort of Shore Grammar debating technique circa 1967 or whenever it was, which is what we managed to get from the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of postage allowances, with the old Charlie sitting there sadly in the background, I must give the Leader of the Opposition some points at least on the count of sheer gall in coming in here and talking about postage allowances vis-a-vis the last election campaign and performances in that regard. The only honourable member who apparently seriously used it to a very substantial extent came from the other side of the House. However, to come in here and raise it as an argument against the Government was completely absurd.</PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House do have some respect for tradition. In fact, there has been a whole number of ways in which the Budget debate has been conducted over the years. The fact of the matter is that it has not always been at 7.30 and it has not always been televised, as the Opposition well knows. Indeed, it was generally at 8 o'clock and the reply was a couple of days later at 8 o'clock. But the one common feature always has been that the time of the response delivered by the Opposition in this House is the same as the time the Speech was delivered-be it 7.30 or 8 o'clock. If the Speech was delivered at 7.30, it was responded to by the Opposition at 7.30; when it was 8 o'clock, it was responded to at 8 o'clock by the Opposition. It has been presented this time at 3 o'clock; the Opposition will now have its turn at 3 o'clock. </PARA>
<PARA> I stand to be corrected on this, but I do not think even that particular pattern has been automatically conformed to. I seem to recollect that on one occasion when Mr Hayden was Leader of the Opposition he chose, as a particular Opposition tactic, to respond immediately to the Budget. I may be incorrect, but I think that did occur. So he breached the pattern on that occasion, and I am sure we could have accommodated the Opposition if it had decided to run on, immediately after the Treasurer had delivered the Budget, at 3.30 yesterday. But the fact of the matter is, as far as the Government is concerned, that time is made available at the same time of the day two days on for the Opposition to give a reply. </PARA>
<PARA> I have picked up a rumour around the place, the substance of which involves concerns by the Manager of Opposition Business about whether or not television stations could run responses or would be obliged to run responses and that the ABC was disinclined to run the Opposition's response at 7.30 or 8 o'clock on the Thursday night but would be prepared to run it at 3 o'clock. I might say, if that is the case, that it was not as a result of any initiative by this Government that the ABC took that particular attitude. Anyone who knows anything about the relationship of the Government and the ABC knows that it is 100 per cent contra-suggestible to suggestions by Ministers. So, on the whole, Ministers do not bother to make suggestions, and I am in no different position from my predecessors in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> So, if that is true, of course it makes this particular exercise by the Leader of the Opposition 100 per cent bogus. If that is true-and by the way in which the Opposition spokesman conducted himself in here when putting questions to the Speaker it appears to be the case-the Opposition was not going to get on the box at 7.30 or 8 o'clock anyhow, in which case the only time it has an opportunity to get its response across--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Manager of Opposition Business managed to bell the cat by the way in which he asked questions of the Speaker, which did rather seem to confirm that particular rumour that was circulating around the place; otherwise it is very difficult to establish why he should have bothered to raise those questions in the way in which he did. He can tell me: did the ABC refuse to broadcast the Opposition at 7.30? Did it give the Opposition that response? No answer. The Opposition outsmarted itself on that point by raising it with the Speaker. So the fact of the matter is, the Opposition will have no public response at 7.30 or 8 o'clock; it does have the opportunity to give a public response at 3 o'clock. So this is a performance here that is totally confected. It has absolutely no substance because the Opposition was not going to be able to give that performance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do not have a worry about its response to our Budget. We do not have a worry because we are waiting anxiously for it to answer a few questions. We want to know what it is going to do about higher education in this country. Our Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) had a few things to say about the vagueness of the propositions that the Opposition has put forward. We want to know what it intends to do about health in this country. We are very happy to hear its answers on those particular suggestions, in a Budget context or anything else. We want to know what it intends to do about consumption tax and taxation policy generally, because we think that when in this place it adopts the attitude it does to the poor and needy in this country it is perpetrating a monumental hypocrisy concerning what it intends to impose on them via a consumption tax. So we have absolutely no problems with listening to what the Opposition wants to say about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, because the point was made by the Leader of the Opposition on unemployment, we want to know what level of unemployment there would be if the Opposition were going to seek as a permanent objective an inflation rate of nil, which is what it was talking about when there was discussion in this place on inflation rates a couple of years ago. The Opposition must want to see levels of unemployment way beyond what they are at the moment, because the sorts of measures that it would have to put in place to achieve those levels of inflation would be draconian indeed. So fundamentally we do not worry about responses from the Opposition. We do not worry about the Opposition in any sense embarrassing us before our constituency, because we know that there is that thorough leavening and underpinning of hypocrisy in everything it says. But it is not subtle hypocrisy, I am afraid; it is hypocrisy that is relatively easy to expose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition was kind enough to have some concern about my constituency and whether or not I would manage to hold it next time. It is always a struggle in the old Swan, I have to say. But it is going to be a heck of a lot less of a struggle when I go around the areas of Bentley and Queen's Park and Belmont and Rivervale and have a chat with members of my constituency about the fact that they will be provided with, via a consumption tax, the means for continued good living by the people who managed that good living in the 1980s at my constituents' personal expense. </PARA>
<PARA> They will have a view about who will support the poor and needy when they have an opportunity to hear that. They will want an opportunity to hear what might be done and hear about the chances of their children securing a higher education, following the sorts of suggestions that have emanated thus far from the Opposition. No doubt they will be very pleased to hear some answers in that regard. They will also be pleased to hear what is intended on their behalf when it comes to health policy and whether or not they will be able to continue to be in receipt of a universal service. Above all, because many of them are pensioners, they will be very pleased to get an understanding of how it is intended that $3 billion will be cut from the social security budget. That is something that will be of some interest and concern to them. </PARA>
<PARA> So we do not actually have a problem with the Opposition's presentation in this matter, but we would like to hear some answers to those questions. We strongly suspect the answers to those questions in any particular detail will not, in fact, be forthcoming in a couple of days time; nevertheless, it would be good to be able to hear them. I think, given the amount of time the Opposition has had to work on these policies, an absolute minimum requirement as far as this House is concerned and as far as the public is concerned is for the Opposition to have put up or shut up on a couple of these issues by now. After all, the Opposition has had about 18 months to work on them, and I think that we are really entitled to hear a few answers to those particular questions in this Budget reply. I strongly suspect that we will not. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as equity in this House is concerned, the Opposition is getting an opportunity to respond at exactly the same time as the Government chose to deliver its Budget. The Opposition's response, if it is given at that time, I understand will be broadcast on national television. I am not sure, but there have been rumours-and I take those rumours to be somewhat confirmed by that otherwise totally inexplicable intervention by the Manager of Opposition Business in questioning the Speaker earlier on-that the Opposition in fact was not going to get time on national television to present its response to the Budget at 7.30 or 8 o'clock. If that were to be the situation, of course it would render this whole exercise here an exercise that, if it has any merit at all, has some merit in its training value-training the Leader of the Opposition to be a parliamentarian. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition would be able to have its array of judges sit there behind the Leader of the Opposition, pass judgment on him and take him outside. They will say, `Well, John'--</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Perhaps you should give a bit more inflection there, or perhaps button your coat, lean and speak closely into the microphone-or perhaps you could learn something from the putative Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who has developed a better technique of slapping the dispatch box than just about anybody else in this chamber; that putative Deputy Leader who unfortunately is not here to advise you on technique because, as well as from the honourable member for Kooyong, you would get some excellent advice from him on how the Leader of the Opposition ought to conduct himself in Parliament'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One is sort of left to wonder why in fact he is not here. He has been conspicuously absent this last day. I do not know whether his particular run at the Opposition's current Deputy was said to be successful or unsuccessful at its last party meeting. No doubt he will have another opportunity to run at the current Deputy sometime later, using the argument that most of the Opposition members believe that they have really just got to get Johnny up as Deputy in order to improve the Opposition's parliamentary performance. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell honourable members opposite: they do actually need to get John Howard up as their economic spokesman and Deputy Leader in order to put on some sort of performance in this place. In case they think they do not need to get him up here to do that, I point out that the Leader of the Opposition gave ample evidence of that need here today. So the rest of the Opposition members who are sort of sitting there ticking it over in their minds need not worry too much about abandoning their only Victorian leader; they should go for parliamentary performance when they are in the position of their Leader strongly needing that sort of support. They should ignore the fact that perhaps there will be a sentiment out there in the public that he is just worming himself into the right position at the right moment to terminate the current Leader of the Opposition when they find that some of their totally unsaleable policies need to be sold. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate the fact that honourable members opposite managed to listen to this in silence for about 30 seconds, as they recognise the arguments that they are using amongst themselves at this precise moment. Of course, some Opposition members-for reasons that we cannot quite fathom, but perhaps there is logic in them-harvest some view of a potential last minute advancement for the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). The honourable member for Barker has not yet tested himself in this place, but the would-be new deputy leader of the Opposition has tested himself, and we have to concede that he is not a bad parliamentary performer. </PARA>
<PARA> The upshot of all this is that the Opposition has to go back and reflect on this session, recognising that it has not done terribly well out of this debate, have a chat to Johnny about it, see if he has got any useful suggestions as to what it might do, hope that those suggestions do not immediately involve the current removal of the Deputy Leader and that he will be slightly more constructive. But I would not count on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The way in which the Australian National University Bill has been brought back into the House is further evidence of the contempt with which the Government is treating the Parliament and the Opposition. My office was not advised that this Bill was coming back. It is not on the blue business sheet. No effort whatever was made to consult with the Opposition in relation to these amendments. The matter has been handled either incompetently or with a total contempt for this Chamber and the role of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The way this Bill has been handled throughout its time in this House is very interesting. When the Bill was first introduced into the House, the second reading debate was guillotined. The opportunity for the Opposition to draw attention to the very damaging consequences of the Government's policies for the Australian National University was cut off. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has now reintroduced the Bill into the House without notification to the Opposition. Yet the Minister took the time, in his second reading speech, to make an extensive defence not just of the measures in this legislation, but of the Government's policies toward the Australian National University. So far the Government has provided no opportunity for the Opposition to comment in this House on these policies. The Minister is, regrettably, totally out of touch with the implications of his policies for the National University and for higher education in this country. He listens to a small clique of mates who applaud what he says and he chooses to ignore the voice--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about the Minister's union mates. He chooses to ignore the great bulk of those who have views of and interests in the development of higher education in this country and who are making their voices known with increasing loudness and clamour because of the impact of this Government's policies on the higher education system. The Australian this morning, in the higher education supplement, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Federal Government has decided to make a stand on the future of the Australian National University and push ahead with revised funding arrangements foreshadowed last March which could see the demise of the ANU as a national research institution. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are not the words of the Opposition; those are the words of the Australian. The Minister made comment in Question Time today that there had been general criticism of the Opposition's position on higher education. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that every editorial that was produced at the time the Opposition's policy was released endorsed the thrust of the coalition's policies. The Courier-Mail spoke of the union's response-the response of the Minister's mates. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>That response rather sourly demonstrates that however lofty a union's intellectual base, its reaction to perceived threats to so-called rights and privileges is unashamedly Neanderthal. Dr Kemp advances the reasonable view that universities might be better off managing employment conditions in the way they choose. This would include allowing them to top up public funding with corporate sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial of the Australian stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Dr Kemp is correct to suggest a supple academy sits uneasily with the present rigidities of industrial relations. Good scholars deserve more money, bad scholars less. It is also unhealthy, as he implies, for universities to be wholly dependent on government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Sydney Morning Herald stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Where Dr Kemp has a strong point is his claim that the universities must be able to offer places to fee-paying Australian students who have missed out because of a mark requirement. At its national conference in Hobart, the ALP voted down this proposal. But there is more ideology than logic in its position. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is in the position where the President of the Australian Higher Education Industrial Association has come out, in a private letter leaked by the unions to the Government, endorsing the thrust of the Opposition's higher education policy. Yesterday no less a person than Professor Karmel, former Chairman of the Australian Universities Commission and a former Vice-Chancellor of Flinders University and the Australian National University, endorsed the strategy put forward by the Opposition in leading the debate for rescue of higher education from the terrible condition into which it has deteriorated under this Government and which this Minister has done nothing whatever about. Of course the AVCC is delighted to receive additional funding, but the Budget addresses none of the fundamental problems, with the east European style management system that the Minister and the senior Minister under whom he works have foisted on the system. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Australian National University, in response to an article of mine the Minister stated in an article in the Canberra Times that the national university was close to his position. Does he still support that or was it another inaccurate statement about the relationship between the Government and the university system? It is reported in the same Australian article this morning, in the comment of the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University, that the university is very far from the Government's position. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>But comments by ANU administrators suggest the gap-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, between the Government and the university-</PARA>
<PARA>still exists. The director of the ANU's Institute of Advanced Studies, Professor Max Neutze, said the university would continue to protest against the Government's interference with its autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Neutze, a man who is very highly respected throughout higher education, had this to say about the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Baldwin's letter was `a bit opaque' and lacked clarity . . . We are still very concerned about the extent of ARC involvement. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that it was important to make sure the university did not get into a position where changes could not be undone. What does he mean by that-`where changes could not be undone'? He means that when the Government changes, as it surely will, there will be a significant change in higher education policy in this country. World class institutions will not be under attack, will not be undermined, will be able to manage their own affairs in a way that is not possible under the system which is being administered by this Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Barry Rolfe, who is leading a grassroots revolt of academics throughout higher education and who will be campaigning against the Labor Party in the next election, said:</PARA>
<PARA>What can he (Mr Baldwin) do (if the ANU rejected his decision)? Turn the money off?</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Rolfe is referring to the fact that the Minister, all macho, said in his initial March statement that the schools of the Institute of Advanced Studies would be reviewed and that, if the performance of any school was not satisfactory, its funding would be cut off. He later realised that he had shot off at the mouth a little, because he could not cut off its funding. The statement was incorrect. He still does not understand that it is a matter for the Australian National University to allocate its funds internally. </PARA>
<PARA> I assumed from the way the Minister later approached this issue that he had been advised that this was the case, and that is what is being referred to here. The Minister has no power to carry out that threat; he himself has said that it is up to the Australian National University to allocate its funds. As many people from the Australian National University have said to me since they have read the Minister's article, it is plain that the Minister does not understand the impact of this policy on the national university.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good. It is interesting that the honourable member for Goldstein went to other more general higher education issues. What authorities did he cite to support his position? He quoted the editorial from the Australian; he quoted the Higher Education Supplement. Let us consider its reputation for objectivity. I have been in this Ministry since April of last year. I could probably count on the fingers of one hand, and certainly on the fingers of two hands, the number of occasions on which my office has been contacted for comment on things. There has been no attempt by the HES to get the Government point of view on the issues about which it has been writing. Time and again we have seen totally distorted and biased accounts of things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To give an example, I will take the Institute of Advanced Study and ANU issue. A journalist from the Australian wrote quite an extensive piece which was based on material from an academic from the faculties of the ANU who had spent some time as a research fellow funded by the NHMRC within the institute and which strongly supported the broad thrust of government policy on what we are seeking to do there. What happens to it? Where does it put it? Does it put it in a higher education supplement so that it might provide some sort of balance to the line it has been taking consistently week in, week out? No, it put in a page buried in the middle of the computer pages. This is the sort of journalistic integrity that one has to deal with in that publication. </PARA>
<PARA> I attach no weight whatsoever to anything that is said in either the higher education supplement or in an editorial in the Australian newspaper on these sorts of issues. Time and again, there is no semblance of an attempt to get an objective and reasonable account of these issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You totally dismiss the comments of the Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee, which is the body which represents the vice-chancellors of all the higher education institutions in the country. The Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee has warmly endorsed and supported the measures that the Government announced in the Budget context yesterday and it dismissed the Opposition's National Press Club speech as being marked by superficiality, vagueness and a failure to address the whole range of practical issues that the sort of policy approach that the Opposition espouses throws up. The Opposition can be terribly selective and pick this one or that one that it claims supports its position, but I would have thought it would attach more weight to the representative body representing higher education institutions in this country. For what it is worth, I could find an editorial in this or that newspaper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, the specific terms of this legislation appear to be non-controversial. As usual, the Opposition spokesman takes the opportunity of one of these relatively non-controversial amendments to get up and grandstand. His position on the Institute of Advanced Studies is devoid of integrity. The Government is saying that when it makes $130m available annually to an institution, there ought to be some proper process of public accountability and review so that the Government can receive advice on what the appropriate distribution of the higher education research dollar is between such an institution and the rest of the higher education research system as a whole. Is the Opposition saying that is unreasonable?</PARA>
<PARA> The ANU says that it accepts that that is a reasonable proposition. The point of difference is that it continues to maintain that there ought not to be meaningful external involvement in the review process itself. We do not accept that. We proposed to the ANU that the review processes be done on a five-yearly basis and that they be done using performance criteria that would be developed jointly by the Australian Research Council and the ANU. The review panels of individual schools and centres would be comprised of a membership which would have to be agreed between the ANU and the Australian Research Council. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot see how the Opposition can reasonably object to such a process. In fact, there is no logical, coherent or remotely intellectually respectable basis on which to disagree with such a process. The Opposition knows that. It waited two months before it made any public utterance on this issue after the release of my statement on March 27, yet the Opposition talks about the guillotining of the Bill as if that is some sort of excuse. Why could the Opposition not issue a press release or call a press conference? Why could it not do an interview on the radio? The Opposition made no statement on the Government statement after March 27 until it saw a cynical, sleazy piece of political opportunism. It saw that there was a bit of political hay to be made and it jumped on the bandwagon. Its position is without integrity and without credibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) is again clearly demonstrating that he simply does not understand these issues; he is poorly briefed on the matter and is inaccurate in what he says. The Opposition fully accepts, as does the Australian National University, that it is appropriate to review the performance of a body such as the Institute of Advanced Studies. The Minister says that the National University is totally opposed to any external involvement in the review. As he knows, that is a distortion of the National University's position on the matter. From the start, the National University has objected to the way in which the Government has entrusted the review process to the Australian Research Council. The University has made a powerful case as to why this will interfere with and prevent the University's autonomous management of the Institute of Advanced Studies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has no objection whatever. Indeed, it is correct to assert that it is quite appropriate for the Government to review the performance of a body such as the Institute of Advanced Studies. Throughout we have asked for-and I must say the Australian National University has asked for-a review process which will assure the university, the public and the Government that not only has justice been done, but also that it will be seen to have been done. It has objected to the fact that it is to be reviewed by a body which itself-and this is no reflection on the individuals on the ARC-actually would benefit from the funds that might be taken away from the Institute of Advanced Studies. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the Minister's pathetic suggestions that the Opposition failed to comment on his March statement, let me draw the Minister's attention to a press release which I issued on 29 April after fully consulting with the Australian National University on the implications of the Minister's statement condemning the actions of the Minister announced in that statement. The Minister is wrong on both counts. He is wrong because he simply does not understand the issues involved; he is badly briefed on the issues involved. None of the charges that he makes against the Opposition holds the slightest amount of water. He is presiding over a system which is coming to an end. That is increasingly recognised throughout higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> It is recognised that the east European style attempt to centrally manage higher education in this country is collapsing. It is collapsing because of the overcrowding, which is a result of the Government's regulations, as the AVCC has said. I understand that because it said that the Minister was very cross with it and that it faced some difficulties in access to the Government for a period of time. But I feel sure that is remedied by its response to the Budget, which I am sure is a very sincere response. As I said, the Minister is presiding over a system which is coming to an end. Throughout higher education, it is recognised that it cannot survive; it cannot cope with the problems of the system; it is creating enormous pressures within the system for uniformity; it is interfering with institutional management. Vice-chancellor after vice-chancellor is being attacked on his own campus because the Minister's system forces an increasing centralisation of power within the institutions themselves. That is the inevitable consequence of every centralised system, and that is happening within Australian universities. It is creating division within the institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that is further exacerbated by the centralised industrial relations framework, which the Minister and his Government have imposed on the universities. That tells the university community that it is divided into employers and employees, and the traditional tactics, with which the Minister is so familiar, such as industrial confrontation, are the appropriate tactics with which to decide issues in higher education. It is a system which has centralised power, divided institutions and demoralised staff. Until it is changed, we will not get out of higher education in this country the quality and excellence of which it is capable and we will not be able to provide places within higher education for those who are qualified and knocking on the doors, but whom the Government says at the moment the universities may not admit on any terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not mind telling the universities that they can admit students from overseas for full fees. It is not prepared to allow Australian students the same opportunities. It is a system which is constantly open to the suspicion of political influence, and that suspicion, throughout higher education, is rife. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement by Professor Karmel reported in the Australian Financial Review yesterday is of great significance because no-one in Australia has a longer association with policy making in higher education at the highest levels than Professor Karmel. Professor Karmel has been involved in higher education policy for several decades. He has come to the view that the present system is intolerable and unworkable and that it has to be changed in the direction which the coalition has been advocating. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be interesting to hear the Minister's future comments on enterprise bargaining in view of the comments of Paul Hickey in Darwin. We have not heard any statements by the Minister endorsing enterprise bargaining on the public platform in higher education. His senior official, a Deputy Secretary of his Department, endorsed very strongly that direction of change, so I assume it is the Minister's direction of change, although his union mates apparently do not think so. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policy of devolution in industrial relations within higher education, our policy of deregulating the institutional profiles, our policy of funding institutions through the students rather than through the DEET bureaucracy, and our policy of giving much greater emphasis to accountability to the users of higher education rather than to the Minister's officials here in Canberra will revive higher education in this country. It will create world class institutions and, once more, it will give institutions such as the ANU the freedom to pursue an educational mission which at present is being damaged and destroyed in a totally negligent and destructive way by the policies of this Government. </PARA>

He must have hidden it under a rug in his office somewhere as nobody in the outside world seems to know anything about it. Even if he did that, he is saying it took more than a month for him to wake up to the fact that this huge public storm and controversy was happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to reiterate three final, fundamental points. The first point is that the Opposition spokesperson said that we wanted to entrust the review process to the ARC. Let us be clear what the ARC is. It is a body established by legislation to provide the Government with advice on any higher education research schemes. Contrary to what the honourable member for Goldstein apparently seems to believe, the ARC does not conduct research in its own right. It is an advisory body to government on any higher education research scheme referred to it by the Government. That is the first point. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that, looking at the structure of the Australian Research Council, nobody could reasonably question the integrity and the appropriateness of the background of the body of people who make it up. One occasionally sees attempts to label the ARC as an extension of the bureaucracy. I do not question the integrity of the bureaucracy either. The fact is that the ARC is, very clearly, a highly representative body and a highly appropriate body to be providing the Government with advice on higher education research matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point is the actual review process, which we propose. If the Opposition spokesperson paid attention he might learn the contents of the decision we have taken. In this process the reviews of individual schools and centres would be done collaboratively by the Australian Research Council and the Australian National University applying criteria which would be developed collaboratively with those two entities and with review panels, the composition of which would have to be agreed by the Australian National University and the Australian Research Council. In other words, the ANU would have an effective veto right over the composition of panels reviewing parts of its own schools and centres within itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member suggests that there is something inappropriate about that process. If that is not appropriate, he might describe an appropriate process which includes the need to achieve external accountability, which he says is necessary. What body would provide that advice to government if not the ARC? Will we create a special new entity to review the Australian National University? Let us hear in precise terms what the Opposition proposes by way of an alternative to what the Government is proposing in this area. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides for amendment to increase the maximum allowable honey levy on honey produced and sold in Australia. The Bill is one of three similar Bills, each dealing with a different way of selling honey, which provide for an increase in the maximum allowable levies or export charges on honey to 0.75c per kilogram. The levies and export charge are imposed to provide the basis for funding the Honeybee Research and Development Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the present legislation the maximum allowable levy for research and development is 0.50c per kilogram, which is the same as the current operative rate. The operative rate is determined by regulation on advice of the Federal Council of Australian Apiarists' Associations, which is the national representative beekeeper organisation, or the Honeybee Research and Development Council. The Federal Council of Australian Apiarists' Associations has advised that it wishes to increase the operative rate to 0.52c per kilogram from 1 January 1992 as part of its program of progressively increasing the producer contribution to research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> To allow for this increase and any further increases the Federal Council of Australian Apiarists' Associations has requested the raising of the maximum rate to 0.75c per kilogram. Increasing the maximum rate by 50 per cent will give industry the flexibility to increase its contributions to research and development over an extended period without the need for frequent amendments to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government commends the industry's foresight and support of the need for increased research and development. The Australian honey industry is currently contributing about 0.4 per cent of its gross value of production to research and development. Research and development is a major factor underlying this country's future growth. The Government is committed to continued matching of industry levies for funding of research and development up to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production. This has continued to encourage rural industries to increase their contributions to research and clearly the honey industry recognises the advantage of this commitment in moving towards the 0.5 per cent target. </PARA>
<PARA> No additional budgetary outlays will result from the amendment itself. However, this amendment would enable the Government to agree to an industry request for an operative rate increase above the current maximum which would then generate additional matching budgetary outlays. I commend the Bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill corrects deficiencies in four Bills-three wool Bills and one horticultural Bill. By correcting the deficiencies, it will allow levies which were collected from growers before 1 July to be transferred to the new authorities which came into operation after 1 July. It also covers one other deficiency in the wool legislation; it will ensure that the Government pays to the wool industry its share-half, or a dollar for dollar contribution-for research and development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is unnecessary legislation. It should not have been needed, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has acknowledged that. I am not having a go at the Minister or, for that matter, the Department, but I believe it is a bad scene. It is really a reflection on the quality of the legislation presented to us in Parliament when something that should be automatic in legislation-that is, the transition provisions to pick up from the old structure to the new structure, which is in some cases the major part of that legislation-is not automatically in the legislation. There should be a check list that ensures that that is automatic in any procedure before the draft legislation has the final approval to come into the House. Therefore, it is a reflection on the quality of work being done by the parliamentary draftsmen. The wool Bills were certainly late, but there has been no pressure on the horticulture Bill. That Bill went through in March this year. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the legislation being unnecessary, it creates uncertainty for the industries. There is the concern about loss of income and interest forgone to the industry and there is the worry of greater cost. With the wool industry we are talking about a significant figure. A figure of about $90m was held up. I understand that $30m of that amount was able to be transferred, so we are talking about $60m. With the horticulture industry, the amount is $95,000, still a significant figure. A different type of levy is imposed on the horticulture industry but the principle remains the same: it is important that the levies that are collected are automatically transferred and utilised by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In his second reading speech, the Minister indicated that the industries will not lose because of this; that is very important. In that speech the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government considers that the statutory authorities, and through them the woolgrowers, should not have to bear the additional expense caused by the drafting omission. Therefore the Government will pay interest for the period of the delay in the wool tax payments. The Bill provides that the Minister will determine the interest rate to apply and I envisage that the rate will be based on that which the Commonwealth earns on investment of its surplus funds.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes that interest will be payable by the Commonwealth on the delay in payment to the wool statutory authorities of wool tax money received by the Commonwealth immediately before 30 June 1991 but not paid out until after that date, while the legal questions were being resolved. </PARA>
<PARA>There is still a potential inequity in the sense that interest forgone on money invested is at a lower interest rate than money borrowed if the party that was the loser, that is, the Wool Corporation or the Realisation Commission, had to borrow additional money to make up for the money which did not come through. </PARA>
<PARA> My understanding is that that is not the case in this situation and therefore one assumes that the interest obtained by the Commonwealth, or at least the payment which will be made by the Commonwealth at that interest rate, will be equal to what the industry lost because it was not able to make use of that money. I guess that does not arise in this case; that is the assurance I have from the Minister on this case, and my understanding from the industry is the same. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular piece of legislation is not the only issue relating to wool before Parliament at present. There are the regulations that flow from the wool debate and the wool legislation in the dying stages of the last session of Parliament. The coalition parties more than ever believe, because of the way the opening of the wool auctions have gone since we were here in June, that its policy of a maximum of 10 per cent total tax to be paid by woolgrowers-to cover the repayment of the debt incurred by the old Wool Corporation, promotion, and research and development-is adequate. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very conservative. It is our intention to move for the disallowance of the regulation which the Government has proposed for 12 per cent, which follows on the final agreement or understanding in that wool legislation that, whereas the tax level remains at a maximum of 15 per cent, the operative level for this year, which will be set by regulation, will be at 12 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am giving notice that it is our intention to move for that disallowance. We believe that if one looks at the projection figures for production for this coming season-which are falling-there will be an ability for the price to remain firm above all the projections that were made a couple of months ago; there will be an ability to sell significant amounts from the stock-pile later in the season; and 10 per cent, when considering the financial problems concerning woolgrowers is, more than ever, a realistic and adequate figure. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to promotion, there was certainly some double-dealing by the Government in the dying hours of the debate. It removed the legislative figure of 3 1/2 per cent for promotion and replaced it completely by regulation. There was no notice or recognition of that given in the dying stages of the debate. Therefore, the level of wool promotion, which is a very significant part of the recovery of wool as a desired world fibre, is at the whim of the Government. I believe that is an unsatisfactory basis for what is a very significant industry promotion activity. We are talking of about $180m a year based on the reduced IWS budget for this coming year. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned-I know that some of those who will speak after me are concerned-about having an adequate financial base for promotion and the figure of 2 1/2 per cent that is to be allocated by the Government through regulation. We will not be attempting to alter that because with no legislative basis behind the regulation it is very difficult to have an actual allocation for promotion on a stable and secure basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I also believe that there is a case to be made for some outside evaluation of wool promotion-we are talking about a large amount of money-and its effectiveness, particularly in these times of financial difficulty for woolgrowers. I believe that that would be of value. That is for the industry to determine, unless the Government decides to step in with some form of Industry Commission inquiry or something like that. That is the position of the coalition concerning the regulations before the Parliament at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wool Realisation Commission, which is part of the legislation we are debating, has sold about 100,000 bales from the stockpile worth about $65m since 1 July. Its policy is to offer wool on days when there is no auction sale at a premium above the closing price for that category of wool for the last selling day of the previous season, or the closing price of the last sale, whichever is the highest. It publishes figures, and it has a reasonable accountability in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is sensible for the Wool Realisation Commission to make available wool if it is in short supply or if it is close to the mills and is needed quickly, or where that wool has been part processed. Some of that wool was available in the latter part of the last wool selling season. </PARA>
<PARA> I question-it is a personal view-the wisdom of the Wool Realisation Commission offering so much wool early in the season; that is, between 1 July and the start of the auction system, in the latter part of July. The bulk of the wool is to be available this season before Christmas and again that adds to potential market uncertainty in this new environment for wool, at a time when as much confidence as possible is needed by the industry to maintain as high an opening price as possible in setting that tone, and also for the benefit of the woolgrowers who were already suffering a dramatic reduction in their wool income. </PARA>
<PARA> That sale has certainly more than covered the $20m repayment that is required under the Government's repayment schedule. That and all the other factors at work in the wool industry at present, as I said before, confirm more than ever the correctness of our strategy through this whole debate and this most difficult time for the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I want to make concerns the role of the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics during this debate. I do not enter into the argument that the wool exporters or some others have proffered about the role of ABARE in the reduction in the price of wool since the wool selling season opened. ABARE had made a projection that it considered the average price for wool this season would be 475c a kilogram. It has a requirement to do that sort of thing, so I do not enter into that argument. </PARA>
<PARA> It worries me that ABARE is supposed to be an objective and politically neutral organisation. It exists to establish to the best of its ability the facts of the situation for a whole range of rural and resource industries. I believe it was less than objective and less than neutral during the wool tax debate. It brings to my mind the question of its role. As we were told during the wool debate, ABARE said that a levy lower than 15 per cent would reduce the price of wool in the market and therefore lower the return to growers. That was used against the coalition argument that 10 per cent was adequate. Four days after that, the debate concluded with an agreed levy of 12 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> While originally we were being told that one of the reasons why we should not drop from 15 per cent to 12 per cent was that ABARE had said that would actually lower the return to woolgrowers, the Bureau said that lowering the levy would increase the return to woolgrowers. This would mean $600 to the average woolgrower, $300 to a broadacre farmer and $300 to a sheep-beef producer. In these days of negative incomes for many woolgrowers, those are worthwhile amounts. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I want to make is that ABARE needs to be careful. It should want to maintain its role as an independent organisation whose projections and calculations are seen to have integrity, but its role during that wool tax debate indicated otherwise. It would be wise in the future for it not to allow its standards to slip in the way they did then. We support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments to the Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) are related to the Australian Wool Corporation Act 1991, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991, the Primary Industries and Energy (R&amp;) Act 1989 and the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Act 1991. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) basically covered the intricacies of the amendments and the need for them. Put simply, the Attorney-General's Department has advised that the wording of the existing legislation is such that it is not possible to appropriate and transfer to the wool statutory authorities wool tax imposed on wool sold prior to 1 July 1991 but received by the Commonwealth after that date. The situation has to be rectified and, consequently, these amendments are being put through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of the defect in the legislation, since early July the wool statutory authorities have not had access to the flow of wool tax funds which they should have had. They would therefore have incurred additional expense, either through interest forgone or through additional interest costs on borrowed funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that the statutory authorities and, through them, the woolgrowers, should not have to bear-and I think this is important to note-the additional expense caused by the omissions. Therefore, the Government will pay interest for the period of the delay in the wool tax payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that the Minister will determine the interest rate to apply. I envisage that the rate will be based on that which the Commonwealth earns on the investment of its surplus funds. The Bill also proposes that interest will be payable by the Commonwealth on the delay in payment to the wool statutory authorities of wool tax money received by the Commonwealth immediately before 30 June 1991 but not paid out until after that date while the legal question was being resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also an amendment to carry over into the new legislation for wool research and development, provisions to reflect the existing Commonwealth policy of matching research and development funds raised by primary industries up to a ceiling of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production of the amount of the levy collected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Dried Fruits Export Charges Act 1924, which was repealed on 1 July 1991, provided the funds for the former Dried Fruits Corporation. A problem arose in making payments to the new board of funds raised under the Act but collected by the Commonwealth after the date of repeal. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, this is a small amendment to correct some mistakes. I think it is important to recognise that we are all human. It is understandable, bearing in mind the workload on this House and the amount of legislation that needs to be dealt with, that in a not perfect world mistakes will be made. It is necessary to correct them. I think it is important to recognise that the amount of effort and work that goes on in this House is not often recognised outside of this chamber. In this respect, I am speaking about not only parliamentary staff but also politicians from both sides of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of modern technology, we are seen to be in five places at once. People want us to be back in our electorate as well as down here in Canberra. We are going to have to grapple with the question of whether we spend more time down here in Parliament and how that relates to the needs and requirements of our constituencies. Over the next few years, this question is going to create partisan debate. How are we to meet the requirements of our constituency both at home and in this Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government has taken a lead by introducing a package of measures to assist the wool industry in this country through these tough times. It has not been easy. But wool is now showing some positive signs of fighting back. That is good. Of course, it is very important that the industry should do so. </PARA>
<PARA> During the course of the last two years, the Government has striven to address the critical situation facing Australian woolgrowers. The Government's aim is that this will lead to the recovery of the Australian wool industry. The Government has suspended the operation of the reserve price scheme; extended the period of Commonwealth guarantee on approved Australian Wool Corporation borrowings beyond 1 July 1992; implemented the wool industry supplementary payments scheme; and enabled the Minister to issue to the AWC guidelines in relation to reducing the AWC's indebtedness. The AWC has indicated its willingness to work with the Government to implement this recovery plan. No-one expects an immediate recovery. The reduction of the stockpile and the AWC debt to manageable levels could take several years. The Government is committed to seeing the difficult process through. </PARA>
<PARA> In a recent press release from the National Farmers Federation, Mr Graham Blight, the NFF President, urged woolgrowers `to put industry and political trauma behind them and concentrate on rebuilding their industry'. He went on to say that the Wool Council of Australia had achieved a responsible result from negotiations with the Government on wool industry legislation. He welcomed new structures to manage the industry and announced that the challenge before the industry now is to make the new arrangements work smoothly and build confidence in the marketplace. That is of fundamental importance. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry is an integral and valuable part of the rural sector, and now that this debate has ended, we must focus on rebuilding the industry for the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>I fully endorse those remarks. There has been a promising upswing in the market this year. The ratio of wool to synthetic prices has fallen. This is stimulating demand and, I believe, enabling more product to be sold. Lower prices should result in overproduction being reduced more quickly. Certainly, all of us in this chamber will hope that this will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> We need now to get some enthusiasm and vision into the wool industry to give growers confidence to press on. There is no doubt that things will recover. The rural sector is tough and it will get back on its feet. If wool is to survive and prosper, it must be competitive. It must be able to compete with all of the substitutes in today's world. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is fully prepared to take action to ensure the survival of this great industry. Although the outlook is daunting, the industry has the financial strength to trade through its difficulties. It has a sound long term future. By working together and facing the need for tough decisions-at the farm and family level, at industry levels and at State and national levels-we can ensure that that future is realised. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that causes me and, I am sure, all members of the House concern, is the way in which events in Russia will impact on our trade. Only time will tell what will happen. We must hope that sanity will prevail in that country and that we are able to maintain our market share. That might sound a bit selfish. But I think it is about time we were a little selfish because every other country is. We certainly cannot afford to lose any access to the markets that we have built up in Russia. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I would like to give my support to ABARE. I do not want to say this in a derogatory way, but I do not agree with the remarks that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), made about ABARE. He does have a right make those comments. However, I would like to compliment ABARE for the work that it has done in these tough times. The Bureau has been under a lot of pressure and I think it has done an outstanding job. We do need to work together as a team. Certainly, constructive criticism-whether it be in respect of the Government or people in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy-is welcome. I support the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is one of the first public indications of the conflict between the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) and the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). This Bill has been introduced to correct errors that were made by the Government. It is not a matter of the Government not having time to look at legislation. The fundamental reason for introducing this Bill is that in two instances the Government did not realise that on the termination of legislation all the powers and obligations in respect of funds accrued under that legislation end. When one introduces new legislation, one has to provide transitionary arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the Australian Labor Party and the present Treasurer (Mr Kerin)-the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy-have been and are under great pressure, given the extent to which they find themselves unable to work out their future leadership problems. But my concern is not about that-whoever is leader, I cannot see Labor leading Australia out of the very considerable economic difficulties which even the new Treasurer today called a depression. To my mind, the situation sadly is not only exacerbated by the Budget that was introduced yesterday. Because of the measure we are now debating and because of the implications for the rural sector generally, the situation is also going to be a lot worse before it gets better. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think many people understand the extent to which wool incomes and wheat incomes-two of the primary sources of income in rural Australia-are going to continue to contract. Farmers will find when they get their annual income this year that their expectations are going to be significantly underrealised. </PARA>
<PARA> Lest it be thought that wool is the only source of income of people running sheep, let me explain to the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) that wool grows on sheep and sheep need to be sold. Old sheep that are not sold eat grass in paddocks that young sheep should be on. While a great deal is being done within the industry to try to identify ways in which we can breed sheep to produce wool that is saleable, if old sheep cannot be sold there is going to be an enormous problem in this country. There has been a reduction in flock numbers. This has been contributed to by a slaughter scheme, which I opposed and still oppose. Prices received for sheep now being sold in an effort to reduce flock numbers or cull in accordance with age or for other reasons have been reduced to such an extent that people in the wool industry are going to have a very lean time. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate of New England it is almost impossible to sell old ewes. Wethers that last year were able to bring from $15 to $20 are now flat out bringing $2 to $3, and a real crisis is developing because this year's wool income will be so much below the price received last year. Without going back into it all, we should remember that the crisis in the wool industry is largely the result of decisions taken by this Labor Government. There were any number of alternatives to the arbitrary reduction of the 870c reserve price. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go over that debate, but I put before the House, the industry and the Wool Council the fact that, had that 870c been preserved on fleece wools, none of the present disaster, in my view, would have occurred. We could have got rid of a lot of the rest of the wool and taken it from the reserve price scheme, but the present Treasurer arbitrarily intervened and reduced the price to 700c; he then suspended sales and the market collapsed. Much of the flow-on effect, without any doubt, dates back to the way in which he interfered, and as a result of the collapse of the reserve price scheme we have this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has told the House that the legislation was introduced in haste and passed after too short an examination. There are several aspects to that. First, there was no need for the legislation to be introduced in that way and there was certainly no need for the hurried consideration it had in this Parliament. Sure, it terminated on 30 June, but the Parliament did not rise on 30 June. There were any number of other opportunities for us to return. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, if the Minister believes his rhetoric, there has been the device, which the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) recommended long since, of reintroducing legislation committees. Had we had a legislation committee we could have looked at the detail of the legislation, seen the areas where it might have failed, and I suspect we might have picked this up. In legislation committees there is a Minister who is responsible for the legislation, his officials and, if you like, a few parliamentary counsel and a few representatives of the Attorney-General's Department. We go through the legislation clause by clause and examine the implications of difficult pieces of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that as a Minister it tends to be a bit disruptive of one's time-far be it from a Minister to deign to come into the Parliament to hear the views of mere parliamentarians!-but, sadly, this legislation indicates the time wasted when they do not get it right. I think it is an absolute disgrace for the Government not to be able to get it right in a matter of this order. It is not just one Bill; it is a series of Bills. It is no use pretending that it was difficult, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), suggested, because we are all terribly busy people and we really did not have the time. I can tell him that the woolgrowers out in the community are not interested in how busy he is. The point is that he is being paid; half of them are not. Half of them are in a loss situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite should talk to some of the children who have been forced to withdraw from school. Government members have spoken about the extent to which the Government has dealt with the problems in rural Australia, but I can tell the Minister at the table, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, that if he goes out into some of the areas in my electorate he will see children whose parents are not able to keep them at school, who will find this year that they are going back to the dark pre-World War II days of our grandfathers, when many children did not get more than a primary education. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the sort of thing the Labor Government has done. Honourable members opposite might be proud that the Government is trying to introduce deregulatory programs and policies. I can tell them that a lot of farmers are going broke and do not know what will happen to them, a lot of towns are closing, a lot of shops are vacant and businesses no longer operate. There are people on the dole and 26 per cent of young people are unemployed. They are looking at the Labor Government and asking, `Is this a Labor Government? Is this the Government that represents us?'. I can tell the Minister that it might have been all right in the Storeman and Packers Union and the ACTU, but on this side of the House we think that people are more important than some of the philosophies and isms and ologies the Government has been pursuing. When the people in the cities start to suffer because the income in the country goes down and the consumption that has remained gradually falls away, the Government will notice the result of what is a depression getting even worse. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the decisions of this new Minister are concerned, there are a number of other problems. I was delighted to hear my colleague the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), who is the shadow Minister for primary industries and energy, refer to the arbitrary and nonsensical decision by the Minister to reduce promotion. When things are tough and we want to sell things, we have to get out into the marketplace and look at our product. If the Minister had done his reading he would know that there had been a significant move within the Australian Wool Corporation, as it was previously constituted, to place some greater emphasis on wools in the middle micron range. They are largely the wools represented in the stockpile and they have not been selling well. Those middle wools, as they were called, are wools that the AWC had intended to embark on an extensive campaign to promote. </PARA>
<PARA> I know there are different arguments about the quality of the efforts of the International Wool Secretariat and the promotion campaign by the AWC, but in my view it is only by promoting wool and letting those who at the moment are buying other fibres understand the merits and qualities of the natural breathing fibre of wool that we have any chance at all of re-establishing one of our major primary industries. I know the Minister has been running around the country talking about added value and the extent to which we can process to a greater degree in Australia. We have all been on about that for years and all of us support it, but we must look at the realities: if we cannot sell overseas the raw wool produced on the farms and if we try to sell processed or even scoured wool, we will run into all sorts of tariff and non-tariff impediments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My friend, Australia has been at that GATT round for about 40 years. I have heard nothing new in the Uruguay Round that I did not hear in the Kennedy Round. It is like the concern we all have at the events in the Soviet Union or Yugoslavia. Of course we have concerns. We have concerns about what happens in the G7. We have real worries, but we have very little influence. It was a nonsense to send the Minister to Europe to try to persuade the Europeans to drop protection. I can tell the Minister that over the years far better men than he, from John McEwen onwards, have been there repeatedly. We have not been able to get the message through because the difficulties there are not a matter of rhetoric. They are matters of land ownership, of generation after generation of tenant farmers. The European protection is not there for economic reasons but for social reasons, because of the link with the tenant peasant farmer whose great-great grandfather or even great-great-great grandfather was first given the right to farm that bit of dirt. Our problem is that we have to put in place an advocacy which is not occasional but which is constant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was first appointed Minister for Overseas Trade Representations so that we could get a continued presence in Brussels. The Government had a whole lot of Ministers who hardly ever visited there. When the former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Lionel Bowen, for whom I have a great deal of personal respect, was Minister for Trade I do not think he visited Japan for the first 12 months of his appointment. The Government should take a leaf out of New Zealand's book. Look at marketing: New Zealand did not arbitrarily reduce the promotion funds from 4 per cent to 3 per cent, as this Government did four days after this levy went through and without telling a soul. New Zealand did not and does not act-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, it might have been five days; but this Government arbitrarily reduced it. Nobody knew, and the Government did not tell the Parliament. From the Government's point of view, it is all a matter of trying to get the money. The Government has not understood that, because the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Wool Realisation Commission have been selling more wool from the stockpile, the funds are already better. We all know that the volume of wool being produced this year as a result of seasonal conditions will be significantly lower than it was. The projections from ABARE, from the Minister's Department and from the Wool Council show that the position will be significantly better. There is little doubt, as my colleague the honourable member for Murray said, that with a 10 per cent levy we can adequately fund the needs of each of these bodies for research, for promotion and for the servicing of the stockpile. We could have done it with a 4 per cent allocation, certainly for the next 12 months, to the Australian Wool Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me pick up two things from that. The first is the parallel with New Zealand that I suggested. Looking at what New Zealand has done in Europe, we have to respect the way in which New Zealand has maintained a foot in the door there. New Zealand is still selling dairy products in Europe; it is still selling lamb there. New Zealand has done a brilliant job in marketing. I do not think I have ever heard of a better marketing exercise than New Zealand persuading the rest of the world that Chinese gooseberries are Kiwi fruit. It is brilliant, and New Zealand has done it effectively and constantly. </PARA>
<PARA> New Zealand has succeeded by persisting. It is not an occasional on and off effort. We go for a trip to Europe, knock on a few doors and say, `How are you, Bill, Joe, Harry, Klaus'-whoever it happens to be-and think that that is what it is all about. It is not. New Zealand does it constantly and we have to do it constantly and we have to do it better. Above all, we should not reduce funding if we want to do our promotion better. We have to maintain our funding, maintain the opportunity to have a presence there and understand not just the concerns of the producer in Australia but the concerns of the European consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what it is all about. The whole nonsense of the GATT program is not just that it disrupts international trade. The producers are not subsidising anybody; it is the consumers in European and other countries that are doing the subsidising because they are paying a lot more than they should. If the efficient Australian producing industry were able to have free access for its agricultural produce, the prices to consumers around the world would decline, the volume of sales would increase, and I believe we would all be a lot better off. </PARA>
<PARA> So I have no argument with the Minister about the purport of the Cairns Group or our GATT negotiations or the significance of the talks he is about to have in Europe. I do have very real concerns that we have not been sufficiently effective over the last eight years in maintaining pressure. While we are trying to maintain that pressure, it would be a jolly good thing if we went to the Middle East as well, because one of the things that has happened is that the live sheep trade has virtually been lost. </PARA>
<PARA> Sure, we have had problems trying to establish the extent to which veterinary standards and veterinary inspection requirements by the European countries are beyond the capacity of us to set before sheep leave Australia. Scabby mouth has been an enormous problem. I am not sure of the answer, but I think we have to find one because I can tell honourable members that, if we could lift by even $10 a head the price received for sheep from Australia, that as much as anything would get many of the rural producers out of the very difficult financial times they are in. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, this Bill was not necessary. The reason that this legislation has finished up before us again is that the Government has been too busy with the internal debate between the honourable member for Blaxland and the honourable member for Wills to get the job done right. There was inadequate time to debate the legislation and inadequate time to scrutinise it. Furthermore, it refers to two industries, not just wool. I am sure the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) is going to refer to the Australian Horticultural Corporation, and perhaps the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) will too, because the legislation as it pertains to that industry similarly has to be adjusted. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the proposals in the legislation. I think that, as the error was made, the Government has done the right thing. But the Government has not done the right thing in those other areas and my concern is that, at a time when the wool industry is suffering, when the agricultural industry is suffering, it has a ripple effect through the rest of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want Australia to continue to go downhill. I wish that in the Budget yesterday and even in this legislation today we had seen something that was not just going to patch up things and just sort of make do. This does not take us ahead. All we are doing is saying, with a wish and a promise, `We are going to pay a bit of interest on money we should have given you on wool tax that has been collected'-growers' funds I might add. It is not Government money; do not let anybody be fooled. Apart from the $30m-odd that was in the Budget yesterday for wool research and development, it is basically growers' funds we are talking about. Of course, the idea of providing a fifty-fifty subsidy for wool research and development is also something we support. The difficulty with it is that when incomes are down, of course, the amount of levy we raise is down. When the amount of levy is down, it happens to coincide with the time when we need more dough. If we need more money but the rate is set, of course it means that we have to stretch things further. </PARA>
<PARA> On the general funding question, I know that there are some assets that can be disposed of, and we have had some debates in this place about the rapidity with which we can sell them. We also have some reserves and, when the Government talks about reducing from 4 per cent to 3 per cent the amount of money available for promotion, what it says is, `Oh yes, but you have reserves that you can turn to' and they are in fact the funds on which the Wool Corporation and the Wool Realisation Commission have been depending in this interregnum until this legislation is passed. But we have to understand that reserves are reserves and, once they are run down, they are no more. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly want to get this levy down, I want to get wool sold, and I want to improve the position of primary producers. I say to the Minister that I do not really think that this legislation is going to advance the cause a great deal. Sure, it patches up; it gets rid of a mistake that has been made but, if it had been properly done in the first place, this legislation would not be necessary now. A mistake has been made and it is being patched up, but it is not going to do anything about really solving the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the appointment of Mr Jackson as Managing Director of the Wool Corporation. I think Mac Drysdale, the new Chairman, has done a first-class job in selecting him. I believe he will be an outstanding figure. I look forward, as a parliamentarian, to working with him in that role. </PARA>
<PARA> I express on behalf of my constituents a real concern about the future direction of the wool industry but, before I close, I would like to say that there are a few people out there who are getting off their butts and doing something. I have two such people in my electorate: Bob and Annette Gill. They are a couple of locals who have spent something over a quarter of a million dollars developing a new wool fibre testing facility in a town called Walcha, not far from where I live. They have done that because they intend to encourage flock owners to individually test the micron count of each of the sheep within their flock. That will mean that they will be able to say, if they are describing a fleece as an 18 micron fleece, that every sheep in that flock is going to be 18 micron. It means that the buyer will know what he is getting, and it means that the end product is going to be certain. It is the way we have to go. So we do have people who are out there working hard, and thank goodness we do. I think that at this time the industry has never needed them more because, frankly, the Government gives it little help. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I am a little disappointed, and I can only say to the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) that, were we being broadcast to the woolgrowers of this country, his status would have been reduced to that of the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) because he had little to contribute and was not in any way constructive. There is no doubt that we are in here today because of a piece of bureaucratic incompetence. No-one denies that. But it is really of small importance. The legislation is being corrected without cost to woolgrowers, so there is no need to make a great issue of it. There is no need to suggest that it in any way undermines the slow recovery that we hope is taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to address a few of the remarks that were made by the right honourable member for New England while they are fresh in my mind. He blamed the Government for the demise of the wool industry. This is a most absurd notion. I am on record as saying it is my belief that the previous Minister must bear some responsibility. When the Wool Corporation and the Wool Council agreed to put the price of wool to 870c, it was then that the seeds of the demise of the industry were sown. All the foreign indicators at the time were that wool had turned. </PARA>
<PARA> Raising wool to that price meant it had to meet headlong the falling price for wool-and that is exactly what happened. I believe that that was apparent when the then Minister went to Roma, and I believe he should have used the reserve power he had to tell the Wool Corporation and the Wool Council that they were nuts, that they were incompetent, and that he was not going to allow it. The fact that he did not do that means that, in a sense, he acquiesced. To that extent, he certainly has to bear some responsibility. Similarly, when the price was moved to 700c in the circumstances it probably was not enough and we should have moved to free the market then. Of course, with hindsight, that is very easy to say. </PARA>
<PARA> But the right honourable member for New England puts the blame on the Government although woolgrowers have belatedly realised that it was their wool councillors and the Corporation that sold them out. I can tell people out there in the real woolgrowing land that there is no great angst against this Government for its performance. They realise that this Government did what seemed appropriate at the time. People's criticism is much more correctly levelled at those in the Corporation, and the National Party and the Liberal Party were of course their friends and confidantes. </PARA>
<PARA> The right honourable member for New England suggested to us that reducing promotion was a dastardly act. The truth is that we could have wiped promotion out altogether for this year and it would not have made one iota of difference. </PARA>
<PARA> If we had our heads screwed on right and had not been emotionally inclined, we would have done just that. What is selling wool now is not quality; it is price. Wool is cheap and that is why it is selling and, when something is selling because it is cheap, it does not need to be promoted. It would have been better to have saved our money for later on. So let us be done with the nonsense that the Government has in any way threatened promotion by reducing the amount. In any case, there is enough fat in the Wool Corporation's promotion account for it to pick up the amount that was lost. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to have a close look at what these geniuses have achieved in promotion. Let us not forget that the International Wool Secretariat was controlled by the Australian Wool Corporation, which had the votes and the numbers to control its operations. If it did not, it stands condemned; if it did, it stands condemned. But the responsibility must be sheeted home to the Australian Wool Corporation because it had the numbers on the board. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we get from promotion? We saw the great scheme to push wool into blends-the Fletcher Jones scheme-which was going to save the industry by selling a million bales of wool into America. It was a very expensive program costing some $70m. I think that 2,000 bales were sold, which works out at something over $400 a kilogram for promotion costs. And the right honourable member for New England talks about promotion!</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, one could be equally cynical about research and development. The reality is that in recent times there has been very little of value from Australian research and development. An enormous amount of money has been put into that area. Most of the worthwhile developments, certainly at the fabric end, have come out of the mills of Biella in northern Italy at no cost to the Australian grower. It may be that there was some research and development put into growing more wool. In the event of a record wool clip, it does not seem such a good investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The right honourable member for New England also referred to tariffs on wool. To my knowledge there are no tariffs on wool anywhere in the world, nor on scoured wool or tops. There are no tariffs in the user countries. Top making will take place in this country if our customers perceive that it is in their interests. Why are they going to perceive that it is in their interests to do it in Australia? There are several reasons: a considerable saving in freight-they do not have to cart the wool so far in its greasy state; a considerable saving in pollution, which is becoming an increasing problem for Europe and Japan; and, probably most significantly, there are much lower wage rates here than in their own countries. So there is a very good chance that we will see value-adding in this country to the extent of top making. I would be very cautious about going beyond top making because it is at this point that blending occurs. We simply do not have all the wools that are needed by the trade for blending. Our speciality is, of course, Australian wool. </PARA>
<PARA> The right honourable member digressed and referred to New Zealand, which gives me the liberty to digress as well. I hope you concur with that, Mr Deputy Speaker. New Zealand is held up as a marvel for Australia. We have to give it to New Zealand-it has been very innovative and aggressive in its marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> I was in Guangzhou province in northern China in June, I think it was, where acres and acres of Chinese gooseberries are grown. I said to the one of the Chinese, `What do you call this fruit?' He said, `We call them kiwifruit'. I said, `Why would you do that?' He said, `Because the Japanese do'. So they got onto the market as well; it was a marketing coup. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that New Zealand is in many ways a much better place than Australia. It kept its relationship with the UK intact when Britain went into the common market, and it is that relationship with the UK that has protected New Zealand dairy produce in Europe. In Australia the government of the day was busy untying itself from the British apron strings, where it grovelled for a century and a half, and quickly attaching itself to the American apron strings, where it now finds itself dangling. It was one of those sad examples of the cultural trends that existed in Australia, and still does, as we now try to tie ourselves to Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> In digressing a bit more, I will give the multifunction polis a swipe. The multifunction polis was set up, in essence, because there are people in Australia who believe in the cargo cult. They believe that somebody-in this case the Japanese-is going to come into Australia and give us technology. What a lot of nonsense. It will never happen. We are more likely to concentrate our technology in an area where the Japanese can more easily access it, and we will once again see good Australian technology being siphoned off overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many areas in which we are way ahead of the Japanese in technology. The South Australian Government would have been much better if it had said to one of its electronic companies, `Go out and prime bid $470m for the Civil Aviation Authority airport radar contract'. Not one Australian company has been asked to tender. That is an absolute disgrace. If that prime bid had been underwritten, it would have done far more for South Australia and for this nation than by wasting money on multifunction polises. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to talk about the new structure that we have in place. I am not entirely relieved that the right honourable member for New England applauds the appointment of Mr Jackson-ex-ANZ bank, ex-Elder Smiths International Wheat Sales, ex-Nylex, currently BTR. I do not see any great relevance to the wool industry there, and I hope that Mr Jackson has the ability that has been touted for him and he can provide the leadership required. </PARA>
<PARA> It concerns me that under the old Wool Corporation and the old Wool Council we had this crazy notion that wool was somehow a wonder fibre, it was better, it deserved a premium and, by God, we would not sell it without that premium. That was nonsense. It is equally nonsensical to say that wool has no special virtues. It is equally absurd to trade wool just as another commodity, just as a clothing filler. The truth, of course, lies somewhere in between. There is a section of the Australian wool clip that is a unique fibre, and it is that section of the wool clip that we ought to be doing our very utmost to develop and to increase in production, because all the indications are that there is nowhere near enough of that quality wool available in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The right honourable member also commented on the appointment of Mr Drysdale. My own Government tells me that is a wonderful choice. I recall that he was on the previous Wool Council. It is my often expressed view that most of those gentlemen should be in gaol. Let us hope that his performance will improve with his new responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, who I think the rural industry is very lucky to have, has a keen interest in downstream processing. He realises the benefits this provides, not only to woolgrowers, but to the whole country. Concerns were expressed to me today at a meeting I had with members of the Wool Council that downstream processing may require some subsidy from the woolgrower. This is patently absurd. If the wool is bought on the market, how can it possibly require any subsidy from the woolgrower? When they were pushed to explain it, they realised that they were, once again, a victim of their own prejudices. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that there are some unique aspects of Australian wool fibre, we ought to have a very hard look at what we are doing with this genetic material. On a couple of occasions we have looked at this issue and decided to continue to allow the sale of Australian merinos. The arguments are basically economic. We are told that Australian merinos have no real benefit; it is an economic advantage that one can run sheep in Australia without having to house them in the winter; and that we are not going to inconvenience ourselves or act in any way that is detrimental to ourselves by allowing foreigners to have it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reason which is advanced by the Wool Council is that we must improve the quality of the wool going to our customer countries. We must do this as some sort of incentive for them to buy our wool. I cannot understand that logic; it eludes me. Even the National Party of Australia would be very hard put to explain that. The reality is that Russia and China want Australian genetic material to upgrade their wool so that they can buy less from us. It is simply economics for them. They want to save their very hard earned currency and-something which is very important to them-their foreign currency. Let there be no mistake about it; they want to upgrade the quality of their wool so that they need to buy less from us. </PARA>
<PARA> One must also ask: if Australian merinos are of no benefit to overseas buyers, why is it that overseas buyers have been paying the top prices at the recent stud sales? Are we to presume that they are stupid? Does anyone seriously believe these people are stupid? They buy because they perceive it as an advantage. The advantage is the improvement of their flocks in the areas where Australia excels-that is, in the evenness of fibre diameter, the quality that gives character to the wool, and in the lack of black fibres in the wool.</PARA>
<PARA> The only way anyone is going to improve these qualities in the short term is by using Australian genetic material. What is happening overseas? People, particularly in South America, are very keen to get the services of Australian sheep classers. Many Australian sheep classers are going there, culling their flocks and showing them how to do the upgrading. We cannot do much about that, and it will certainly advance them, but why would we make it easier for them by making available to them the genetic basis which is, after all, the reason for our supremacy in this area?</PARA>
<PARA> I am told by people in the trade that the average Argentinean or Uruguayan flock has about 500 black fibres per kilogram; the Australian flock has less than 10. This can be clearly seen. I put it to honourable members that, even if there was no real advantage in banning the export of Australian merinos, we should do it now as a sign of unity, as a sign to the world that the free ride is over: no longer is Australia going to carry promotion for the world; no longer are we going to act as the great rich uncle to all the other producers of the world. It would be a sign that Australia really means business, and it would be a sign to the woolgrowers of this country that we, as a government, mean business. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly hope that the Minister is going to give consideration to supporting a ban on the export of merinos. Of course, the studs will scream. Let them scream, in my view. Their fortune has been made out of the Australian wool industry and their long term fortune resides in the Australian wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the general area of wool, I think it is important that Australian woolgrowers realise that there has to be an improvement in quality. We have to produce a finer wool with a more even fibre count. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the Australian Wool Testing Authority basically uses a 1940s technology for testing fibre diameter. Available to us is the Melden Laboratories' technology, which not only tells us the diameter of individual fibres, but also gives us an idea of where they are located in the staple. It is a much more advanced technology and virtually gives an instant readout. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention this in passing because the monopoly bestowed on the Australian Wool Testing Authority by the Australian Wool Corporation was used to try to break-to send broke-this private testing group. It did break it until the group was rescued by Swiss money. The group is now part of an international Swiss group. I wish Melden's every success because its technology is going to be very vital in advancing the production of better quality wool. I have one final word of warning. One of the briefing notes I have says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Corporation is required to adopt the role of a catalyst in facilitating activities in the market including the increased acceptance by the private sector of responsibility for marketing. The full implementation of sale by description is one such area where this could occur. </PARA>
<PARA>I see no relationship between the last sentence and the previous part of that paragraph. Sale by description is a very dangerous game. If sale by description was wanted by the trade, it would be in now. I ask honourable members to think about this: how can people enhance the sale of their product when they analyse it exhaustively and make available to their customers in a written format every fault that it contains? Clearly, it is nonsense. History has shown-contrary to an answer given to me recently by the Minister-that sale by description does reduce the market price. There is very little doubt that when the marketing genius Sven Anderssen sold the Russians on sale by description the average return to growers dropped by about 20c. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). He seems pretty confused and ill-informed about the wool industry in Australia. I was quite surprised by some of his comments. He said that there are no tariffs on greasy wool in the world. I have got news for him and I will highlight some of those matters in my speech. He said there is no value in research. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), who is at the table, would know that CSIRO has been at the forefront of research funded by the woolgrowers. It developed sirospun, which reduces processing costs. That increases processing capacity several fold; it is wonderful research. CSIRO has developed an instrument which will identify coloured fibres in wool tops-a result of woolgrower funded research. I think that is wonderful value.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kalgoorlie says there is no value in promotion. He should ask Toyota, Sony or one of the other large Japanese corporations whether they see any value in promotion. I just point out to him the value of the cool wool promotion. It is a reason that wool is now being sold in tropical climates on a year round basis, rather than being seen as a winter-only fabric. I suggest to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that in the future before he comes into the chamber talking about the wool industry he ought to get a better understanding of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member said something about sale by description not being on; he said that it lowers the price. During the last 20 years, nine million bales of wool were sold out of the stockpile by description. Not one bale came back into a wool store to be inspected again. The 4.5 million bales that are in the stockpile now are all going to be sold by description. They are located around the world, as well as in Australia. In some cases they are close to the markets; in others, people are getting first stage processing. Those bales are going to be sold on description. Once the first stage of processing is done the wool is all sold on description. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member is leaving the House; he does not want to hear the truth of the matter. Let me go on with my address. First of all, I declare my interest as a woolgrower. Only two weeks ago, I sold my wool and paid my 12 per cent wool tax. I was thankful it was 12 per cent, and not 15 per cent. There was a little bit extra in it for me because of that; but there could have been a lot more, I would advise the Minister. When I talk about it, I think I have a little understanding because for most of my life I have been a woolgrower-not a person in charge of the Storemen and Packers Union or a union movement, though I do not take that away from the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, the price for wool is 530c per kilogram. That is the indicator. It has fallen since the opening of sales late in July. They are figures which are a long way above those used for our calculations or for those of the Government and ABARE. Those calculations were done on about 450c and 470c a kilogram. </PARA>

He knows as well as I do that what we are seeing now is the tip of the iceberg emerging in this recession. I put it to the Minister that, if we had a 10 per cent tax instead of a 12 per cent tax, for every 5,000 sheep the growers would receive an extra $2,500 in their bank accounts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the winter recess I have taken a hands-on approach in representing my constituents. I have been right around the electorate-to Charleville, Goondiwindi, St George and to the dedicated wool areas of Stanthorpe and Texas. I was told that some of the dedicated woolgrowers will soon be walking off. They are hanging in there now, but their first line of defence-and it is a sad one-was that they had brought their children home from school. We are facing the possibility of a whole generation of children being denied a further education-or even a basic education. Some of the kids who are coming home do so to live with their parents because it is cheaper at home than away at a boarding school or a hostel in a town nearby. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day I was at the School of the Air in Charleville. In the last eight months it has had a 30 per cent increase in its enrolment, which has increased from 310 to 430. That backs up my statement that kids are being withdrawn from school. They are going home and they are getting a different form of education-and I must say that the people at the School of the Air in Charleville do a wonderful job-but it cannot be of the same quality as they were getting previously. They do not have access to a computer in the schoolroom. They do not have access to all the other facilities that kids in the cities take for granted. They are living up to 300 and 400 kilometres west of Charleville and the nearest town could have a one-teacher school, like the one that I visited last Saturday. It had nine kids in the school. That is what we are seeing. What I have done through the winter recess is get around with a hands-on approach and listen. </PARA>
<PARA> The people out there congratulated us on this side of the House on our approach to the wool tax debate. They would love to have had that bit of extra money coming into their bank accounts-it is vital-because at the end of this year if they have to walk off those properties, not only will they be penniless but they will lose the family home as well. They will be homeless and penniless. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to notice how the Minister arrived at his figure of 12 per cent at the end of the day. Perhaps he had been talking to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. He said that promotion was not worth while: `we will cut promotion by one per cent to make the figure look a little better'. However, I will not be opposing the Minister on the 2 1/2 per cent for promotion. The Corporation certainly has to look at how it will promote from here on; it is a much tougher job. But I do not believe that at a time when prices are lower we should be cutting our promotional effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) gave a wonderful speech. He said that the New Zealanders have been great marketers and great promoters. This is a time when we should be spending more on promotion, not less. The only accurate forecast that I could make about ABARE, from the figures it presents continually, is that its figures will always prove to be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing I would like the Minister to address is the multifibre agreement, which comes under the rules of GATT, because I believe it is critical to the debate on free trade and fair trade. The multifibre arrangement, which commenced in 1974, attempts to regulate international trade in textiles and apparel and it comes under the GATT Round of negotiations. It divides all fabrics, fibres and garments into categories. Within each category, agreements are negotiated between the supplier and the importer. </PARA>
<PARA> That agreement, which Australia still runs under, flies in the face of so-called free trade. While raw wool producers are desperately striving to compete on world markets, we have a system within the textile industry, covered by the multifibre agreement, which flies in the face of that free trade. It was supposed to expire on 31 July this year, which passed 20-odd days ago. However, it had an extension of time because of the Uruguay Round and to see how the Cairns Group gets on. From what the Europeans are saying about that multifibre agreement, it could take 15 years to phase out. The original intent of the multifibre agreement was to give developing countries access to major markets whilst also regulating their own. As the Minister has said so often in this debate on free trade, especially wheat recently, it means access to free and fair markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kalgoorlie said that he did not think there were any tariffs on wool around the world. I have a table on import tariffs. On taking greasy wool into India there is a 20 per cent tariff plus a 5 per cent levy. To get greasy wool into China, it will cost 15 per  cent--</PARA>

<PARA> We should also be looking at the multifibre agreement, because that will give Australia an opportunity to add value to wool. One of the things that the Minister has so often spoken about is adding value to our products. Australia could add value to its wool and cotton if we were able to get access to markets with the made-up product, to these other markets, and not to have to come under the multifibre agreement. So it is an important matter and I hope that the Minister will take it up. </PARA>
<PARA> It is almost time for the suspension of the sitting for dinner, so I conclude by saying that it is with great reluctance that I support this Bill providing for a 12 per cent regulation. I would rather have seen this as a Bill which gave a maximum tax of 12 per cent instead of one that gave a regulated tax down to 12 per cent, because I am not sure that we can say to the woolgrowers that the Minister can be trusted not to introduce a 15 per cent tax next year. On behalf of my constituents I express concern about the way that the Minister arrived at that 12 per cent figure. We were right and I believe that the evidence even today suggests that we were right. I am sure that time will prove that our figures were correct. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. Due to a number of comments that have been made by honourable members about the tax rate and its implications, I want to go over the ground that I know we have already covered in this Parliament, but not so as much in this Budget session. The 15 per cent tax was based on certain parameters that had changed by the time the wool legislation package came before Parliament in June. The Industry Committee revised that estimate of shorn wool production in the 1991-92 season downwards from 914 kilotonnes to 881 kilotonnes greasy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In light of the performance in the market, ABARE increased its 1991-92 season price forecast from 435 cents per kilogram clean to 475c per kilogram clean. Recalculations based on these changes produced a tax rate of 13 to 13 1/2 per cent as the level which maximised returns to both the taxpayer and the woolgrower. When the Commonwealth grant of $22 1/2m in each of 1991-92 and 1992-93 for interest supplementation on the $200m commercial loan pending asset sales was taken into account, this brought the wool tax back to around 12 to 12 1/2 per cent. Interest and storage charges alone in the stockpile are estimated by the Wool Realisation Commission at $340m in 1991-92. The Commission's 9 per cent share of wool tax is estimated to bring in $248m, so a further $92m is needed just to service the debt, on top of which the debt must be reduced by $20m. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless very large quantities of wool are sold from the stockpile and we have a consequent reduction in returns to woolgrowers even further, the total tax below 12 per cent would be extremely risky. In fact, honourable members who have spoken before me have said that originally the Government was taking from the farmer by its proposal for 15 per cent tax. Of course, it was not doing anything like it. What was really happening was that we were looking for the best adjustment in the interest of the industry. This is what some of the speakers have failed to recognise, that whichever way one goes, in the end the industry itself is affected, as well as the income of farmers and their ability to sell. No matter happens, they are being affected. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now finding that the market is settling down and by 15 August in just a few weeks it had fallen 57c to be 540c per kilogram. It is too early to judge what will happen in the future, but I understand there was a further drop yesterday of 9c. If things turn out better than the estimates suggest, then the mechanisms are built into the legislation that would enable wool tax rates to come down next year. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been controversy about the apportionment of the wool tax. I am glad all honourable members are supporting the legislation, but their support is not always reflected in what they have had to say nor in what some industry people-but by no means official industry-have had to say. Apportionment of the 12 per cent wool tax for 1991-92 is 9 per cent for debt management, 2 1/2 per cent for promotion and  1/2 per cent for R&amp;. Industry was expecting 8 per cent for debt reduction and 3 1/2 per cent for promotion. </PARA>
<PARA> I had discussions, along with other honourable members, with the Wool Council of Australia representative here today, Mr Alan Bowman, who is in the Parliament today and will be tomorrow. He did acknowledge that, taking into account that the Government was giving a commitment for this year, 2 1/2 per cent was adequate. So we have it from the people who should really know-the Wool Council of Australia-that, taking into account that we are looking at a year, 2 1/2 per cent is adequate. What happens after that year is important to the Wool Council; it is important to the industry; and it is important to the Government. It is extremely important that the industry, the Government and all others involved make sure that we have the right data so that a decision can be made based on proper discussion and data at the end of that year. Meanwhile, the Wool Council is saying that it is satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has been critical of the way the Government has moved on this legislation, but the Opposition's record is not all that good. It has never been game to take decisions. It moves into systems too late and reluctantly. Very often, it does not move when it should and it does not move out of them when it should. The economy is fairly fluid; we need to be fluid in our approach. Our approach on the world market involves very careful consideration of the way we go financially and the way we manage our industries. The Opposition would not move into wheat stabilisation when it was needed; it will not adjust that when it is appropriate. It did not move into the wool reserve price plan when it was being called for and when it was quite useful, but it would not support getting rid of it when the whole concept of the reserve price plan changed. It had a poor record on tariffs and, for all the noise about free trade today, it is, on its record, a high tariff coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> Protection gave Australia bad habits; the Opposition was part of that. Prices were boosted to meet cost demands and, of course, this meant that Australia was not in the real world. The Opposition has been somewhat critical of the Government's move in GATT, but it is vital to keep moving when making progress, however slight that progress is. We all have to acknowledge, while acknowledging the point made by many in the industry, in Opposition and in Government, that we also need to look at bilateral relationships; we need to look at Asia and other relationships. The legislation result is an actual correction-I suppose you could call it-of previous legislation. It is important that we do it. I welcome the fact that it looks as though all honourable members are going to support the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr COBB (Parkes) (8.08 p.m.) As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) said, this Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 is, to use the words of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) in the second reading speech, `to correct omissions and drafting errors' in the original legislation. The Minister in his speech says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it is not possible to appropriate and transfer to the wool statutory authorities wool tax imposed on wool sold prior to 1 July 1991 but received by the Commonwealth after that date. Clearly, the situation needs to be rectified and the provisions of this Bill do that. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government forgot to provide for the transition period of levies collected before 30 June. I understand there could be something up to the $90m for funds frozen that cannot be paid to the Wool Realisation Commission or the Wool Corporation and the Research and Development Corporation. But I have been informed that the Government has been able to transfer about $30m of this through regulation, but needs legislation to transfer the other $60m. </PARA>
<PARA> The same problem apparently has arisen with levies collected after the date of repeal of the old Australian Dried Fruits Corporation, which was replaced by the Australian Dried Fruits Board under the wing of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. Levies collected by the Commonwealth for the ADFC after the date of repeal will be recovered and this money will be paid to the ADFB. In addition to these two corrections, the Commonwealth will also pay compensation for losses incurred due to these late payments. I understand this will be an amount equal to interest received by the Government while the money has been waiting to be transferred. The coalition would certainly support that action being taken. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to make some comments on the wool tax levels the Government has imposed on the financially strapped woolgrowers of Australia. Initially the Government tried to impose on woolgrowers a 15 per cent tax level after 1 July this year, which coalition members felt was totally unnecessary. We all know that Government members joined with the Democrats after considerable debate and everybody settled at 12 per cent, even though 10 per cent was the figure aimed at by the coalition. We still feel that 10 per cent was the level needed to collect the amount of money necessary to service the situation in the wool industry. Having had the benefit of observing the open market situation that has been operating since 1 July, we believe our calculations are even more justified and that a 10 per cent tax level is not only achievable but has been pitched at a very conservative level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Realisation Commission has a very difficult job. I understand it sold 104,000 bales of wool in July this year, quite a large proportion of that being from overseas stores, and has received an amount of about $71m for that. The Wool Realisation Commission debt reduction target set by the Government for 1991-92 is of the small order of $20m. This Commission has a total loan servicing and storage cost of $350m, and to pay for that their share of the tax levy, which is 9 per cent of the 12 per cent tax levy, will return in round figures about $250m. That leaves a shortfall of about $100m, plus the $20m in debt reduction for this year. Having already sold $71m worth of wool from the stockpile, the Commission has to sell only another $50m or $60m worth of wool before 30 June next year to accomplish its target, which it should do comfortably. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Wool Realisation Commission stockpile selling policy up to this date has been absolutely correct and that David Clarke has done a very good job. I have not met the man, but from what I read he seems to have a very good feel about him. I think he is doing an excellent job. </PARA>
<PARA> The outlook as far as wool prices and clearances go at the moment is quite good, and certainly better than expected at the beginning of the year. It is true that the market indicator since 1 July this year has eased back into the 530c to 540c per kilogram range, but in some ways this is not truly indicative. Since 1 July fine wools have come down quite a bit from relatively high levels, whereas coarser wools have not come down by anywhere near as much. I believe one or two of these levels have even gone up since 1 July, so the market indicator is not quite the indicator that some people think it is so far as this price reduction is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The market indicator at the moment is down just over 25 per cent on what it was when 700c per kilogram was in place. However, if we had continued with that scheme after 1 July this year, the tax provisions that were then in place would have allowed for a tax of up to 50 per cent to be imposed on growers, with quotas on top of that. I do not think that in that sense there is much doubt that under the present scheme the growers are better off. On top of that we are getting a market clearance in excess of 90 to 95 per cent instead of the 40 per cent-odd we were getting before. It is wonderful to see market share for wool being regained; it has a very low share-4 to 5 per cent-of the world textile fibre market. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to look at the figures for the first three weeks of this season. The trade bought 284,000 bales in the first three weeks. That is 51 per cent more wool bought by the trade than in the first five weeks of last season. It is sobering, though, to look at the figures because we are offering only 100,000 to 120,000 bales a week at present. The real test will come from about mid-October through to the end of November this year, when we will be offering from 140,000 to over 160,000 bales a week. If the market can get through what could be a fragile period without too much of a reduction, I think we will be well on the way to getting wool back again as the premier and most profitable primary industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make some brief comments on the situation in the Soviet Union and how it will affect wool sales. There has been considerable concern since the coup in the last couple of days about the effect it will have on sales. I believe that this situation should be kept in perspective. The Government extended a $500m line of credit insurance for agricultural products-not just wool but wheat, meat and so on. That was established late last year. Of that credit facility, $421m has already been used, so there is only $79m left to be used. I understand that no repayments are due until December. It might be something to exercise the Government's mind as to what it will do if the turmoil in the Soviet Union is continuing at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Of that $500m facility, $100m available to the wheat industry has already been used. Incidentally, I was very disappointed to see that in the Budget only $35.1m was set aside for the Iraq compensation. Some would argue that that is only about a quarter of what they should receive. But I digress from the purpose of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the remaining $400m of the credit facility, I understand that $260m has been committed to wool and $60m to mutton. Something less than half of this, $148m in total of this $320m, has already been shipped. There is a considerable portion, $178m-worth, of these commodities that is yet to be shipped, although I am told that this is not affected where there is a contractual obligation to supply. However, if there are difficulties or concerns about shipping it to the USSR, I hope the Government will come to the party. It does concern some people. It is worth noting that the recent revival of wool demand from the USSR had already tapered off before the recent military coup in the Soviet Union. Indeed, the USSR was already a weak buyer on the market and was expected to remain so for some months. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous speaker, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, mentioned that the market indicator yesterday had fallen from 540c to 531c, a 9c drop, and most people were putting that down to the Soviet situation. I do not think it was concern about credit facilities; it was concern about the uncertainties created in world trading patterns, and to that extent that is unavoidable. I do not think we should get overly alarmed about the sanction, if I can call it that, of withdrawing what remains of the credit facility. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to pass briefly now to the promotion levy having been dropped from 3 1/2 to 2 1/2 per cent. The Minister has already come in for some comment on this from previous speakers. When the Minister's original intention to have a 15 per cent tax came in at only 12 per cent, he reduced the 3 1/2 per cent promotion levy to 2 1/2 per cent. I think there was a lot of angst in the bush. There was a feeling out there that this had been done in an underhand way. It certainly was not mentioned in debate. There was not even a whisper of it, to my recall. There was no consultation with woolgrowers; there was no consultation that I am aware of with industry leaders; there was certainly no consultation with the Parliament, and many people felt that this was outrageous. It appeared, rightly or wrongly, as though the Minister had done it in a fit of pique rather than for good reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Minister could have mounted an argument-perhaps even a rational argument-in favour of doing so. For example, I am told that there are reserves of $114m and that another $37m of reserves have been found there. If these figures are correct, there are $151m of reserves there. A 2 1/2 per cent levy pulls in about $65m, so in that sense there are about two years of reserves already there. If the Minister had perhaps argued this way, the overwhelming majority may not have agreed with him, but at least they would have been paid the courtesy of some sort of reasoned explanation given to them. However, that was denied to them. I do not think it was too much to ask that people could have been informed of that before it happened--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says they were, but no-one else seems to have heard of it. This is the problem. If the Minister wants to win the confidence of farmers-which I believe he would want to do-he should fully consult with them in the future because this has left a bit of a sour taste in many ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are other little niggly things coming in. I know that the annual general meeting is now a requirement of the Wool Council, and apparently that is going to cost $300,000. It sounds an outrageously high figure to me, but if this is the case, no doubt it will be passed back to the growers. I also believe that a $150,000 bill has already been presented to the Australian Wool Corporation for the selection committee costs. That is something that people did not foresee when that came in. It is a bit like taking out a loan at a bank and finding all these little bank charges coming in later on that one has never heard of; it leaves a sour taste. If these things could be spelt out fully at the beginning, people would accept them better. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I hope the Minister will take on board some of these concerns. I hope he will make genuine efforts to come to terms with the very real problems of the wool industry. I know that in recent weeks the Minister has spoken a lot about value adding, et cetera, and I know of his genuine concern in that area. To me, if he does not mind my saying so, it is a little bit reminiscent of the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) running around, as he did, a couple of years ago talking about sunrise industries. These things never seem to come to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA> We would all like to see value adding. If the Minister can pull it off, I will be the first to welcome it; but before we get value adding in this country to the extent that we would like to see it, over and above what we have already, we will certainly need a major revamp of the industrial relations system in this country. We will need incentive and reward for effort, voluntary unionism, enterprise bargaining, and things like this. In some ways, the Minister seems to me to have spent most of his life fighting against these things. If he can somehow turn this around and work for the industry in this direction, I guess we will all applaud him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I can assure the last speaker, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), that it has been my intention and endeavour-in fact, all of my activities-over the 11 weeks that I have been in this portfolio to get to understand the issues of concern to those in farm Australia in particular, as well as the mining sector, and to take into account their concerns and to genuinely consult. I do not think I need to remind the House to any terribly significant extent on this point, but consultation has been my way of life; I have been doing it for 20 years. I do not restrict it to one constituency, and I have not in relation to the new one I have now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make a couple of points because I think two things ought to be said at the outset. Firstly, I agree with all the comments that this legislation before us is unnecessary. I was particularly peeved, to say the least, to find that we had this technical defect. I do not appreciate it. I accept the criticism that is levelled in this place that the issue should have been picked up earlier. I do not accept that it was as a consequence of the so-called rushed nature of the wool legislation, because the same technical problem has arisen in relation to the horticultural industry, on which there was little controversy and for which there was plenty of time. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is a significant oversight; it should not happen. We should be aware that if we are establishing new bodies, transitional arrangements are needed and the drafting should take proper account of that. I agree with all honourable members who have criticised the unnecessary circumstances in which this Bill is before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that in all the debate that has taken place on this piece of legislation, not one speaker opposed it, because all speakers recognise that the legislation itself is designed to get moving as quickly as possible that money which is the entitlement of the three industry structures so that they can have it. In addition, we have undertaken to ensure that there is no financial disadvantage to those bodies. As a consequence of this legislative oversight they will be compensated, and they will be compensated on the basis-as I indicated in my second reading speech-of the earnings that the Government obviously obtained from holding the money rather than its being held by the appropriate structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said all that, despite the fact there is no disagreement about the legislation that is before us, I must say that it has still generated a fair bit of debate. I think we have been in the House for a couple of hours on these issues--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a bad thing. It is a good thing at times to clear the air on some of these issues. This debate provides a more convenient opportunity to do it, I guess, than Question Time or perhaps an MPI or whatever. But there have been a couple of concerns and issues raised by those opposite in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first point I think is the assertion that 10 per cent rather than the 12 per cent which we have, and compared with the Government's original proposal of 15 per cent, is the appropriate level of tax. I reject the view that 10 per cent was an appropriate figure. I join with the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) in drawing attention to the NFF press release. </PARA>
<PARA> He made the point that the NFF press release welcomed the 12 per cent as a sensible outcome, believed it was workable and that we should stick with it. Therefore, I think this continuing assertion that 12 per cent is workable needs to be seen against the NFF's rational assessment of the outcome. But, more than that, I think it is important to understand that I had carriage of this legislation in something of a wall of fire. I was sworn in on the Tuesday and had to deal with the legislation for the next 48 hours almost non-stop. I think that it is true to say that because circumstances changed from the original drafting of the Bill, I became convinced fairly quickly in the piece that there was room to move below the 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not for one moment accept that 10 per cent was the appropriate figure. I put not just my Department to the test but also ABARE, with which I spent a lot of time in going through these figures. A number of circumstances had changed. There was, firstly, the fact that production levels were down, and therefore that had a bearing in terms of the current clip and future operations, as well as the fact that prices were holding reasonably well at that stage, even though the forecasts that ABARE was still giving me suggested an average price of 475c a kilogram on the old scale. I will come to that point in a minute because some comparison has been made that blurs the difference between the new indicator and the old indicator. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I accepted that there was some room to manoeuvre. I can admit now, because I have admitted it at various meetings of growers that I have attended around the country, and it is no secret, that on the basis of the information I had before me, when I had to be confronted with this-the legislation having been introduced into the House by my predecessor; even though the portfolio had changed, he introduced the legislation-I was prepared in that next 48 hours that I was involved to accept that there was justification for reducing and negotiating the tax down. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of that, I had a series of meetings with the National Party and with the Opposition. I spoke to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), I spoke to the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Lloyd), and I spoke of course to the Democrats because that is where the issue was in the Senate. My bottom line was that I was prepared to accept a tax at 13 1/2 per cent and, if pushed, 13 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> There were a number of assertions-and honourable members will recall the debate at the time-as to what we would realise from the asset sales, what the price would be, what the production levels would be and whether we had to pay retrenchment payments for those in the AWC. There are a number of parameters. It is important that I make the point for those who have asserted that ABARE kept them in the dark, and that there was no information exchanged, that in this debate one has to understand that there is the giving of information where it is appropriate in the negotiations, but also the recognition of commercial-in-confidence. After all, there is not much point in making our projections, putting them out in public and signalling to the market-the place where we are trying to sell the damn stuff-what our expectations are. Anyone who thinks those are smart negotiating tactics is a fool. Therefore, one has to understand that the commercial-in-confidence criteria was very appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I took the Deputy Leader of the National Party through the figures, I took the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer of the Wool Council through the figures, I took the Leader of the Opposition through the figures and I took the Democrats through the figures-the ABARE figures. Those figures demonstrated on their analysis the sort of figure that was justified, given what had to be raised simply to service the debt, and given what had to be met in terms of the Cabinet schedule for the reduction of the debt-without which there would not have been the $300m appropriation to help the ailing wool industry, the underwriting of the debt or the credit line to the Soviet Union. None of that would have been there had we not had the debt rescheduling figures in place. </PARA>
<PARA> People have to understand the fundamental point: it was not just an issue of the tax being a cost to growers; it was a question of the tax-growers' money-being generated sufficiently to enable, on the one hand, the reduction of the debt and, on the other, the continuing promotion and activities of the new Wool Corporation Board and of research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject the argument of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). I think that his assertion is so shallow. He comes into this place and says, `Anything ABARE says, you've got to reject'. What sort of considered view is that? I simply make the point that forecasts are forecasts. Whether one comes from an economic background, a trade union background, a farm background or a business background, they are forecasts-nothing more than that. But they are based on the best available information. </PARA>
<PARA> ABARE got its information from the industry. It did not dream it up. It spoke to the industry. It got much better advice than it would have got from the honourable member for Maranoa, who comes in here and asserts, in all his glory, that anything that ABARE says has to be rejected. I refute that. People out there in the bush, in his electorate in particular, ought to understand the shallowness of the substance with which he comes into this place to argue the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The significant point that I make is that, while I said that I was prepared to negotiate down to 13 per cent, I still believe that 13 1/2 per cent would have been the most appropriate figure because there would have been more opportunities if things went bad. None of us predicted what was going to happen in the Soviet Union in the last three days. It does have implications. I accept what the honourable member for Parkes says about having to see things in context, but the reality is that if we have sold wool on credit and that credit is not paid, that is a debt either to the industry or to the taxpayer generally in terms of the contingent liability that we have underwritten. Opposition members should not forget that and should not forget also that none of the wise people on their side of the Parliament were predicting that that crisis could have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was saying that there is too much uncertainty. The figures that the coalition was putting up were based on a number of parameters and assumptions and, if only one went wrong, the whole thing could really be jeopardised. Therefore, it was more sensible to err on the side of caution. That is why I would have preferred to have got the 13 1/2 per cent. Having said that, I make the point that I was prepared to negotiate down to 13 per cent. That is a matter of record that can now be divulged simply because the negotiations and the issue are resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> We got 12 per cent, but the important thing is that as a result of the negotiations that were undertaken, and as a result of the situation that I found myself in, I was able to get a commitment from the Government to pay up-front that $22.5m, which the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) would recall was an issue in the debate in the House. It was not guaranteed. There was a belief that it had been offered and it had been withdrawn, but the fact is that we got it in the end. The fact that it was there as a concrete figure was the equivalent of one per cent. Therefore, the 12 per cent is 13 per cent but not at a cost to the grower. </PARA>

I said in the House when we debated this that I could not guarantee that the tax would continue to come down. I could have, at a higher figure, and I was prepared to guarantee it at 13 per cent. When this legislation finally got through the Parliament on 21 June I said that I could not guarantee it at 12 per cent. I hope that things improve.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not $71m, it is $67m. I will come to those figures in a minute. The Commission has handled the situation well. On the basis that we do not have crises such as the Soviet Union has, and that we do not have a collapse in the price, it ought to be possible to get to a situation in the future where we do not have to put up the tax. It is too early to make that judgment. For the time being, it is not an issue that is before us. That is the point that I make about the 12 per cent, the 15 per cent and the 10 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The promotion and the proportionality of the 12 per cent has been raised by a number of people in the Parliament. I did not make the decision to reduce the so-called promotion from 3 1/2 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent in a fit of pique. I do not do anything in fits of pique. I consider myself to be a rational type of person. I like to consider the issues and make value judgments. I have seen others in this place do things in a fit of pique. I hope not to emulate them and I simply did not do it in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the figure of 15 per cent, if we were saying that the proportional break-up was 11 per cent for the Realisation Commission, 3 1/2 per cent for promotion and half a per cent for R&amp;, the Opposition would take 3 per cent away from us, yet not expect anything to come off promotion. I think members of the Opposition must be living in cloud cuckoo land if they do not understand the ramifications of reducing the absolute figure without expecting that it will affect the proportionality. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not correct to say that this was not signalled, because I indicated it to Alan Bowman of the Wool Council in discussions. I said, `If you don't give me this legislation, don't accept that by regulation I'm going to reduce the tax to 15 per cent'. If this tax was not introduced we would have had 25 per cent. That is the stupidity of the coalition's position in holding up this legislation and leaving me to determine what the tax level should be by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the old structure there had to be agreement with the Wool Council as to what the proportionality would be. Under the new structure there does not. I made it clear to the Wool Council that it was not going to get 15 per cent out of me by regulation as the fall back position unless I had a clear understanding as to what the proportional break-up was. I said, `If you force me down from 15 per cent, don't expect that the other proportions are not going to be affected'. </PARA>
<PARA> To members opposite who come into this place and say that I have made this unilateral decision without thinking it through, I simply say this: give me 12 per cent instead of 15 per cent and the other components will suffer. I must say that I took the conscious decision not to reduce the R&amp; commitment because I think that is important. I also took the view that 2.5 per cent was livable with this year because of the significant reserves that the honourable member for Parkes acknowledges the Corporation has. </PARA>
<PARA> One might ask-and I guess that if the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) were in this place he would do the asking-why the Corporation has reserves and why has it not been spending them on promotion. However, the fact is that it has the reserves. I spoke to Mac Drysdale and told him of my decision before it was formally announced, and he accepts-honourable members should read his press releases and his speech to the Dubbo conference-that it will not affect promotion this year. He accepts, as I do, that if we do not do something else on promotion in the future, the question of promotion may suffer. I am fully conscious of that. It is my intention to ensure that promotion does not suffer because I think it is a critical component of the new structure in the industry's functions. I will be doing what I can to ensure it is funded, but the industry will have to understand that I will not do it at the expense of continuing to run up the debt through the realisation operations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to understand that the promotion component being reduced from 3.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent does not mean promotion will suffer. I draw that to the attention in particular of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who has joined us, because he argued earlier that the Government was cutting back on promotion. The Government is not, but I understand the circumstances of the 2.5 per cent. Provided we get through this year properly and the Realisation Commission is meeting the schedule, we will have another look at the promotion. I give that undertaking now, as I have given it to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point raised by the Deputy Leader of the National Party in particular relates to the role of ABARE in this whole exercise. The honourable member for Maranoa-I have alluded to this already-was also critical of ABARE's role. I reject that completely; I think there ought to be a bit more preparedness among honourable members on the other side of the House to be honest. They should sit down with ABARE and go through the figures. ABARE is not just a reputable organisation; it is a great forecasting organisation and has great economic expertise which members opposite ought to use. I do not mind members of the Opposition using ABARE, but they must understand what I said before: there is a commercial-in-confidence aspect to this and the last thing the Government would want to do is take members of the Opposition through confidential details and have them, in their mad grab to get a press statement, release something stupid in the press that sends the price down. (Extension of time granted) I thank the House and I will try not to take up too much more time, but I would like to deal with a couple of the issues that were raised. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject the criticism made of ABARE. As I said, I took members of the Opposition through the projections and forecasts that ABARE put up, and I ask them to reflect on this point again: there is no sense in them going around the country telling their constituency that the tax is a cost to farmers without recognising the intrinsic importance of ensuring within the tax a mechanism for getting the debt down. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been talk of where the market indicators and things are, and we have talked about price. But it has been suggested that the price is now much stronger than was previously forecast by ABARE. The fact is that when the new market indicator opened with the new selling season, it started at 597c, which is 570c on the old indicator. That was four weeks ago. It is now 529c on the new indicator or 505c on the old indicator. That is a loss of 68c or 12.5 per cent in four weeks, and today sales have been generally softer. </PARA>
<PARA> Many reasons have been mentioned in this debate for that, but sales are softer and that cannot be ignored. The old indicator of 475c, which is what ABARE based its predictions on, is 497c, so in essence we are talking about ABARE's forecast as a year average figure. We now have the actual indicator of what members opposite consider to be the good end of the market, because they told the Government when we last debated this in the Parliament that we were 600c and over 600c. It is actually 32c or 6 per cent above where ABARE was. I think the member for Maranoa, if he were in this place, ought to be a little apologetic for his criticism about ABARE because it was actually not too far off the mark. ABARE's point always in this issue was that there is not much point putting more wool on the market, which the Realisation Commission would be forced to do if it were not given enough out of the tax to reduce the debt. Put more wool on the market, and the price is reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> In the end what matters to growers is not just the question of tax as a cost but the ultimate return to them, which is reflected by the price. The more wool we put on the market-there is no economic trickery in this; it is supply and demand, a free and open market-the more the price will come down. ABARE was trying to create the forecasting model that demonstrated that, if too much were taken away from the Realisation Commission and it was forced to sell more wool, the price would be decreased and growers would be further away. I guess we can debate this for days. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will come to that in a moment. However the AWRC has sold $67m worth of wool-that is my information-which puts it ahead of schedule for the moment in terms of its sales. These figures are important because at the current estimates of the tax from wool-this is assuming we have still the price currently around in the market-what they will get is the $250m, which I think is what the honourable member for Parkes said. We have that plus the $22.5m which the Government advanced, plus the $67m and the $19m which I understand has come from property income. That is a total of $358.5m against costs at the best current estimate of $340m. That does not yet allow for the $20m. I corrected the honourable member for Maranoa for this by way of interjection and he conceded it. I accept it is heading in that direction, but the reality is that it is not there yet. I think it is important to underscore that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The right honourable member for New England made a number of comments in his contribution. He asked why the Government had to bring this legislation through so quickly. He acknowledged that the existing structures terminated by the end of June and he asked why the Government had to do it on the day it did because Parliament did not have to get up on 24 June. The fact is that this damned House rose on 21 June, and it rose late on that Friday because we were still debating this legislation and trying to get it through.

Of those who have spoken in this debate-the right honourable member for New England; the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher), who is not here at the moment; the honourable member for Parkes, who is; and the honourable member for Maranoa, who is not here-not one was present for the vote, and yet they come into this place and tell us of their concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Five out of 14 is not a terribly good figure, but when one takes into account that one of those was the teller for the National Party and another was the person who had the carriage of this Bill on behalf of the National Party-the Deputy Leader-there are three. That is the concern of those opposite. I think it is a disgrace. The right honourable member for New England cannot tell me about the rushed legislation, how important it was and how much more time could have been spent on it-he was not here even to go through the detail. He should not come in here with his cant and hypocrisy and give us his concern for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that the honourable member for Maranoa made was to have a go at members on this side of the House for going to Europe and arguing the Uruguay Round. He told us that he and others, including Sir John McEwen-much better people than us, he told us-went, and they did not succeed. I will tell the honourable member why they did not succeed. It was because they had a hopeless case. They went over there saying that they wanted increased access, but they tried to defend a domestic market that was so protected that the rest of the world took us as a joke. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the hypocrisy that comes from members of the National Party and, in particular, one of its former leaders. They try to pretend that they have done the right thing in this place in representing Australia's interests, but they went with a hopeless case. Then they get up and say, `Don't come along, new Minister, and tell us about value adding; we've said that for ages'. They might have said it, but they have done nothing. The reason they have been able to do nothing is because they have never encouraged an efficient manufacturing base in this country and that is a necessity for value adding. They have efficiency, as have we, because we have deregulated the industry in agriculture. We have the efficiency--</PARA>

The reality is that, under the new arrangements that the trade unions have entered into, any greenfield operation which has new value adding potential can get any flexibility it wants-anything that it wants-but National Party members are not prepared to try it. They want to reject it as being part of some inflexible operation to which no flexibility applies. It is rubbish. They do not understand the issues and they are not even prepared to try to find out about them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sorry that the honourable member for Maranoa is not here as he asked me to chase up the question of the multifibre agreement. I tend to agree with him that we need to make sure that that agreement is broken down. That is the point that I have been trying to make-the GATT Round cannot just be about better access in agriculture. Agriculture is a key, but if we are going to pursue value adding in this economy, if we are going to get more of a manufacturing base, then we need access to manufactured opportunities, not just commodities. </PARA>
<PARA> So I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa. We are not signatories and not party to the negotiations in that agreement, but obviously the success we have in the Uruguay Round will have implications. Therefore, I believe that the efforts that this Government has been making-which, I must say, have bipartisan support from the Parliament-are crucial. They are crucial not just to agriculture, but also to the future of the agricultural base which provides the wealth generation for this economy, not by continuing to trade in commodities but by actually doing a bit more with it. Those opposite never had the strategy for that. They have never understood the importance of linking agriculture with manufacturing. We have. We will do it and we will succeed. It will be better for farmers, it will be better for the nation and it will encourage regional development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to contribute to this important debate on an important statement from the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) on our defence policy into the twenty-first century. The Defence Force structure review, which was announced earlier this year and which is embodied within the statement issued by the Minister, provides a very necessary and timely focus on Australia's defence needs in the next decade and beyond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should be seen in the context of a dramatically changing international arena with all the implications that holds for foreign affairs and for defence. It should also be seen in the context of domestic pressures to ensure value for money and increased productivity from all sectors of our economy. Economic constraints are as real in defence matters as they are everywhere else. As the Minister's statement noted, the central challenge before us is to organise our defence better so that we can obtain the maximum combat capability in the most efficient and affordable way. </PARA>
<PARA> The force structure review contains a number of welcome initiatives which will enhance our defence capabilities. The expansion of commercial and civilian workers undertaking support and maintenance work has the potential to be cost effective and will release defence personnel and resources for more important combat related duties. It is important in the implementation of that program that each case be assessed on its merits. There are clearly areas of activity within the defence forces-particularly in support and maintenance work-which could quite easily be handed over to non-defence personnel on a private, civilian contracted or employee basis. There are, though, a number of areas of maintenance and questions of supply which defence will need to look at closely in making these decisions to ensure that at no time is Australia's combat capacity diminished on those occasions when it is most needed. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the statement includes increased emphasis on basing forces in northern Australia. This decision recognises the realities of Australia's strategic interests. I think it also recognises and picks up on many of the lessons that have been learned through exercises such as K89. Decisions such as the relocation of the second cavalry regiment to Darwin, I am sure, have occurred at least in part from the lessons that have been learned from K89 and, given the huge geography of our nation, to deploy a larger portion of our defence forces in the north makes good sense. </PARA>
<PARA> Continued development and expansion of the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar system is an initiative which I support. As a member of the defence subcommittee of the joint Houses of the Parliament, I have had the opportunity of visiting that installation and seeing the operations first hand. There is no doubt that Australia's efforts in this field are at the cutting edge of world technology. We are, probably with only one or two other nations in the world, able to produce over-the-horizon radar systems that are combat effective. The work that has been done by those involved deserves praise and clearly has a number of beneficial outcomes for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision of the Government to construct six Collins class submarines to be based primarily in Western Australia with two deployed on the east coast will provide Australia with a capability at sea which is unmatched in our region. It will also assist the development of our two-oceans policy which, again, recognises not only the size of our country but also the fact that we are an island continent and need to recognise the importance of maintaining a naval presence in both the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Those six Collins class submarines will enhance our naval capacity quite significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these changes improve our defence ability in what I believe is a cost effective manner. The most significant changes, though, with immediate or short term effect relate to the Regular Army-particularly the changes which will impact upon 6th Brigade, which is based at Enoggera army barracks within my electorate of Brisbane. The 6th Brigade is currently an integrated regular reserve unit. Its combat units consist of the 6th and the 8/9 battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment and the 49th Battalion Royal Queensland Regiment, which is a reserve battalion. This brigade is to become the new ready reserve brigade of the Army. A good deal of the public debate and comment on the Defence Force structure review relates to ready reserves, and I wish to take some time to talk about that, not only because it affects my electorate directly, but also because it is of some significance to the defence of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the next four years all battalions within the 6th Brigade will be rearranged to become ready reserve units. The ready reserve concept is a worthwhile one which, if successful, will give us a comparatively well trained, full strength regiment consisting of 3,200 ready reserves and 800 regulars. It is pleasing to see that the restructured 6th Brigade will be at full strength. It is a fact that the brigade is not now at full strength and has not been for some time. That is a pity. It is a reality, though, in the context of the tight economic situation we face. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some concerns about the introduction of the ready reserve and I shall mention some of those in this debate. At the outset, I have some concern that next year we will find ourselves with 1,000 recruits keen to join the ready reserve and enlist for one year's full time training. All the surveys that have been done indicate that that is not going to be a problem, and very soon we will find out whether that is the case. I sincerely hope that there are more than enough recruits to implement the first-year operations of the ready reserve. </PARA>
<PARA> I also harbour some concerns about the effectiveness of training in subsequent years. The two-week block of training for ready reserves in their second and subsequent years will afford Army an opportunity to undertake worthwhile training in locations throughout Australia that are suitable for the purpose. However, the remainder of the training period in subsequent years will be of short duration. It has to be recognised that there are limitations and problems associated with training the ready reserve on two-or three-day blocks, which will be the case, I understand, for approximately half of their training in subsequent years. That matter is being addressed by the Army, and I think it will need some careful scrutiny by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I also have some reservations about the logistic matters associated with the change of 6th Brigade to a ready reserve. The simple question of where these people are going to be housed needs to be confronted, and I understand that matter is being looked at now. However, I believe that there is not space for 1,000 people at Enoggera from the start of next year, and the Government will clearly need to look at the changes that have to be made and the possible cost implications in ensuring that there is adequate housing for those involved. </PARA>
<PARA> My major concern in this area is the reduction of two regular battalions. The 6th Brigade has successfully integrated reserves and regulars into a very effective combat force. It seems possible and desirable to maintain one regular battalion as part of an integrated regular ready reserve brigade. After all, the ready reserve will have the benefit of one year's full time training, not required of current reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> I readily acknowledge the cost factor involved in changing a ready reserve battalion to a regular battalion. New equipment has to be paid for, and that is a significant cost which Defence is having to meet. I have referred already to some of the major cost items, particularly in the Navy. There are also some acquisitions in the Army, in particular the purchase of the wheeled armoured fighting vehicle, which will greatly improve mobility. I understand that one of the early trials of that will be with 6th Brigade, and I welcome that. The acquisition of night vision equipment on a large scale is to be commended. One of the lessons that came out of the Middle East Gulf dispute earlier this year was the advanced night vision capability of the United Nations alliance forces. There is no doubt that the large scale distribution of modern night vision equipment will be of great assistance to our infantry battalions. </PARA>
<PARA> The reintroduction into service of between four and six Chinooks is welcome. I have made speeches on that point in the past, and I am pleased to see that the Government is continuing to look at ways in which those Chinooks can be reintroduced into service. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in the end it is not the equipment but the people who make the difference: how well trained they are and, in defence, how many of them there are. The Government needs to monitor closely the introduction of the ready reserve and to adjust its implementation in the light of developments. There is some irony in the replacement of the two regular battalions in the 6th Brigade. This year 6 Battalion of the 6th Brigade has been recognised for having some of the most outstanding skills and abilities in the Army. It has recently won the overall Duke of Gloucester award, the night operations award and the award for the most outstanding section commander. This is the first time that all three awards have been won by the same battalion. Given the resources and opportunity, it would clearly be desirable to keep this successful combination together. The Minister is correct, though, when he says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is easy to draw up lists of what can be done to improve our defence capacity, if there were no resource limits. More demanding is the task of deciding what we can do less of, or to find better ways of doing things so that we can release resources for new projects and activities. </PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge that problem and the costs involved in the suggestions I have made about the need to maintain some greater regular battalion presence in the 6th Brigade. </PARA>
<PARA> With the Defence budget maintained in real terms and with strong pressures on other parts of the Budget, I concede the difficulties facing the Government in this matter. However, defence of our nation and its citizens is one of our fundamental responsibilities as an Australian Parliament. New technology is making defence procurement more expensive. I believe we are fast approaching the point where our total expenditure on defence as a nation will need to be revised. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that my sentiments in seeking some additional funding in this area will be echoed by those opposite. I ask them in their contributions to consider the question of the total Budget outlays and to reconcile what I anticipate will be their call for increased defence expenditure with their often stated view that total government outlays should be reduced. Later in this session we will no doubt hear from prominent members of the Opposition in response to the Budget, when they will be calling for cuts in government expenditure. Last year they proposed a $3 billion cut in Budget expenditure. I put it to those opposite that, when they argue for increased defence expenditure, they might at the same time inform the House how they will reconcile that with their requirement to cut total government outlays. They might enlighten the House as to the specific areas they wish to cut in order to fund not only the overall outlays reduction but the increase in defence expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Government and the Minister for their efforts to rationalise the Australian defence forces, their training and support facilities. The savings made in this process can be applied to other areas of greater need. Similarly, I think it is time for us to look beyond our own shores at the opportunity to rationalise our defence in association with other countries, particularly New Zealand, where there is scope for us to look at rationalising our total defence operations in some association with the New Zealand Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I commend the Minister and the Government for acknowledging in this statement the need to strengthen international arms control measures. There are many lessons we hope to learn from the Gulf war; foremost amongst those must be that arms sales and worldwide arms production must not be allowed to continue. I am pleased that the Government has acknowledged that in this speech. The future in defence, as elsewhere, will be about efficiency and effectiveness. I believe this statement is a positive move in both directions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While it is true that it is extraordinarily difficult to look into the future, it is of concern to me that as we talk on this defence paper introduced on 30 May, today being 21 August, the fundamental circumstances affecting Australia's and the world's security have changed fundamentally. In the course of my remarks I want to pick up some of the aspects mentioned by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), but it is essential that we understand a few of the crises that have beset us and still beset us today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sadly, the turbulent events in the Soviet Union are there for all to see and to fear. They have two real outcomes. The first is, obviously, the extent to which there is likely to be an armed conflict and loss of life, with all the very serious repercussions that flow, within the Soviet Union; but the second-equally profound for the world-is the extent to which the strategic arms limitation talks and the other disarmament achievements between President Gorbachev and President Bush could founder on the change towards a hard line communist dictatorship within the Soviet. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that at the beginning when looking at a statement which I think reflects the progressive deterioration of the Australian defence capacity under the Labor Government. Under successive Ministers-the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) and now Senator Ray-Australia's actual defence capability has been boosted on the premise of self-sufficiency, while it founders on the reality that we are more dependent today on the support of other forces than we have ever been. I intend to pick that up in relation to the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence (Senator Ray) and the Minister assisting him in this place, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), said that on 30 May it was premature to reach too many conclusions about the outcome of the Gulf war. But a few conclusions are now apparent. I want to look at those, look at the Australian Defence Force, look at our procurement program and see where we go from here. </PARA>
<PARA> Out of the Gulf war there are a few prime lessons. First, allied intelligence was superb. There is no doubt that the movements, the numbers and the extent to which there were changes to the structure within the Iraqi forces were known with absolute precision. The second lesson concerns the absolutely vital matter of air supremacy. If it had not been for the air supremacy of the allied forces, there is little doubt that the extent to which they would have been able to move the large mass of arms across to the western front so that they could come around in the main drive on Iraq would have been almost impossible. Certainly, that supremacy of air power enabled the allied forces to operate in an entirely different environment. That was one of the prime reasons for the capacity for the war to have been won so rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area is the amazing development in technologically sophisticated equipment. Some of it is in a field that is almost mind boggling. The honourable member for Brisbane talked about night vision equipment. When we look at the Stealth aircraft and some of the hand held weapons and equipment that were operated by the soldiers in the field, the extent to which technology gave the allied forces unprecedented supremacy is absolutely amazing. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth field, which is equally critical, is logistic support. It was absolutely incredible to move, stage, maintain and train so many in such a harsh and difficult environment and to sustain them for such a protracted period of time. Of course, it was equally amazing that the coalition was politically able to stay together. </PARA>
<PARA> I put on record all of those matters, because if we look at those in relation to the Australian Defence Force and say `Where do we go?', we realise how vulnerable we are. If we are going to measure Australia's contribution, it is also important to ask-let us be honest about it-what we sent. Effectively, we sent two frigates. We might have been able to extend that to four frigates. What would have happened if we had lost four frigates? What would have been the impact on the Australian Defence Force? We need to understand that those two frigates-there were several sets of two frigates-were unable to operate independently. The FFGs are not designed to operate independently out-of-station on their own any more than the DDGs-although the DDGs are much more capable ships. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at air superiority, we see the appalling result of this defence statement and the Budget. Although the honourable member for Brisbane properly said there is zero growth this year-in fact, the Government has maintained real spending on defence-we have been told that there will be an actual reduction in expenditure of nearly $84m next year and $177m the following year. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the Air Force, we are getting to the position where we are not giving enough flying hours to our pilots, particularly with the FA18s and certainly with the F111s. We have to be able to maintain not just the supremacy of those who are flying sophisticated aircraft but also their technical skills, their proficiency and their capability. I find this statement from the Minister laughable. I have a brother-in-law who is a former wing commander and is consequently very skilled in flying F111s. To bring back people who have been out of practice in flying these aircraft and expect them to become proficient air crew or, as the Minister says in his statement, to provide a surge capability, is not realistic, no matter how skilled or proficient they may be. People who are going to fly those modern war machines need a standard of training that is greater than what is now being provided. We are not providing the flying hours or the capacity even to maintain the equipment we have at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Brisbane said, it is true that we are looking towards a new wheeled armoured fighting unit and to some more night vision equipment for the Army. They are great measures, but let us be realistic. This Government cancelled the Whaler program. The Whaler program was designed to replace the M113 armoured personnel carriers because it was recognised 10 years ago that we had to do something to get something suitable for Australian conditions. We spent quite considerable sums of money developing an Australian armoured vehicle, and what did the Government do? It replaced it. Now the Government is going to buy something from overseas. Night vision equipment is essential, and it is very important that we acquire it. At the moment we have not enough. Were we required to fight anywhere in our region at the moment, we would find it extraordinarily difficult unless we depended upon somebody else to provide the supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has not the logistic capacity even to sustain an operation in Fiji if we needed to. I query whether we would be able to do anything in Papua New Guinea, with all the difficulties there. When we look at the climate around us and all the instability to which the Minister refers and of which we are all conscious in the South Pacific and our region, we would be foolish to think we had the logistic capacity to sustain a major commitment. If we look at what we might have done had we borne the same proportional commitment as the United States and Britain in the Gulf war, we see that we would not have been able to do it. We would have had to send about 2,000 armed personnel to the Gulf, we would not have been able to sustain them and we would have had virtually no defence forces left here. Nothing in this defence statement changes that. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to identify the fact that the defence procurement program has not been advanced by this defence statement. The lessons of the Gulf war say that we are more vulnerable and more dependent on our allies than we have ever been. We have to start working out what sort of a role we will play. I am one of those who say that we have a responsibility to maintain Western stability. In my view, we are far better preserving across the world the sort of peace that we believe can be obtained by working with the Western alliance. To do that, we have committed forces successively in Namibia; we still have a police unit in Cyprus; we have committed defence forces to the Sinai; and we have committed personnel to the United Nations unit in the Gulf: Australians to defend our international interests. But let us be realistic: those measures are as described within the general concepts of those who plan our defence spending; they are not the prime purpose of our Defence Force. Indeed, the whole purport of the Dibb report was to withdraw Australia's defence concepts back into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1987 White Paper, which has been endorsed as the strategic base of the statement made by the Minister, essentially says that there should be some capacity in our region. It does not talk other than incidentally about peacekeeping forces. Nothing in the 1987 White Paper removes us from the prime task set down in the 1976 White Paper, which looked at the overall capacity to which we want to develop defence self-sufficiency while working within an international context. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this statement leaves us very vulnerable in defence procurement. I am most concerned at the equipment that has been ordered. We have heard talk about the Collins class submarines. I still believe that we could have saved significant sums of money if we had had a refit of the Oberons and looked, as I believe we still should, at a nuclear powered submarine. </PARA>
<PARA> We are designing a U-boat of 1950s generation. It has a bit of flash equipment, but essentially it is still a modern U-boat. The U-boat was by far the most sophisticated submarine of World War II; and the Collins class, for all the significant improvements on the safety and other operational capabilities of those vessels, is still powered by an oldstyle unit which requires it to come to the surface to charge its batteries. The Minister says that the submarines will be stationed on the west coast. Our concern is that, if we want to send them somewhere, we cannot get them where we want them when we need to. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the lessons of the Falklands campaign was that the British, with their nuclear submarines, posed a threat which kept the Argentinean Navy at home. We want to be able to deter aggression. We will not be able to do it with something that can be observed. Realistically, with our capacity, we will not have the air supremacy to which I have referred as being a vital factor in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the Air Force, I am concerned that, as the Minister suggests, we will not be able to maintain the PC3s. I hope we can. He talks about replacing the F111s. I do not know with what. I only hope that he proceeds with an avionics upgrade. He needs to understand, with both the F18s and the F111s, that we have to provide more hours for the training and maintenance of those personnel and their pilot skills, or we will be in great trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) represents HMAS Albatross at Nowra. That is a typical example. We sold A4 aircraft to New Zealand, and now we have virtually taken them back into the Royal Australian Navy. We have not even been able to work out our acquisition program. The Navy is extraordinarily vulnerable because it has no intrinsic air defence. It would need to depend on the RAAF to maintain defence if it was needed. </PARA>
<PARA> I set this very briefly in the context that the procurement decisions have been wrong and that we do not know where we are going. The honourable member for Brisbane asked where we are going to get the money. I understand that it has already been decided that instead of having three over-the-horizon projects there will be two. I would cut the second and develop the original Jindalee over-the-horizon radar project. That would give us some funds with which we could start to look at our AWACS needs. The 707s need to be paid off shortly. We must have an AWACS capability, and I think that perhaps we have to start looking at a 727 or a new generation Boeing, both for refuelling and to develop the airborne early warning command and control system. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I close, I think I should say something about the Army's Ready Reserve. Unfortunately, I believe that the Ready Reserve will take resources from the Regular Army and that it will not provide the additional resources that we need to train our real reserves adequately. We have to look at the resources and to provide our regular and reserve forces with adequate training hours and adequate equipment. The Ready Reserve will be made to work, simply because that is what our service men and women are all about-they make things work. But it will not get additional resources; our Budget shows that. If it does not get additional resources, its personnel will come off the existing regulars and that will be to the detriment of Australia's defence capability. </PARA>
<PARA> The accommodation problems to which the honourable member for Brisbane referred are real. We have to look at what we have, make it better, train our personnel adequately and properly, house them properly and give them sufficient resources to undertake their tasks. Frankly, nothing in this defence statement gives me any confidence that the Government has looked at our strategic situation and designed its expenditure and its program to meet the real requirement of defending Australia in the 1990s and into the year 2000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate that tonight I have the opportunity to speak on the defence of our country. The timing of this debate allows me briefly to pay tribute to the late Brigadier Tony Hammett. He was perhaps the most respected soldier ever posted to Singleton army base, in the electorate of Hunter, New South Wales. So highly regarded was the then Colonel Hammett that during his period as Commandant of Singleton Army base, the Shire President, Neil McNamara, and the Singleton Council conferred on him the highest honour that a community can bestow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently Tony Hammett was tragically killed in a light plane crash. Mrs Hammett decided that her late husband's ashes should be held in the area that was dearest to him during his military career. So on Tuesday, 3 September, an important ceremony will take place in Singleton when Brigadier Hammett's ashes will be laid to rest. I know that Colonel Peter Cosgrove and the personnel at Singleton army base, the local RSL President-Bill Ruggatt, who served under Tony-all the RSL members and the citizens of Singleton will pay Tony Hammett the tribute that he so well deserves. Unfortunately, Parliament will be sitting that day and I cannot be in Singleton. However, I want to say my own farewell to Brigadier Tony Hammett, who was a brilliant soldier and a champion bloke. I join with others in extending my sympathies to Mrs Hammett and the Hammett family. </PARA>
<PARA> The defence statement being debated tonight is a far-reaching and, some may consider, radical statement. But it is a good statement which will take our defence forces well into the next century. The Dibb report highlighted the need for Australia's self-reliance and the Government has been moving steadily in this direction. Three key principles are adopted by the force structure review which examined the current Defence Force structure and recommended adjustments to the year 2000. I have too short a time to go into detail about the three principles, but the changes outlined in the statement on defence are progressive and allow this country to maintain a peak defence ready force, ably served by members of the regular Australian Defence Force and strengthened by members of our reserve forces. </PARA>
<PARA> I had a discussion with a senior officer from the Singleton army base who has been involved with reservists. He made the point that generally, in his experience, reservists are the best type of people. They are usually public minded and more dedicated. They not only hold down their own job and do it well, but are always on promotion courses in the reserves. They make excellent soldiers and the only problem is that the reserve forces cannot get enough of them. It is to be hoped that many regular Defence Force personnel will join the new reserve forces and thus continue their military careers. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not denigrating the men and women of our regular Australian Defence Force in any way because they, too, are splendid, dedicated people and are the backbone of our nation. They have proved themselves time and time again over many years. Of course, the latest conflict in which they proved themselves was the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> The permanent Australian Defence Force is to be reduced by some 10,500 personnel over the next 10 years. The bulk of the reduction in personnel will result from natural attrition with only some minor voluntary retirements. It is hard to argue with the stated aim of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to get more punch for the Defence dollar. Certainly, the Defence vote should not be immune from scrutiny and I am sure the Australian taxpayers will agree with that statement. Defence is a big spending item on the Budget, representing some 9.6 per cent of total government outlay. Like all areas of government activity, the Services have to take their share of cost cutting. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be little argument with the plans to allow private enterprise to take over support functions such as catering, tailoring, communications, transport and medical services. Savings from that exercise will be put to more effective use on the combat side. </PARA>
<PARA> There should not be any dispute about the idea of a well-trained reserve force to back up regulars in the three services. Singleton army base certainly will not lose from the changes in the defence area, with $130m or perhaps even more to be spent on the Singleton army base and Myambat supply depot. Although I doubt that the defence statement will have much impact on either the Singleton army base or the Williamtown RAAF base, it is possible that Singleton and Raymond Terrace in Newcastle could benefit by the release of very well-trained people in highly sophisticated areas. </PARA>
<PARA> That could also have a beneficial effect on towns in the Hunter region because more civilians could be employed. Soldiers doing work that could be done by civilians will be allocated other duties. Savings will be generated by commercialising some activities such as catering, communications, stores and transport, clerical work, non-military training, repairs and maintenance, health care and firefighting functions. Other people can do these jobs very well. Our soldiers would then be allowed the freedom and the time to develop expertise in the combat side of things. </PARA>
<PARA> Savings made will be beneficial in two ways. First, they will allow Australia to buy the state-of-the-art technology to maintain our defence-ready capability and, secondly, by commercialising some activities benefits will be derived in the private sector. With regard to the reserves, there will be better pay and conditions for them, but I am a bit concerned about the married reservists. I assume that they will be entitled to the same conditions as members of the regular defence forces. For instance, a married person is not entitled to removal expenses for his family unless the posting is for in excess of 12 months. This situation could arise when reservists might be transferred to Western Australia or northern Australia. Incidentally, there can be no argument at all that we should expand our defence operations in the vast stretches of Western Australia and northern Australia. We are the largest island in the world and our coastline stretches over many thousands of kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA> I have always believed it was ludicrous to continue basing major defence operations in the southern areas of Australia. Sure, we do need to have these areas suitably protected too, but any threat to Australia is likely to come from our vast, largely unprotected, western and northern coastlines. Bases in the southern areas of Australia belong to the early days of our history, and certainly have little bearing on our defence needs today and in the future. I believe most Australians see the logic in the reason for this move to protect our most unprotected areas. </PARA>
<PARA> While I support the thrust of the defence statement, I do have a few concerns. One of those concerns is about the use of reservists with regard to employers. Some employers do allow their employees leave, particularly government departments and the larger businesses, but other employers, particularly those in small business, cannot afford to lose their employees for long training periods. With the training guarantee scheme in operation, it is possible that some employers will be reluctant to allow employees additional time to participate in the reserve forces. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about what will happen when the new reserve scheme commences next year. It is expected that young people would undertake 12 months training. Where would we find these young people who can get leave from their employers? Certainly, the new scheme will provide employment opportunities for many of our young people who are unable the find jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> I can also foresee logistical problems in getting people from all over Australia into one area for training. The timing of that training could also present problems. For instance, the time selected for training may be unsuitable for farmers or may not fit in with the end of semesters for university students and so on. I suppose the Army has been dealing with this sort of thing for many years and has answers to all these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> The Singleton army base, including the Myambat Supply Depot, and the Williamtown RAAF base are very proud of the way they are accepted into and form part of the community. They are an integral part of our Hunter Valley and I hope that this will remain the case for many years to come. Both bases have taken a positive attitude about the defence statement. Their personnel have said to me, `We'll get on with the job and we'll be able to cope with the changes'. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of the Newcastle earthquake in 1989, personnel from Williamtown RAAf base were in the area within 30 minutes to assist with relief work. Their work was so good that they were requested by the SES to stay on and provide further assistance. Williamtown is a great asset to the Hunter. The annual wages bill is about $68m. Major projects have been completed there. Millions of dollars are put into the Hunter Valley economy. All the money is being spent locally. </PARA>
<PARA> Another interesting point is that the base is a tremendous user of some of the services provided in the Hunter: for example, the Shire of Gloucester is a fairly large area but at peak periods the RAAF base at Williamtown uses more electric power than the whole of the Gloucester Shire. </PARA>
<PARA> So Singleton army base and Williamtown RAAF base are of great benefit to the Hunter Valley. Both bases view the Hunter Valley as being a pro-military area-a pro-RAAF area too, I guess-a delightful place to work in, and they consider themselves part of the Hunter community. It is not just the Singleton army base that is highly regarded by the community; Williamtown RAAF base is equally regarded. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that there is a fort on the foreshores of Newcastle named after one of the founders of the concept of the Army reserves, Colonel Peter Scratchley, who in 1877 arrived from England and advised that the only need by Australia for defence was a system of armoured forts. He recommended that the forts be backed up by a small but well trained force of full time soldiers, and that the bulk of the troops should be part time paid volunteers; in other words, an Army Reserve. </PARA>
<PARA> We will have a darned good Army Reserve in this country. There are reserve units of artillery, infantry, engineers and support units based at Waratah, Hamilton and Adamstown within the Hunter Valley and there are other companies throughout the Hunter region. They are jolly capable personnel. It has been claimed that the Army Reserve may become the poor relation of the new Defence Service. But I reject that claim outright. </PARA>
<PARA> When defence personnel leave the Australian Defence Force, they take with them a range of skills and, with attractive pay and service conditions offered to reservists, it should be possible to attract these people to the reserve forces and thereby retain these valuable skills. The defence statement is very comprehensive and covers a whole range of issues such as combatant surface vessels, aircraft needs, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that the statement clearly sets out Australia's position on defence exports, I believe that this defence statement is a positive document which, when implemented, not only will allow Australia to maximise its capacity to draw on national resources but also will take our country forward into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to offer my congratulations to both the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Defence, Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) for the report they have brought down. (Time expired)</PARA>

The RSL recently celebrated its seventy-fifth anniversary and, in the context of this debate on the paper entitled Defence into the 21st Century, we might reflect on the motto of the RSL. I remind honourable members that that motto is, `The price of liberty is eternal vigilance'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Budget yesterday confirmed in my view for all time that Labor has lost its resolve on defence. I believe that the Budget showed conclusively that Labor is not genuinely interested in reforming defence or in developing a genuinely self-reliant defence policy. Although this Government will be thrown out at the next election because of its economic ineptitude, it may well be that its complacency on defence will be the Government's most damaging legacy to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians have paid a high price for liberty in the past. Last Sunday the twenty-fifth anniversary of the battle of Long Tan in South Vietnam was remembered. Eighteen young Australians gave their lives there and for them, of course, it was the ultimate price. It is not that Long Tan was a Gallipoli or a Tobruk, but it was the first major engagement between an Australian force and its enemy in South Vietnam, and it was a battle in which Australians performed in the best traditions of Anzac. In that battle 245 enemy were killed. Ultimately 500 young Australians gave their lives in South Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> The price of liberty then is high. On hearing what has been said by Government members tonight in this debate, I wonder whether the price for the Government is too high. I want to say on behalf of my children here tonight, and on behalf of the children of others, that no price is too high to pay. We cannot take risks with defence. Yet this is exactly what this Government is asking us to do. It is asking us to take unacceptable risks with the defence of this country. But what does it care? The Budget even cut the allocation to the Australian War Memorial. What strange priorities this Government has. Australian veterans will judge this Government on the way it commemorates their fallen comrades, and I believe it will be a harsh judgment indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I am pleased to say in this debate on defence that the Speaker and his colleague the President of the Senate have agreed to my suggestion that we have an Anzac commemoration here in Parliament House next year. I intend to take Mr Speaker up on his offer for me to proceed to organise this. I note that he has offered his assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in his response to the ministerial statement pointed to the many respects in which the Government strategy for defence into the twenty-first century is flawed. I want to take it further and expose some of those flaws in my contribution to the debate this evening. I want to make the Australian people aware of the path which this Government is taking us down, a path which will put this country's future at considerable risk. As I said, it is an unacceptable risk for I do not believe we can take risks with defence. All of the lessons of military history underline this fact. </PARA>
<PARA> If we put this debate into its historical context, we will recognise that Australia has never been properly or adequately prepared for war. Indeed, we have been fortunate that, except for some fairly minor but significant incursions, we have never had to fight a full-scale war on our own ground. But when war came in 1939 Australia was not prepared. Nor was it prepared in 1914.</PARA>
<PARA> Our defence policy in 1939 was not adequate for the situation. The RAAF was ill-equipped and the Army lacked modern equipment; in fact at the time, interestingly enough, as we reflect in this debate, we had two armies-the existing militia and the soon to be formed and recruited Second AIF. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1920 and 1935 little or nothing much was done in respect of defence. These were years of neglect, and in a sense we look back at those years of neglect and we see a direct parallel with what has happened in this country in recent times. Of course, the hurried re-armament that occurred after 1937 when the signs became ominous was too late. Governments at the time did not believe there would be a Second World War, and when war actually came to Australia's shores in 1942 we were not capable of defending ourselves; we were clearly totally incapable of defending ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The two-army policy that existed at the time also caused great difficulties. As I listened to the ministerial statement on 30 May, I could not help wondering whether history was repeating itself, except that now we have before us a proposal not for two armies, but for three armies. The Opposition believes that this proposal will seriously affect our combat capability. We have the Regular Army, the Reserve-already poorly equipped and lacking adequate training facilities, despite what the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) suggested it would have-and we will have an all new Ready Reserve. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that can work effectively. The addition of a third tier may well be quite counterproductive and increase the size of the already too large defence bureaucracy. I believe that what the Government proposes now is the worst of all worlds. It proposes to reduce the regular component of the Army to the absolute bare minimum. It will leave us with only four regular battalions. With only four regular battalions, the Regular Army will be close to useless; in fact, it will be unable to maintain a protracted deployment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's solution in recognition of this is the creation of a Ready Reserve. I say to the Government that that just will not work. What it will do is knock the guts out of the existing Reserve, which may sound the death knell of the Reserve. Reservists have been struggling for years. They have been poorly equipped and there has been very little incentive for them to remain. Now that they will be relegated to third grade, they might as well pack up and go home-and they probably will. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Ready Reserve fails, what will we have? We will have a weakened regular force and a decimated Reserve. I believe that is a recipe for disaster. I have no doubt that the whole idea of a Ready Reserve is a pig in a poke. It has been tried in one or two countries. It failed in Canada. Of greater concern to all Australians is the fact that it is extremely risky and it puts at risk the future defence of Australia and, to that extent, it is a completely unacceptable risk. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be little incentive for people to join the Ready Reserve. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) suggested that ex-regulars might join. They will not be interested or motivated. Once they have left and have taken up civilian employment, they will not be too interested in going back under any conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) earlier tonight made an excellent contribution to this debate. I shall just echo some of the remarks that he made which were based on his very wide experience in this area. When we put the ministerial statement in the context of our most recent military engagement-the Gulf war-we get some interesting insights. Australia participated in that war for national security reasons-although Saddam Hussein did not pose any direct threat to Australia-and joined a United Nations sanctioned coalition. It was a very broad coalition. It was almost a war with the world against Iraq-in some sense it may have been seen as World War III-but Iraq's activities demanded and received decisive action from the international community. It now appears that with the survival of Saddam Hussein, however, the war ended too soon and it may well be that once again peace will be lost. </PARA>
<PARA> As the right honourable member for New England said, the Gulf war highlighted then, and continues to highlight, the major deficiencies in Australia's defence preparedness and capabilities. Australia's defence forces were not prepared to react in the Gulf war situation, other than superficially. No matter how much we might like to think we made a great contribution there-that does not in any way diminish the contribution of those who went-we only reacted superficially. </PARA>
<PARA> We could not have dispatched ground forces. We could not have risked valuable RAAF assets, and the equipment on our ships-they were ill-equipped at the time-was cannibalised from other ships. Some of it was borrowed from overseas, some was borrowed from the RAAF and some was borrowed from the Army. It was altogether a pretty patched up job. At least it put us there, and that was terrific. </PARA>
<PARA> What have we learned from the Gulf war? Clearly, the real problem with Australian defence policy is its persistent failure to respond effectively and in good time to major global strategic shifts. Australia's modern defence policy is based heavily on the Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities and the subsequent 1987 White Paper. Essentially, it is a policy of alliance plus self-reliance. Unfortunately, the Budget yesterday effectively killed Labor's 1987 defence policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The aim was to develop the ADF into an instrument which could support overall security policy and deal with lesser contingencies itself; but the policy has failed. The ADF's independent operational capacity is almost non-existent, and it will be completely non-existent with the planned restructuring. Our war stocks at the moment are very low and we have virtually no independent resupply capacity. This has been exacerbated to some extent by the bleak outlook for Australia's defence export industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context we find ourselves faced with this magnificent document entitled Defence into the 21st Century. I say to honourable members and to the people of Australia, because I believe it is incumbent on me and I have a responsibility to do so, that this paper, this plan-if I can call it that, using the word loosely-does nothing to engender any confidence at all in the Government's ability to come to grips with Australia's defence needs. The Government has failed in defence. As I said earlier, looking at yesterday's Budget Papers it appears that the Government has completely given up and lost its resolve on defence. </PARA>
<PARA> The needs of Australia have changed dramatically in response to the end of the Cold War. We are witnessing rising defence expenditure amongst some of our neighbours. We are witnessing a dramatically changing role in many respects for the United States, where defence expenditure, for one reason or another, is falling, and falling quite dramatically. In real terms, over the next 10 years it will fall substantially. Yet the Government, even in the context of that reality, has continued to give a low priority to defence-a priority that was confirmed in yesterday's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> This is happening at a time when the Government is enthusiastically handing out money all over the place for other things while defence real growth since 1987 has been zero. In other words, we have been going backwards on defence expenditure since 1987. Defence spending over the last few years has been at historically low levels. As I said earlier in my remarks, to put this debate in context we need to consider that Australia has never been adequately prepared for war. I suppose some would say that maybe no-one is ever adequately prepared for war. But the signs are there. There is no reason for complacency in this world today. We must be prepared in the context of world events. Events of the last 24 to 48 hours should impress upon us the urgency of being prepared. Yet we have become extremely complacent, and the Opposition is concerned about this. We feel we must warn the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> There is now more than ever a need for a major defence review. There should have been in May or earlier this year another White or Green Paper, not just a knee-jerk where-can-we-save-money reaction, which is what we got from the Government. Urgent attention needs to be given to the high and costly personnel wastage rate-- (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Events of recent days certainly demonstrate that the Cold War is alive and well. We have had one Cold War warrior, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), echoing the 1970s defence philosophy and technology. We have a new Cold War warrior, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradfield), using slightly different words, but the message is still the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In looking at defence in the twenty-first century, it is probably best that we go back and look at why we needed the Dibb report and the defence review of 1987. Honourable members may recall that when the right honourable member for New England relinquished his portfolio as the Minister for Defence in early 1983 he did not bother telling the people of Australia how payments on a whole range of equipment had been deferred, particularly on the F18s, because the Budget was going bad. In the 1983-84 Budget, because of the deferred payments left by the outgoing Minister, the defence surplus funds were virtually all expended before this Government could even draw up a Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> He did not tell the people that the shells on our Leopard tanks-which are Germany's finest tanks-had to be imported. After all the years we had had them, we had not even negotiated the licence to make the shells in Australia, so to use those tanks in Australia we would have had to get permission to import the shells. He did not tell us that the capacity, suitability and specifications of the Whaler vehicle, which he mentioned earlier and the introduction of which he initiated, that were drawn up were so inadequate that when it finally went through the analysis stage the vast majority of the experts in the defence committees which examined it were unanimous in saying that it was not just a waste of money but also unsuitable for what Australia needed. He did not tell us that the trainer aircraft was in such bad shape and so poorly specified that after some three or four years its design specifications were still not finalised. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cold War warriors made all the noises about tanks rumbling through Red Square, giving a great show of strength and letting the world see what wonderful equipment we have. It did not matter to them if there were no bullets for them, if we had not paid for them or if they worked-as long as they looked good. I suggest that the honourable member for McPherson look at the Defence projections in the late 1970s and the actual expenditure. He will find a gap. The projected expenditure on Defence was never matched by the right honourable member for New England, as Minister for Defence, or his predecessors. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two aspects to a defence strategy: the first is international; the second is regional. Australia was part of somebody else's international strategy, particularly America via the American alliance. We have never had a regional defence strategy of any nature. It is therefore not surprising that our equipment was inappropriate and that the major criterion for acquisitions was that they contribute to paying the price for international alliances. The main issue was compatibility, adaptability and absorbability into somebody else's army. </PARA>
<PARA> The great irony of tonight's speeches is that the comment made by both the honourable member for McPherson and the right honourable member for New England regarding the Gulf crisis was that somehow we were not suitably absorbed. The fact is that we do not need to be fully absorbed by any other army. The vessels that were sent there played a very useful role. There was no pretence that, as one of the 28 countries involved, we could somehow be a dominant or major participant or an individual, stand alone participant. That is both ludicrous and simple rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> I should go slightly further. The right honourable member for New England initiated the common task submarine project. Tonight he is talking about how that was wrong. He admits that was wrong, but he will not admit that the Whaler and trainer were wrong and that the negotiation of the Leopard tank was wrong; nor does he admit--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they all were, and I think the Dibb report and the defence review of 1987 shows that. Nor did the honourable member admit the $1 billion of missing offsets that were negotiated with Krauss Maffei on Leopard tanks and with the Americans on the FFGs. This $1 billion was supposed to be spent in Australia but was never spent, and those involved could not be held to it because the contracts had too many loopholes. That is the record; it does not quite match the rhetoric.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Defence is just that-defence. This country requires a capacity to defend itself. It also needs to be part of international alliances and arrangements. As I said earlier, previous defence policies were simply international. Equipment was designed to fit into other people's forces; it was predominantly designed for somewhere else, to be used somewhere else-invariably under somebody else's control, as we were in the First World War, as we were in the Second World War and as we were in the Gulf war. That is what international alliances are about. To suggest that we do not have a capacity to defend ourselves in the regional context is not just insulting but downright wrong. It displays not an ignorance but a deliberate intention to distort and to frighten. </PARA>
<PARA> The khaki elections of the 1950s and 1960s have gone. We cannot bring them back. This week the Cold War warriors in Moscow will get the same answer from their community that the Opposition will get if it runs that line. We cannot resurrect the threat of the Russian ships in the Pacific or the yellow peril. They have gone. Nowadays, Australians are much too sophisticated for that kind of nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence into the 21st Century report basically is no great departure from the defence review of 1987 nor the Dibb report. It simply takes the next step of restructuring and positioning. One would imagine from the previous speaker's remarks that there had been a massive cut in defence expenditure. Last year defence took up 2.4 per cent of GDP. For the current year defence will take up 2.4 per cent of GDP. There has been no shift. It is important to point out that we are spending 9.3 per cent of Government outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> Members opposite are in for a great surprise if they think that when they are in government the economic rationalists will not be looking at defence as a major area of saving. They are in for a great shock if they think that is not the case. I can assure them that the economic rationalists will be looking at defence cuts. Fortunately, this is something those opposite will not carry out, so I do not think we should be too concerned about defence being attacked. </PARA>
<PARA> The right honourable member for New England suggested that we remove one more of the Jindalee radar systems, but let us get that in context. The tender for Jindalee was for two systems-not for three, but with a possible extension to three. The Government is saying in this report and in the Budget that the third one will not be taken up at this point, as it was not originally planned. The right honourable member for New England is now saying that we should take one of those away. He did not say which one. One points predominantly west and one points predominantly north. The third one was to point more to the north-east. Which one does he want to take away?</PARA>
<PARA> Nor did the right honourable member talk about the difficulties in securing and protecting AWACS in the air. That surprises me because he certainly would be aware of that. When he spoke about the difficulty of defending defence assets, particularly with the FFGs in the Gulf and the like, he did not mention the cost of defending AWACS. The fact is that the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar-JOTHR, as it is now called-does make a substantial potential contribution to surveillance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Dibb report and the defence review of 1987 was basically about surveillance, self-reliance and quality. I notice that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) seemed to equate defence with numbers of bodies. Subsequent speakers have not fallen to that simplistic notion. Clearly, modern defence is about quality. More importantly, modern defence is about community involvement and support. Previous speakers have referred to the Army reserves, their integration and the important role they play in bridging between the defence forces and the community itself. Defence manufacturing does exactly the same. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a source of great pride to me to have watched this Government shift defence expenditure. The figures are of some interest. It is estimated that some 87 per cent of total defence expenditure will be spent in Australia in the current year, including 59 per cent on capital equipment, the order for which will go to Australian companies, using Australian skills and an Australian work force. In 1984-85, that figure was only 25 per cent. It is a source of great pride to me to be part of the Government that has started to make us generally self-reliant in our capacity and has given our work force and our organisations the opportunity and the scope to show their ability and to take pride in contributing to their country. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that people who work in defence manufacturing have a special quality-whether they work in shipbuilding, submarines or other areas. They take a great pride in their work, because it is both demanding and of a high quality. They get a special source of pride because they are helping the nation in a visible and substantial way. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite talk in the rhetoric of the 1960s and 1970s-the Cold War warriors. They left us with only 25 per cent of capital expenditure being spent in Australia. They lecture us on what defence should be about and then they somehow think the community will take notice of them. I think the people of Australia are much more sophisticated nowadays. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some important aspects of the paper that I think need touching on. The first of those is the minehunter project-now being shifted from an inshore minehunter to a coastal minehunter. That is an important change, for two reasons: first, the performance of the smaller vessels in heavy weather. I mentioned earlier that the inshore minehunter was a project started by the previous Government. At the time, no-one differed with the view that inshore minehunters were the appropriate direction in which to go. However, with Australian conditions and the capacity for sudden changes in the states of our seas, acceptance of the need for larger minehunters rather than the smaller inshore ones is an appropriate and important change. I express my public concern, as I have on previous occasions, at the performance of the Navy in the sonar assessment for those vessels. That was lamentable and I think that over time more will be heard of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The second important matter that has not been picked up is the shift from a three-tier Navy to a two-tier Navy. That may sound esoteric, but it is a substantial change. What do we need most? Do we need fewer bigger ships or more smaller, smarter ships? I suspect that, with our seas and the expanse we cover as a country, the latter is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The paper says that by 2009 there will be 16 vessels, compared to the current figure of 10, with enhanced Anzac frigates starting in 2006 and a new patrol boat starting in 2004. That is a very important statement in the paper because it gives a clear definition. </PARA>
<PARA> I was going to touch upon the nuclear submarine option, but time will not allow that. It is important regionally and nationally that we are seen to be defensive of ourselves, and not seen to be overtly offensive to others. The signal that we must give to the world is that Australia is about defence-not about first strike capacities, not about invading others. Our equipment must be seen and must be able to defend our shores, our shipping lanes and our regions. Australia must not be seen to be primarily a country of first strike capacity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members of the Opposition have listened with interest to the observations of the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) on what is a very important debate, although it is taking place some three months after the ministerial statement, Defence into the 21st Century, was made in this Parliament on 30 May last.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to draw the attention of the honourable member, who has just left the chamber, to some of the rather intriguing observations he made; for example, his observation that defence is just that-defence. I would certainly like to see how he could analyse that in the context of what we are seeing before our very eyes on television stations around the world of events in the Soviet Union at present. Surely they demonstrate for all to see the fundamental reality of defence planning; that is, international circumstances can change so rapidly and can have such a fundamental effect on whatever principles one may have placed as the basis of one's defence planning. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact that was rather well addressed by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney) when he spoke on behalf of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) in this place on 30 May. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Defence planning by its nature must be dynamic and evolve with changing strategic and economic circumstances. We face considerable strategic uncertainties as we enter the 1990s. We are not in Europe, where we might benefit directly from the decline in superpower confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA>When the Minister made that statement no doubt he, all members of this House and, I am sure, the entire world hoped and believed that the days of superpower power confrontation were over. </PARA>
<PARA> While we have seen, as I said earlier, the most extraordinary events unfolding in the Soviet Union, we still hope we will not see the return to the Soviet Union and to the communist system of a Stalinist government which would once again cast the world into two rival camps. That is something which we must all hope and pray about if we are to develop to any degree a new world order-the words used by President Bush at the time glasnost and perestroika were hailed around the world as being the great step forward-from the abyss of international destruction which has been held over the world since at least the 1950s. If we are not to see a return to that, the reality for nations like Australia is quite simple: defence above all else must, once again, be taken far more seriously than this Government has taken it over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The force structure review we are debating here tonight represents a recognition that present strategic, economic and political circumstances can no longer support an environment in which defence can look to real funding increases. In fact, it is not unreasonable to say that it would be lucky to achieve zero real growth and negative growth cannot be excluded. That is the underlying reality of this paper, despite the efforts by the honourable member for Newcastle and others to try to read into the statistics a very different situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also drew the attention of the House to what he regarded as the Cold War warriors of the past. I hope I have managed to put that argument to bed once and for all. He also complained that the previous policies-by that, I presume he meant the policies of Liberal and National governments in the past-were simply to integrate Australia's defence capability into international requirements and to fit in with other people's systems. Anybody who can make a comment like that merely demonstrates the paucity of his understanding of international defence realities and of the need for access to the best and most modern research capabilities and most recent weapons systems. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Australian military system must to a considerable degree be integrated with those of our allies. That is not to suggest for one moment that we should be incapable of defending our own national interests-quite the contrary-but it demonstrates the lesson which NATO failed to apply for so long. Despite the fact that all those nations in western Europe were members of that alliance, had signed its treaties, had claims of all sorts of degrees of integration of strategic and defence preparedness, the simple fact of the matter was that when their navies went out onto the North Sea, they found it very difficult to transfer fuel from one ship to another of different navies because they did not even have the same connection on their pumps. </PARA>
<PARA> Precisely for those sort of reasons, it is fundamental for the integration of the Australian military capacity that we have the ability to work with, to train with and, if necessary, to fight with similar forces of our allies. </PARA>
<PARA> The papers before us have introduced a whole series of interesting reforms. I must emphasise that the Opposition parties do not disagree with all the reforms which the Government has introduced; quite the contrary, some of the reforms are sensible and should be applauded. That is not to say, however, that we totally agree with some of the decisions, such as the decision to reduce our regular battalions from six to four. </PARA>
<PARA> We are firmly of the view that a nation of the territorial size of Australia, which has a sea zone equal in area to the total area of our land mass, and one that is a major nation in the South Pacific, is simply incapable of defending its regional interests at this southern end of the Asian land mass without having a Regular Army of at least six battalions. Merely playing around with reserves, establishing a new reserve structure and doing what one likes with the numbers cannot for one minute remove the fundamental reality that, as we saw in the Gulf, the men on the ground are the final determinants of who wins and who loses in a land war. </PARA>
<PARA> I need to emphasise this point no more than by drawing attention to the fact that when it was feared that the Iraqis could mount a force of up to a million men, the United States and its allies determined that they could not possibly face that force without at least an enormous additional air capacity and a military force on the ground at a ratio of at least 1 : 2. So for Government members to seriously ask anybody who knows anything about defence to accept any formula of less than six battalions as the basis of the Australian Regular Army is simply absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> What we saw in Iraq, and what we have seen in every single military campaign in which Australia has been involved, is that even when one has significant aerial superiority it is the men on the ground who have to fight and die to hold that ground or who have to attack and therefore gain access to the enemy's territory. That is a formula and a dictum that has been in place for hundreds of years and was emphasised so clearly by such outstanding military historians as Clausewitz. </PARA>
<PARA> The greater use of civilian infrastructure is one of the major objectives of this package and it is one which the Opposition parties support. It is quite clear that there is a whole range of support tasks currently being carried out by the ADF which could be and should be transferred to the private sector. These tasks include catering, communications, depot level maintenance, the maintenance of defence assets, transport, medical services and various aspects of non-military training. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the objectives of the Government's policy is to establish a Ready Reserve of approximately 20,000 men, who would require a year of full time training followed by a rigorous return of service requirement for a further four years. The numbers of that Ready Reserve are estimated to be some 16,000 for the Army, 3,000 for the Navy and 1,500 for the Air Force. In terms of the Air Force-I wish to draw particular attention to this unit-Australia has reached the absurd position where we virtually have more front-line aircraft than we have pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> That may seem an extraordinary statement, because I remember only a few years ago when the ratio was precisely the other way around. It demonstrates what the Royal Australian Air Force is facing, as are all other Western air forces, which is the drain-off until quite recently-since the economic recession, which may well have had some effect-of the best-quality pilots. Therefore, it is necessary to have a reserve structure which can maintain the defence readiness of pilots even if they have left the regular service. Any move that can be put in place and that will attract and retain that extraordinarily valuable group of personnel, who I am reliably informed cost about $2m each to train, is clearly in Australia's national interests. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to cuts in regular ADF numbers. Among the suggestions, as I said earlier, is a reduction from six to four Army battalions. Effectively that means the second line of defence is now, more than ever before, going to be in the hands of the reserve component of the Australian Army. As an ex-reserve officer myself, I have to say in this House that this is a matter of grave concern because, while this document talks about maintaining the existing size of the Army Reserve, the document does not tell us whether adequate resources are being made available so that the reserves can be maintained at an adequate level of preparedness. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already been informed by various battalion commanders in my own State that they have had cutbacks in their training funding by up to one-third when compared with their allocation last year. If those figures are even half right, this is a very serious matter indeed. It demonstrates clearly that, if we are to maintain an active and efficient and effective reserve force, it cannot be based on simple numbers of men or women in and out of the service. We must be able to maintain our unit strength to the maximum extent possible and for as long as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Government is well aware and as honourable members of this House have mentioned before, the figures quite clearly show that the capacity to retain reservists in Australia in most units is unsatisfactory. Clearly, one of the reasons for that is that reservists honestly believe that, when they are facing all the competition from their wives, girlfriends, local sports clubs, jobs, et cetera, if they are not going to get the support that they regard as absolutely fundamental to ensuring that they do a decent job they simply will not stay in military units. On 30 May in this House when the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) made his statement, he emphasised the need for the defence services to be supported by the community and at the same time to be made up of men and women who were willing and able to serve. I think it is not unreasonable for the Opposition to say to the Government that it is all very well to say those sorts of things, but let us cater to the realities which can make that a viable possibility. </PARA>
<PARA> A further change in the structure which the Opposition would support is cuts in civilian numbers to change the ratios between Regular Army personnel and civilians while at the same time ensuring that some functions of the regular reserve services can be transferred to civilians. The final point I want to make concerns base rationalisation. The document contains some useful suggestions in the context of moving units from Victoria and New South Wales into northern Australia, in particular the Northern Territory. It is perfectly clear that, in terms of theatres of operation, it is northern Australia which must be given higher priority than any other part of the mainland. I should also add it is not just northern Australia in the accepted sense of the term, but north-west Australia in particular. The policy contains some significant changes, including the movement of base facilities for the Navy to Western Australia. Again that is useful, especially for the submarine squadrons and the new ships that will be coming on strength. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the saddest thing of all is that, although the review adds some credibility to our northern defence posture, it simultaneously sends signals to the region that we are unwilling to come up with the funds necessary to support a significant power projection capability. Those who claim-as did the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris)-that defence is all about keeping people away from Australia miss the fundamental point that the principal defence in a democracy is the capacity to retard any threat to its national sovereignty or national interest. A fundamental strategic review has taken place but regrettably the principles in the White Paper of 1987 are still being applied. As I said in my opening remarks, circumstances change rapidly in international diplomacy and international strategic realities, and regrettably this document does not take that into account.

Yet never has Queensland been more poorly treated by a Federal government. Is it that this record 19 ALP members and senators are not doing their job, or is it that they have been squeezed out of the government process? Not one of those 19 members is in Cabinet. There are two minor Ministers but there is no representation at all in the Federal Cabinet. This is the first time since Federation that there has not been a Queenslander in the Federal Cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, in the whole sorry history of the Hawke Government there has been only one Queenslander in his Cabinet. That was, of course, the Governor-General, Mr Hayden, who was Minister for Foreign Affairs and out of the country for most of the time. Indeed, Labor's treatment of Queensland has been disgraceful. There have been plenty of opportunities to include Queenslanders in the Cabinet but they have never been taken up. Over the years, of the 252 positions in Labor ministries and shadow ministries only 19 have been filled by Queenslanders. That is only 7 1/2 per cent. So its record is consistent in ignoring the talent from the sunshine State. The coalition record is more than double that number and certainly contrasts very favourably. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another stark contrast when one looks at what Labor has done for Queensland compared to what is happening in Victoria. Despite the fact that in Victoria the Labor Party was mauled at the last Federal election, it also is represented by 19 Federal members and senators, among them nine Cabinet Ministers, including the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) as well as the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) and his Deputy, Senator Gareth Evans. </PARA>
<PARA> Every State is better treated than Queensland. Even the ACT has a Minister in Cabinet. Queensland continues to miss out. The ALP does all of its deals to get people up, to sort out the factions and to make sure the mates are looked after, but no Queenslander is ever found a place. Senator Richardson was reported by Peter Beattie, the former State Secretary of the Queensland Labor Party, as saying that none of the Queensland members were any good. But when has talent had anything to do with who the Labor Party appoints to ministerial positions?</PARA>
<PARA> In these times of depression, unemployment and record bankruptcies is it suggested that the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler) or the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) could not do just as good a job as the Ministers occupying the seats at the present time? When we look around at the pathetic Budget we listened to yesterday and the Bills that have been messed up and regularly brought back into the House, is it suggested that the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) or the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) could not do just as good a job?</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland has been consistently discriminated against and disadvantaged by its lack of representation in the Cabinet. When it comes to State grants, local government grants, allocation of tertiary places, road funding, awarding of defence and other government contracts, location of government departments, the parochial allocation of services, arts grants, hospital funding, tourism promotion, and appointments to quangos, wherever one goes Queensland has not been given a fair share of the deal. </PARA>
<PARA> This has so angered and embarrassed Premier Goss that he even recruited the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) to become a de facto Minister for Queensland. Premier Goss has expressed no confidence in the Queensland Labor members of parliament to put the case, so he has recruited a Western Australian, an honourable member from Perth, to look after the interests of Queensland. Of course, this honourable member makes occasional visits to the Queensland beaches, like the Prime Minister and some other Ministers, but he holds a marginal seat in Perth. It is hard to believe that he will put the interests of Queensland ahead of his own State whenever a contract is to be awarded or a decision to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor treats Queensland with contempt. The Queensland members should stand up and be counted rather than meekly support the Prime Minister in any leadership challenge. On the last such occasion their reward for taking care of the Prime Minister, for being loyal, was to get nothing. Disloyal Ministers remain in office while loyal Queensland members are given no opportunity. After the next election there will be few Queensland ALP members left to be chosen as shadow Ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second anniversary of the establishment of the Parliamentary Education Office has passed. I place on record members' appreciation of the work of the dedicated and talented people who are achieving such wonderful results in that office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Schools are urged to visit their national Parliament and take part in the full range of programs which have been developed for visitors. First, and most important from a member's point of view, we have the larger public and soundproof galleries, which optimise both access and learning opportunities for students when the House is in session. Second, the Parliamentary Guide Service assists schools by explaining the workings of Parliament and conducting tours of this magnificent building, explaining the finer points of its artistic and architectural features. </PARA>
<PARA> However, perhaps the most exciting innovation for the Parliament has been the decision by the Presiding Officers to establish and fund an Education Office to assist members in their efforts to bring the Parliament closer to the thousands of young Australians who visit Canberra each year. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had the pleasure of observing participants in the Education Centre's mini-parliament Question Time, and I left the program feeling that we as upholders of parliamentary democracy in this nation should continue to support and enhance the Parliamentary Education Office in all possible ways. The students, under the guidance of a parliamentary education officer, in the program which I witnessed took on the many roles that this chamber has and proceeded to debate the issues which concern government and opposition alike. I understand that committee hearings and debates on Bills also take place in the Education Centre. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, the briefing before the role-play gave students an accurate and informative idea of how the process of representation works. This was done by means of the `Parliament Stack' computer display, which is an outstanding achievement by any standard. The debriefing component of the session highlighted the key points relating to the Question Time as the focal point of any parliamentary sitting day. I understand that almost 30,000 students each year are able to take part in the Parliamentary Education Office programs, which are conducted in committee room 1S1. </PARA>
<PARA> You, Mr Speaker, and the President of the Senate, Senator Sibraa, have supported the office and the vital role that it is playing in enhancing the knowledge of future generations of citizens from whom our parliamentarians and civic leaders will be elected. It is important that all citizens, including primary and high school students, learn as much as possible about our constitutional heritage, the great Australians who have shaped our political and social history, the process of law-making and how Parliament is the `clearing house' for ideas and issues relating to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> We are nearing the centenary of our Federation and it is paramount that this Parliament continue its work in getting across the message that parliamentary government is a system which deserves the continuing loyalty of all Australians and their elected representatives. It can do this only if it maintains the proactive stance which our Presiding Officers have established in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate all members of the Parliamentary Education Office staff and I exhort them to keep up the good work. I pay particular tribute to Richard Gilbert, John Carter, David Arnold, Peter McMahon, Di Weddell, Janice Hourigan, Marie Ferris, Sue Frost, Therese Rogers, Ros Lilburn, Jenny Nyman, Sue Irvine and Cathy McLean. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Earlier today the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) asked me a question concerning the cost of the settlement of the industrial dispute in the Parliamentary Catering Service. He further asked if that sum would be allocated from the existing vote to Parliament or from Supplementary Estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can now provide the right honourable member and the House with the following information: a meeting of the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union this afternoon accepted the settlement proposal and the Trades and Labor Council has lifted the picket. The basis of the settlement was that former employees of the Parliamentary Catering Service can either retain their redundancy payment or choose income maintenance in accordance with the guidelines for redeployment and redundancy in the Australian Public Service. If the former employees choose income maintenance, they must repay the severance element of their redundancy payment.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the agreement, former Parliamentary Catering Service employees have until 20 September to decide whether they wish to retain their redundancy payment or take income maintenance. Consequently, it will not be known how many people wish to take up the offer of income maintenance until 20 September. However, I believe that sufficient funds will be available within the sum allocated by the Department of Finance to run the Parliamentary Catering Service this financial year to cover this one-off payment. I table a copy of the agreement.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="262" SPEAKER="Kerin The Hon J.C." NAMEID="QH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CORIO" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1), (2) and (5) Comments by the Victorian Treasurer are a matter for him.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) The answer to this question should be seen in the context of the responsibilities of the Reserve Bank for the main groups of financial intermediaries. In terms of the Banking Act 1959, the Reserve Bank is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks authorised under that Act. The Act does not apply to state banks or to non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFI's) such as building societies or merchant banks. However, all State banks have undertaken to comply voluntarily with the Reserve Bank's prudential requirements which apply to Banking Act banks.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the case of the State Bank of Victoria (SBV), the voluntary arrangements agreed between that bank and the Reserve Bank were replaced during 1990, at the Victorian Government's initiative, by a formal understanding between the Victorian Government and the Reserve Bank on future supervision of the SBV. (These arrangements lapsed when SBV was acquired by the Commonwealth Bank.)</PARA>
<PARA>  The Reserve Bank is not involved in on-site inspections of banks but monitors prudential matters relating to banks and encourages sound prudential practices. It does this through the collection and analysis of statistics, regular consultations with banks' management and arrangements with external auditors of banks. In recent years some supervisory requirements have been extended to comprehend the operation of banks' subsidiaries as well as banks themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>  Given the Reserve Bank's general role in maintaining a stable and efficient financial system, it takes a close interest in developments affecting non-banks. In broad terms, if an NBFI gets into difficulty, the Reserve Bank has a twofold role:</PARA>
<PARA>    To assess possible implications of that intermediary's difficulties for the stability of the wider financial system and, if necessary, to consider steps to deal with any threats to that stability;</PARA>
<PARA>    To ensure that bankers to NBFIs are aware of the Reserve Bank's policy that banks should be sympathetic to reasonable requests for liquidity support from NBFI's which they judge to be viable and well managed, and that the Reserve Bank would assist banks should their own liquidity come under strain in providing assistance to an NBFI.</PARA>
<PARA>  Turning to the particular financial institutions mentioned:</PARA>
<PARA>  Farrow Group of Building Societies</PARA>
<PARA>  I am informed that when the difficulties of the Farrow Group of building societies emerged in the first half of 1990 the Bank, consistent with its broad role as described above, acted to:</PARA>
<PARA>    Authorise a reference to the Bank's understanding with other banks on liquidity support in the press release by the Victorian Treasurer and Attorney-General on 13 February 1990;</PARA>
<PARA>    Initiate regular discussions on developments with the Victorian Registrar of Co-operative Societies, who is the supervisor of building societies in that State;</PARA>
<PARA>    Discuss developments with Mr Farrow and other members of management of the Farrow group;</PARA>
<PARA>    Liaise with senior management of other building societies, as well as with representatives of the building society industry;</PARA>
<PARA>    Confirm with banks their understanding of the Reserve Bank's policy on liquidity support for NBFI's; and</PARA>
<PARA>    Issue on 2 July 1990 a press release noting that it had been involved in discussions leading to the support package arranged by the Victorian Government for non-Farrow building societies, and stating its assessment that the problems of the Farrow group were not shared by the other societies in Victoria, or in other states.</PARA>
<PARA>  Tricontinental/SBV</PARA>
<PARA>  In recent years, in its consultations with SBV, the Reserve Bank had sought to test the appropriateness of that bank's strategy, including the fast rate of growth of Tricontinental and of the group as a whole. It pressed SBV to comply on a group basis with the capital adequacy standard which was introduced in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA>  To help stabilise the situation when problems began to emerge during 1989, the Bank accepted the provision by SBV of substantial liquidity support to Trico and, subsequently, its guaranteeing of Trico's liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bank also took a series of steps to ensure that the interests of SBV's depositors were protected. These steps included advice to the Victorian Government and the bank aimed at maintaining minimum capital requirements, and close monitoring of SBV's liquidity position. It consulted closely with State Government officials and the management of SBV regarding the support arrangements implemented by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) I do not wish to comment specifically on the causes of collapse of the Farrow building societies and Tricontinental, which are the subject of ongoing investigations in Victoria. Nor do I wish to pre-empt possible findings of the current Parliamentary inquiry into the banking industry and deregulation. I can, however, make some general comments.</PARA>
<PARA>  The major thrusts of financial deregulation were to remove direct controls on the operations of banks, to relax restrictions on entry into the Australian financial system, and to open up foreign exchange markets. These measures saw a substantial increase in the numbers of banks and non-bank intermediaries operating in Australia and, in turn, led to increased competition. In this competitive environment, combined with rapid growth in demand for credit for a variety of purposes, including asset speculation, there was some erosion both of credit assessment standards and management practices by lenders. These factors impacted on some financial institutions more than others.</PARA>
<PARA>  Prudential supervision for many groups of financial institutions has been upgraded in recent years in response to problems that have emerged or appeared in prospect. However, prudential supervision, no matter how good, cannot give absolute assurance that individual institutions will be problem free.</PARA>
<PARA>  Ultimately, the continuing viability of financial institutions depends on the competence and integrity of their managements. While deregulation has highlighted this necessity (particularly in regard to management of credit risks), that process as such cannot be held responsible for the worst problems experienced by some financial institutions in the past year or so.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) The Hon. E.G. Whitlam's comments are a matter for him.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) Part IV of the Financial Corporations Act 1974 has not been proclaimed. As I said in my answer on 11 March 1991 to Question No. 143 also asked by Mr Scholes, Part IV was seen as providing reserve powers over financial corporations to be used if necessary for monetary policy, rather than prudential supervision, purposes. The powers were broadly equivalent to those that applied to banks covered under the Banking Act. Monetary policy no longer relies on the Banking Act provisions but is exercised through open market operations. Recourse to Part IV is not, therefore, relevant.</PARA>
<PARA>  Part IV powers, even if invoked, would not be an adequate basis for prudential supervision of non- bank financial intermediaries. The Part does not contain provisions relating to the financial stability of corporations, or to the protection of depositors; nor does it contain requirements directed at the financial soundness or prudent operations of financial corporations.</PARA>

<PARA>  (b) 1.5 per cent and 1.1 per cent of adult cases and death respectively.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) The numbers and proportion of AIDS cases and deaths arising from injecting drug use and heterosexual contact in Australia remain low. However, AIDS represents the end stage of HIV infection: the average time between initial infection and diagnosis of AIDS is around ten years.</PARA>
<PARA>  There is evidence that HIV infection among heterosexuals and injecting drug users is rising in Australia. Heterosexuals who were not injecting drug users comprised 6.5 per cent of new adult HIV diagnoses in Australia (excluding NSW for which no data were available) in the last six months of 1990. Heterosexual injecting drug users comprised 3.1 per cent of the total for that period. The experience from other Western countries shows that HIV can spread rapidly among these groups. Australia is almost unique in having avoided this spread to date.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Preventive education will continue to target those groups for which there is clear evidence that HIV infection can pose a significant threat. This includes injecting drug users and sexually active young people who are not always readily distinguishable and are spread throughout the population. HIV/AIDS is a communicable disease for which there is no vaccine or cure and where there are often no observable symptoms for many years. There is a responsibility for health authorities to provide clear education messages about modes of transmission and the means of prevention to all Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) I am aware of Mr Hill's letter of 26 March 1991 to all Members of Parliament. The ABC has advised me that this letter was in response to queries from parliamentarians and viewers about the procedures adopted by the ABC during the current trial period of televising from the House of Representatives. The ABC has advised that the letter sought to fully inform members of those procedures and, in so doing, clarify any misunderstandings which may have existed. The ABC considers that in covering proceedings from both chambers of Parliament, the ABC observes the broadcasting guidelines prescribed by both the House and the Senate. For this purpose it maintains regular contact with the appropriate officers of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) I am aware of claims that the ABC's news department enhanced a recording of Question Time on 6 March 1991. The ABC considers that careful examination of the item in question, including comparison with Hansard and the official tape, shows that there was no `enhancement' of the recording. Nor was there any departure from the House guidelines governing such excerpting. The three excerpts from the Member for Bennelong's speech used in the ABC news report were not in chronological order. However, the ABC considers that this does not constitute `enhancement' nor was it in breach of the televising guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Yes. The ABC's coverage of Question Time on 6 March 1991 represents a proper exercise of the ABC's right to make its own decision on its coverage of proceedings in the House, subject to compliance with the conditions laid down from time to time by the House. A recording of the ABC's coverage of Question Time in the House on 6 March 1991 was broadcast late that night. The ABC has advised that that replay had been edited in accordance with House guidelines after consultation with officers of the Parliament.

For example, automotive LPG can vary from around 20 cents per litre in Melbourne, to nearer 40 cents per litre in coastal Queensland towns.</PARA>
<PARA>  Australia exports about one third of its LPG production, with Japan our major market. The prices which Australian producers receive are consistent with world traded prices.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Prices are higher in Japan because of the high costs of shipping, internal transport and distribution, and taxes on LPG use. There are no taxes on LPG use in Australia, except for a small State tax in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA>  The benefits of the Australian Government's LPG policies have been reflected in low prices and seen LPG demand in all its uses in Australia grow by an annual average of 12 per cent in recent years. The most recent Government LPG policy initiative has been the deregulation of LPG markets from 1 January 1991. This has sent the right signals to industry so that the necessary infrastructure is set in place to ensure supply, and to encourage further LPG production in association with crude oil and natural gas resource developments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) With the incorporation in the Department of responsibility for technology in 1985, it was realised that the complex issue of Australia's technological development required detailed research to provide the information with which to develop sensible policy options. This expertise was not available in-house, was largely undeveloped in the academic community, and virtually nonexistent in the private sector. It was decided that a critical mass of researchers was needed and the Centre for Technology and Social Change (TASC) was the only sizeable group with appropriate expertise.</PARA>
<PARA>  DITAC entered into a general consultancy for three years to carry out a series of research projects. The aim was to provide security of funding to facilitate the expansion of TASC to enable the Centre to develop further expertise in areas vital to policy development and to carry out studies of significant science and technology policy issues for DITAC.  A steering committee of Departmental officers and TASC researchers was established to oversee the consultancy and a senior Departmental officer was placed on the TASC Board. In 1990 the steering committee was disbanded.</PARA>
<PARA>  In 1990, four consulting contracts to be carried out over a two year period were awarded to TASC on the understanding that all future work would be on the basis of a competitive tendering process.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Department has had an additional five contracts for purposes other than the production of reports with the University of Wollongong over the period in question. These contracts were let for running symposia, courses and workshops.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) and (3)</PARA>
<PARA>1989</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) From July 1975 to June 1990 CSIRO filed in Australia 1,290 patent application accompanied by a provisional specification. Statistics are not maintained on non-patentable ideas conceived by CSIRO officers. Centralised computer records of agreements entered into by CSIRO were not kept until 1984. An examination of current agreement file records (which date back to 1984 and include agreements entered into earlier than that date which were current in 1984) has shown the following breakdown:</PARA>
<PARA>  (i) agreements with overseas or foreign owned companies (186);</PARA>

<PARA>  Comprehensive data are not available on the benefits to Australia of CSIRO innovations. However, studies which have been done [including a major study of the output of the CSIRO Division of Entomology by the (then) Industries Assistance Commission] have confirmed that these benefits significantly outweigh costs.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) and (4) CSIRO has a statutory function to carry out scientific research in support of a wide range of areas of Australian national interest, including assistance to Australian industry. In carrying out the latter role, CSIRO aims to produce research results which will be relevant to industry. The Organisation has a widely publicised priorities exercise designed to ensure early dialogue between scientists and companies to ensure more efficient transfer of technology to Australian industry. CSIRO assesses its portfolio of research projects against a range of criteria related to potential national benefits, costs, technical achievability and (where relevant) likely market interest. In assessing potential market viability CSIRO is strongly guided by the market itself. Commercial-in-confidence discussions are usually held after a call for expressions of interest from the market in Australia. CSIRO's policy is to involve commercial collaborators at the earliest possible stage - ie before major investments have been made in the particular technologies. A failure to attract market interest is not necessarily seen as an adverse judgement on the technology itself; quite often similar technologies are being vigorously pursued overseas. The judgement may reflect market factors peculiar to the circumstances of Australian firms in the relevant industry individually or collectively. In the main, therefore, CSIRO tailors its industrially oriented research to the needs and capacities of Australian industry, and most of the Organisation's important output in this area is either being used already by industry or is the subject of collaboration or negotiation with industry with a view to finding mutually satisfactory ways of developing and applying the relevant technologies for the benefit of Australia, especially by promoting exports. Gene Shears is a recent example of a development which does not fit this model exactly; it is of such global significance that it required participation by world-leaders in the relevant industries to ensure its proper commercial development. At the request of the CSIRO Board, CSIRO is at present identifying and delineating six projects not already committed to commercial collaborators which appear to have major commercial potential. The results of this exercise are expected to be available in August 1991.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) (a) The National Teaching Company Scheme provides financial support for company based projects and as such the grant is awarded to the company, although the Associate employed under the Scheme may be administratively employed by either the company or institution. If the company chooses to be the employer, the Scheme pays the company over a maximum two years, $6,000 towards administrative costs of employing the Associate, $34,000 towards the Associate's salary and pays $10,000 to the participating institution department for the provision of academic support and equipment.</PARA>
<PARA>  Should the company and institution agree that it would be more convenient for the institution to be the employer of the Associate, the Scheme pays the institution, on behalf of the company, the administrative and salary component of the grant as well as the academic support costs. In either case the company pays the balance of the graduate's salary, salary on-costs, project expenses and travel costs associated with the Associate's attendance at the Annual Conference of Teaching Company Associates.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) The National Teaching Company Scheme is supporting projects where companies are collaborating with the majority of Australia's public sector research institutions. A list of companies and participating institutions is available for the honourable member's information.</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) The Scheme has provided support to 212 projects involving some 200 companies. The list available will provide the honourable member with the names of the companies.</PARA>
<PARA>  (d) (i) This information is not available as it is provided to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce under a `Commercial-in-Confidence' classification.</PARA>
<PARA>  (ii) The object of all projects supported under the Scheme is to facilitate the growth and international competitiveness of Australian companies by providing support to projects designed to improve company performance. It is not possible however, to provide details of the objective of each project because this information has `Commercial-in-Confidence' status.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) (a) All Australian companies and firms (incorporated or not), public trading trusts and overseas owned companies incorporated in Australia are eligible to apply for support under the Scheme. Officers of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce visit all applicant companies/institutions to assess project applications against established criteria. Applications and assessments are then considered against the selection criteria by an independent committee comprising members from industry, academe and officers of the Department.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) A viable project supported under the Scheme is one that meets all the selection criteria and which the Department/Committee considers, on the basis of relative merit, will be of significant benefit to the company and the economy of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Under the terms of the National Teaching Company Scheme agreement between the Commonwealth, company and institution, the parties are required to submit quarterly financial and project progress reports to the Department. During the course of each project, officers of the Department make regular visits or contact with the participating companies and institutions. At the conclusion of each project the Department also conducts a final assessment to determine the outcome of the project against both the Scheme's and project's stated objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>  Additionally, the Scheme is subject to external review. The Bureau of Industry Economics released a report on the Scheme on 2 June 1991.

<PARA>  (f) Promotion of Australia's industrial, scientific and technological achievements and capabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Counsellors are encouraged to exercise their initiative in developing their role in their host country's IS&amp; communities. As a result the resources allocated to these duties will vary over time and between posts. In the case of France the Paris Counsellor is required to devote a considerable amount of time to Australia's participation in the ongoing work of the OECD, particularly the Industry Committee and the Committee for Scientific and Technological Policy, as well as pursuing bilateral work with the French Government.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) The Australian Industry, Science and Technology Counsellor Network (ASTCON) was established in 1985 as a program of the then Department of Science and was incorporated into the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce when those Departments were amalgamated in 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) The estimated operational cost in 1990-91, in terms of direct administrative expenses, salaries and allowances paid to the Counsellors is $802,000.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) The estimated cost, since amalgamation of the Science and Industry, Technology and Commerce Departments in 1987, including 1990-91 - based on administrative expenses, salaries and allowances - is $2,938,000.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) Evaluation of the Department's overseas representation is an ongoing process. The mission statement of the Counsellors was reviewed in 1990 to ensure that it remained consistent with the Government's objective to internationalise Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) In addition to the support provided to the Portfolio and the wider S&amp; community in Australia (see response to Question (l) above), concrete results from the work of IS&amp; Counsellors during the past twelve months include the following:</PARA>
<PARA>  (a) Meetings arranged by our Counsellor (IS&amp;), Paris, with the French Government resulted in the successful French/Australian Science Colloquium held in April 1991 in Australia which covered marine science, astronomy, informatics and telecommunications, and environment and Antarctica.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Counsellor assisted in negotiations leading to my predecessor signing with his French counterpart M Curien, two new arrangements to facilitate bilateral collaboration under our S&amp; Agreement with France. One of these established the French- Australian Industrial Research (FAIR) program; the other will provide a conduit to link research and commercial developments in marine sciences.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Counsellor has also been active in OECD work, resulting inter alia in her election as chairperson of the Experts Group on Subsidies and Structural Adjustment, the General Working Party of the Industry Committee, and the Information Services and Invisible Transfers working groups.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) Following the meeting in Bonn between my predecessor and the German Minister for Research and Technology, Dr Riesenhuber, general agreement on the need to raise the level of R&amp; interaction between the two countries was reached. Our Counsellor (IS&amp;), Bonn, has been closely involved in developing specific opportunities for collaboration in the areas of new materials, advanced manufacturing technologies, and environmental technologies. The work has involved coordinating interactions between DITAC and the German Ministry for Research and Technology (BMFT).</PARA>
<PARA>  In addition the Counsellor has arranged a formal Agreement between the University of NSW and the University of Bonn that involves exchange of post- graduate students and academic researchers. She has also played a major role in the successful conclusion of an Agreement between the Australian Research Council and the Humboldt Foundation. The Counsellor has also facilitated several joint research projects between Australian academic institutions and research bodies in Germany.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Counsellor played an important role in the successful Joint Workshop on Software Engineering organised by the Australian Software Foundation and the German National Research Centre for Computer Science held in January 1991 in Australia. She has also facilitated the visits to Australia of several leading German officials.</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) Our Counsellor (IS&amp;), London, provided support for discussions in Italy and Spain and for the Commonwealth Science Ministers Meeting in Malta in November 1990. He also arranged Minister Beddall's visit to the UK in February 1991, provided necessary briefing and accompanied the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Counsellor has been involved in both the negotiation and development of activities under the recently signed Education and Science Agreement between Australia and the UK.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Counsellor has participated in investment/offset activities, the major one being involvement in preparation for the UK/Australia Trade and Investment conference, including management of the preparation of the consultancy report used as the basis for the talks.</PARA>
<PARA>  Because of the relationship and similarities between Australia and the UK, combined with a strong S&amp; policy research base in the UK, a key activity for the Counsellor is monitoring and reporting relevant IS&amp; developments. He also monitors these developments in Ireland and the Netherlands.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Counsellor has also been involved in developing activities under the Netherlands/Australia Technology and Industrial Cooperation Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>  (d) Our IS&amp; Officer in Brussels, has carried out valuable work in support of ongoing negotiations for a S&amp; agreement with the EC. When the Agreement is finally negotiated, Australia should be the first non-EC member and non-EFTA country to access the Community's research and development programs.</PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, the IS&amp; Officer has provided essential support for the officials and ministerial bilateral consultations held respectively in March and May 1991 with the Commission of the European Community (CEC). She also played a key role in negotiations with the CEC regarding Australia's participation in the EC Business Cooperation Network (BC-NET). This is a major EC initiative to foster strategic alliances between small and medium sized businesses in EC member countries.</PARA>
<PARA>  (e) The Counsellor (IS&amp;), Washington, was closely involved in facilitating closer links with Canada's Toronto-based Centres of Excellence. Follow-up work has included identification of specific areas of potential collaboration which he matched with Australian institutes. Direct outcomes from these activities include contact by Australian researchers with the Canadian centres, and proposals by Australian researchers to travel to specific Canadian centres to discuss further possible collaboration.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Counsellor also provided extensive and essential key liaison with the Office of Congressman Robert Roe, then Chairperson of the US House of Representatives Science, Space and Technology Committee, during the organisation of Congressman Roe's successful fact finding visit to Australia in November 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>  Over the last twelve months the Counsellor has provided input of both a significant and timely nature on the US position on the Intelligent Manufacturing System (IMS) project. The IMS is a major international collaborative research project in advanced manufacturing technologies, with potentially important benefits for the future of Australian manufacturing industry. The intelligence provided by the Counsellor was an important factor in consideration of the nature of Australia's involvement in the project.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Washington Counsellor, like the other Counsellors, has provided a wide range of reports on various industry, science and technology issues and trends in his host country. The reports have covered issues such as how the host country sets science and technology funding priorities, regulation of transgenic manipulations and small business programs. These reports are important inputs into policy and program development processes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (f) The Counsellor (IS&amp;), Tokyo, has undertaken a wide variety of liaison activities with Government Ministries and organisations in relation to bilateral interaction under the S&amp; Agreement and broader aspects of industrial cooperation including liaison on specific proposals for S&amp; and industrial cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA>  He was involved in discussions leading to an agreement in September 1990 to increase the emphasis in S&amp; Cooperation on applied research.</PARA>
<PARA>  This position has also provided an important link during the development of Australia's position on Japanese initiated multilateral S&amp; programs such as the Intelligent Manufacturing System and the Human Frontier Science Program. The Counsellor also provides information on Japan's national R&amp; programs, in which foreign companies and research bodies are invited to participate.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Counsellor is actively participating in the development of the MOUs covering Australia's participation at the Photon Factory (at Tsukuba) and marine biotechnology cooperation. Both of these agreements are expected to result in commercial benefits in the longer term. He has also been involved in commercial negotiations (eg for ANSTO in respect of silicon irradiation contracts).</PARA>
<PARA>  The coordination of science research exchanges, and the organisation of research missions to Japan such as the Optical and Opto Electronic Materials and Joining and Casting Missions also form an important component of the Counsellor's activities.</PARA>
<PARA>  (8) (a) The geographical locations of the ASTCON Counsellor posts represent the major centres of international, industrial, scientific and technological influence, thus affording Counsellors the best opportunity to forge links which facilitate the internationalisation of Australian industry. However, the location of ASTCON posts is constantly under review. Only last year a part-time IS&amp; Officer was appointed to Brussels to monitor on a day to day basis, significant developments in industry, science and technology in the EC, as well as to report on Benelux.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) The Network has Counsellors, Industry, Science and Technology (IS&amp;) located in Washington, London, Paris, Bonn and Tokyo. They all enjoy full diplomatic accreditation to the Governments of their host countries. The Department's representative in Paris is also accredited to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), while the London position is also accredited to the Commission for the European Communities in Brussels. The Department's IS&amp; Officer at the Australian Embassy in Brussels coordinates her work with the Counsellor in London but has no diplomatic accreditation.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="277" SPEAKER="Free The Hon R.V." NAMEID="HG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GIPPSLAND">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HG4">Mr Free</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Firstly, in responding to the various parts of this question I must emphasise that the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce is not involved in calling tenders for the Cape York spaceport project.  They are, however, interested in receiving assurance that the funds and other resources required to move the project forward are available within industry, and have sought registrations of interest from commercial organisations who believe they could satisfy this requirement.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Space Office has contracted AIDC Ltd to review and confirm the commercial viability of the spaceport project. AIDC Ltd will then prepare an investment package and conduct negotiations with commercial and industrial interests to establish a proponent.</PARA>
<PARA>  The activity of AIDC Ltd is therefore not a matter of calling tenders but one of vetting and accepting proof of the credentials of those who wish to be the spaceport proponent. Since the spaceport is not a government project, the final composition of any spaceport consortium will remain a matter for private commercial interests to resolve.</PARA>
<PARA>  As noted in Senator Button's Press Release of 19 February, the purpose of the AIDC Ltd activity is to determine if there is a single substantial Australian proponent with access to the financial, technical and management resources which will be necessary to complete the next phase of the spaceport's development and with whom the Government can proceed with confidence.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) The 23 companies (both local and overseas) which registered interest with the Space Office did so on a commercially confidential basis. It would therefore be inappropriate to release their names without their consent. It should be noted however that it is open to any of these 23 companies to approach any of the other companies which have made public their interest and intentions regarding the development of a spaceport.</PARA>
<PARA>  No evaluation has been made at this stage of these companies' commercial and technical competence to undertake the project. AIDC Ltd has held preliminary discussions with the majority of registrants in order to establish the level of their interest.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) As advised earlier in this reply, neither AIDC Ltd nor anyone else has been involved in calling tenders.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) To the best of the Government's knowledge CYSA has not withdrawn from the project and Essington is understood to be still seeking equity partners with the objective of satisfying the Government's requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) Except for China, there are no other commercial spaceports in the region. China might or might not benefit from lack of competition.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) There have been reports in the press and elsewhere that Hawaii, Indonesia or Kiribati might be the site for a spaceport. Hawaii is known to have the matter under active consideration. There has been no official confirmation that any of these are to go ahead. The Japanese have not decided whether to start up a commercial launch service from their spaceport at Tanegashima.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) (a) No.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) (b) No, but the Space Board has received verbal briefing by the Australian Space Office on the findings of Cape York Space Agency (CYSA) commercial viability studies. This information is propriety to CYSA.</PARA>
<PARA>  (8) There has been ongoing interaction between the CSIRO's Office of Space Science and Applications and the Space Board with:</PARA>
<PARA>    Representation by CSIRO at meetings of the Space Board through the Director of CSIRO Office of Space Science and Applications, and</PARA>
<PARA>    Cooperation between the Space Board (through the Space Office) and the CSIRO's Office of Space Science and Applications in many areas including major projects such as:</PARA>
<PARA>      The Atmospheric Pressure Sensor (APS) - a passive remote sensing instrument being developed to measure atmospheric pressure at the earth's surface from a satellite platform, and</PARA>
<PARA>      The Tasmanian Earth Resources Satellite Station (TRESS) - a satellite receiving station capable of receiving down-linked remotely sensed data in X and S frequency bands from both current and planned earth resources satellites.</PARA>

In March 1989, provision of yellow fever vaccination services for members of the general public was delegated to State governments as a staff saving measure and to facilitate public access.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Commonwealth retained the right to provide a yellow fever vaccination service, together with a full range of other vaccination services. In 1989, it limited the provision of vaccination services to government employees and other officials. Because of a continued demand for the Australian Government Health Service (AGHS) vaccination and health advisory services, combined with the transfer of AGHS operations to a cost recovery mode from 1 July 1990, AGHS again opened its vaccination service to the general public on a user pays basis.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) It is not expected that private practitioners will be affected significantly by the reintroduction of AGHS public vaccination services. AGHS does not seek a monopoly in the market and the cost of its services to the individual higher than those of private practitioners.</PARA>

<PARA>  (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) (a) Yes. (b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) No. Planning responsibility for the establishment of service centres is a matter for the States and there is no obligation for the State to provide this information to the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) Yes. In the case of the Glenrowan service centre, land worth $30,000 which was acquired with Commonwealth funding for construction of the Hume Highway, and which was subsequently surplus to requirements, has been provided for the service centre site.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) No. There is no obligation on the State to provide such information to the Federal Government. Planning responsibility for the project is primarily a State matter.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) No. There is no obligation on the State to provide such information to the Federal Government. Planning responsibility for the project is primarily a State matter. It is understood however that the service centre is to be sited some five metres above the flood plain.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) Yes. The Administrative Procedures under the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 require that any rentals to be paid for the leasing of the land sites purchased with Federal funds should be credited to the State Road Authorities for expenditure on the construction and maintenance of the National Highway.</PARA>
<PARA>  (8) Yes. Although service centres as such were not envisaged at the time of the second reading speech for the National Roads Bill in 1974, the principles of improving road safety on the National Highway were paramount.</PARA>
<PARA>  Implementing the development of service centres, rest areas and truck parking bays on the National Highway is in the interest of road safety to reduce driver fatigue by encouraging travellers to stop and rest frequently. The Federal Government has recently adopted a policy for the development of service centres along the National Highway. With regard to the establishment of the Glenrowan service centre, Victoria has complied with the Federal Government's guidelines for development of service centres.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr Bilney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (a) No. A key principle of the Force Structure Review was to maximise the combat capabilities of the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) No.</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) Section 33(1) of the Public Service Act requires that appointments to the Public Service be made on the basis of an assessment of the relative suitability of applicants having regard to the nature of the duties and the abilities, qualifications, experience, personal qualities and potential for development of each applicant that are relevant to the performance of those duties. Section 47A of the Public Service Act is a provision whereby a re- turned serviceperson is to be given preference when considered equal with another applicant following the normal merit selection process. It is not proposed to amend these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>  (d) Reductions in each Service will be achieved through a plan developed by the Chief of Staff. To provide the Chief of Staff with increased flexibility, some of the reductions may be achieved through redundancy measures. It is expected that redundancy measures will only be used when reduction in particular rank or skill categories are not being achieved through natural attrition. The overall numbers who may be given this option will be small. The redundancy procedures will recognise the need for consultation.</PARA>
<PARA>  (e) Decisions on the terms of advertisements for positions created in the `civilianisation' process, ie. for a civilian to replace a serviceperson who was carrying out an administrative support function, will be decided on a case by case basis. This process is largely distinct from new positions created as a consequence of the rationalisation and down sizing of the existing civilian structure in the States. In the latter case, it is doubtful that the key criteria warranting opening the field to applicants outside the Australian Public Service will apply, i.e expected difficulty in obtaining a good field from within the APS or a known shortage of suitable people in a particular area or category of employment.</PARA>
<PARA>  (f) Serving ADF personnel carrying out an administrative support function require military skills as well as those used in the administrative support function itself. In large part it is the additional requirement for creating and maintaining military skills which make it more expensive to use serving ADF members to perform these essentially civilian administrative support tasks. Hence, it is not the intention for civilian appointees to such positions to have a similar level of flexibility to ADF personnel. Training will, however, be provided as necessary to civilian appointees to enable them to carry out administrative support duties specific to their position.</PARA>

<PARA>  (1) Inspectors headquartered in towns where abattoirs no longer operate form part of the pool of inspectors who are utilised on relief duties for other officers on recreation, sick and long service leave and for backfill during training. To determine which abattoirs they have worked in and for what periods in each case would require my Department to examine all time sheets and rosters from each establishment since the day it was closed. I am not persuaded that it would serve the public interest to devote the large staff resources necessary to this task. However, I can inform the honourable member that they have worked in other abattoirs on a regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) AQIS considered how best these inspectors could be utilised with regard to the continuation of efficient and effective operational needs. Some inspectors remained in the locality to form part of the established pool of inspection staff who regularly provide relief duties for other staff on authorised leave or who are undertaking training. Other inspectors are reassigned to nearby locations: for example the five inspectors located in Orange have been assigned to work at the Blayney abattoir. Staff who were transferred to vacant inspection positions in other localities were offered relocation assistance as part of normal public service conditions of service.</PARA>

<PARA>  What is the annual (a) cost and (b) revenue generated by the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics' research vessel Rig Seismic.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="286" SPEAKER="Griffiths The Hon A.G." NAMEID="0H4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FARRER">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr Griffiths</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Research Vessel, Rig Seismic, is the vehicle for the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics' Continental Margins Program - the program of regional geological mapping and petroleum and mineral resource assessment covering the 12 million square kilometres of Australia's offshore jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Continental Margins Program is a key element in the Government's strategy to promote effective and efficient petroleum exploration around Australia. It does this by providing the geological base maps and concepts which allow industry to make informed assessments of exploration risk. Much of the activities of the program are aimed at increasing industry interest in so called `frontier' areas which are underexplored or unexplored. The program also generates the datasets (principally sediment thickness and bathymetric information) needed to support Australia's future claim to a `legal continental shelf' under the 1982 UN Convention on Law of the Sea.</PARA>
<PARA>  Rig Seismic is a 1545 tonnes displacement vessel built in Norway in 1982 and was chartered and fitted out in 1984 in Australia for geoscientific research by the Bureau. It is registered in Newcastle, New South Wales, and is operated for the Bureau by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The vessel is equipped with a modern seismic acquisition system, direct hydrocarbon detection capability, underway geophysical and echo sounding equipment and seabed rock and sediment sampling equipment.</PARA>
<PARA>  (a) Annual Cost</PARA>
<PARA>  Direct expenditure on the Continental Margins Program is expected to be $11.6 million in 1990- 91, of which $5.1 million is for the basic operation of the vessel, $3.4 million for operation and maintenance of shipboard scientific equipment, and $3.1 million for processing and analysis of data.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) Annual Revenue Generated</PARA>
<PARA>  Direct revenue from sales of geoscientific data and reports was $210,000 in 1989-90 and is anticipated to be $250,000 in 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA>  In terms of indirect revenue, the program contributes significantly to petroleum exploration and development which in turn generates very substantial revenues for the Commonwealth amounting to some $1,300 million in 1989-90.</PARA>
<PARA>  With the assistance of Government initiatives, such as the Continental Margins Program and a supportive taxation regime, the level of exploration offshore Australia is at an all time high. Analysis of the work program commitments of exploration companies in the period 1988-91 suggests that some $488 million of new petroleum exploration investment over that period has been dependent on or strongly linked to data, information and concepts generated by the Continental Margins Program.</PARA>
<PARA>  Investigations which are related to the definition of Australia's `legal continental shelf' and for future seabed boundary negotiations with adjacent countries account for expenditure of $3.0 million per year and do not generate revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>  External funding from industry for joint projects enables extension of the program and amounted to $250,000 in 1990-91. This is expected to increase substantially in 1991-92. The Bureau is also negotiating to contract out some unused capacity of the ship in 1991-92 which would generate additional revenue.</PARA>

<PARA>  (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Yes, sometimes referred to as the Mamba 2- seater so as to distinguish it from the proposed development of a 4-seater and 6-seater Mamba.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) This is a claim made by the company in respect of it being a utility aircraft. There are, however, a number of companies that can claim they produce 2-seater utility aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) Not that I am aware of.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) No. The prototype has a developmental Certificate of Airworthiness only. The production model has not been approved for certification by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) The company only used a Cessna undercarriage on the prototype to simplify cost and expedite the project. The company also used basic materials and equipment, e.g marine quality plywood, alloy steel tubing, a standard Lycoming engine and standard instrumentation.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) The company is seeking overseas investment into the company from Malaysia. If equity is obtained from Malaysia, manufacturing rights are expected to be licenced to the Malaysian investor. Mr Jess Smith of the company has stated that the reason he is seeking overseas investment is because he can not raise funds locally.</PARA>
<PARA>  At the time of approving a grant to the company, the Industry Research and Development Board required the company to enter into a detailed formal agreement which inter-alia, requires the company to seek the Board's permission to transfer the technology off-shore. The company has been reminded of this requirement but, as yet, the company has not sought the Board's permission.</PARA>
<PARA>  (8) The Board undertakes progress reviews and a final assessment of the project to determine the final outcome of the R&amp; and commercialisation results. The company is required to provide financial and technical reports during the lifetime of the project.</PARA>
<PARA>  (9) A prototype aircraft has been constructed and successfully tested. The first aircraft is now under production and will require certification by the CAA. The company has received 3 orders from the WA State Government and, upon certification of the aircraft, intends to manufacture locally with the help of sub-contractors.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) I can confirm that an incident took place involving an EastWest BaE 146 aircraft during an approach to Hamilton Island on 31 December 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>  (a) At the time the area was under the influence of a tropical cyclone, which had produced strong and gusty winds. The aircraft was approaching the island from the south-east, and the crew intended to carry out a right hand circuit for landing back towards the south-east. The aircraft broke out of the clouds in the vicinity of the aerodrome, but while manoeuvring for the landing heavy rain and low cloud was encountered, and the crew lost sight of the ground. A go around was carried out, in accordance with normal operating practices.</PARA>
<PARA>  As the go around was commenced, wind shear causing a loss of altitude was detected, and the Ground Proximity Warning System activated. The pilot applied additional engine power, adopted a higher climb altitude than normal to correct the situation, and subsequently completed an uneventful landing.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) No.</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) The incident was not reported to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI), which only became aware of the event a number of months later.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Air Navigation Regulations require that an incident involving an Australian civil aircraft is to be reported to BASI within 48 hours of the occurrence. This requirement applies equally to both the pilot in command and the operator of the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) BASI has access to flight data recorders for purposes of accident and incident investigation. This access is not available to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) No. Modern flight data recorders store information for the previous 25 hours of flight time. By the time this incident had come to the attention of BASI the aircraft had flown sufficient hours for the relevant information to have been over-written.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) (a) Both BASI and the CAA conducted independent investigations. These found that the crew had acted correctly under the circumstances of the incident. However, neither the crew nor the company complied with the requirements for prompt notification of the incident to BASI.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) Both BASI and the CAA have reminded the company and the crew of their obligations with respect to the reporting of incidents. The company has indicated that procedures have been put in place to prevent a repetition of this problem. No further action is considered to be necessary on this occasion.</PARA>

The Working Group's interim report has been circulated to other Government Departments and to industry for evaluation and comment.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) Three classes of pigmeat are presently allowed to be imported into Australia - canned pigmeat from many countries, uncooked pigmeat from the South Island of New Zealand and uncooked pigmeat from Canada. The canning process inactivates disease causing organisms and canned pigmeat is not considered a risk. PRRS has not been recognised in New Zealand and New Zealand product does not present a risk. PRRS or a disease similar to it is present in Canada but I am advised by AQIS that, on current information, the banning of uncooked pigmeat from Canada could not be justified on disease grounds. This is based on the fact that there is no evidence that the disease in Canada, is transmitted in pigmeat; the organisms believed by the Canadian officials to cause the disease are not carried in pigmeat; in fact no other country in the world has imposed restrictions on pigmeat due to concerns about this disease. AQIS met with industry organisations and other interested parties on 5 July and there was general consensus with AQIS' proposed course of action for pigmeat</PARA>
