<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House has before it the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill, which has the support of the Opposition. That is not surprising because, with respect to Antarctic policy, the Opposition has taken positions that have subsequently been followed by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The principal features of this Bill are that it prohibits mining activity by Australians anywhere in Antarctica and prohibits mining activity by non-Australians on Australian Antarctic territory. That is a step the Opposition believes is appropriate. Indeed, the Opposition's only question about the Bill is whether the penalties that have been prescribed are adequate. I do not intend to deal with that in my speech on the motion for the second reading, but I do ask the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons), who is no doubt sitting in for his Cabinet colleague the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly)-who is currently, I think, on Melbourne radio rather than in the chamber-whether he could pass on to her the fact that the Opposition wishes to raise in the committee stage of this Bill the issue of adequacy of penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, I think, penalties of up to $100,000 under this Bill. But we are dealing with the issue of mining, and if it did take place-there has even been talk of the possibility of subsidised mining activities in the Antarctic by people anxious to establish some position-the sort of penalty that is laid down might be regarded as a mere flea bite. When compared with penalties in the Trade Practices Act for other offences it is comparatively light. I would like the Government's considered view on the adequacy of penalties so that we can consider that view and perhaps look to moving amendments in the other House. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, the Opposition was the first in the field in Australia to oppose the signing of the minerals convention. I think most members of the House would be aware that within the Australian Labor Party there was strong support not for this approach but for the signing of the minerals convention. That support came from both the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, and from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans). </PARA>
<PARA> The Government took a position on this issue only after the Opposition announced in May 1989 its decision to oppose Australia's signature of the proposed Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities. We did that because that convention essentially was based on the premise that there could be mining in this fragile area and we did not believe that that was an appropriate course to follow. I do not intend to canvass in this debate all of the Opposition's reasons, but for those people who are interested in a more detailed explanation of the history of this matter and of the reasons why this no mining approach has been adopted, I commend a speech given by the Australian Ambassador for the Environment, Sir Ninian Stephen, on 24 October last year. That is reported in the Monthly Record and it sets out at some length the possible environmental consequences of mining activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the only criticism I would have of the ambassador's speech is that in the chronology of events he omits the Opposition's stance on this matter, which I am quite sure was very important in terms of the Government's own decision making. I notice that the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) laughs at that. He should know that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories was extremely grateful for the fact that on an issue like greenhouse gas emissions she was able to take into the Cabinet room the clear position which had been established by the Opposition and to use that in support of her argument that the Government should similarly adopt a position. If the honourable member opposite stops smiling and grinning and instead thinks about the tactics which have been followed by the Government with respect to the environment and its frequent use of this issue as a political football, he will understand that when the Opposition takes these positions it is in fact often instrumental in determining where the Government finishes up. </PARA>
<PARA> Again Government members opposite tend to make light of that comment. I can only commend to their attention the comments of Phillip Toyne, Mr Garrett and others who contrast their dealings with the Government before the last election to the treatment which they now see, and they are highly critical of the Government for its playing politics in this extremely important area rather than playing the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted to make the point that this is another area where the coalition came in first because I think that this debate, like most debates in this place and indeed outside on the environment, is in fact dictated from the Government side by a determination to continue to use this issue in the highly political way that it has in the past rather than to deal with the national interest. In fact, under this Government the environment has become a political football, and the deep cynicism about the approach of the Government among environmentalists whom I meet reflects that reality. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the deep cynicism which is also felt about the Government's approach by people in industry is well known, and that is a matter which the Government has been trying to deal with with respect to its resource security legislation. It is not this Opposition which has invented the resource security legislation; it is this Government which has had to do so. It has been no part of the Opposition's thinking that one needed to have a piece of legislation which would limit the Government's capacity to exercise its discretion, whether it is discretion with respect to exports or to the Heritage Act. The simple reality is that the Government, by its political manoeuvring, has created such an atmosphere of distrust that it is necessary for the Government to legislate in this area. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Mr CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, who is at the table, says, `What has this got to do with the Bill?'. It has a great deal to do with the Bill because if we are to succeed in the very many environmental objectives which we have for Australia and indeed for the world-we have to think at both levels-it is important that we establish a much better public understanding of the range of things which need to be done and of the issues than is possible if the debate is politicised in the way that it has been in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for a more careful debate is very clearly illustrated when we look at the person who sets the tone of the Government's contribution in these matters, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself. It is only a matter of a few days ago that the Prime Minister said in this House that at the next election there would be a clear choice between Labor, which is for development with protection of the environment or the conservatives, who would cut down every tree, dig up everything in the ground and dam every river. It is that sort of ridiculous exaggeration which forms part of the debate on any environment issue in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I again remind Government members that, just a few days ago when we were debating an environmental matter in this House, the Opposition was accused of saying nothing about the environment; of having no commitment to the environment; and indeed, to coin a phrase, of being made up of a group of vandals. I certainly wish to use the opportunity of this debate to put the record a little straighter than Government spokesmen would wish it to be, because I do not believe that all of the pious things that have been said about the environmental credentials of the Government sit very well with its deliberate distortion of the debate on the environment generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say that, just as the Opposition took a clear lead with respect to the protection of the Antarctic, which we regard as an international asset, an asset which is to a very substantial degree within Australian sovereignty under our claims, it takes very seriously the obligation to preserve that environment both for environmental and scientific purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> We took the view that the sorts of risks, which were so clearly outlined by Sir Ninian Stephen in the speech to which I referred, are risks that we should not be prepared to tolerate. The risk of environmental accidents, the risk of the whole environment in that area being severely disturbed by any oil spillage, and all the other risks which are essentially a part of carrying out mining activities in such a delicate, sensitive area, are risks to which we were not prepared to subject the area. This is an area of Opposition lead. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House of Representatives that that is not at all unusual. After all, it was the coalition which established the first Federal department with environmental responsibilities. It was the coalition which developed a national conservation strategy for Australia, which remains consistent with the broad approach that is claimed by this Government to be so unique. It was, of course, the Opposition in government which first made grants to voluntary conservation organisations. Some honourable members on my side of politics might well say that some of those voluntary conservation organisations have since rather abused their position in the public area by endorsing the Labor Party at the last election. However, I know that many people in the conservation movement regard that as a significant and sorry error on their part. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the Antarctic is concerned, the Antarctic Treaty legislation was a creature of the coalition Government. The Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 was passed by the coalition Government, as was the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act 1981. Nobody has suggested that those Acts are inadequate, although the addition of this `no mining' provision is something that was advocated firstly not by the Government, but by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the protection of other interests, it was the Opposition when in government which commissioned the Frost Inquiry into Whales and Whaling and brought in the Whale Protection Act 1980. That was a significant contribution to giving a lead to the whole world on the issue of whale protection. That was done by the Fraser Government under the very active involvement and leadership of the then Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser. It was the coalition which brought in the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act (No. 2) 1982, and passed the migratory birds ordinance of 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> We proclaimed the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. There are of course frequent scare campaigns that in some way the Opposition would be in favour of any action which might damage the Great Barrier Reef. I simply remind the House that it was in this House that the then Minister for Science, Mr David Thompson, made it quite clear that the Fraser Government would not tolerate mining or exploration on the Great Barrier Reef. It was the Fraser Government which moved to prevent sand mining on Fraser Island, and which proclaimed the Kakadu and Uluru National Parks, as well as the Christmas Island National Park. We also established marine nature reserves in the Coral Sea conformation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition introduced unleaded petrol, a very important environmental change. There was some resistance to it at the time, but I think it was probably the plight of the people of Sydney-the pollution of the Sydney atmosphere with lead fumes which was affecting people's health-which led the Commonwealth to move for a national change in that area. It was strongly resisted in States such as my own, Western Australia, where there is not a problem of overcrowding and there was not an immediate health problem. That was another area of strong government lead. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government brought in the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981, the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983, the States Grants (Air Quality Monitoring) Act 1976, and the Environment Protection Nuclear Codes Act 1978. These and all the other things which were done by the Fraser Government ensured that the uranium mining, which has continued under this Government, proceeded under a careful regime of protection which this Government has not seen any need to improve upon. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that this Government has restricted us to an absurd and illogical three-mine policy but the fact is that there has been no move by this Government to improve the very high standards which were laid down by the previous Government. I think it is also important to note in this area, where we are dealing with one of the world's great wilderness areas, an area of great scientific importance--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Mr CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an area which, as my colleague the Leader of the National Party says, is a very fragile environment. I know that he has visited the area and has been impressed by the need to maintain our policy of total protection of the Antarctic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I again put on the record the fact that previous coalition governments secured the World Heritage listing of the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu stage 1 and Willandra Lakes, and of course initiated proposals for the listing of the Lord Howe Island group and the western Tasmanian wilderness. All of these things were done not on the basis of a crude attempt to buy environmental votes under the umbrella of promoting conflict which would set Australians against Australians; what is interesting about the Opposition parties' approach to these matters when in government is that we achieved all these things without conflict with the relevant State governments and the relevant communities. I think that it is a very important earnest of our good faith in these issues that we have been able to carry the States and the other relevant authorities with us when dealing with these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other area that I wanted to refer to with respect to the excellent record of the Opposition is to remind the House that it was the coalition Government which commissioned major Federal environmental impact statements on Fraser Island, the Alligator Rivers--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Pearce might relate his remarks somewhat to the legislation before the House. It is a rather restricted Bill. The honourable member has ranged rather widely, and he might at least come back to the legislation before us.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I take note of your direction to me. I simply say in response that we are dealing with a Bill which has the strong support of the Opposition. I am making the point that the Government's position with respect to the Antarctic was adopted after the Opposition took a position on this in May 1989. I think it took the Government three weeks subsequently to clear up the differences which had been up to that point exercising the Government, with, as I said, both Senator Evans and Senator Richardson supporting the signing of the Antarctic minerals convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am then putting that in the context of the record of the Opposition, which is one of providing a lead to the Government on these major environmental issues. I am in part responding to the comments which have been made by a succession of Government spokesmen within the last week about the failure of the Opposition to address major environmental questions. I am putting in the context of this Bill, which reflects a Government response to an Opposition initiative, other areas of similar initiative. I am indeed responding to an invitation from the Minister to provide her with more guidance in these matters. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="Mr SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister might have asked the honourable member for Pearce for all sorts of advice but we are responding here to a Bill entitled `An Act to prohibit mining activities in the Australian Antarctic Territory and Antarctica, and for other related purposes'. We might just talk a little about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Mr CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. One of the features of this Bill which I think is worthy of consideration is the importance of Australia providing a lead in this area. In common with other areas of environmental concern, it is an area where Australian action has been quite influential in affecting the rest of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at the situation that Australia faced with respect to the regulation of Antarctic mineral resources activity, we find a situation where, if we go back to the relevant time of decision making, the convention was open for signature by prescribed parties from 25 November 1988 until 25 November 1989. Entry into force requires ratification by 16 Antarctic Treaty consultative parties, including Australia. By May 1989 only Australia and France had failed to signify their intention to sign the convention. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is quite an important fact, because what we had was a mood within the world for a quite different approach to the approach now being advocated by Australia. It was in fact Australia which, with France, provided the lead that has led to a whole new series of negotiations taking place, reflecting the policy position adopted by the Opposition in early May 1989 and followed by the Government three weeks or so later. I think, therefore, that this Bill is significant to the broader environmental debate, because it illustrates that, whilst Australia has only some 17 million of the world's five billion plus population, we are in a position to significantly affect and influence the debate and decision making on major environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who might be sceptical of Australia's capacity to do good on a worldwide scale in this area, or indeed other areas, might reflect not only on the fact that we appear to have successfully set a new lead with respect to the Antarctic but also on the fact that that shows the enthusiasm for Australian involvement in seeking a targeted reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. I put that forward as a parallel example of the capacity of Australia to influence international debate. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was in Germany during January of this year I found-I must say somewhat to my surprise-considerable enthusiasm for working with Australia in this area of activity: a strong belief that Australia was in a position to play an international role in obtaining worldwide adherence to the notion of a targeted reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. I reported that matter back to the Minister as soon as I returned, because I do not think that is a matter for partisan political game playing. That is a matter where, if Australia is to do something, I should not wait until after the next election to see some improvement. I reported to the Minister on the interest in Germany in obtaining Australia's active cooperation and in working with Germany on this important issue. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, I am delighted to mention that this is a second area where in fact leadership came from the Opposition, because it was in 1989 that we adopted the notion of targeted reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. That was put in a tighter form in the policy pronouncements we made in February 1990. It is a matter of record that it was only late last year that the Government brought itself to adopt a similar target. The honourable member for Brisbane shakes his head, sadly, but I hope that you, Mr Speaker, will not be unduly influenced by his sorrow on this occasion. As I indicated before, the reality is that the Minister was quite grateful and, indeed, in this House expressed her gratitude for being able to obtain support for the position she sought arising from the Opposition's commitment in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I contrast that very proper acknowledgment of the Opposition's position with the general tenor of the debate on environmental issues which is reflected in the accusation by the Prime Minister that we wish to cut down every tree, an accusation that sits rather oddly this week in light of some of the comments that have been made about the resource security legislation by environmental organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst there are very significant international issues of this sort, the Antarctic remains a very significant international issue with major contributions being made by a great range of countries and with outcomes of worldwide significance. After all, the whole attack on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and the ozone layer flows from the research work done in the Antarctic, on this occasion principally by British scientists who discovered the somewhat remarkable fact that the CFCs being released primarily in the Northern Hemisphere found their way eventually to the Southern Hemisphere and were responsible, or were very likely responsible, for a very significant reduction of the ozone layer. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a matter of direct relevance to every country in the world and is an example of the way environmental issues overlap. It is not possible to put all these things into a neat box and to say that one environmental issue is not relevant to another. Indeed, in the Australian context I think that is one of the reasons why we are not making adequate progress on important environmental issues. We continue to box our concerns about water quality, for example, into administrative arrangements that are too separate from the administrative arrangements with respect to soil quality. Yet to divorce the issues of soil conservation and soil improvement from the issue of water quality is to be highly artificial and to invite inefficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> In exactly the same way, we divorce our concerns about forests-a matter of very high profile this week-from the vital issues of soil conservation and water quality, when what is required is a totally integrated approach to those issues. The issues of plantations and of forestry in native forests have to be dealt with in a holistic and rational way and not through an approach that is based on trying to carve out another 1 1/2 per cent of the vote by exciting an interest group that might think one party is slightly greener than its neighbour. </PARA>
<PARA> The international issue of biodiversity has to be dealt with. It is no different from our concern about the Antarctic. There is not a narrow national interest; there is a total world interest in preserving the range of species, both animal and vegetable, that give the world its resilience. One of the great contributions of the Brundtland Commission report, Our Common Future, is to put in an understandable form why it is that biodiversity matters, why it is that if we want to go on feeding five billion people-very soon perhaps to be 10 billion people-we need to maintain access to the extraordinary range of life forms on the globe. That makes it a matter not of narrow national interest but of international interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, I simply say to the Government that it is time it looked to its laurels, looked at the proposals, for example, the Opposition put forward with respect to priority national parks, which have as their total priority the maintenance of the diversity of life. I ask that the Government look to that sort of approach and see whether it cannot improve what I think is the rather halting advance that is being made and make a proper Australian contribution both nationally and internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill reflects the importance of international cooperation. We have a situation where that international cooperation has been achieved and where Australia is showing leadership. I welcome the fact that once again the Government is following our lead in encouraging the same sort of cooperation with the States instead of the confrontationist approach that was a feature of its pre-election approach. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the international problem of tropical forests and I invite the Minister to stop fiddling around with this problem, a year after she has received an expert report on it, and to examine very carefully the lead provided by the Opposition. We take the view that there is a chance for us to contribute internationally in a way that will make a substantial difference to tropical rainforest operations in our region. Again that is a matter on which I have reported direct to the Minister. There is not much reflection of that in the comments she has made in this House, but I took up with the Minister the very positive views of the Indonesian Minister for population and environment on what could be done to improve standards of forestry and what Australian contribution could be made which would make a difference throughout the whole of the Association of South East Asian Nations region. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I simply say that the Opposition will continue to give leadership to the Government with respect to these issues. I am happy to go on making suggestions to the Minister. Let me close by saying this: if the Minister is to heed the words of both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson)-in other words, if she is to heed the bipartisan view that has been adopted that the great environmental challenge that faces Australia is not the Antarctic or forestry but is the vital issue of soil degradation and the accompanying issue of water quality-then I put her on notice that the Government will need a substantially increased effort, both intellectual and, I think, financial, in that area. </PARA>

At a time when we were generally seeking a reduction of government expenditure we said we would double expenditure in this area. That is our position and it is part of the continuing position of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response to the Minister's invitation that we should help to set the agenda for her, I now say to her publicly, as indeed I have said to her privately, that I do not believe that within Australia there is sufficient comprehension of the magnitude of the task that we have to undertake with respect to soil conservation. I confidently predict that within the next decade there will be a need for far greater effort if we are to do anything to reverse the position in the Murray-Darling area and, indeed, on most of our cleared lands. I give notice to the Government and, indeed, to the Minister that the Government needs to lift its game, not least in the light of the comments made by its own Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) with respect to the inadequacies of government administration in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House. I am pleased that the Government is following this course and I hope that in our debate on this Bill and other Bills we can spend more time on the content and the real problems that face us environmentally rather than on the political game playing which has been a feature of this debate in Australia for far too long. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have just witnessed this morning from the shadow Minister for the environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), is a rather pathetic and vain effort to colour the Opposition's record on the environment as being one which the environment movement and those concerned about green issues would approve. They, above all, know that the record of honourable members opposite has been abysmal in the field of protection of our environment and in many of those things that the honourable member for Pearce sought to set out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to the Leader of the National Party, who says that they are all supporting this Bill and that we should be nice, that my intention was to recognise the fact, which I will do later, that those opposite have supported from an early stage the preservation of the Antarctic as a nature reserve. I am quite happy to acknowledge that, and I commend them for it. But in his contribution this morning the shadow Minister barely touched on the Antarctic and sought to give honourable members opposite some credentials in this field which, quite frankly, they do not deserve. It is a sham and it is a fraud for honourable members opposite to stand here and claim in any way to have a record of protecting the environment. Their position on issues like the Gordon below Franklin and the logging of the north Queensland rainforests is one which the environment movement condemned and one which it remembers well. It is not one which will be washed away on the strength of the pathetic performance by the Opposition shadow Minister this morning, who sought to read into the record any and every piece of legislation that the Fraser Government enacted that had anything at all to do with the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The whole area of World Heritage listings and World Heritage legislation and the very fact that the Commonwealth should exert its constitutional authority over the States in these matters have been opposed by the Opposition at every opportunity. Honourable members opposite are still trying to come to grips with the States' rights argument which they have within their own party and within their branches around the country. So Opposition members should not come in here and try to tell the House and the people of Australia that they have a record of support for the environment and that they have now turned green. What nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA> But let us not look too far back; let us look at what has been going on today. This morning the Leader of the Opposition, the visiting Professor Hewson, made statements on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio telling us all that the pendulum has swung too far in favour of the green movement. That is what he said this morning on ABC radio, and he has said it time and time again in recent months. That is the sort of position that the Opposition spokesperson needs to respond to. It is no good the honourable member for Pearce coming in here as the Opposition spokesperson on the environment and putting forward his mythical credentials in these matters. Let us see the Leader of the Opposition hop up in this House and proclaim his endorsement of these environmental issues, and let us see him argue away the sorts of comments he made this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only did the Leader of the Opposition complain that the green movement has had too much power and that the pendulum has swung too far in its favour; he referred to areas where, in his view, we had not gone far enough. This morning he mentioned Coronation Hill. He should tell us what the Opposition's environment policy is on that issue and what it was in the second half of last year on logging of forests. At that time the Parliament was ringed by trucks of loggers and the honourable member for Pearce, as shadow spokesperson for the environment, stood up in this place and moved a motion of public importance condemning the Government for `locking up our forest industry'. </PARA>
<PARA> I well recall the contribution of the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) because he supported the honourable member for Pearce that afternoon in that debate by attacking the Government for trying to save our forests. But at least he had the political acumen that evening in the adjournment debate to stand up and read into the transcript a statement which would do the Australian Conservation Federation proud. At least he understood the political impact of his statements earlier that day. It is that duplicity that we saw last year on the Opposition's matter of public importance that we are witnessing again today. The honourable member for Pearce does not have the credentials in this field and his efforts today to acquire them will be scorned by all who have fought for many years to protect the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill we have before us today is an important piece of legislation. It is yet another piece of the jigsaw puzzle or part of the web of environmental legislation and decisions which this Government has set in place and supported and of which we can be justly proud. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal features of the Bill provide that mining activity by Australians in Antarctica will be prohibited. It also provides that mining activity in the Australian Antarctic Territory will be prohibited. It further provides that mining activity will in fact be given a very wide definition so as to also preclude any prospecting and exploration which could lead to the recovery of minerals. It is a piece of trendsetting legislation in the global context. We are at the leading edge of environmental laws and of protecting this unique and important environment. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said a moment ago, the Opposition has from the outset recognised the importance of Antarctica, unlike its attitude to many of the other environmental issues to which I have referred. It has adopted a far more responsible position on this issue, although it is not one reflected by the shadow Minister's speech today. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation follows on the history of the Convention for the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources Activities which was signed on 25 November 1988. It came into being on that day and required the endorsement of 16 countries, including that of 11 of the developed countries which are signatories to the Antarctic agreement. It is a matter of record that in the end that document required the signature of only one further nation-Australia-for it to be brought into force. The Convention was not brought into force because the Australian Government took a courageous decision in the context of the world debate at that time in declining to sign the document. Instead, we proposed that the Antarctic area should be preserved as a major natural environmental resource for the global community. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on this matter on 23 November 1990 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The decision my Government took in May last year not to sign the Convention for the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources Activities was a bold one. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA>We made this difficult decision because, at the end of the day, we identified a fundamental flaw in the Minerals Convention-the fallacy that `safe mining' was an option in the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister's clear commitment to ensure the preservation of the Antarctic at that early stage was in fact setting a trend for public opinion in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the shadow Minister's attention to that statement in particular because of-and I repeat this-the reference to the Government's decision in May of last year. The shadow Minister spent some 15 or 20 of his 30 minutes talking about matters other than this piece of legislation. When he did refer to this legislation, he repeated on many occasions his great boast that Opposition members were somehow the trendsetters within the country, claiming to be two or three weeks ahead of us. Quite frankly, I do not know whether that is correct and I do not care. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of minute petty politics for the shadow spokesperson to make such a point and then 10 minutes later to put his hands up and say, `Well, we should be bipartisan about this'. Mr Deputy Speaker, I refer you to the statement of 23 November and the Prime Minister's clear reference to the Government's decision in May of last year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth having a look at the development of this matter from its early days. I traced some of the coverage of the Government's decision and our efforts in this matter from 1989. I refer to an article in the Melbourne Age of 15 June 1989, headed `Hawke to push stand on Antarctic overseas'. At that stage, Australia stood alone in the world community in its efforts to have the Antarctic preserved. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, will try to gather support for the Federal Government's decision not to sign the Antarctic mining convention during his coming overseas visit. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke leaves tomorrow on an 18-day trip to France, Britain, the United States, West Germany and Hungary. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a particularly important turning point in the process that has led us to our current position, because it was during that trip the Prime Minister made to France that he sought and obtained the endorsement of the French Government for our proposals. Indeed, only a few days later, on 19 June, the Australian newspaper ran an article headed, `French warm to PM's Antarctic park plan'. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA>The French Government is likely to back Australia's international campaign for a ban on Antarctic mining and the declaration of the area as a world park. </PARA>
<PARA>French support would represent a diplomatic victory for the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and provide vital momentum for Australia's multilateral push to save the wilderness area. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not just an environmentally important document that we are discussing today. It is as well, a major diplomatic achievement of the Prime Minister and this Government to enlist the support of the French Government for that proposal. Since that time the proposal has usually been referred to as the Australian-French proposal for the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA> The proponents of mining in the Antarctic have set out a litany of mineral wealth that they propose to exploit there, and it is worth mentioning that in this debate. Those seeking to mine the Antarctic claim that there are significant stores of coal and oil, including off-shore oil. It is interesting to note also the propositions of some people that we should mine not only the minerals that we tend to associate generally with mining activity but also the ice itself as a source of fresh water for export to some of those countries in the Southern Hemisphere. </PARA>
<PARA> The minerals convention, as I said earlier, nearly obtained the support that it needed. It was a matter of some concern to many of us that countries from whom we would have anticipated support did not provide it-and of course America is foremost on that list. In fact, the American attitude to the Australian-French proposal was not very positive at all in those early days. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sydney Morning Herald of September 1989 reported the then director of the United States State Department's Office of Marine Science and Polar Affairs, a Mr Scully, when he was giving evidence to a Senate subcommittee. He was asked by a member of that subcommittee whether Australia would change its position on the Antarctic. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>`In a word, yes.'</PARA>
<PARA>The US position repudiates a warning to Senator Gore by the Prime Minister during his visit to Washington in June . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister said, as the article quotes him:</PARA>
<PARA>`Australia is opposed to the convention, period. We will fight it, period. We will never ratify it, period.'</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister's clear and unequivocal statements to the Americans were not taken at their word. The Americans seemed to think that we would buckle, that we would change our position and fall into line behind them. The record shows that was not to be. The Australian Labor Government stood firmly behind its principle of preserving the Antarctic and ensured, as we can see here today, a major shift in world opinion and the making of a commitment by this Parliament that mining will not proceed in that fragile environment. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of those efforts, Australia has had to battle against continuing opposition from a number of countries, including America, until recent times; the United Kingdom-given the political persuasion of the UK Government, that is hardly surprising-Japan; and North Korea. However, more recently we have met with success in our diplomatic efforts to ensure the region's environment is maintained. An article appearing in the Sydney Morning Herald of July 1990-nearly a full year after those earlier events to which I have referred-said:</PARA>
<PARA>In a foreign policy coup for Australia, the Bush Administration is now considering an indefinite moratorium on mining in Antarctica . . .a senior Administration official told a Senate panel . . . that the US ``clearly recognise that we have lost the consensus'' on the Wellington Convention. </PARA>
<PARA>In effect, we had caused a U-turn in US policy on these matters. That is not something that occurs often, but it was a major achievement of this Labor Government to ensure that the Antarctic was preserved against the entrenched, dogmatic and quite simplistic view adopted earlier by the US Administration in some of these matters. We were winning support around the world to ensure that the Antarctic could be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> Last November and December a critical meeting took place on this question that dealt with the future of the Antarctic region, referred to as the Chile meeting of the parties to the Antarctic Treaty. I am very pleased to be able to say that at that meeting Australia met with substantial success. We met with success in ensuring that the draft document from that meeting includes clear reference to the need to cease mining in the Antarctic. The Government pursued negotiations for a comprehensive legal document for the protection of the Antarctic environment which included such text. I am pleased to say that the draft document states:</PARA>
<PARA>Any activity relating to mineral resources, other than scientific research, shall be prohibited . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We have, in the space of the last three years, shifted the world debate from a situation where one nation's endorsement would have activated a minerals agreement to a situation now where the world community accepts our position of maintaining a no mining policy and the importance of maintaining the Antarctic as a natural reserve for research and preservation. That enormous shift in world opinion was executed in such a short time through the efforts this Government and, in no small way, through the efforts of the Prime Minister, who was centrally involved in some of those overseas negotiations. It is a credit to the Government and to the Prime Minister that this has been able to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian-French proposal now enjoys support from Finland, Sweden, Greece, New Zealand, Belgium, Italy, India and Chile, with some endorsement now from the United States. In fact, just recently United States President Bush signed legislation that bans US firms from engaging in mining in the Antarctic until a new Antarctic agreement comes into force providing a long term moratorium on mineral exploration and development. That is indeed a major achievement for this Government and one of which we can be rightly proud. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, mining should be banned in the Antarctic. A number of reasons have been advanced in the bulk of literature available. Most of them, quite frankly, are self-evident. The areas likely to be exploited are the most environmentally sensitive to pollution of any in the world. The associated facilities of mining-the towns, the ports, the shipping, the roads and the power stations-would cause damage to that sensitive Antarctic environment. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be said that the mining companies themselves do not have a particularly good record in maintaining the environmental integrity of sensitive areas. Of course, it is also worth noting that the cold climate in Antarctica means that any pollutant that would be introduced into the terrestrial or marine environment would take an extremely long time to degrade and would therefore be able to damage both the marine and terrestrial life for a far longer period than would be the case in temperate or tropical areas. Coupled with this, it should be recognised that there are so few ice free coastal areas in the Antarctic that they would be used for the major prospecting and exploration mining and support work at the expense of those wildlife colonies that currently use those areas for their habitation and survival. </PARA>
<PARA> The new convention seeks important protections, and they have been set out in part in this legislation. They seek to protect the environment and the ecosystems for scientific value and for a range of other important measures that time does not permit me to read into the record today. However, I should acknowledge that the decision the Government is taking today is in keeping with the original Antarctic Treaty of 1959, which clearly sought to retain the Antarctic for the peoples of the world to use for peaceful scientific research purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a good piece of legislation; it deserves the support of the Parliament, which I believe it will achieve. It is a pity that those opposite have sought to take a few cheap political shots in their effort to claim some environmental credentials. Their efforts in that respect have been exposed and will not be supported by the environmental community, nor by those of us who have worked for many years to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill and to join with my colleague the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) in indicating the clear-cut views of the coalition in support of the thrust of this Bill to prohibit mining and related activities in the Antarctic territory. I very much regret that the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) has injected a highly partisan note into these proceedings. He must have got out of bed on the wrong side, and his mood would have further deteriorated when he read the media reports on the infamous statement delivered yesterday by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If he wants to know who the environmental movement is condemning today, it is the Government, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), and it is condemning the Prime Minister lock, stock and barrel. If the honourable member for Brisbane had come with clean hands to this debate, he might well have detailed where he stands on such matters as Fraser Island and what should be listed by way of World Heritage in Queensland, given the views of the Goss State Government. The honourable member injected these matters into the debate and I am entitled to respond to them. I do so briefly to reject what the honourable member for Brisbane said by way of extreme partisan comment on a Bill that both sides of the Parliament are supporting. </PARA>
<PARA> One other area that I think needs to be reflected upon in terms of the debate that has taken place in this House relates to some of the previous World Heritage listing areas. The area I particularly pick up is Willandra Lakes, in my electorate, which was nominated in 1981 by the previous coalition Government. There are actually some geological linkages of quite extraordinary dimension associated with the Willandra Lakes region. The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) may not be aware of the seabed circumstance of the dry lakes of the area, including Lake Mungo, the Mungo National Park and the Walls of China feature there. I am very proud that a coalition government listed this area as a World Heritage area. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted to see the increasing international interest in the Willandra Lakes heritage area, particularly given some of the extraordinary finds that have been made in the Willandra Lakes heritage area. I believe it will go on to become more highly regarded and will attract more international attention as people realise the significance of this key area located just to the north-west of Balranald or north-east of Mildura in the far western section of the electorate of Farrer. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the honourable member for Pearce has detailed our views in respect of this legislation. I want to highlight the definitions of `mineral' and `mining activity' in the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>`mineral' means any non-living, non-renewable natural resource;</PARA>
<PARA>`mining activity' means an activity carried out for, or in connection with, the recovery or exploitation of minerals (including prospecting and exploring for minerals) . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The definition goes on to list two other qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government needs to clarify exactly where the harvesting of ice stands in respect of this Bill. By any definition, particularly that contained in the explanatory memorandum, the harvesting of ice-some would say the mining of ice, or fresh water icebergs-is not excluded by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, ice is a renewable resource of some magnitude, and I do not dismiss the prospect at some future date of ice harvesting becoming viable. Certainly some quite detailed studies have been conducted on ice harvesting in the Antarctic for water supplementation in dry parts of the world. Some of the calculations done have shown that ice could be economically delivered in large quantities, for example to the Spencer Gulf in South Australia. The problem is then reharvesting the fresh water, having floated it up that far. There would be some transmission losses during the towing effort required to move a large iceberg to the Spencer Gulf, but the real cost would be in the meltdown process, in how we might somehow manage to capture that fresh water and utilise it, for example in a dry South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Government, in responding in this House or in the other House, should make it very clear where ice harvesting stands. As I read the legislation, and on the information made available to me this morning, there is still the capability to proceed down the path of ice harvesting without infringing the provisions of this important legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to the second key point I want to make, and that is that we should not underestimate the magnitude of what this House is doing with this Bill. There are massive mineral resources in the Antarctic, and that is generally recognised. This legislation is saying that however large, small, valuable or strategic those resources might be, they should be set to one side and should not be exploited, for various proper reasons. That is a very big decision for this Parliament, as for other parliaments around the world, and it is one that will be examined against developments in the course of time to see whether it was correct. Certainly, the legislation is quite clear-cut in terms of mineral activity, and to that the coalition extends its support. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I make in regard to Antarctica generally is that there would be a very practical difficulty if we were to proceed with mining. Many people do not realise that in many ways this huge continent at the South Pole is like some form of ice-cream cake. Its true geographic centre contains something close to two kilometres vertical depth of ice cover. It moves down from that, coming down to one kilometre and eventually to the coast where there is still a huge thickness. There it breaks off and floats out to the ocean in the form of icebergs from some of the bigger floes. </PARA>
<PARA> A huge amount of the world's fresh water deposits are in the Antarctic. The mineral deposits in the land mass are buried under, on average, a one-kilometre thickness of ice that has been there for many thousands of years. There have been drilling programs to assess the extent of that depth and from time to time unknown mountains have been discovered but, because the overall ice cover is so thick and so level, people do not realise that underneath there are quite large mountains. </PARA>
<PARA> That becomes clear in the Casey Base area, which I visited with some parliamentary colleagues a number of years ago. Law Dome there is created by a mountain underneath, with the ice moving down from the central core of the Antarctic. I make this point because I think the public at large should realise that there is a massive quantity of ice there which in one sense acts to protect the environment. It is also in part a key factor in the weather of Australia, particularly the southern part, and it is an area in which Australia must maintain a very active interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years Australia has had some difficulty in terms of its policies relating to Antarctica as a consequence of the attitude taken by Malaysia. Once again we have a situation where Malaysia has sharply differed with Australia, has criticised Australia and has run an agenda against Australia, this time in respect of policy, procedure and progress with Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> I very much regret that the state of bilateral relations between Australia and Malaysia leaves a great deal to be desired. It stems from the highest levels, particularly in Malaysia. It is a key and vital Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) country with a tremendous economic future. Clearly Australia must relate more to Asia in an economic sense-in economic cooperation, export activity and the like. Yet here, in the area covered by this legislation, there is yet another huge gulf between Australia and Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA> There are reasons for this, some steeped in history. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who will be speaking later in this debate, may or may not choose to give more detail in respect of this area. But Australia should never take for granted the legitimacy and acceptance of its activities in Antarctica. It is a continuing battle on the diplomatic front and requires effort, especially with regard to the attitude of our ASEAN friend Malaysia, which has attacked Australia on some occasions in public forums. That is to be regretted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill is an extremely important piece of legislation. It provides for a bipartisan approach in this Parliament to future policy with regard to this aspect of Antarctica. It will be difficult to administer and to enforce. Say, for example, an Australian is employed by the French at Dumont d'Urville, that sliver of territory on which the French base is located. On either side there is Australian territory. If that Australian were to go about some mining activity in that area, I could see some very real difficulty in monitoring that and in determining how that would affect the impact of this law on that Australian, even though clear-cut penalties are provided for such activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, the facilitation of scientific research is provided for in this Bill. I want to highlight that because there is a need for runways of a carefully planned and limited nature. In Antarctica the French have built a runway that required mining and quarrying of rock. I am advised that in terms of this legislation that is in order, as it is part of the overall scientific effort. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, I believe that this legislation is extremely important. Its impact should not be underestimated. The coalition supports the legislation in line with the excellent comments made by the honourable member for Pearce earlier in the debate. However, I believe that it would be helpful in terms of the debate on this legislation to have placed before this House and the Senate the exact circumstance relating to the harvesting of ice, because we cannot rule out that that will be an industry at some date in the future. As I understand the legislation, there is nothing in it-nor should there be necessarily-which precludes the harvesting of ice. There is a huge deposit of ice in Antarctica, sections of which break off and, in the form of icebergs, float further north over a period of time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does support this key legislation. I note your deep interest, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a member who has made not one but two extensive visits to Antarctica. I commend you for having a much stronger stomach than mine on the visit that we made together to that important continent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support strongly the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill, which prohibits mining in the Australian Antarctic Territory and prohibits Australian nationals from participating in mining elsewhere in Antarctica. I am not a Johnny-come-lately to this issue. Over the last couple of years, I have taken opportunities presented to me in meeting colleagues from other parliaments around the world and in visiting other countries. I have raised this issue on many occasions and sought international support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Parliament will be aware, when Australia initially took what should be regarded as a quite courageous initiative in this regard, there was little international support for our position; and I commend the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and all those other people in the Government who have worked so hard over an extended timeframe in ensuring that this matter moves towards fruition. </PARA>
<PARA> The ban will ensure that the fragile Antarctic environment will not be irreparably harmed, and I think there would be a consensus in this House in relation to that. I should add that in my view the Australian mining industry will not be disadvantaged by the prohibition but, even if it was, I would still support the Bill because I strongly believe that the preservation of the environmental values of Antarctica outweigh commercial considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> The environmental values of Antarctica are, by any measure, unique. The Antarctic comprises about a tenth of the world's land surface and a tenth of the oceans. It is the highest, windiest, coldest and driest continent. It is also the most remote region, without any indigenous population. Consequently, of all continents it most nearly approaches a pristine condition. </PARA>
<PARA> More than 45 per cent of the Antarctica coastline is fringed with iceshelves or glaciers, and it is the intervening ice free stretches that provide the most favourable conditions for plants and invertebrate animals, as well as coastal breeding sites for sea birds and some seal species. These limited snow free coastal areas also provide the best sites for scientific research stations. These areas would be the first candidates for any minerals activity, yet it is these areas which are very susceptible to disturbance and pollution and where attention to environmental impacts needs to be focused. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall importance of Antarctica is, however, much greater than this. The iceshelves, sea ice and icebergs are a treasure-house of archival records of climatic changes which have occurred in past ages. The apparently untouched icecap itself constitutes an archive of man made pollutants, the rate of deposition of which reflects changes in worldwide baseline levels. These massive ice structures are a laboratory for scientific research on the effects of worldwide weather changes, and for this reason alone should be preserved against commercial activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Antarctica affects the world's environment in many ways, not the least of which is that, because of its icecap, it acts as the earth's major heat sink. This huge ice blanket reflects incoming solar radiation, resulting in extreme temperature drops in the lower latitudes. This in turn exerts a major influence on the world's climate and drives the major currents of the world's oceans, so changes in the Antarctica are likely to have global impacts. </PARA>
<PARA> The thinning of the protective overlaying ozone layer has already been demonstrated, and the region is likely to be affected by future climatic warming with consequential effects on sea levels. The region's main resource is, therefore, not its potential for commercial exploitation but its potential for scientific discoveries that help us understand global conditions and processes. In short, Antarctica contributes to understanding and monitoring global change. </PARA>
<PARA> With these considerations in mind, it must be stressed that mining in Antarctica would have significant environmental impacts, even if there were no environmental accidents. In Antarctica, even with the best laid plans and implementation, taking into account the harshness and remoteness of the place, the chances of things going wrong are so much the greater. Australia is geographically relatively close to Antarctica, and consequently we are more aware than most other countries of the environmental values of that continent. Consequently, we make no apologies for being concerned about environmental values at the expense of any dubious and hypothetical returns from Antarctic mineral exploration. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now make a few brief points about the mineral resources of Antarctica and the possibility of mining activity there. I raise this because it is often said that we are a resource-rich country which is being very selfish in denying mining in Antarctica to other countries. Whilst it is known that mineral deposits do occur in Antarctica, what is known is very scanty because sustained mineral exploration has been limited by the extreme climatic conditions, as well as by some of the most inhospitable terrain in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Antarctica is the world's fifth largest continent with a land mass some 1.5 times the size of Australia. It is covered by an icecap over some 98 per cent of its surface, which is, on average, some two to three kilometres deep. The 2 per cent that is ice free is located mainly in the mountains, which are not easily accessible, and in some coastal areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Mineralisation has been reported at a number of localities during regional surveys over the last 40 years or so. The most widely quoted rocks are the banded iron formations of the Prince Charles Mountains, and although extensive, they are not large compared to similar formations elsewhere, and they are of relatively low grade-some 35 per cent Fe-compared with 60 per cent plus Fe which is readily available in Australia, to give some indication of the qualitative difference. It is therefore unlikely that the Antarctic iron ore could compete with that from Australia, or for that matter with that from any other major iron ore exporting country. </PARA>
<PARA> Ditto with coal. Antarctic coal deposits, whilst extensive, are too scattered to make even the broadest assessments, let alone to make any judgment about their economic viability. A similar story exists in relation to other minerals. Occurrences of some 20 other types of metallic minerals, 15 non-metallic minerals, and rocks used elsewhere as bulk minerals, have been reported. A few localities have been studied from an academic point of view during regional mapping, and it is not possible to say that economic deposits exist. </PARA>
<PARA> There are only two hydrocarbon shows reported from the Antarctic region. No oil or gas seeps are known, nor have any potential hydrocarbon bearing structures been identified, either by geophysical surveying or geological mapping. In the absence of reliable data, any published assessments of petroleum potential of the region must be regarded as both speculative and hypothetical. </PARA>
<PARA> If the extraordinarily high cost of exploration and extraction were not enough, the transportation of these minerals would be a nightmare, and the costs astronomical. Offshore there are iceshelves up to 200 metres thick covering much of the Antarctic continental shelf, with sea ice of an average thickness of 1.5 metres extending some 1,000 kilometres from the coastline. Commercial navigation would be very difficult, to say the least, as tabular icebergs have been observed with dimensions of more than 60 kilometres by 100 kilometres, and these can be as high as 80 metres above sea level, and are known to have grounded at depths of 500 metres. This combination of iceshelves, sea ice and icebergs also makes offshore drilling platforms and other such offshore installations very risky propositions indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> From what I have just outlined it can be readily appreciated, I believe, that mining would not be an economic proposition today, and in my view it is certainly beyond the limits of present day technology. </PARA>
<PARA> Another argument sometimes put by opponents of this Bill is that we are denying the opportunity of exploiting Antarctica in case mineral resource shortages occur in the future. I reject this argument also. Some of us remember the `gloom and doom' prophecies of the Club of Rome during the 1970s which forecast serious resource shortages in the near future. These have now been discredited. These prophecies have not eventuated simply because, as working mines became depleted or exhausted, those deposits which were previously thought to be uneconomic became viable through improvements in technology and management in the mining industry. This continuing process of extending the economic life of resources will undoubtedly continue in the future. I would suggest, as Minister for Resources, that mining companies would be far better off investing in Australia, rather than thinking of the options or possibilities in Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is also the important environmental dimension to this issue. In Australia the mining industry has developed sophisticated techniques of environmental management and rehabilitation of mined areas, and its recent record in this area is extremely good. That is little understood, I think, by many in the Australian community, and, I regret to say, by many in this House. These techniques would not be of much use in the totally different Antarctic environment, however, where similar results could be achieved only by trial and error. </PARA>
<PARA> If mining was allowed, it would be under an international regime such as the Antarctic minerals convention, which we have refused to sign, and as a result we would lose control of any environmental conditions which we might wish to impose. In Australia we have well-established regulations for environmental controls, which are familiar to the industry and to governments. These regulations are working well, and are constantly being improved in the light of extensive and accumulating experience and knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> In Antarctica the whole process of environment control would be, by definition, experimental, with an untried international administrative authority seeking to develop new rules and procedures to cope with what I would describe as a unique situation. </PARA>
<PARA> As outlined above, I believe that the Bill does not disadvantage the Australian mining industry whilst performing the essential function of protecting the fragile and very important environment of Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted that in his remarks to the House earlier, the shadow environment Minister claimed credit, and correctly so, for the abolition of mineral sands mining on Fraser Island during the period of the Fraser Government. As with many other issues, there is some embarrassing background to that particular plan, because the environment Minister comes into this chamber with no environmental policy clothes, if he uses that particular example, because--</PARA>

<PARA>We will abolish all export controls on the minerals and metals sector including those applicable to iron ore. The only exception to this being uranium as specified in section 9. </PARA>
<PARA>What the Opposition specifically indicated in terms of its platform at the last election was that it will move to the abolition of all export controls in the minerals and metals sector, with the exception of those on uranium.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, because the members opposite would not have the courage to suggest that. In terms of consistency, which is something we hear a lot about from the Opposition, the honourable member for Mayo should explain to the House-and he should have the opportunity to do so very shortly-why the Opposition will abolish the export control powers on mineral sands which are deposited in some of the most environmentally sensitive areas of this country, including the coastal regions of Queensland and some of the islands in that area, and not extend that abolition of export licences if the rationale is as has been outlined in its policy prescriptions. It is a very important point for this House to ponder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In any event, if we forget the issue of the export control powers in so far as they affect the timber industry-I remind the House that if they were abolished it would leave the Commonwealth Government powerless to have any influence over proper forest management practices and all the other related issues in relation to the timber industry-and even if we focus on the specific promise, that is, the abolition of export control powers for mineral sands, where is the Federal Government going to gain the power to have a positive influence on proper mining practices, rehabilitation practices, pricing arrangements and so on in relation to this important sector?</PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition responds by indicating that there may be other powers in its armoury in relation to which it would discharge the obvious responsibility of a national government in these areas, then a further reading of the Opposition's resources and energy policy might be a productive exercise. Under the heading `Federal-State Responsibility' there is this paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>We acknowledge the constitutional division of responsibilities, particularly State control over access to land and mining rights. Our policy is that this should not be circumvented by the improper use of unrelated powers asserted by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us get down to tintacks. The Opposition is proposing the abolition of export control powers over mineral sands. The honourable member does concur with that assessment of the Opposition's own policy. Of course, he does; he cannot do otherwise. In that case, the Federal Government-unless it utilises other powers-is absolutely powerless in relation to these issues. The Opposition's policy prescription specifically arrives at the conclusion that the Federal Government will, in effect, vacate the field. That is a position that is untenable. It is a position that is untenable on its merits. It is a position that is untenable in particular on its environmental sensitivity merits, and it ought not be supported by anyone in this chamber, including the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have as usual in this debate on the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill, which is an extremely important issue, heard from the Australian Labor Party yet another party political diatribe on the general issue of the environment. It is not a diatribe which is particularly relevant to the Bill before the House. Nevertheless, it does raise a number of concerns for all of us in this Parliament that I think we need to think about-that is, that the enormously sensitive issue of the environment and conservation has been used with the greatest of cynicism, in particular by the Labor Party, to shore up its political position. There was no better example of that than during the last Federal election campaign when the then environment Minister, Senator Richardson, formulated attitudes for the Government on environmental matters not on the basis of the merits of those cases but simply on the basis of political expediency. When we are talking about a government for a whole nation in the interests of a whole nation it is a sad thing if its policies are formulated on no other basis than winning the preferences of green candidates and Australian Democrat candidates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) spent quite a lot of time in his speech using selective quotations from the coalition's environment policy to imply, as the Labor Party always does, that it believes in the environment and conservation and, lo and behold, the people on the other side of the House hate the environment, hate conservation, want to see rainforests destroyed, Ayers Rock blown up, mining in the Great Barrier Reef and so on. The fact is that our record, unlike the record of the present Government, speaks very loudly for itself. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary sitting at the table asks what record. Frankly, I think that just underlines the fraudulent way in which the Labor Party approaches this whole debate on the environment. It was a coalition Government that first established a department of the environment, not a Labor Government. It was the coalition which first put the whole issue of conservation and the environment on to the national agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We often talk about the great contribution the Fraser Government made to conservation in this country through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Fraser Island, through support for and the successful conclusion of the International Convention on Whaling, as well as the things the Fraser Government did to look after the quality of water in the River Murray and the things that were done in the areas of soil and land degradation. I hope that people who are serious about environment and conservation issues recognise that the reality of what the Fraser Government did in the area of the environment was very much greater than the reality of what the present Government has done and was based on a genuine heartfelt commitment to the environment, not the cynical smoke filled backroom politics of Senator Graham Richardson. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole issue in this Bill serves as yet another illustration of my point: that is, as we have continually said in this debate, it was this side of politics that took the initiative on the banning of mining in the Antarctic, not the Labor Party. At the time the coalition took its initiative-I will come back to that a little later-the Labor Party was on the threshold of signing the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities. Every department supported it and just about every single Minister in the Government supported it. Yet when the coalition took the position on 2 May 1989 that it would oppose that Convention and oppose mining of any kind in Antarctica, suddenly the Labor Party became confused. </PARA>
<PARA> Once more Senator Richardson trotted in with his latest piece of opinion polling and cynical smoke filled room politics and the Government decided to change its mind. It has the hide to come into this House today and say, `Look at the great job we have done with this legislation; aren't we committed to the environment; aren't we green', when all the time it has followed in the wake of our side of politics. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is well worthy of support. It is a Bill which prohibits mining in the Australian Antarctic Territory. It prohibits mining by Australians in Antarctica anywhere and it provides a definition of mining which I think is fairly comprehensive and quite sensibly allows an exemption for scientific research. This whole process of putting together this legislation and of changing the Government's position has been a quite tortuous one and a process that I think is a matter of some embarrassment to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth remembering that the divisions within the Cabinet on this issue were extremely fierce when, prior to the coalition taking a position, the Government was apparently unanimous in supporting the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities. When we look at the issue of that Convention, which we finally decided not to sign, for the reasons I have described, two legitimate views were debated. First of all, before the Government took a position of opposition to the Convention-as I have mentioned, we did as well-it was argued that the Convention actually provided a means of controlling mining rather than a means of giving carte blanche to mining. In order for mining to proceed under the convention, an environmental impact statement was needed and, arguably, signatory states to the Antarctic Treaty were able to veto any prospecting and subsequently, therefore, mining in Antarctica. That argument was strongly supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument against that was that, if we just legislated in the way that this Parliament is now legislating to simply ban mining altogether, that would clearly have a more beneficial effect than the Convention, because the Convention under certain circumstances did allow for mining, provided all Antarctic Treaty members, all signatories to the Convention, agreed that that mining should go ahead. So it is true that the Convention did not guarantee that mining would take place but it provided for such mining to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House certainly came to the conclusion on a balance of judgment, not on the basis of opinion polls or political considerations, that it was really better to move towards a total ban on mining through national legislation of this kind and through endeavouring to get the Antarctic Treaty partners to make a commitment in the context of the Antarctic Treaty to ban all mining. There is no doubt that Australia, in this area of Antarctica, has a very great responsibility when it formulates policies of this kind. We can in this area, unlike so many others, exert enormous influence over the future of Antarctica-largely because of the obvious size of our claim but also because of our equally obvious geographic proximity to Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> People may wonder why one would want to ban mining in Antarctica. Why would we not allow mining there since we allow mining in most other parts of the world? I put forward three or four reasons why I think we should support a ban on mining in that part of the world. However, before I do so, I want to highlight that it is generally believed that Antarctica does have large hydrocarbon reserves. There are probably also very substantial reserves of copper and gold and, indeed, it is believed that the hydrocarbon reserves in Antarctica are comparable to those in Mexico or the North Sea. So the size of the hydrocarbon reserves could be very substantial. Despite that, extraction would be enormously difficult and vastly expensive, particularly in the context of the cold climate, the very strong winds and the icebergs, about which others have spoken. So in the present environment, with oil at $21 or whatever a barrel, one could hardly imagine that such exploitation would go ahead; but over the next 30 or 40 years we do not know what will happen to oil prices. My guess is that oil prices will go up very substantially over that period-in the long term, I am sure they will-and, consequently, the price may gradually become right. </PARA>
<PARA> The mining, and any other similar kind of exploitation, of Antarctica would have four basic consequences. The first is that it would clearly bring to an end the Antarctic wilderness-the last great wilderness in the world-with a very severe climate and a very fragile environment. Without having time to articulate all the reasons why I would be sad to see that happen, most of us in this House would agree that to get rid of, or at least to damage, the last great wilderness in the world not only would be damaging to the fragile ecosystem of Antarctica but also, in a more general and emotional sense, would be a very sad thing for the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, as far as hydrocarbon and, in particular, oil exploration is concerned, the risks would be very high to the environment. For example, oil spills would be more damaging in the Antarctic environment than they would be in the Persian Gulf. That is partly because of the very cold water, which means that oil would take a great deal of time to degrade, but also because in that particularly fragile environment it would be vastly difficult to put together some sort of clean-up operation. It would make the clean-up operations in the Persian Gulf look extremely simple by comparison with the massive problems in the Antarctic with rough seas, strong winds, intense cold and icebergs that would be confronted if a similar clean-up operation was mounted. Obviously, an oil spill would have a devastating effect on the krill, algae, bird life, fish and the like. So we would not want to see that happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The third concern that I have is that any kind of mining would require, in an environment like the Antarctic environment, a massive infrastructure compared to the type of infrastructure we would need for comparable mining in countries such as Australia, perhaps the United States, Canada or Africa. A massive infrastructure would be needed because of the cold, the winds, the icebergs and so on, and that massive infrastructure would also have very clear environmental implications. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, I believe-and I do not think this aspect has been discussed at all but it is one I see as very important-that if we were to allow mining to go ahead in Antarctica the very pacific political climate that has existed in Antarctica since 1959 when the Antarctic Treaty was signed would be brought to an end. In other words, it would create the potential for political conflict. It would be very hard for the Antarctic Treaty partners to limit exploitation of the potentially very rich resources in Antarctica just to those Treaty partners. Legitimately, we would really have to open up that exploitation to all countries. If we were to open up that exploitation to all countries, companies from all countries or governments themselves, very real questions would be raised about the current status of the Antarctic Treaty. For example, what would it mean to the claimant states for exploitation to take place within the areas defined by those claimant states? How would Australia enforce a mining regime, a royalties regime or whatever it may be within the Australian Antarctic area without having its claim to Antarctica agreed to by all, which it clearly is not. Indeed, as people well know, many of the Antarctic Treaty states do not recognise the claims of Australia and other states to parts of Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> So the potential for political conflict there is very great. We as a country which has a very significant claim in Antarctica and which has relative geographic proximity to Antarctica could be drawn into serious political problems should mining go ahead there. I think that is something that the international community in general needs to dwell on, particularly those countries which up until now have shown great reluctance to support the proposal of the Australians and, subsequently, French, Belgians and others that mining should be banned altogether. Those Antarctic Treaty partners need to think about that much more than they have. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one point in conclusion, and that is that I want this particular initiative, the banning of mining in Antarctica, to be built up on the foundation of the Antarctic Treaty. I think that the Antarctic Treaty has been an extraordinarily successful foundation for the evolution of the relationship between mankind and the environment in Antarctica. I know some countries in the world, particularly Malaysia, would like to see the Antarctic Treaty abandoned altogether. They see it as a kind of rich man's club. It is not a rich man's club; it is an open-door treaty. In other words, countries which wish to become parties to the Antarctic Treaty are able to do so, and several countries in recent years have become parties to that Antarctic Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative to the very fragile political structure which has been put in place by that Antarctic Treaty is little short of anarchy. Without the Antarctic Treaty, we would end up with a race for the resources of Antarctica, and in the course of that race the destruction of its fragile environment. It is with that Treaty that we can ensure that that fragile environment is properly conserved. I very much hope not only that this Bill passes through the House, but also that in future Australia endeavours to ensure that the ban on mining is supported by all the Antarctic Treaty partners and that that ban on mining becomes an integral part of the Antarctic Treaty system itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset of my remarks on the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill, Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to say how pleased I am to be speaking on a Bill dealing with Antarctica with you in the chair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was somewhat surprised by some of the contributions from both sides. I have heard of wide-ranging debates in this place, but when we start talking about timber resources, Fraser Island, the Murray River, Lake Mungo and so on in a debate on Antarctica, I think some of our colleagues have ranged very widely. That is a great pity, because there is so much one could say that 20 minutes is really not enough time to devote to this. </PARA>
<PARA> As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Bill gives effect to the Government's pledge to work towards prohibiting mining in Antarctica. On 17 August 1990 the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) announced the Government's decision to introduce legislation to ban all mining in Antarctica to the extent of Australia's legal capacity to apply such a ban. This Bill achieves that objective. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly welcome the strong support from the Opposition for the Bill. I listened to all the speeches in the chamber this morning and I agreed with the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) when he said that this was a momentous decision. I am not sure that I share his enthusiasm for harvesting of the ice; I think that would cause some difficulties. He commented on the possibility of a runway and said that this would involve drilling in rock and so on. I have visited the site for the proposed runway at Mawson, and I support him on that. Like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I accept that the only way to travel to Antarctica is by sea. Nevertheless, if we have to have a runway there-which I believe that for some purposes we do-I hope that we would be more sensitive in our construction than the French were in Dumont d'Urville. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will prohibit mineral activities in the Australian Antarctic Territory, the area we claim, and will prohibit Australian nationals and corporations from undertaking mineral activities elsewhere in the Antarctic region. The Bill is a first key step towards achieving our objective of comprehensive and legally binding protection on the Antarctic environment. </PARA>
<PARA> I know of no-one who has visited Antarctica who supports mining there. I know some people who supported mining before they went to Antarctica, but after visiting the area they changed their minds. Many members of this House have visited Antarctica. Regardless of where they are on the political spectrum, those of us who have visited the frozen land are totally opposed to mining. Indeed, who could support mining as they look across the fragile landscape of incredible beauty and colour of this frozen continent?</PARA>
<PARA> There are many arguments against mining and many of them have been canvassed in the House today. I do not believe that the economics would stand close scrutiny. I draw attention to the tremendous infrastructure that would be required, the harsh and changeable weather and the transport difficulties. I will leave others to make the economic and legal arguments; I shall concentrate on the environmental arguments. </PARA>
<PARA> Antarctica is the last clean place of any size left on earth. How long it can stay this way is questionable because it will most likely get increasing numbers of tourists, ships, garbage and pollution in general. Already there are elements of pollution there. I pay tribute to the clean-up measures of the Australian Government at our bases in Antarctica at Mawson, Davis, Casey and also Law. I believe that our record in Antarctica is second to none. I have visited the Chinese and Russian bases, and I must say that our record is much better than that of these other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> While I was in Antarctica in early 1989 an Argentinean supply ship spilt an amount of oil-not in the area where I was but off Anvers Island near the Antarctic peninsula. To look out, as I did at that time, over the beautiful white landscape and try to imagine it spoiled and stained by oil-or, indeed, by mining waste-was a very frightening and sobering experience. </PARA>
<PARA> This spill alerted those concerned about the integrity of the Antarctic environment to the compounding dangers implicit in mining activities, particularly transportation by sea. I think the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) mentioned the problems of transportation by sea. Another aspect we should consider is that any ships coming there to pick up freight or minerals would have to have ballast. As we found on the south coast of New South Wales, when ships from Japan and other places put ballast into the water it affects the oysters. If ships brought ballast to Antarctica and let it go in the bays, it could well affect the sea life. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter to take into consideration is the tremendous infrastructure, such as mining equipment, that would be needed. Despite safeguarding measures, it is inevitable that spills would occur. Bad as the spill from the Argentinean ship was, the whole world was shocked two months later when, on 24 March 1989, the Exxon Valdez disaster occurred off the Alaskan coast. It is interesting to look at the clean-up measures that were taken at that time. Although there were some delays in the clean-up measures after the Exxon Valdez disaster, measures were actually taken. People could get in there; they could get equipment in there. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Antarctic there are parts that cannot be reached for, say, 10 months of the year. When I was there in 1989 we were stuck in the ice for some three weeks. As you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, ships on the first resupply trip of the year go to the ice edge, which may be 200 miles from the bases. Even in later trips-in fact, as late as the January trip-ships may get only within 20 miles because the ice is still there. As honourable members can imagine, if an oil spill had occurred it would have been impossible to get even the equipment there-and it would take at least 14 days from Hobart to get there. During that 14 days when the ship was coming from Hobart, the weather could change very suddenly and dramatically. It is frightening to think of any spill, any damage, in the Antarctic because it would be impossible to get there speedily enough to clean it up. </PARA>
<PARA> Many kinds of pollution are cleaned up gradually by a natural process. An oil spill, damaging though it is, evaporates to some extent. It breaks down, is degraded gradually and finally disappears. We all know that it does not do this quickly and that before it degrades it often causes a tremendous amount of harm. All chemical processes tend to slow down as temperatures drop, so in cold weather the evaporation and degradation of the spill is slow. At the very cold Antarctic temperatures, the rate of evaporation and degradation may be only one-hundredth of what it is in warmer climates. Spills of this sort may make their effects felt for a full century or more. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a lot of debate about what minerals are in Antarctica. I am not a geologist but I have spoken to a lot of people who have done geological studies in Antarctica. I must say that that is something Australia is well supplied with. I think most of the PhDs in geology today seem to be gained in Antarctica. The Minister for Resources mentioned that there was some iron ore in the Prince Charles Mountains and some coal. As he rightly said, the infrastructure difficulties of getting them from the Prince Charles Mountains down to the coast, let alone the infrastructure on the coast itself to ship them out, would be tremendous. </PARA>
<PARA> Representing, as I do, a coal-producing part of Australia, I know that one thing we do not need more of on the world market at the moment is coal; there is a world oversupply of coal. So I do not think we will be racing to bring coal out of the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA> If the continent of Antarctica itself is largely a frozen wasteland, the waters surrounding it are the richest reservoir of life on the planet and they support the familiar large animals of the far southern seas-penguins, gulls, seals, dolphins and whales. The sea is also rich in krill, which, unfortunately, is being overfished by the Japanese, amongst others. If we damage the region badly-which, even with the best will in the world, mining would inevitably do-we tear an enormous whole in the fabric of the planetary ecology and cause damage elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard arguments about signing the minerals convention. I have listened to all of the arguments and I have taken part in many debates on this subject. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) made the point which many people make: that only by signing the minerals convention could we actually have a say and have the veto to stop mining there. I do not agree with that, because I believe by putting legislation in place and by setting an example to other countries, we will get the other countries with interests in Antarctica to do this also. I believe this is the best way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's stand, as we have seen over the last few years, has been gradually supported by other countries. In the early days it was only the French who supported us. The United States, although not enthusiastic, is coming along. Other countries-Belgium, Finland-now support us. Two years ago President Gorbachev himself announced quite a significant change in the Soviet attitude. So over the last few years Australia has built up a tremendous lot of support for our stand concerning Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> A feature of the minerals convention is that it permits prospecting without any authorisation by the institution of the minerals convention. Should the results of that prospecting then disclose minerals of value there, extreme national and commercial pressures to exploit would probably follow, and they would be pressures that might affect the making of those value judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make two final points about the minerals convention. Firstly, it provides security of title, between all nations who are parties to the Antarctic Treaty, to any mineral venture that complies with its requirements. This provision of secure title of mining tenements must, for the first time, be a very considerable encouragement to mining companies considering the possibility of engaging in mineral activity in Antarctica. Secondly, the convention runs counter to the whole concept of the Antarctic Treaty system that knowledge gained should be shared between all parties, in that it permits the results of prospecting to be retained by the prospector as confidential information. That goes against all of the conventions of the Antarctic Treaty, whereby knowledge is always shared. Usually the knowledge shared is scientific knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA> All of this provides reason enough for Australia's refusal to sign the minerals convention. But there is another and distinct perspective which leads to the same conclusion and which, at the same time, underlines the urgent need for some comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment. Antarctica has long been recognised as a unique natural laboratory for scientific research. Many years ago, with great foresight, Sir Douglas Mawson said of it:</PARA>
<PARA>Bound up with the mystery of the seventh continent are volumes of data of vital importance to science and economic problems which may become of moment in the near future. The polar regions like other parts of the globe may be said to be paved with facts, the essence of which it is necessary to acquire before knowledge of the special zone can be brought to even a provisional exactitude . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Antarctic science is of global importance in describing, understanding, monitoring and predicting changes affecting the entire globe. It is also vital in analysing and modelling a variety of processes and systems that can be studied better in the Antarctic than in other regions, and in providing the basic knowledge necessary for conservation and management of our global resources. </PARA>
<PARA> An example of the importance of the preservation of the Antarctic environment to the rest of the world is found in the areas of global weather patterns and of threatened global climate change and the effect of stratospheric ozone depletion. Confirmation by the British Antarctic survey in 1985 of the springtime thinning of the ozone layer over the Antarctic is perhaps the foremost example so far of the value to the world of the Antarctic laboratory. The ozone hole extends over approximately 4 per cent of the earth's surface in spring. The Antarctic vortex provides conditions in its still and very cold central core for the formation of polar stratospheric clouds at heights of between 12 and 20 kilometres. These ice particles act as a nuclei on which a multitude of complex chemical reactions take place. These have been found recently to be leading to the destruction of ozone as the sun returns in the spring. The earth's ozone layer is of immense importance. It filters out the lethal ultraviolet radiation from the sun, and life on earth depends as much on the working efficiency of this filter as on oxygen or water. </PARA>
<PARA> Had the international scientific cooperation that thrives under the Antarctic Treaty system not existed-as it now has for more than 30 years-there is a chance that the world would still be blissfully ignorant of the major threat to life on earth and no steps would have been taken internationally to phase out the production of ozone damaging chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will assist in achieving the prohibition of all mining and related activities in Antarctica by banning mining, by Australians and non-Australians alike, in the Australian Antarctic Territory which, as we know, is some 42 per cent of the Antarctic continent. In addition, the legislation will prohibit Australian nationals and corporations from engaging in mining activities elsewhere in Antarctica. The Leader of the National Party asked the question: what if an Australian national was working with a French company mining in the French sliver of territory at Dumont D'Urville? Obviously, under the legislation that national would be engaged in an illegal activity because the legislation prohibits Australian nationals from mining in Antarctica and if he or she had Australian nationality, of course that would be an illegal activity and that person could be subject to prosecution over the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill recognises the need to allow for activities in support of scientific work. The legislation is targeted at commercial minerals activities and has been drafted so as not to apply to scientific research and building and maintenance activities in support of scientific stations. Of course, we all know that this is very important. The Government recognises the importance of Antarctica for scientific research and will not stand in the way of legitimate geological and geophysical research, for example. We have never done that in the past and we have always cooperated with many other countries and allowed their scientists to come and work on our bases as, indeed, some of our people go to work on their bases. It is always interesting to note that on the supply ships that travel to and from Antarctica there are always scientists from other nations, and this will become even more prevalent now that the Aurora Australis is in service between Australia and the Antarctic region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Antarctic region is valuable to the people of earth because of its ecological role and as a mine of information useful to science. In addition, we have a responsibility to try to protect and preserve, in as pristine a state as possible, the few areas on earth not spoilt by man. This is not too high a price to pay, and the scientific and environmental integrity of Antarctica is infinitely too valuable to lose through inactivity or in the name of dubious short term economic enrichment. And the economic arguments that have been put forward are very dubious. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this earth have mined, farmed and raped so much of the world. We have done tremendous damage to this planet. Surely there can be one place on this earth that can be left in its pristine state for the benefit of everyone and for future generations. I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very useful interjection from the shadow Minister who is at the table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have pointed out to this House, and in particular to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), the coalition is the only group in Australia to have a clearly detailed and written environment policy, so it is not surprising to see the present Government refer to it as a source for its own policies-and if it does not, it should. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill seeks to ban all mining in the Antarctic. We must be reminded that Australia is not the first country to enact such legislation. The United States Congress passed laws banning all US citizens from mining in Antarctica last year. However, by virtue of our strong claim to 42 per cent of this wonderful area, today's legislation is important and significant. I recognise, however, that this Bill attempts to ban all mining in Antarctica, subject to Australia's capacity to legislate to impose such a ban. </PARA>
<PARA> When Parliament passes this Bill, approximately 42 per cent or 6.1 million square kilometres-which gives everybody a real sense of the massive size of Antarctica-of that region will be protected from mining. That is indeed a substantial achievement. However, as the Minister recognised in her second reading speech, it is only the first step towards achieving the objective of comprehensive and legally binding protection of the Antarctic environment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that Australians have been encouraged for several generations to have an acute interest in Antarctica. In the early days it was Mawson, the great explorer, who traversed through those desolate and cold places. In later days it was Dr Phillip Law. Those of us who lived in Melbourne in those days will remember the excitement with which Melbourne greeted the visit of each of the Danish vessels we used to hire to take our people down to Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that this interest has spread from Adelaide with Mawson and from Melbourne with Law. It is interesting to note that of the 13 speakers so far listed to speak in this debate, seven come from New South Wales and only one from South Australia and two from Victoria. I am not being State-bound when I talk about this; I am merely pointing it out to show that the interest in the Antarctic has not been limited to either Adelaide or Melbourne where the events took place. I was one who turned out with excitement to see the Danish ships-these ships of adventure-leave Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia was an original signatory to the Antarctic Treaty in 1959. It should be pointed out that successive coalition governments have supported the protection of this unique area. In 1980 the Fraser Government introduced the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act. This was introduced for-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the protection of Antarctic wildlife and for the preservation of areas of outstanding ecological and scientific importance. </PARA>
<PARA>The second reading speech at that stage went on to say that the legislation would take into account the special environmental problems of the Antarctic and would include rigorous controls to limit environmental impact. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government also introduced the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Act 1981. This Act prohibited the harvesting of research or marine organisms in the Antarctic region without a permit. I am pleased to say that both of these Acts were supported by the then Labor Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a different story, however, when in 1989 the Liberal and National parties announced their opposition to the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities. That decision was based on our policy position that there should be no mining in the Antarctic. The statement issued by the then shadow Minister for the environment, Senator Puplick, as well as the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), on 2 May 1989 said:</PARA>
<PARA>To sign a convention which effectively encourages the development of mining activities would be incompatible with that position. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition called on the Government not to sign the Convention. However the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, made clear that it was their intention to sign it. The Opposition successfully moved a motion in the Senate the following day again calling on the Government not to sign the Convention. Finally, three weeks later, the Government heeded the advice of the coalition and supported its policy not to sign. That decision effectively nullified the Convention worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, almost two years later, the Minister informs the Parliament of the Government's `pledge to work towards prohibiting mining in Antarctica'. What a change of face. For my part, it is a welcome change of face. Nonetheless, the House needs to be reminded that the Government's policy was to sign the convention I have referred to, placing in jeopardy the unique features of the continent. That decision was overturned only after repeated calls from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House welcome the decision of the Government to follow the lead of the coalition. Let me remind the Minister of the coalition's policy which was issued in October 1988 regarding the Antarctic. We say in that document:</PARA>
<PARA>In Government-</PARA>
<PARA>where we will be in 1993-</PARA>
<PARA>the coalition will act to increase Australia's participation in Antarctic activities and research; will support the agreed measures for the conservation of Antarctic flora and fauna; will be particularly vigilant in the protection of Antarctica's marine natural resources; and will ensure that any minerals regime is developed only within the strictest environment protection guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>A few months later, when it was felt that the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities would not adequately protect the fragility of the environment down there, our policy was moved further down the track two years ago to the point where we said we would not sign and forced the Government to fall into line. It is the coalition which has the clear policy on the preservation of Antarctica and, in line with our deep seated commitment to Antarctica, we will be supporting this Bill enthusiastically. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we are enthusiastic in our support for the Bill, I personally wish to raise some points of concern which came to me when we were reading the Bill. Clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill-and I was pleased to see the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) refer to this in his speech-impose certain penalties on individuals and corporations carrying out mining activities in the region. Clause 6 deals with any individuals or corporations engaged in mining activity in the Australian Antarctic Territory. Clause 7 prohibits Australian nationals from mining activities anywhere in Antarctica. The maximum penalties for such offences will be $100,000 for individuals and half a million dollars for corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern with these penalties is twofold. First, the Minister makes no mention at all in her speech-nor, indeed, is there any mention in the Bill itself-as to how these penalties were calculated. I would like the Minister to inform the House how such penalties were calculated and on what basis. For example, are there similar penalties for mining in protected areas in Australia? Presumably the penalty for mining in the Australian Antarctic Territory is similar to that imposed for mining in Australian protected areas, but what of mining in other areas of the Antarctic region?</PARA>
<PARA> My second point of concern relates to clause 8 of the Bill. Specifically, subclause 2 provides that offences against sections 6 or 7 may be dealt with summarily. The maximum penalties in this instance are reduced to $10,000 for individuals and $50,000 for corporations. Again I ask the Minister to explain on what basis these penalties have been determined. There is no mention of the determination of the penalties in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very pleased to hear the honourable member for Pearce talking very strongly about the leniency of these fines. I would support him in saying that they do seem to be totally immaterial when it comes to people who have the money to start mining anywhere. </PARA>
<PARA> A further concern I wish to discuss relates to the policing of the Antarctic. There is no mention-none at all-in the Minister's speech of how the mining ban is to be enforced and indeed what procedures will be adopted in bringing offenders to justice. Specifically, there is no mention, again, as to the procedure to be followed to prosecute a foreigner engaging in mining activities within the Australian Antarctic Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> These are logistic concerns. However, I raise them in today's debate to highlight that there are several issues in the Bill that the Minister or her advisers have decided not to address. I find this disturbing in legislation which is so important and so significant. Our legislation is there and we must stop and consider that it does not just apply to Australia. We have to realise that some of our near neighbouring countries, such as Malaysia, have maintained a very quaint attitude to Antarctica. For people to say it has not had an effect on our relationships with that country indicates they are not interested in Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA> I happen to be and I am quite concerned. I wish to goodness we could get some statement in this House from either the Minister for all those different things, including the environment, or the Minister for Foreign Affairs as to what they have actually done about talking to the Malaysians about this matter. It would be very hard to do it just now when one considers what is happening with Malaysian timber that is trying to be imported into Australia. One wonders whether the Malaysian attitude to Antarctica is in reaction to the attitude of some sections of the Australian community with regard to importing Malaysian hardwood. I go no further on this, because it is not part of the Bill, but it is related and it is something which we should be giving real thought to. The present Government should at least be letting the Parliament know that it does have it under consideration at the very least, even if it has not decided to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The next thing I want to mention about the Bill concerns calls from certain sections of the community to make the region a world park. Let me say from the outset that the coalition rejects such calls. We believe that Australia has every right to continue to maintain its claims of sovereignty over some 42 per cent of the continent. I believe Australia's claims of sovereignty are not compatible with the concept of a world park. Under such a proposal there is not sufficient guarantee that proper environmental safeguards will be adhered to. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts in the last Parliament, and also this one, I was involved with an inquiry into tourism in Antarctica. The report of the Committee, which was tabled in May 1989, stressed the need for proper environmental controls over the Antarctic region. In the coalition's assessment, the concept of a world park would not be in the best interests of Australia, or of the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA> We are debating this Bill at a time when Antarctic Treaty nations are soon to have another round of discussion in Madrid. I believe they are meeting there next month. Honourable members will be aware that in December last year in Vina del Mar, Chile, Antarctic Treaty nations agreed to a draft agreement on measures to protect the unique environment of the region, but failed to agree to ban mining. The `Anderssen paper', as it has become known, will form the basis of the next meeting in Madrid. However, it does not rule out a permanent ban on mining activity in Antarctica. It is timely, therefore, that we are discussing this Bill today. The support of this legislation will demonstrate to the other 38 Treaty nations the seriousness with which Australia views environmental protection of Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill should serve as an illustration to the other Treaty nations of how important the preservation of this unique area is. It will, hopefully, provide the basis for other countries to enact similar legislation. The coalition is naturally supportive of this Bill-for it is our policy. The coalition has been united on this issue from the very beginning. There have been no turnabouts as there have been from the Government. We on this side get a little suspicious when we see no mining in Antarctica, no capital gains tax, no this and no that. </PARA>

<PARA> When the Minister goes to Madrid, she will go with a real endorsement from the whole Parliament on this issue. It is bipartisan, it is firm, and it should not be moved around merely because it is not fashionable in Madrid. I would like to stress to the Minister and the advisers who are to accompany her that this is just not a simple, local Bill for Australia. It is one through which we can maintain the pre-eminent role we have played for over a hundred years now in this fragile, delicate and, from photographs, this beautiful part of the world. I agree that the Opposition has led the way on this subject and we are very pleased that the Labor Government has followed it. We will always support the environmental protection of Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to finish by commenting on a couple of things that have gone before. There is great danger in tourism in Antarctica. For example, only a few days ago we were told by Richard Ferguson from the Mawson Institute in South Australia that between 40 and 50 tourist boats are going down into Antarctica this year. I am hoping the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) will make some comments on how it took him 26 days to get from the Antarctic to Australia. Richard Ferguson told us of some of the traumas of being a passenger on the Australian boat that went down for its first trip late last year. </PARA>
<PARA> I only mention the weather conditions and the fact that so many boats are going down there because no matter what precautions are taken, we cannot kid ourselves that there will not be some damage done to this fragile country. It may seem strange to call it fragile when it is virtually unlivable for most of the year, but it is that very situation that causes it to be fragile as far as modern development is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> It is going to take great strength on the part of the Minister, who has not been all that successful in recent weeks with her own Government. On this issue she must be totally strong. She goes to Madrid with our strongest support and our strongest support for this legislation which is very timely. I congratulate her on getting it through at this time. It is a real issue. I have been interested in the Antarctic for a long time, but have never quite had the time nor, might I say, the sea stomach to go on these visits to Antarctica which are regularly offered to members of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. I would say that it is probably more important in Australia, and I have not even touched on the greenhouse effect. It is so important that this part of the world is protected internationally and not just by those countries that now legally occupy the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that we will never see another trauma like that of which the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) spoke-the dreadful oil spill from the smash onto the rocks in the Arctic area. We do not have that problem of people walking through the Antarctic circle, which they can do in the Arctic. The Arctic is much more vulnerable to man than the Antarctic. While we take simple remedies such as banning mining, we add to the value of the Antarctic to future generations. It is important that this legislation be kept as it is and not altered in any way by the Opposition or by any turnabout by the Government in the next two years of its government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find myself agreeing with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) in complimenting the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) on the legislation which is currently before the House. It is certainly a welcome development in this House to have both Government and Opposition working hard to support legislation which I believe will, if successful, preserve a large part of our global environment which is very important, not only to human beings, but to our planet. I intend to make some comments in response to the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) who I hope might be in a position to hear them in the not too distant future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to some comments on my own views on Antarctica. I have to say that my own views are strongly influenced by a former member of this House, the former member for Dunkley, Bob Chynoweth, who, along with other members of this chamber, has had the privilege of travelling to Antarctica to examine first hand the work which is carried out by Australia's scientists in Antarctica. Bob Chynoweth, after his visit to Antarctica, sought to undertake an educational campaign to ensure that Australian Labor Party members of this House, and members of the Senate, were aware of the great importance of Antarctica and the need for Australia to change its mind on the need to persuade the world that there should be a ban on mining and oil exploration in Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that after the Wellington Convention developed a bit of momentum, there was a wide expectation throughout the world that most of the signatories to the original Antarctic Treaty would agree to put limitations and restrictions on mining and oil exploration in Antarctica but would still allow the possibility that that activity could be carried out in Antarctica. There were some people who argued that this would impose restrictions and establish rules which would have to be followed by countries or companies that sought to mine or explore for oil in the future. But it was people like Bob Chynoweth who argued that that was not good enough and that Australia should lead the way in trying to ensure that there was a total ban on mining and exploration for oil. </PARA>
<PARA> If I recall correctly, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was one of the first converts or one of the first victims of Bob Chynoweth's campaign to change our minds on this issue. With the support of not only the Treasurer but also the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Cabinet changed its mind and decided that Australia would advocate a total ban on mining and oil exploration in Antarctica. I remember the day on which Cabinet made that decision and certainly Bob Chynoweth was very happy with that decision. It is no secret, of course, that at that time the shadow Cabinet decided that it also would advocate a total ban on mining and oil exploration, and that is something for which I am prepared to give credit to the Opposition, because it was certainly one decision which it has made on environmental issues which all of us would welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time, Australia was in a pretty lonely position. None of the other original signatories supported the total ban and the great advance was made only when France and Australia both made the decision to support the total ban. Australia has had a very difficult relationship with France in recent years because of our differences of opinion on French nuclear testing in the Pacific and the unrest which has occurred in New Caledonia but, with the election of Prime Minister Rocard and the good personal relationship that has developed between the Prime Ministers of Australia and France, there was an opportunity for issues such as this to come up and for Australia and France to cooperate on them. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of whether there should be a total ban on mining or exploration for oil, Australia and France have worked very closely in trying to persuade other countries throughout the world that they have to reconsider their position, change their minds and support the total ban on mining and oil exploration. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the privilege of representing this Parliament on a visit to France last year. Everywhere we went, the French went out of their way to say that Australia and France were standing shoulder to shoulder in the international forum throughout the world supporting the total ban on mining and oil exploration in Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only an issue which has strengthened the strong relationship between Australia and France, but also one on which Australia and France have taken the lead throughout the world. I am sure the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who is in the House, would compliment Italy and Belgium for deciding to support the moves by Australia and France to promote the total ban on mining and oil exploration. </PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes people say small countries do not matter and that it is the superpowers that decide all of the big issues in the world. Here is an example where Australia, a small to middle sized country, together with France, a larger country, has set out to change the world's view on whether there should be mining and oil exploration in Antarctica. With the support of an increasing number of countries, I think we can expect that ultimately we will be successful; ultimately there will be a ban on mineral development and oil exploration in Antarctica. All parties in this Parliament should be very proud if they are able to clock up that achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> There are still some difficulties ahead. The United States is still saying that it does not want to close off all of the options indefinitely. I know that in the United States Senate, Senator Al Gore and Senator Kerry have put forward proposals which would support the imposition of a total ban on mining and oil exploration in Antarctica. I hope that their efforts to persuade the United States Congress to take a strong position on this issue are successful. I know that there is still some hope that President Bush will adopt a strong attitude on this issue, but to date we are not able to say that Australia and France have the same view as the United States President. If Mrs Thatcher could become a late convert to the green movement in her last years in office, there is some hope that George Bush will adopt a strong position on mining in Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> I know honourable members of this House would be concerned at the attitude of the United Kingdom and Japan. We would have hoped that they could have adopted a more supportive position in the conferences which have taken places to date. Perhaps, if a strong position is taken by the many people involved in environmental movements in those two countries, we could see a change in the views put forward at the next conference, which is to be held in Madrid. </PARA>
<PARA> What is so important about Antarctica? What is so important about the work which is carried out at the Australian bases? I think the reason it is so important is that it really is the last place on earth which has not been contaminated by man. Of course, the very harsh environment and the isolation of the continent mean that human beings have not been able to greatly disturb that part of our global environment. </PARA>
<PARA> You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there is a great deal of concern in the community about the effect that various chemicals have had on the ozone layer and the threat that this might pose for our planet in years to come. There is a great deal of concern that chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons could ultimately affect the ozone layer so much that there would be a far greater chance of our developing skin cancers and other organisms being more affected by ultraviolet radiation. It is in Antarctica, where the winds are uncontaminated by industrial pollution and the air is clean, that scientists can take accurate measurements of the thickness of the ozone layer and determine whether, in fact, that ozone layer is changing in a manner that can be measured scientifically. That is one of the few parts of the world where this research can be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who saw the damage which was done to the Alaskan environment by the Exxon Valdez spill several years ago would be aware that there is no way that scientific research can take place if we allow mining and oil exploration and, ultimately, the development of offshore oil wells. No-one could expect the environment to remain untouched, if that sort of industrial activity were allowed to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have to remember that scientists, by drilling cores into the iceshelf in Antarctica, can virtually go back in time and carry out scientific experiments to determine what our planet's atmospheric make-up was many thousands of years ago. Because the iceshelf on the continent of Antarctica is several miles thick at its thickest point, scientists can, if they drill down deep enough, obtain samples of ice frozen thousands of years ago. By looking at the various concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide in that ice, scientists are able to do calculations which give them some idea as to what the concentration of carbon dioxide was in the atmosphere several thousand years ago. They are then able to determine whether the earth's atmosphere has changed dramatically because of the Industrial Revolution several hundred years ago and our use of fossil fuels. In that way we are able to say whether the greenhouse effect is something that we need to be very concerned about and whether we need to take additional action. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the comments that I wanted to make on Antarctica. Before I finish, I want to make a few comments in response to the statements made by the honourable member for Pearce. I had hoped to make those comments while he was in the chamber because I understand he has been present for most of the debate this morning. I apologise to him for not making these comments in his presence but, obviously, he is busy with other commitments at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Pearce read into the record today a list of all of the achievements of the Fraser Government on the environment. I was not a member of this House in those days, so obviously I had to do some research before making a decision on his claims. In carrying out my research I came across a Bill that was presented in the Senate in 1982 called the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill, which I understand was put forward by the Australian Democrats and the then Opposition, the Australian Labor Party, in an attempt to protect World Heritage areas. </PARA>
<PARA> If one goes through the record one sees that the then Minister for Social Security, former Senator Chaney, was the one who said in the Senate that under our Constitution the Federal Government could not interfere with the rights of the State Government of Tasmania to dam the Franklin. While former Senator Chaney read into the record all of the great achievements of the Fraser Government, he forgot to emphasise that while the Fraser Government nominated South West Tasmania as a World Heritage area, it refused to take any action to use the foreign affairs power of this Parliament to stop the damming of the Franklin. </PARA>
<PARA> The first Bill introduced into the House of Representatives by the incoming Hawke Labor Government in 1983 was the Bill which allowed this Parliament to take action to stop the damming of the Franklin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister says, a close personal friend of Malcolm Fraser, the former Prime Minister. I am not sure whether they are on speaking terms these days, given his recent comments. Certainly, the Fraser Government claimed, and rightly, that it was the Government that nominated Kakadu National Park and the Great Barrier Reef as World Heritage areas. What honourable members opposite do not tell us when they mention that is how much of those areas were nominated for World Heritage listing. When one goes into the detail of this one finds that only stage one of Kakadu National Park was listed for World Heritage listing for protection. There was a great deal of debate about whether stage two should be included, and it was only when the Hawke Labor Government was elected that stage two and now stage three have been protected from mineral exploration and other developments which some people would have us look at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Fraser Government did nominate some parts of the Great Barrier Reef, but it was only after the election of the Labor Government that the then environment Minister, Barry Cohen, ensured that that protection was extended to the vast majority of the reef, not just to the particular areas that the Fraser Government decided to nominate. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important these days that we look at the record of the Liberal and National parties on environmental issues. This morning I heard the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) say on the AM program that he thought the pendulum had swung too far to the environmentalists. We can assume that the Leader of the Opposition will be trying to make sure that environmentalists have less influence on governments in years to come. I have to say to him that it is my view that the world is moving in a direction which will require governments, be they of Labor or coalition hue, to pay more attention to environmental issues. For the Leader of the Opposition to argue that we should pay less attention to environmental issues is a great mistake on his part. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make a few comments on another aspect of world heritage, Mr Deputy Speaker, because as you know this has been a wide ranging debate since the first contribution this morning, when the honourable member for Pearce discussed tropical rainforests in this debate on the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill. I hope you would also allow me the latitude to make a few passing comments on Lord Howe Island, which is, of course, another World Heritage area. </PARA>
<PARA> Lord Howe Island was nominated by the Hawke Federal Government and the Wran State Labor Government for World Heritage listing and, as the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) knows, it is a very beautiful part of Australia's environment which should be protected and preserved for many years to come. But there is an increasing problem on Lord Howe Island with pollution of the water table. I believe that the New South Wales Government, which is ultimately responsible for the administration of Lord Howe Island, should be taking action to ensure that the guesthouses and the residential accommodation on Lord Howe Island do more to properly treat the effluent of those guesthouses and the accommodation on the island. I understand that there is already some evidence that the water table is being affected by visitors to the island. I think Lord Howe Island is so important that it is worthy of the New South Wales Government putting some of its money into ensuring that there is a proper, modern, adequate sewerage system for that island. </PARA>
<PARA> Until recently, I understand that the Lord Howe Island Board obtained most of its income from the sale of kentia palms. I think it might be about time that the New South Wales Government did not force the Lord Howe Island Board simply to rely on the sale of kentia palms for income. Perhaps the New South Wales Government should put some of its own funds into ensuring that that environment is protected. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that as a World Heritage area Lord Howe Island should also qualify for some assistance from the Federal Government. The Federal Government has invested a great deal of taxpayers' funds into ensuring that the Great Barrier Reef and Kakadu National Park are protected and are open to the public and that some of the beautiful parts of those areas are not damaged by tourists.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill. In doing so, I am fascinated by the history of it and the philosophy behind it. Not to support the Bill would be like being against motherhood, and I am sure the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is not against that. But everybody who talks about the Bill gets a warm inner feeling that they have done something practical and worthwhile to save the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seemed to me a reasonable proposition that we should stand up and support that pristine environment of the Antarctic, until I started delving into the history of why this Bill came before the House. Perhaps if the Australian Labor Party had not so mismanaged and politicised the environment over the last decade, we would not have needed this Bill to come before the House at all; in fact, we would have worked towards and achieved a moratorium on a worldwide basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986, the then Minister for Science opened a meeting of consultative parties in Hobart to talk about the proposed mining in Antarctica. On 2 June, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the then Minister for the Environment issued a joint media release in which they welcomed the successful conclusion of negotiations for a convention to regulate any future mineral activities in the Antarctic. At about that stage the Treasurer (Mr Keating) stepped in-it was one of the only times I have agreed with what the Treasurer has had to say-and said, `I do not believe that we should sign that convention'. Perhaps we should remove him from the Treasury and make him the Minister for the Environment. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WT4">Mr RIGGALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps he is a latter-day saint too. The history of this is that the Labor Party was quite prepared to go down the track of endorsing a minerals agreement in that very pristine environment. It was only our leadership in intervening and bringing to bear public opinion and pressure that stopped that particular tack.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is worth having a look at the minerals that are in the Antarctic and their prospect of being mined. If we are talking about banning something, we should first have an understanding of what is there and ask ourselves whether we are talking about enacting legislation which gives us an inner glow or a warm feeling-which is a nonsense because it is not going to do very much-or doing something active. The report that I have says that perhaps the most valuable mineral in the Antarctic is platinum. Because of the environment and the safety requirements it would not be profitable to take any of that out. </PARA>
<PARA> The next mineral that seems to be in Antarctica in some sort of abundance is coal. There is no shortage of coal in the world at the moment and with the greenhouse effect it is not the flavour of the month, so we cannot see that going down there. It is claimed that iron ore is widespread in the area. Once again, that is abundant elsewhere in the world so we would not mine it. Copper occurs in the Antarctic, but it appears to be of poor quality in the ore base and not commercially exploitable. There does not seem to be any significant concentration of precious metals and there are only very limited outcrops of such things as molybdenum, nickel, chromium, cobalt, uranium, lead and zinc, and these do not seem to be in suitable quantities to mine. </PARA>
<PARA> Next we have a look at the seabed with its magnesium nodules. Once again we find a similar thing. They are of poor quality and in no way would it be commercially viable to extract them from the sea. Once again, we come down to the fact that it is not commercially profitable to do so. I guess the last thing-and the real catch 22 in this area-is the hydrocarbons or the oil deposits. There is evidence that there are quite significant reserves down there. Even in this case where there are significant reserves one has got to look at the practicality of mining oil in this extraordinarily hostile environment. If we tried to mine it on land we would have many thousands of metres of ice to go through. It is not a solid block of ice; there is shifting between the land and the ice. Honourable members can imagine how technically impossible it would be to put an oil drill into that sort of environment and hope to make it a viable proposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Prime Minister. On radio this morning he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Fortunately, this country has got a courageous Prime Minister and a courageous government.</PARA>
<PARA>When will the Prime Minister use his new found courage to make some real decisions, such as introducing a broad-based goods and services tax, especially when he has bipartisan support for doing so?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1879" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the fully deserved commercial he gave me; it was accurate. But even more important, in a sense, than being courageous is that the country has a knowledgeable Prime Minister and a knowledgeable government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To highlight the contrast in terms of our knowledge, as the Leader of the Opposition has done me the courtesy of referring to what I have had to say this morning, I will reciprocate and refer to what he had to say this morning. What he had to say this morning was fascinating. He was asked by Maxine McKew about waterfront reform and the Conaust deal. That deal, by the way, is only going to lead cumulatively to 1,500 people going off the waterfront and productivity improvements up to 70 per cent. What did the Leader of the Opposition have to say? He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well . . . I don't know where that comes from but the Conaust deal-it is rather novel that he-</PARA>
<PARA>that is me-</PARA>
<PARA>claims credit for that . . . they went outside the WIRA agreement in order to get that deal . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely wrong. The fact is that if we look at the front page of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) agreement, it specifically says that under those processes the parties can have recourse to conciliation and arbitration under the Industrial Relations Commission. That was not only what was intended but what was encouraged by this Government in regard to this deal.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition is one little boy out of step. The WIRA believes, the employers believe, the trade unions believe and the Government believes that this was done under the WIRA agreement. But no, that knowledgeable person, the Leader of the Opposition, believes that it was not. The fact is that it was achieved under the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> Having disposed not only of the lack of courage of the Leader of the Opposition but also of his lack of knowledge, let me come to the specific question about the broad-based tax. There is a very simple and compelling reason why I reject the insanity of what is involved in his question. Increasing the range of exemptions from wholesale sales tax under this proposal will lead in 1992-93 to savings of $700m to industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite say, `Ha, ha, ha!'. The problem with the Opposition is that when it is confronted with achievement, it has so much commitment to this country and its industry that it wants to deny the achievement. Fortunately, those who have a responsibility in this area-people in industry-have acknowledged the very real benefit, including the cascade benefit, of the wholesale sales tax exemption extension.</PARA>
<PARA> There is an interesting contrast between the impact of the Government's proposal and of the alternative of the Opposition. The Government's proposal will have a deflationary impact. It will mean that costs will go down; inflation will go down. But the broad-based consumption tax would lead to a massive increase in inflation. You would not simply have the first very significant one-off jump in inflation that would be associated with the broad-based consumption tax, but because you would have no basis of introducing appropriate and relevant compensation, the trade union movement would naturally introduce that increase into its wages claims. So you would not only have the initial increase in inflation associated with the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax, you would also have permanently built into the inflationary situation what would follow from inflated wage claims. That is the economics of why it would be absurd to go down the Opposition's route of a broad-based consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I go to an area which is totally alien and foreign to the Opposition-that is, the social impacts of the broad based consumption tax. Consistent with the absolute lack of concern of this Opposition and its Leader for the welfare of poor Australians and the most disadvantaged, it would introduce--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the Prime Minister announced yesterday that it is the intention of the Commonwealth, in cooperation with the States, to mount a project to examine the best practice and the characteristics of excellence within Australia's 10,000 schools.

Of course, the education system has a great deal to do with that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When asked whether it is a good idea to spend $10m over three years in trying to discover and extend what is best in our good schools, he categorically said no. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition would be interested in what the New South Wales Minister for School Education has had to say about this matter. Mrs Chadwick said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I first raised the idea of exploring the key qualities of Australia's outstanding schools at the meeting of Education Ministers in Adelaide last December . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Since that time, I have held a number of discussions with Education Ministers in other States, seeking their support for such a project.</PARA>
<PARA>I am very pleased that the Commonwealth has announced that they will commit $10.5 million over the next three years to fund this program on behalf of the States.</PARA>
<PARA>Principals, teachers, parents and the local school community will all be involved in highlighting the best practice taking place within our schools.</PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to point out:</PARA>
<PARA>We will not just be doing this as a totally introspective exercise in Australia, but we will be inviting the people from the OECD to tell us in Australia how we also can gain from the best practices of schooling elsewhere in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>But most importantly, Mrs Chadwick says this, and perhaps the Leader of the Opposition might take note of this:</PARA>
<PARA>The investigation will take the education debate in Australia beyond ideology and theory.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the real question before us. If we are interested in the quality of our schools, it is not just a matter of putting up some half-baked ideas about how to finance schools through vouchers, or having some other harebrained ideas which seem to flow so easily off the top of the head of the Leader of the Opposition. It is a question of working out how we can work cooperatively with the States which, after all, run most of the schools; how we can learn from the best which is going on within our schools, and transfer that excellence to all schools in Australia. I think once again we have seen half-baked Hewson in action, and he would be well advised to take some advice from a colleague in his own Party in New South Wales, Mrs Chadwick.</PARA>

I ask: is it not true that goods used in most pre-production activities are already exempt? The Treasurer made goods relating to the ordering of raw material exempt last Budget. The Australian Taxation Office already exempts goods associated with the rehabilitation of mining sites, and notwithstanding continual contest by the Tax Office, the courts have consistently awarded exemption from wholesale sales tax of goods used by manufacturers or miners in the transportation of goods by mail, pipeline or conveyor.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The country areas program is one of several programs administered by my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training which are targeted to assist Australians who live outside our metropolitan areas. With his indulgence, I am happy to inform the House of the benefit of this program's increased funding and what it will do for country Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I gather that the Leader of the Opposition is especially needful of information on this important topic so I hope he pays attention. It may be useful for him when he goes to Hamilton later this month to explain to a former conservative Prime Minister and his friends and neighbours why the coalition has no policies for rural Australia. I hope he is aware that this Government's policies have resulted in an overall massive increase in school retention rates, with something like 63 per cent of students now completing year 12 compared to 36 per cent when we came to government. Unfortunately, the fact is that country retention rates lag the national average by around 5 per cent. It has probably escaped the current conservative Opposition's attention-but it is busy coming up with new ideas to float, I do grant it that.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government currently spends more than $13m per year under this program in a special effort to improve the standard of education for young people in regional Australia. This funding directly benefits approximately 1,000 country schools. The program supplies funding directly to these schools with the express intention of making education more interesting and stimulating for students. It does this through a variety of methods which are relevant to the local conditions. They include supplying mobile classrooms, funding visits by specialist teachers to isolated schools, helping with travel to regional and city centres for work experience and visits to scientific and technical facilities, and supporting tours through regional Australia by musical and theatrical groups. In short, the program provides country students with the same stimulation and educational variety that their city counterparts take for granted.</PARA>
<PARA> This extra $15m will be spent on the program in the next three years and it is going to increase the effectiveness of this very important program. I am confident that we will begin to see country retention rates climb to match the national average. The major benefit will be increased job opportunities for young Australians living in the country.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, this decision is based on the considered advice of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. My colleague the Minister asked the board to examine the effectiveness of the program. This is in line with his commonsense approach to government-a quality all Cabinet members and members on this side of the House have in abundance, although it is reportedly only recognised in a few of us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just let me say that we can get the position of the honourable member for Gilmore into perspective. Let us remember what this honourable member has had to say about the Government's reforms in the area of shipping and the waterfront. I refer, first of all, to what he had to say in this place in the area of shipping and the waterfront on 14 November of last year. He said this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Looking at the Government's performance in micro-economic reform of coastal shipping and the waterfront, we find that its greatest area of success has been in shipping. It has had some notable reductions in manning levels from the low thirties towards the low twenties. The Government should be congratulated for that-we must give credit where credit is due because this is a notable change.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that much credit should go to Pat Gerahty of the Australian Seamens Union. We will also go to what he had to say about the waterfront. Talking about the process of reform on the waterfront, the honourable member for Gilmore in this House said:</PARA>
<PARA>The approach of the Liberal and National parties has been to support the Inter-State Commission's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very important. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>We recognise they are not perfect . . . However, we do believe that they are a good basis for fundamental structural reform.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said, and in fact that is precisely the basis upon which the Government has proceeded and has achieved, as I said in this place yesterday, productivity reforms which will amount to up to 70 per cent on the waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me make this point: that is, under processes following from the Inter-State Commission's report which was supported by the honourable member for Gilmore, who has asked me this question, and in respect of the area where we have a direct constitutional responsibility to act--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to activity by the port authorities, we are engaged in negotiations with the State governments. There is a clear recognition by the State governments that they have the rights, the obligations and the responsibilities in the area of the conduct of the activities and the structure of their port authorities. This Government is doing everything it can in cooperation with the States to ensure that they make the changes in the operation of their port authorities which will supplement and complement what this Government has done in its area of responsibility. It is only the Federal Government, according to the processes supported by the honourable member for Gilmore, that can do something about the employment practices, that can get rid of the absurdity of the pooling arrangements, get enterprise agreements, get 1,500 people off the waterfront by the end of this year and get 70 per cent productivity improvements. We can do that under our constitutional authority and in our area of responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the other areas to which he refers, we are doing what we can to ensure that those things are done directly at the level of State governments to make those changes, which, I may say, is in direct contradistinction to what the Leader of the Opposition had to say this morning. His contribution was in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>So, some of those will need the cooperation of State governments. It's why our shadow Minister is speaking with some of Nick Greiner's people, to try and be quite specific how that might be done.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition has got his people talking to some of Nick Greiner's people. Good on you, John; keep going. But while he is having some of his people talk with some of Nick Greiner's people, we are tackling the job by dealing, not with some of Nick Greiner's people, but with the Premiers of each State, to get them to discharge the responsibilities which they, under our constitutional position, have.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lilley for her question and her continuing concern for the interests of young people, particularly those who are trying to enter the work force. It is important to recognise that in some areas of the education system there is no direct relationship between the labour market and education participation, indeed, as the labour market has turned down somewhat, education participation has gone up. Of course, that is in recognition, amongst other things, of the realisation by young people that if they want to get better jobs and keep those jobs they need to have a greater attachment with the education and training system for as long as possible. In a couple of areas they cannot get the training without first having an employer, and that is particularly the case in apprenticeships and traineeships where, if one does not have an employer to employ one, one does not have access to the training. So the Government has been particularly concerned to take action to ensure that those young people who are in apprenticeships and traineeships do not lose their training opportunities as a result of the downturn in the labour market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we go back to the recession of 1982-83, we find that this happened in a great number of cases. Of course, the Government at that time took very little action to prevent this occurring. This Government is determined to see that some action is taken to ensure that those who are in apprenticeships are not dislodged. Therefore, amongst the things we are doing is to provide assistance to employers who are likely to dismiss their third or fourth year apprentices because of the economic difficulties so that they can keep them on and so that they can complete their training. As well as that, we are providing a training allowance to unemployed apprentices and trainees to complete their theoretical training. We will also be funding industry to conduct special training courses for unemployed apprentices, particularly those in their third and fourth years, to enable them to complete their theoretical and practical components of their apprenticeships, as well as paying them this particular allowance.</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a way in which we can ensure that those who have started their apprenticeships can complete them. Therefore, Australia will have the skills available to it when the economy recovers, when we will surely need those skills in abundance to undertake the kind of structural adjustment which this Government has in mind.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us get the orders of magnitude right according to what the question involves. It has been estimated that the savings involved in fixing up the Australian waterfront are of the order of $1 billion. The estimate of the savings that are involved in regard to transTasman shipping is $70m. Therefore, not unnaturally, this Government, in dealing with the question of micro-economic reform, gave its priorities to tackling what has been regarded, not only by the Opposition but also by many commentators, as the litmus test of the Government's commitment-that is, the Australian waterfront. I would suggest that no-one would question the good sense of giving priority to tackling savings of $1 billion against the possibility of saving $70m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To make sure that we maximise the chances of getting these savings on the Australian waterfront which add up to $1 billion, we have concentrated on that area and we were not going to do anything which would complicate those negotiations, as would have been done in that area. As our eight years of government have shown, the process of microeconomic reform is a continuing process, and the issues involved in the question asked by the honourable member for Gilmore remain on the agenda.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The overriding tasks of this Government, which are embodied in the Prime Minister's statement to the Parliament yesterday, are, firstly, to close the gap between science and the market in this country and, secondly, to match the technology push and the demand pull that are capable of being developed within this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some important initiatives are contained within the statement which was delivered yesterday, but before I turn to them can I say that we should not be addressing this problem at the expense of our fundamental long term research. We do have a strong commitment to ensuring that that base is secure, and honourable members would be aware of our commitment, announced in January this year, to give triennium funding to the science agencies so that they can plan over the longer term. In addition to that, yesterday's statement announces that we will develop a national direction in science and technology through a four-year White Paper proposal that has come to us from the Australian Science and Technology Council. In addition to that, the Government has announced the expenditure-and I will be announcing the first 15 tomorrow-in the cooperative research centre program which will involve $100m of additional money to get this linkage between research and its application. But the important thing to understand is that if we are going to get this linkage and commercialisation, we cannot concentrate just on public sector research.</PARA>
<PARA> There has to be a strong emphasis and thrust in relation to getting the private sector to spend more money on research and development. Indeed, this Government has been very successful in getting a stronger commitment to research and development from the private sector. Since 1981-82-when the Opposition left government-private sector research has trebled in this country in real terms. That has happened because we have provided initiatives such as the tax concession-which the statement yesterday says will continue indefinitely under this Government-and the grants for industrial research and development program which yesterday's statement widened in terms of the applicability for them. It is the combination of this approach to both the private and public sectors in the research area that has seen this Government in the last Budget increase expenditure by 2.3 per cent in real terms for research and science related activities. That is our commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that, we placed emphasis in yesterday's statement on the commercialisation of research. I will read from the back pages of the statement because I must say that this aspect did not get terribly much coverage in the reportage of the statement today:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is to commission further analysis of Australia's performance in commercialising research, the impediments to commercialisation and methods of improving the commercialisation of that research. Both public and private sector models exist to carry out these functions and the review will examine the models and other methods of other encouraging more effective linkages between Australia's research effort and the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA>So what we are saying is that there is very strong commitment out of this statement to encourage commercialisation.</PARA>
<PARA> A specific reference in the Prime Minister's statement yesterday was to a commitment to support the development of a biotechnology industry in this country by way of a bounty. A company called Sirius will gain from this bounty about $7.3m over the next few years. This is not a protectionist method. Rather, it is a subsidy to overcome a distortion that has been created in this economy because of a decision the Opposition took last year in the Senate that had the effect of whacking up the price of the raw material sugar in this country. With this bounty announcement we have demonstrated that we are prepared to support this company because of its significance to a $10 billion global market arising from the chemical application in the cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and food industries. We have been prepared to put our money in and support this company in order to overcome a distortion that Opposition members have created. I commend the detail of all those announcements to honourable members on the other side to understand how we are approaching the research and development effort in this country in order to get industry going properly.</PARA>

In this letter from Howard Smith Industries, under the heading `Trans-Tasman', it is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In November 1990 the first cargo of gypsum in this vessel was carried from Thevenard to Lyttleton and Auckland.</PARA>

<PARA> As you would appreciate, we are actively pursuing return cargoes suitable to the vessel's unique discharging system as well as the carriage of wheat to New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA>Properly, the final paragraph of this letter from people in the industry-not from these cheap slicksters here on the other side-says:</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion we wish to express our appreciation of the advice of the Unions of their ongoing cooperation in maintaining a flexible approach in respect of the granting of leave to the crew of this vessel.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I have a media release of 27 February from Mobil Oil Australia Ltd, in which it talks about what it is doing about the improved productivity of its new ship, the Tasman. In this regard-and this has been received from people in trans-Tasman shipping operations, not these people here-it says:</PARA>
<PARA> The tanker has less crew, uses less fuel and carries more product than the vessel it replaced, the Australis.</PARA>
<PARA> There are 23 crew compared with 39 on the Australis.</PARA>
<PARA> Product capacity is up from 25,000 tonnes to 30,000.</PARA>
<PARA> Fuel consumption is down by nearly a third.</PARA>
<PARA> The combined savings in terms of the cost of delivering products from refinery to terminal are expected to be up to 20 per cent.</PARA>

The Tasman is an excellent example of these reforms being adopted by industry.</PARA>

This is an important initiative of the Government, one in which we expect to get the very willing cooperation of the States and one which I am sure will be welcomed by employers and young Australians alike.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course they are relevant. Did honourable members hear the answer from our friend the honourable member for Gippsland? When I said, `Why don't you take account of the facts?' he said, `They are not relevant'. That captures it all: the facts are not relevant. We accept that the facts are not relevant to those opposite, but fortunately they are very relevant to everyone else. So I say that in that period only one country had an increase in the volume of manufactured exports which exceeded that of Australia. The OECD average was 131; we went up to 179-a 79 per cent increase. Only the United States had an increase in volume which exceeded that of Australia. Those are the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we are talking about yesterday's statements by the honourable member who asked this question, I suppose we can test finally what the people of this country can expect in terms of a comparison between this Government and the Opposition as represented by that honourable member. I shall tell the House what this gentleman said on 27 February in response to a question at an industry seminar. The question asked whether the Opposition would have the guts to reform the waterfront. The honourable member for Barker delivered himself of this truly memorable answer:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't know.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members have not heard the best of it yet. In answer to a specific question about whether they would have the guts to deliver, he said:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am able to report progress. I think all honourable members are aware that the Government made an offer to all the States and Territories in December 1989 to participate in what was referred to then quite correctly as the Prime Minister's black spot program. It consisted of two parts. The first part provided $110m to the States and Territories over a period of three years to make it possible for them to identify and to correct those death spots on their road network.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conjunction with that, we requested the States and Territories also to adopt a 10-point road safety package which included things such as a .05 blood alcohol limit, national licensing of heavy truck and bus drivers, national speed limits, a graduated licence system for young drivers, and greater enforcement of seat belt and breath testing requirements. It also included a zero blood alcohol limit to cover drivers of heavy vehicles, dangerous goods and public transport vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important elements was the question of identifying those black spots. I can understand why this question would be of concern to the honourable member for Richmond. He had indicated, even before he became a member of this Parliament, his concern about some of those danger spots on the north coast of New South Wales and along the Pacific Highway. I have had the opportunity to inspect some of the danger spots, and I am sure that the honourable member will be pleased to know that we are in the process of considering the New South Wales program. I think some of those spots in his electorate that he has indicated concern about will be fixed up.</PARA>
<PARA> Those programs now have been announced for Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. I do not know whether the honourable member for Franklin has any of those in his electorate, but the programs have been announced. The announcement of the program for Victoria is imminent. Consideration of the programs for New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory will be undertaken shortly; we are having a good look at those.</PARA>
<PARA> Notice that one area of Australia stands out: that is, the Northern Territory. I have not yet received confirmation from the Northern Territory that it will accept the $5 1/2m that the Prime Minister undertook to provide for it, $2 1/2m of which will be provided in the first year. I will give the reason why the Northern Territory has not yet come on side and indicated that it is prepared to accept that package of 10 major road safety initiatives. All honourable members, including members of the Opposition, will find it difficult to believe the reason for this. It is simply this: it is a question of whether for three years or two years the Northern Territory would be prepared to insist that young drivers have a zero blood alcohol concentration level.</PARA>

<PARA> Coming to the public sector-this Government has been much tougher in its dealings with the unions in the public sector than any government before. As the honourable gentleman will know, I do not say that in terms of some sort of macho approach to these things. We believe that public servants in this country, Commonwealth public servants in particular, enjoy very considerable benefits. They have award wage conditions which are the subject of conciliation and arbitration and which are very satisfactory. Their conditions of employment are sound.</PARA>
<PARA> When we came to office we found that there were some areas in which the attitude of the Public Service was not as progressive as we thought it should be. If one looks back over the period of this Government in office, one will see that we have had some significant confrontations, not of our choosing, with the public service sector. I say that to the honourable member by way of background to indicate that there is no cosy, comfortable relationship between this Government and the Public Service. I do say this: I believe, generally speaking, the Commonwealth Public Service has served this Government and this country magnificently during our period of government, and nothing I am saying in any way derogates from that.</PARA>
<PARA> On the issue of unionism, and membership of trade unions, I do not resile from the fact that from the very time I entered public life as a servant of the trade union movement-and I am proud to have had that background before coming to this Parliament-I had a very basic view: if a person had a genuine, conscientious belief that he or she did not want to have anything to do with a trade union, I personally could understand that view. But one very rarely finds that view, because the person--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make it quite clear that one often hears the view expressed, `Yes, I don't want to have anything to do with trade unions'. That sounds marvellous, but the very people who say, `I don't want to have anything to do with trade unions', have their hand out to take the benefits of the wages and conditions which are worked for by members of the trade unions. As far as I am concerned, the trade unions are then entitled to say, if they in fact take the view that people should be members of trade unions, that that is a legitimate position. As far as the Australian work force is concerned, the majority of people are members of trade unions. Unions have played an enormously important role in advancing this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, what I find most disturbing about the honourable gentleman's question-and he is better than this-is the suggestion that there is some way in which the trade union movement of this country acts against the interests of the country, that they are something to be knocked. The fact is we have received cooperation from the Australian trade union movement. I ask the honourable member to recognise these facts: that we have had a 10 1/2 per cent reduction in real wages-and I am referring to non-farm unit labour costs-as a result of the contribution of the trade union movement. Industrial disputation has more than halved, and we have had a rate of employment growth twice as fast as the rest of the world. None of those things, none of those great achievements for this Australian nation, would have been possible without the cooperation of the trade union movement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To say that the community has given the industry statement only a lukewarm response would be a considerable understatement. Virtually every section of the community has expressed disappointment in the contents of it. I think that that highlights the fatal flaw in the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). More than anything else, it represents a lost opportunity. Really, what did we get? We got only half a statement. The Prime Minister was prepared to kick away the walking-stick from underneath Australia's protected industries, but he did not have the courage to take on his mates in the trade union movement and pinch a few feathers out of the beds upon which they lie.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one reads the Prime Minister's speech, he virtually admitted that the Government was only able to go as far as it did and that to go further would have been impossible for the Government because of the restraints of the accord. The truth is that every morning he bows down before the accord before he goes off to work, and when the real future prosperity of our country is resting in the balance he really is not prepared to put Labor's sacred cows out to pasture and get on with the reform that this country is crying out for.</PARA>
<PARA> There were really no surprises in yesterday's statement. I think the explanation for that is that there is so much internal turmoil within Labor's ranks, so many factional fights, that virtually everything in the statement was leaked to the press well in advance. So it was that the whole exercise has been a mighty anti-climax. It is no wonder that industry leaders have been so disappointed-the very industry leaders to whom the statement was primarily directed. The Prime Minister took over the presentation of the statement really as a mark of the importance with which he treated it, and yet then failed to satisfy the expectations he himself raised. </PARA>
<PARA> On the big issues, one would have to say that the statement was either silent or entirely inadequate. On the costs of capital-for example, interest rates-and on the costs of labour, the Prime Minister said virtually nothing. On fiscal policy-and really it would have been reasonable to expect a comment from the Government on fiscal policy-it must be remembered that it was only eight months ago in the Budget that the Government said that fiscal policy was the rock upon which its economic policy was based. In the last eight months we have seen $8 billion virtually disappear. That is $1 billion a month. It is the most amazing case of a vanishing surplus in Australia's political history.</PARA>
<PARA> What did we get from the Government yesterday on fiscal policy? Virtually nothing from either the Treasurer (Mr Keating) or the Prime Minister. They said they would ameliorate the outlays measures in the Budget, but they forgot to mention how they would deal with the revenue side. It is on the revenue side that we have the really big ticket items-in round figures, something like $700m out of $800m of the effect of the measures. So they are loosening fiscal policy yet again. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to debt, from hearing either the Treasurer or the Prime Minister yesterday we would not know that this country has a massive debt, and a cumulating debt, of $131 billion. The word `debt' did not even pass from the lips of the Treasurer and we got only a perfunctory mention of it from the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of inflation we got only a few sentences from the Prime Minister and only a passing reference from the Treasurer. Their policy is that they hope inflation will come down, but they do not propose any fundamental changes to a system that has delivered high inflation for this country for the last 20 years. Instead of scrapping the accord, which is what we would do, I have no doubt that in the weeks and months ahead the Kelty-Keating duo will be hard at work again putting together another deal, another accord, which will ensure higher inflation and low wages for the workers they claim to represent. Yesterday was an opportunity for some meaningful reform within the context of an integrated and comprehensive reform package. We did not get it, and as a result I think we will all be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement did, however, take some steps, albeit generally small ones, in the right direction. If we look at where the money is spent, we will see that the two biggest ticket items are in the area of tax measures and tariffs. My colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) will deal in detail with the tariff issues. I think it is fair to say that they generally go in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The big costs, where producers must be competitive, are in tax, interest rates, labour costs, the Australian currency and transport and communications. If producers cannot be competitive on those, the real result of yesterday's statement is that the Government invites Australian industry to enter the international boxing ring to face the foreign competition, but with both hands tied behind their backs. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate over resource security has been one of the most amazing sagas we have had. The Government has introduced this concept and broken a promise to the greenies in doing so. It has introduced the idea of resource security because it broke so many promises in the past and created real uncertainty in the investment climate. The promise now is that we will have a legislated promise in the future that the Government will not break its promises. The Treasurer bitterly opposed that decision and he made sure that his opposition was leaked to the Australian Financial Review. When the Treasurer stands after me, he should tell us what he told the Cabinet about resource security. </PARA>
<PARA> On tax measures, we welcome any relief for business, particularly at the time of a recession which has been induced by this Government. On the wholesale sales tax exemptions, I think the Treasurer has been too clever by half. His business input exemptions are worth $375m, but the total incidence of wholesale sales tax on business inputs is $5 billion to $6 billion. Exemptions of $375m are great as far as they go, but how far do they go against a total incidence of $5 billion to $6 billion? It is just a drop in the bucket. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the explanation for the figure of $700m. The Treasurer has tried to crank it up and make it look better because he knows that the $375m is barely worth having. If he wants to challenge that, he should table the calculations when he stands to speak after me. He did not even mention the fact that on Australian exports the wholesale sales tax incidence is about $1.2 billion-a massive penalty on the very people we want to encourage, Australian exporters. Furthermore, not only is relief minimal but also the truth is that it adds complexity on top of an already ramshackle system. </PARA>
<PARA> The real reason for yesterday's reforms is that the Treasurer could not get himself a consumption tax at the Tax Summit. He knows it is the right policy and I think he rightly senses that, when we win the next election with a consumption tax in our platform, that will put an end to his claims as a tax reformer. He does not want to be remembered as the Treasurer who did not have the guts or the clout to introduce a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> As usual, the Treasurer is prepared to do anything and to say anything to oppose a reasonable measure. What do we get? We get the hotchpotch of reforms that we had yesterday. What does the Treasurer do with regard to this issue? He visits the issue. He is no big thinker, and he deserves to be remembered for the mess he has made of the luxury car tax. It is a policy disgrace. No self-respecting, self-professed tax reformer would ever turn up with the dog's breakfast that we got from the Treasurer yesterday on the goods and services tax. Look at what the experts have said; they have absolutely panned the Treasurer from one end of the country to the other. Let us take the comments of all of the senior tax experts in Australia. David Vos of Coopers and Lybrand, an acknowledged expert and authority on this issue, said:</PARA>
<PARA>They haven't gone very far at all. They have taken a few anomalies that have been problems in the courts . . . They should exempt all inputs. </PARA>
<PARA>Arthur Andersen and Co. said that `grey areas would remain' and that the statement had, in fact, made the grey areas bigger. Peat Marwick said that the exemptions were minuscule. Deloitte said that `there were still uncertainties over how the concessions would be applied'. Price Waterhouse-this one really got the Treasurer between the eyes-criticised the proposal and then, delivering the coup de grace, said that it `believes the Government should introduce a consumption tax'. Good point. </PARA>
<PARA> I will use four general points to explain the complexities of these wholesale sales tax changes. Yesterday the Treasurer introduced some exemptions for fork-lift trucks at ports and he heralded this as a great step towards improving export trade. The fact is that, as a result of yesterday's decision and as a result of the ramshackle system that we already have, there are a whole lot of distortions and discriminations in the system. In other words, we tax some people some amounts and other people we do not tax at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at fork-lifts. Let us take, for example, goods which are made in Melbourne and used in Hobart. In each factory along the production process-the distributor's warehouse, the wholesaler's warehouse and the retailer's warehouse-there is a fork-lift truck. In the factory in Melbourne on the fork-lift truck no tax is paid-that is exempt. But the wholesaler pays tax on the fork-lift in his factory or shed and the distributor pays tax on the fork-lift in his warehouse. If goods are taken to the port in Melbourne and then to Hobart, no tax is paid as a result of the exemption which the Treasurer gave us yesterday. But as the goods are shifted to the retailer's warehouse, tax is paid again. It is just a mess from start to finish. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that the Treasurer announced things yesterday that are already practised. For example, the Australian Taxation Office already exempts goods associated with the rehabilitation of mining sites. The Treasurer announced this fantastic measure yesterday, and we find out last night as we go through the fine print that in fact that has been practised for another reason. Another reform was introduced yesterday, but the reason it was introduced is that there have been some court rulings which required the Tax Office to provide the exemption. That was not a reform initiated by the Treasurer; it was forced upon him by the legal system. Of course, goods relating to the ordering of raw material were exempt in the last Budget. I asked the Treasurer a question about that in Question Time, and he did not have a clue. </PARA>
<PARA> We have built-in delays. Why do we have these delays? I rang a tax expert this morning-something the Treasurer obviously has not done for a long time-and I asked him for a comment about the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer should listen. He loves to come back with personal abuse, but the truth is that this tax expert told me this morning at 11 o'clock that he had already had three phone calls from three big multi-national corporations which are deferring investment decisions because of the uncertainty which was created by yesterday's sales tax exemptions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now pick up on the last point. We had a lot of discussion during Question Time about the importance of apprentice training-and it is important. We share the Government's policy objective. But for years and years-the Government has been in for eight years-the Government has been taxing some of the products used in apprentice training schools. So yesterday the Treasurer said, `We've done a great thing; we've removed this tax impost on those who are involved in training apprentices'. But he has removed it only in respect of the training of apprentices who are on the staff of the person operating the school. I give an example of the civic-minded employer who has a decent facility for training apprentices, who does not make a cent out of it-so it is a non-profit organisation-and, to further the Treasurer's policy objective of boosting training for apprentices, decides to take in the apprentices of some of his fellow employers. </PARA>
<PARA> What does that do? It jeopardises the exemption given yesterday. It just makes a complete mockery of the Government's proposal. Here is a proposal to exempt, but when one reads the fine print one finds that there is a clawback so that the Treasurer can get his tax after all. This jeopardises the whole policy intent of the proposal in the first place. It is just one more `grey area', as described by one of the leading tax experts. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of questions again remain unanswered regarding depreciation. It is the fifth depreciation that this Government has introduced in eight years and yet it reckons that it is going to do something about certainty in the investment climate. Who knows that we will not get another depreciation from the Government in 12 months? So far we have had them on a constant basis. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of questions are raised. For example, how committed to self-assessment is the Government really when taxpayers are requested to annotate their tax returns?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last point the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia (Mr Reith) made about self-assessment underlines graphically his lack of understanding of all the measures introduced by the Government, apart from his general lack of understanding of the tax system or fiscal policy in Australia generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader talked about self-assessment. He said that people annotate their tax returns, so how could this be self-assessment? He thinks self-assessment is an optional tax paying scheme-that is, if one does not want to pay tax, one self-assesses oneself out of tax, but if one feels that one has a social obligation, one self-assesses oneself into tax. Self-assessment is subject to an audit procedure. If one wants to elect a rate of depreciation outside of the schedules, one has to say that one has done so. The Commissioner of Taxation can then examine the quality of one's claim of, say, a three-year write-off instead of the scheduled six or seven. This does not cut across the principle of self-assessment at all; it just gives the taxpayer the advantage. Instead of having a six-year or seven-year depreciation rate, the taxpayer might be able to make a case for two or three years. If a person believes that such a case can be made, he or she annotates the return. When the return is looked at by the Commissioner for an assessment to be raised, the Commissioner can accept or reject the advice which the taxpayer offers. That is what self-assessment is about. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party does not understand the concept, but how would he understand? Some tax accountant put a sheaf of notes in his hand yesterday and so he is up here today with a question. I challenged him to ask a second question, which he could not do because he could not rephrase it without advice, since he does not know what he is doing. He then stood up here and gabbled this stuff from the same notes. What he said is essentially wrong-just like the point I made about the notion that an annotation on a self-assessment form cuts across the notion of self-assessment or, in other words, that self-assessment ought to be about electing the rate of tax one can pay and whether one can rort the system. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand the high principles in the Liberal Party where that sort of view comes from-principles with which the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party would be entirely familiar. But the fact of the matter is that that is not what self-assessment is about. It is a freedom given to taxpayers to state what they believe their costs are and their income is and therefore to get the benefit in the year in question of a higher or better after-tax rate of return. Then in the audit process, if the Commissioner does disagree with a particular aspect of that self-assessment, an assessment by the Commissioner can be produced changing the taxpayer's tax liability. The honourable member just does not understand it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party then went on about the manufacturer and the wholesaler who both have a forklift. We are not here doing anything for wholesaling. We are doing it for manufacturing; it is for inputs to production. Maybe if I write that down for the honourable gentleman he will understand what it means: P-R-O-D-U-C-T-I-O-N equals inputs to production, not wholesaling. </PARA>
<PARA> Some wholesalers actually import, and generally we do not go out of our way to help the wholesaling path. So there we are: inputs to production. Does the shadow Treasurer understand? That is what the point of the thing was. No, he missed the point altogether-but of course it is easy for him to miss the point, is it not? The shadow Treasurer is saying that I do not understand what I am doing. Then the shadow Treasurer put out a statement yesterday. It is absolutely riddled with tomfoolery. As we go through it, he mentions `pooling of assets'. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Pooling of assets within the same class will over time introduce simplicity. But given that the rates will only apply from 1 July, there will continue to be a 5:3 accelerated depreciation pool. So there will be the 5:3 pool, the 1 July 1991 pool, and the post-July 1991 pool. The fact is broad-banding and pooling will apply to all assets pre- and post-July 1991 except 5:3 assets. </PARA>
<PARA>So what does the Opposition ask us to do: wipe out 5:3 depreciation retrospectively? Is that what it is asking us to do? We can tidy it up by taking that concessional 5:3 depreciation out retrospectively. Is that what the Opposition is arguing? I mean, honestly, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) ought to be in a club doing a stunt act, a review. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even the honourable member for Barker would understand that. I will give him that. Further down, the shadow Treasurer says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There is no level playing field that exists so that the manufacturers applying directly to retailers would be in a better position to compete. </PARA>
<PARA>I have just said goods to resell are not taxed at all. Do they understand this point? We are not taxing the goods which pass through the chain. It is an input to the capital expenditures incurred by producers. The shadow Treasurer goes on to talk about some of the other ones. He makes his point on storage and handling. Then he says:</PARA>
<PARA>The major areas of concession appear to be ordering of goods, some environmental aspects, lighting under production-related . . . and storing, handling and dispatch in warehouses controlled by the goods producer and from the main manufacturing site. </PARA>
<PARA>So what? I know the shadow Treasurer did not write this, the poor thing. Someone else had to write it for him. But being of course political oafs, they have produced a political oaf's product. I am determined that he should not spoil my fun, so I said at Question Time, `Ask me a second question'. Of course he could not rephrase one; he could not put one together. </PARA>
<PARA> They were the closing remarks. Let me just go through some of the opening remarks about the cost of capital. As to interest rates, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government had nothing to say about that. </PARA>
<PARA>We have only reduced interest rates by 6 percentage points in the last 13 months, and both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and I speak about it regularly. We talk about lowering inflation, lowering nominal interest rates, lowering the cost of capital. Why he believes that we had to say that in the statement as well as most days in Parliament has me beat. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Treasurer then talks about small steps in the right direction. The whole of the tariff wall of Australia, constructed by the dullards of the conservative parties of this country, has been since 1949 wiped down by Labor Governments-by the Whitlam Government in the early 70s and now in two stages by the Hawke Government-and he says it is `a small step in the right direction'. The Opposition's cowardice! It gave away import quotas to every lobby that banged on its door. The shadow Treasurer knows that was true. Jack McEwen used to say, `Just step this way'. He was always trying to secure a relationship with manufacturing to one-up the Liberal Party. That was his way of getting his agrarian influence into capital city manufacturing. Of course, the conservatives never ever had the courage to take the portfolio off him. So he built this amazing tariff wall with quotas and protection, and a Labor Government comes along and says, `Look, the only hope we have is to internationalise the economy; let's wipe it away'-and it is only a small step in the right direction, says Goofy over there. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same small step in the right direction, blatant untruths were fabricated by the Leader of the Opposition on the same subject last night when he had this to say-and I will read it slowly so he can understand the import of his gross misrepresentation, `I give credit where they floated the currency, but it was implementing decisions that were under way in the previous Government'. What a massive untruth; what a despicable untruth. He sat there cowardly with a managed, overvalued exchange rate, the Government moved out of the road and he said, `Yes, I give credit for that'-he was being reasonable and making a good fellow of himself by giving credit, but then came the untruth-`but it was implementing decisions that were under way in the previous Government'; in other words, all the things that he is so embarrassed about--</PARA>

I never thought he was so well spirited'. But the thing is, he was glad to be relieved of the task. There was a crushing recession, profits had gone through the floor, investment had smashed and there was an overvalued exchange rate. He was bewildered and, all of a sudden, another government came along and said, `We'll show you the way. We'll fix it up'. As we did, we could see the relief come over him. He put out statements supporting what we were doing and everyone was saying, `Gee, John's an agreeable little guy'. But the truth was that he was like every other member of a conservative government in a jam-just relieved to be out of office, just as he is now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those opposite claim to be the people of business and to know how it all works but, when the first challenge came along-double digit inflation in the 1970s-they did not know what to do about it. When they finally had to identify the long running problems of the economy-lack of competitiveness and all the things that went with it, such as wages, the exchange rate, exchange controls, the tax system and tariffs-they just laid down with their craven weakness obvious for everybody to see. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They made the changes; they happen to be in power. Let me remind the Treasurer of a couple of things. He may have forgotten that in the 1960s some of the farming organisations were telling Black Jack McEwen and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) of the cost of protection to them and to the mining industry in this country. The Government was supported by the ACTU, and the Treasurer and his forebears no doubt were right in it. I think those opposite ought to remember a few of those things. The Treasurer will remember that in 1985 we came into the Cabinet room to tell him-and he took a bit of persuading-that the farmers of Australia were paying $6,000m as the cost of protection. He took more than persuading; he walked out on us at the end of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the subject of Australia's competitiveness, I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) earlier whether he thought the latest international measure done by IMD and the World Economic Forum indicated that what he said yesterday-which was that we were more competitive-was true. Of course, he sought to give some other answer and, in the process, he took it upon himself to report some remarks I had made to a shipping industry luncheon in which my final words were, `You will have to trust us or vote Labor'. There is not much to add to the story, except that the Prime Minister failed to report that when I mentioned in that forum the possibility that those present might seriously consider voting Labor the whole room collapsed with laughter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister said yesterday that the country is becoming more competitive. I say to those opposite that there are no international measures-and they are the only ones that count-that show that this country is becoming more competitive. I mentioned in the question the world competitive scoreboard done by the Lausanne University and the World Economic Forum. They put out a chart that shows that Australia is now running thirteenth instead of tenth in group 1. In group 2 we are headed by Thailand, Malaysia, Korea, Hong Kong and, of course, Taiwan, Singapore and the rest. This is an internationally comprehensive study; it has taken 300 different aspects of competitiveness in this country and it shows that we are going backwards faster than we would like to admit. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why what this industry statement did not do yesterday is quite catastrophic for Australia. What it did not do, of course, was accelerate waterfront reform by abolishing security of tenure and breaking the waterside workers' monopoly. It did not phase out cabotage. It did not terminate the trans-Tasman shipping agreement. It did not give a full commitment to effective competition in telecommunications. It did not address land transport issues and it did not even mention the word `privatisation'. It did not make a decision on the three-mines uranium policy. It did not make a decision on Coronation Hill. So it did not send any messages out that would give business the confidence to invest. </PARA>
<PARA> What it certainly did not do was genuinely address voluntary unionism or scope for negotiation at the workplace. As the Business Council of Australia has told us very clearly, the statement did not even address at the edges the $20 billion-odd that they say is possible in extra income if Australian firms attain the world's best practice. What happened in regard to the luxury car tax? The Government brought it in one year and threw it out the next. What happened to the development fund? Those people would not even sign up. They would not sign up when it came to the crunch. They would not put in their $100m apiece-putting aside the problems the trustees of those super funds would have had if they even sought to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's violent complaint is that this statement has not dealt with the one part of the picture that it could have dealt with. It has dealt with only a small part and that is the tariff reduction portion of the debate. We agree with that reduction. But business has told the Government time and time again, the academics have told it, the press has told it, even the Government's own press has told it, every international comparative work has told it: the Government cannot do one without the other. Let us take the most pertinent and recent example, the Australian automotive industry submission to the Industry Commission. In that submission the industry made the very important point:</PARA>
<PARA>The overriding requirement is for comprehensive synchronised reform. This means that any gradual, pre-announced reductions in border protection must be accompanied by comprehensive macro- and micro-economic reform which aims at raising productivity . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The submission goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The alternative approach would be to impose rapid reductions in protection, designed to bring prices under international competitive pressure, but without more than cursory attention being given to the supply or the cost side. </PARA>
<PARA>It then illustrates the second scenario. It says that if the costs go ahead, as they would, and then we bring prices down with rapid assistance reduction, we get a whole series of losses. It says, however, that if we go back to the first scenario what happens is that, the minute we introduce the comprehensive reform side of the package, profits accrue. That is evidence enough, one might say, but further on in that paper it compares Australia's status quo in regard to attractiveness. We are shown to be behind Korea, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and the rest. The submission then says that, if we brought about these comprehensive reforms, in today's terms a change would take place which would put us ahead of Malaysia, Canada and the United States and just behind Japan and Germany. That is what would happen if we did these things that are so obvious, but they have not been addressed in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> This substitute for an industry statement deals with only one part of the problem. Our complaint and the world's complaint this morning, as evidenced in the newspapers, is that the Government has left out the other side and the most comprehensive side of this whole problem. </PARA>
<PARA> For all the reasons that I and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) have said, I believe that the pressure that this one-sided document will put on industry in Australia will have the totally unintended consequences of making the Industrial Relations Commission irrelevant and of breaking the power of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in this country. If that has to happen to get Australia moving, God speed to it!</PARA>

We are privatising Aussat Pty Ltd, levering in a competitor. That competitor will compete across the network. He has seven years to get himself up and running, and then it is open competition after that point in time-recognising that there are enormous barriers to entry in order to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, we are providing for additional cellular mobile licences, which is now one of the most competitive areas of telecommunications. We are allowing for almost unlimited competition in the cordless telephone area. We are allowing a regime of resale on leased lines, which is the most liberal regime internationally, with the unusual combination of being liberal not only domestically but also internationally. Very few countries permit that. We will have to take a very careful look at how we do that so that our own telecommunications industry does not totally disappear as a result of our allowing monopolists in other countries to come in and take advantage of that liberal regime. </PARA>
<PARA> In telecommunications, we now have what are comparatively the most liberal arrangements anywhere-and effectively liberal. New Zealand technically has more liberal regulations; people can do anything they like, except that they cannot get an interconnected price and structure out of the main carrier that in fact enables them to compete. Let me turn to the situation in Sweden. There is no legislative monopoly, but the control of the system is placed in the hands of the monopoly carrier, and it cannot get effective competition levered in. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem in all these areas is that, when we actually get down to the detail, the Opposition does not think and does not work. Maybe the Opposition spokesman in this area will know a deal more than the people who have been speaking in this debate. He claims such expert status on it. But there is no evidence from the spokesman who just spoke, who is supposed to have some sort of courage in the micro-economic reform area, that he understands a single thing about what has been done. He does not have the technical knowledge, and he does not have--</PARA>

<PARA> What do we have on his views of what ought to be done for the waterfront? We have a couple of additional throwaway lines in this great speech to the Australian Chamber of Shipping. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> ``By the time the election comes there will be a number of important people in this room who will know exactly what the process of reform will be . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is pretty good. In two years the Opposition will actually have a position. We are all to wait with bated breath while it develops a position on the waterfront. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>``Your question is `will we have the guts to do it' (reform the waterfront)-I don't know. George Bush said `read my lips' and he backed down (on United States taxes). </PARA>
<PARA> ``I can only say you're going to have to either trust people or keep voting Labor.''</PARA>
<PARA>He interprets the huge laugh after his statement as relating to the suggestion that the people present might vote Labor. I think that other people looking at these answers might have a different interpretation of why that huge outburst of laughter occurred. But he did say one thing which was valid. Perhaps it is the first sign on his part of the getting of wisdom. He was sure that there would not be a one-off solution or a shortcut to solve industry problems. Is that not so?</PARA>
<PARA> There was another sign of the getting of wisdom yesterday, not from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and not from the statements that he happened to make about the Commonwealth deal going outside the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA), which is a load of nonsense. Just to conclude that argument, let me read from the statement of the Industrial Relations Commissioner who brought down the statement on it. In determining these issues, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I have had regard to . . . that the negotiations and final agreement shall be subject to the terms of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) In-Principle Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) pointed out, he always anticipated being part of the process that the IRC would be used when necessary. That was in the heads of agreement, of which the honourable member for Barker seems utterly incapable of reading. Again, it is evidence of policy sloppiness. I do not know how the Opposition works out its policies. I remember that when the Australian Labor Party was in opposition, it really used to work on policies. It went through them in very great detail so that when people asked the obvious questions about them, it had a few answers. The Opposition is totally sloppy. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition was asked the following question on AM:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . you make it sound as if it's easy. Surely, if it was easy it would have been tackled years ago?</PARA>
<PARA>HEWSON: ``Nothing is easy in this business and there's no substitute really for a long, hard slog of structural reform. </PARA>
<PARA>Hear, hear! We will agree with that. But McKew was a bit pressing on this question. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>But I'm sure you'd be the first to admit there's no magic wand, you can't say that you'll come into government tomorrow and bang, we'll have an efficient waterfront. I mean, what sort of timetable do you think we'd have to be looking at?</PARA>
<PARA>Here is his timetable. It is good to know this. Dr Hewson answered:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, we've looked at the process over this decade in terms of working down to negligible protection by the year 2000, and doing that hand-in-hand with structural reform across the board. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition will have the waterfront reformed by the year 2000. Good, fine; I will not mock him for that. That is what he has stated. He is getting to a point of honesty here. He continues, referring to SPC Ltd:</PARA>
<PARA>Now, that's a very quick and decisive improvement. In other case cases, sure it will be more difficult on the waterfront to stay with your particular example, it does involve cooperation with the States, so you would need the State Premier's to be part of the process in putting enterprise bargaining into place and developing competition between ports and privatising port authorities, all the key elements of the reform process. Some of those will need the cooperation of State Governments, it's why our Shadow Minister is speaking with some of Nick Greiner's people . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again, when we actually get Dr Hewson in reflection as opposed to spokesman on the front bench here, we begin to get the impression that it is at last beginning to dawn on him that we have a process of change under way that is hard and grinding. When I was on television the other day-people love to cite Rotterdam in these debates-I said that the WIRA process would introduce reforms that within three years would have a substantial effect in increasing productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Unbeknowns to me, there were several people here from Rotterdam involved both in the unions and in the management in that place. One of them said, `Well, the Minister is a bit optimistic. It took us 10 years in Rotterdam. He is saying that he will do it in three'. They did not comprehend that all I was talking about was the stevedoring end of the industry, but he did point out what is undoubtedly a fact. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition will have to concentrate on this. Once the WIRA process is through, in the stevedoring area there will be very little left to do. There will be an enormous amount left to do as far as State port authorities are concerned, both in their own work practices and manning levels and in regard to the actual infrastructure of ports. </PARA>
<PARA> What makes ports really successful is not so much their work practices, important as they are, as their own infrastructure. That is what gives them enormous efficiencies-the fact that they bring rail right onto the waterfront; the fact that they do not warehouse at the waterfront. There is an effective way of getting goods off the waterfront and into the system. To get such situations in place involves the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> The port authorities are another problem. Within Cairns, for example, through our reforms the work force has gone down from 23 people to 10. It so happens that the Cairns Port Authority--</PARA>

Some Opposition members seem to understand it; some of them admit that they do not actually have policies in this area-they have attitudes. It is an Opposition with attitude. Opposition members wander around the place expressing attitudes-an obscene chant of attitudes-on these sorts of matters, but they do not have policies. However, every now and then in reflection, in their heart of hearts, they know what this process involves, that it is a hard, solid grind of micro-economic reform and that it never ends. There is no concluding process. It has to change all the time. We understand that, and the processes that we have put in place produce micro-economic reform.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will amend the social security legislation to implement some relatively minor initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, the Social Security Act provides an assets test exemption for certain pre-paid funeral expenses. Generally, this involves a person entering into a contract with a funeral director where he or she pays over money and the funeral director agrees to provide a funeral service at some future time. However, some investment companies now offer funeral bonds. These allow people to set aside money for the payment of funeral expenses without necessarily committing themselves to a particular funeral director. Income accrues to such bonds. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill introduces an exemption from the income and assets tests for these bonds provided that the bond has a contribution limit of $5,000 or less per funeral-$10,000 or less in the case of the funerals of a married couple-and cannot be redeemed before maturity on the death of the investor or the investor's spouse. A person will not be able to benefit from both the exemption for funeral bonds and the existing exemption for pre-paid funeral expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition of `income' in the Act at present does not exclude certain scholarship payments. As a result, a person could have a social security payment cancelled or reduced under the income test on receiving a scholarship payment. The Government has decided that, with effect from 1 September 1990, a scholarship awarded from outside Australia to a person is to be excluded from the person's income if the payment does not include any component for living expenses and if the Minister approves the scholarship payment for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria has cast some doubt on whether existing provisions of the Social Security Act enable the Commonwealth to recover social security payments from compensation payments where State or Territory legislation purports to make such compensation payments inalienable. This Bill makes it clear that the Commonwealth can recover social security payments in spite of such provisions in State or Territory legislation. The Bill also makes some minor technical amendments to refine and clarify measures introduced in the last year. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is one of several social security Bills to be introduced during the current sittings. Other Bills will provide for the transition from the Social Security Act 1947 to the clear English Social Security Act 1991, update the Social Security Act 1991 to take account of social security initiatives introduced during the Budget sittings last year and provide for the implementation of initiatives announced in the 1990-91 Budget such as the Newstart strategy and disability reform. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill will provide for the transition from the Social Security Act 1947-hereafter referred to as the 1947 Act-to the Social Security Act 1991-the 1991 Act. The Bill will achieve four specific objectives. It will:</PARA>
<PARA> - repeal the 1947 Act;</PARA>
<PARA> - provide for the transition from the 1947 Act to the 1991 Act;</PARA>
<PARA> - consolidate all applicable savings provisions; and</PARA>
<PARA> - make consequential amendments to other Acts. </PARA>
<PARA>The overall aim of this Bill will be to achieve an uncomplicated transition so that the general administration of pensions, benefits and allowances will continue as normal under the legislative scheme of the 1991 Act. Social security recipients will not be disadvantaged by the transition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will provide that where persons are receiving a pension, benefit or allowance they will continue to do so without having to lodge a new claim form. It will provide arrangements for the treatment of claims and reviews which had not been determined before the repeal of the 1947 Act. It will also provide for other administrative matters such as the continuity of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and its members. The Bill does not have any financial impact.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill has the effect of making the existing Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (DFRDB) scheme a closed scheme. That is to say that the only persons who will be permitted to join the superseded scheme will be pensioner re-entrants who choose not to join the new Military Superannuation and Benefits scheme and a couple of rare classes of re-entrants. However the DFRDB scheme will last for many years. When all existing contributors have retired there will still be pensioners under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973-the DFRDB Act-and is mainly directed to improvements in the administration of the DFRDB scheme, by removing uncertainties about the operation of certain provisions and to make some minor improvements to the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The DFRB scheme of 1948 also remains in existence for pensioners only. Some of the amendments are appropriate for that scheme and the Bill accordingly includes amendments of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948 (DFRB Act). </PARA>
<PARA> The matters dealt with in the Bill include:</PARA>
<PARA> - changes to the constitution and manner of appointment of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority to reflect its more limited role;</PARA>
<PARA> - compulsory cessation of contributions by members who have at least 40 years effective service;</PARA>
<PARA> - provision of specific power for the DFRDB Authority to classify and reclassify members for invalidity purposes in certain cases of death;</PARA>
<PARA>continuation of payment to a spouse of a deceased member, for a period after the death of the pensioner, of a pension at the rate previously payable to the deceased pensioner;</PARA>
<PARA> - changes in the nature of the benefits payable to members who retire a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments to the two Acts will have a small impact on the costs of the DFRDB and DFRB schemes. Continuation of payment of a full pension to the spouse of a deceased pensioner for six pay periods after his or her death will result in increased costs of $160,000 per annum. Some of this additional cost will be offset by administrative savings. The estimated cost of providing a commutation option for re-entered DFRDB pensioners on their subsequent retirement from the Defence Force would be around $88,000 per annum. The DFRDB revenue foregone as a result of the cessation of contributions for members with 40 years service will amount to $36,000 in the first year after this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The other changes in the Bill will have a minimal cost impact. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill gives effect to a Government decision announced last August to introduce a new superannuation scheme for Australia's regular Defence Force personnel. The scheme, to be known as the military superannuation and benefits scheme (MSBS), is intended to take effect from 1 October 1991. The scheme was recommended in the report of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme Review Committee under the chairmanship of Sir William Cole, a former Secretary to the Department of Defence. The report was tabled in this House last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The MSBS has been designed to comply with the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987, which sets out the Government's guidelines on the structure and operations of superannuation funds. The scheme also finalises arrangements for the treatment of the 3 per cent productivity benefit, which has been paid in respect of members of the Defence Force since 1988. In compliance with the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act, provision is made for the scheme to be governed by a trust deed and be administered by a board of trustees. </PARA>
<PARA> An important feature of the MSBS is that it provides equitable treatment for members of the Defence Force who serve for less than 20 years. Under the present defence force retirement and death benefits (DFRDB) scheme, these members receive only a refund of their contributions when they leave the Defence Force. They receive no interest on their contributions and no employer benefit except the 3 per cent productivity benefit. This is contrary to community standards. Under the MSBS, members will have returned to them not just their contributions but also whatever these contributions earn in the MSBS investment fund, and will accrue an entitlement to a substantial employer benefit in addition to the 3 per cent benefit. The MSBS will have the following features:</PARA>
<PARA>A. Contributions at a rate elected by the member, in the range of 5 to 10 per cent of salary. Contributions will be invested in a fund and returned to members with earnings when they leave the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA>B. An employer benefit which will provide a full range of options, that is, lump sum payments, pensions calculated at a rate more generous than that available in the commercial annuities market, or a combination of both. The 3 per cent productivity benefit will be part of this. The total employer benefit must be preserved until age 55 or later retirement from the Defence Force except in special cases. </PARA>
<PARA>C. Invalidity benefits for those members retired from the Defence Force on medical grounds with a disability which appreciably affects the person's civil employment. </PARA>
<PARA>D. Reversionary benefits for spouses and children of deceased members or deceased pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA>E. An appeals system for persons dissatisfied with decisions of the Board of Trustees or its delegates. </PARA>
<PARA>The occupational superannuation standards prevent the inclusion in the MSBS of the benefits structure of the DFRDB scheme which allows members to receive a life-indexed pension, part of which can be commuted to a lump sum, on resignation at any age provided they have served for 20 years. The existence of this benefit has encouraged many members to serve to the 20-year point who might otherwise have resigned earlier. Its necessary omission from the MSBS, combined with the availability of a lump sum refund of members' contributions, with earnings, on resignation will lessen the incentive for members to serve to the 20-year point and thus has the potential to increase the premature loss of personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> To offset this, the Bill provides a retention benefit payable to certain members who complete 15 years continuous full time service and undertake to serve for another five years. The benefit is equal to one year's salary and is taxable as income. Conditions attaching to payment of the benefit are set out in the Bill. The benefit will be administered by the Department of Defence, not by the trustees of the MSBS. </PARA>
<PARA> Persons joining the regular Defence Force on or after 1 October 1991 will automatically join the MSBS. Members who are contributors to the DFRDB scheme on that date will have the option of remaining in that scheme or joining the MSBS. Membership of the MSBS will also be available to reservists who render continuous full time service for periods of or exceeding three months, and to reservists who render continuous full time service for less than three months with a unit of the Defence Force allotted for duty in an operational area. </PARA>
<PARA> Members will have until the end of September 1992 to decide whether to join the MSBS unless they retire or resign earlier, in which case an earlier decision will have to be made. Each member will be provided with the information necessary to enable him or her to make a considered choice and individual counselling will be available. </PARA>
<PARA>Permanent Part-Time Service</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The report of the review committee included a proposal for inclusion in the new scheme of provisions which would be appropriate for permanent part-time service if this were to be introduced for the regular Defence Force. However, the present legislation governing the rendering of service by members of the Defence Force makes no provision for the rendering of permanent part-time service and, until it does, it would not be appropriate to make provision in MSBS. If permanent part-time service is introduced changes will be required to a number of Acts and the necessary changes to MSBS would be included. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of MSBS has a number of financial impacts resulting from:</PARA>
<PARA>A. The funding of MSBS member contributions. </PARA>
<PARA>B. The funding of the 3 per cent productivity benefit for MSBS members. </PARA>
<PARA>C. The provision of a retention benefit to members of the requisite rank who have completed 15 years service. </PARA>
<PARA>D. The credit of notional interest to the DFRDB contributions of members transferring to the MSBS. </PARA>
<PARA>E. Increased administrative costs during the MSBS implementation period including the provision of advice to members on their transfer options. </PARA>
<PARA>F. The change in the form of the primary superannuation benefit from a pension in the DFRDB scheme to a lump sum in the MSBS. </PARA>
<PARA>G. The deferral of payment of the MSBS employer-financed superannuation benefit until members reach 55 years of age in the majority of cases. </PARA>
<PARA>It should be recognised that these costings are dependent on assumptions made about future behaviour and circumstances-such as transfer rates, commutation decisions and consumer price index increases-many of which cannot be tested against actual experience for many years. </PARA>
<PARA>Short and Medium Term Impacts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> There are bring-forward costs associated with the introduction of MSBS in the short and medium terms. These will result mainly from the funding of member contributions and the 3 per cent productivity benefit in MSBS, the provision of the retention benefit, and the transfer provisions. The estimated net impact of the introduction of MSBS on annual budgetary outlays for Defence Force superannuation is expected to be $151m, rising during the transitional period to $209m for 1994-95. Budgetary savings are expected to commence in about 35 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Longer Term Impacts-Current Defence Force Membership</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government Actuary and the consulting actuaries have forecast that the expected net long term employer costs, after tax and social security clawbacks, for current members who join MSBS will be less than the projected net long term employer costs of the DFRDB scheme for these members if they remained in that scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Net Employer Liabilities for Current Defence Force Membership</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The estimated net reduction in costs of superannuation for the past and future service of current members of the Defence Force is $690m. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Albury-Wodonga Development Amendment Bill amends the Albury- Wodonga Development Corporation's membership arrangements, changes annual reporting requirements, introduces reciprocal mobility rights for staff and approves execution of the Albury-Wodonga area development agreement amendment agreement (No 2). These changes are part of a package of wide-ranging reforms to the Albury-Wodonga project. The reforms have been agreed amongst the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian governments as partners in the project. Complementary State legislation and relevant Commonwealth-State agreements are also being amended. </PARA>
<PARA> The three governments have decided that the Corporation is now to concentrate on profitable development and marketing of its land holdings. Nevertheless, it will continue to play an important role in land use and social planning, economic development and promotion of the area, although primary responsibility for these functions will reside with the relevant local government bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The reform package has four main thrusts. First, Corporation financial management practices and accountability to the three governments are to be improved. The Commonwealth and the two State Albury-Wodonga Corporations will be able to produce one consolidated annual report instead of three separate reports, one for each Parliament, as has been the case until now. Amendments to the Albury-Wodonga area development agreement will remove impediments to the preparation of consolidated accounts and remove redundant provisions for determining the amount of money appropriated by each government for the Corporation's activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Other important measures, such as performance reporting and attentiveness to the profitability of property development, are already being introduced on Albury-Wodonga Ministerial Council authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, the activities undertaken by the Corporation are to have their scale and focus changed. Most functions and responsibilities normally undertaken by local government are to be handed back to local government, including land use planning powers and provision and maintenance of physical and social infrastructure, such as roads, sewerage, open space and community centres. Except for participation in matters of region-wide significance, decided periodically by the Albury-Wodonga Ministerial Council, the Corporation will operate on the same basis as any other property developer. Transition arrangements are currently in place. Collectively these measures will give the community, particularly through its elected members in local government, the power to determine its own future. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, the Corporation's three full time executive members are to be replaced with part time equivalents and responsibility for day-to-day operations is to pass to the Corporation's most senior staff member. Local government membership on the Corporation is to be changed from being the mayors of Albury and Wodonga on an ex officio basis to the appointment of a member of each council. Reciprocal mobility rights for staff are being introduced. The Corporation's internal organisation is being restructured to reflect its new role and objectives. These measures will ensure the Corporation's structure is prepared for implementation of the reform package. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the unwieldy provisions governing returns for equity holders will be replaced with simpler mechanisms. This will make it easier for the Commonwealth as the owner of almost all the equity in the project to obtain a better return on its $120m investment in the project. </PARA>
<PARA> These reforms are included in proposed amendments to the Commonwealth-State Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance Act 1973 financial agreement. In keeping with that Act, the agreement's amendments will be tabled in this Parliament when executed by the three governments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991, which is now before the House, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. This Bill gives effect to the tariff changes announced by Senator Button as part of the ministerial statement-Building a Competitive Australia. The Bill also contains some amendments which have previously been introduced as customs tariff proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The major tariff changes announced yesterday fulfil the Government's commitment to continue, beyond 1992, the tariff reforms initiated in 1988. The importance of these changes is the certainty that this announcement will provide to the importing community in setting the tariff regime for the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains measures relating to general tariff rates, measures for the specific industry sectors of agriculture, passenger motor vehicles and textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF). The amendments to the general manufacturing ad valorem rates implement phased reductions to 5 per cent by 1 July 1996 for tariffs greater than 5 per cent at 1 July 1992. This will continue to reduce the disparities in the effective rates of assistance between Australian industries, further flatten the tariff, encourage rationalisation of less efficient activities and reduce input costs to other trade-exposed sectors of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes are also proposed for the preferential tariff arrangements for Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan Province and the Republic of Korea. From 1 July 1992 the tariff rates for these countries will be frozen. When the general tariff rate reaches or passes the frozen rate the general rate will apply. This action recognises the rapid improvement in their economic situation, and the widening disparity among countries traditionally considered to be `developing'. This disparity creates differing needs for international trade assistance by way of preferential treatment. The United States recently recognised this in their `graduation' of these four countries from preference arrangements. The amendments in this Bill will be consistent with these moves, and with the original purpose of preferential arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case, the freezing of tariffs applying to these countries will ensure that no tariff rates will increase for them. Some preference will continue to be available until the general tariff rate phases down to the rate applying to developing countries at the start of the freeze. Where the general tariff rate remains unchanged, these countries will continue to enjoy the 5 per cent preference margin. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to convert fixed and composite tariff rates to ad valorem equivalents wherever possible and consistent with Australia's international obligations. These tariffs will be reduced in line with the general reductions in tariffs and will be brought forward in a future Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Tariff assistance for agricultural industries will phase down after 1992 at the same rate as the general manufacturing sector to 5 per cent by 1 July 1996, with the following exceptions: vegetable products-which are phasing down to a tariff of 10 per cent by 1 July 1994-will continue to phase down at the same rate as the general manufacturing sector to 5 per cent by 1 January 1998. Post-1992 assistance arrangements for the dairy, sugar and tobacco growing industries will be determined in the context of Industry Commission inquiries. An inquiry into the dairy industry is currently under way, an inquiry into sugar will commence in the near future and tobacco growing will be reviewed in 1993. In the interim assistance for the sugar industry should be brought back within the spirit of the 1988 decision to reduce general tariffs to a maximum of 15 per cent ad valorem equivalent by 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, it is proposed to adjust the specific tariff rate for raw and refined sugar to $76 per tonne at 1 July 1991 and to $55 per tonne at 1 July 1992. By maintaining a specific tariff rate, the sugar industry will remain protected in the event of low world prices over this period. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements for passenger motor vehicles maintain the successful policy direction already established by continuing the existing rate of tariff reduction, while making the export facilitation scheme more flexible and rewarding to those firms prepared to make investments to considerably expand exports. </PARA>
<PARA> They are designed to focus the Australian industry on increasing its viability and international competitiveness at reduced levels of tariff assistance, achieving a higher level of global integration, and improving product quality at reduced real prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements also reflect the Government's desire to reduce the cost to the community of supporting industry. The new arrangements retain the current schedule for tariff reduction until December, 1992. From January, 1993:</PARA>
<PARA> - Tariffs on passenger motor vehicles and original equipment components will continue to be reduced at the current rate of 2.5 per cent per year, reaching 15 per cent by the year 2000;</PARA>
<PARA> - Tariffs on light commercial and four-wheel-drive vehicles, as well as on components for these vehicles, will be reduced from 15 per cent in line with the general tariff reductions, while</PARA>
<PARA> - Tariffs on replacement components for passenger motor vehicles will be maintained at 15 per cent until 31 December 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also moved to provide for a definition of forward control vehicles in the Customs Tariff Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Assistance changes for the TCF industries will extend to the year 2000. Tariffs will commence phasing in on 1 March 1992 and will reach a maximum of 25 per cent in the year 2000 compared to the current planned level of 55 per cent by 1995. Quotas will be abolished by 1 March 1993, two years ahead of schedule. The Government's decision to accelerate TCF tariff reductions is aimed at bringing TCF assistance more into line with the rest of manufacturing while recognising the special adjustment problems within the sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The pace of restructuring since the current plan was announced in 1986 has not been sufficient. Protection levels have remained very high. This has tended to attract resources into the least efficient areas of production and has negated any incentive for the industries to restructure and become internationally competitive. Although the current plan would have made significant reductions in protection by 1995, TCF assistance would still be much higher than that currently programmed to apply industry-wide. The tariff quota system in particular has tended to counteract reductions in protection. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes incorporated in this Bill are designed to encourage the development of a more internationally competitive TCF sector which will be viable with lower levels of community support. Australian consumers stand to benefit from better products at cheaper prices. Economy-wide effects will accrue from the more efficient allocation of resources. In line with these objectives:</PARA>
<PARA> - All quotas will be terminated on 1 March 1993 and out-of-quota duty rates currently programmed for 1 March 1992 will be halved. </PARA>
<PARA> - Tariff rates will be reduced as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> - apparel and certain finished textiles to phase down to 25 per cent by 1 July 2000;</PARA>
<PARA> - footwear, cotton sheeting and fabrics to phase down to 15 per cent by 1 July 2000;</PARA>
<PARA> - footwear parts and existing non-quota TCF goods to phase down to 10 per cent by 1 July 2000;</PARA>
<PARA> - TCF goods already having rates of 15 per cent or less to phase down in line with general reductions for general manufacturing tariffs;</PARA>
<PARA> - The textile yarn bounty will be phased from 30 per cent value-added on 1 July 1992 to zero by 1 July 1995 when it will then be replaced with a 5 per cent tariff. </PARA>
<PARA> - An import credit scheme will operate from 1 July 1991 to 30 June 2000 to assist those firms who have the best chance of becoming internationally competitive to prosper in an environment of lower protection. </PARA>
<PARA> - Import credits will initially accrue at the rate of 30 per cent of the domestic value added of TCF exports and will phase to 15 per cent of the domestic value added over the period of the scheme. The scheme will exclude exports of wool, wool tops and raw cotton as well as all exports to New Zealand</PARA>
<PARA> - the credits can only be used to reduce tariffs on TCF imports and will be freely transferable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to extend the existing duty free entry provisions for capital equipment. The savings in import duty will encourage the undertaking of industrial projects in Australia, greater participation of Australian manufacturers, the boosting of Australia's international competitiveness and increased exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The specific assistance measures are:</PARA>
<PARA> - Extending the split consignments provisions available under item 43 in schedule 4 to certain capital equipment falling within chapters 86, 87 and 89 of schedule 3. This will allow the importation of complete capital equipment or parts of this equipment in separate consignments at the rate of duty applying to the complete plant. </PARA>
<PARA> - Extending duty free entry for minerals processing equipment not made in Australia in the ordinary course of business. This is achieved by amending item 45 in schedule 4 and will encourage the downstream processing of our resource based industries and further enhance our international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> - Extending item 42a in schedule 4 to allow shipbuilders to enter duty free all components for the repair, modification and construction of vessels greater than 150 gross construction tons. This will enhance their international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Other industry specific measures are:</PARA>
<PARA> - The provision for duty free entry of bountiable machinery for working advanced materials such as engineering ceramics, composites and polymers. This action is in conjunction with the extension of the machine tools and robots bounty which will give uniform treatment for all machine tools covered by the bounty, and will allow end users access to the latest equipment at world prices while continuing to give assistance to local industry. A new item in schedule 4 will give effect to this measure. </PARA>
<PARA> - The removal of the duty on printed circuit boards classified to heading 8534 in schedule 3 from 1 July 1991. This reflects the decision to assist local value added production of printed circuit boards by means of the computer bounty scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> - Binding tariff rates on certain vegetable products at 10 per cent as a result of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, to guide members through the sections and schedules of the Bill: clause 3 of the Bill inserts new subsections 19 (1a), 19 (1b) and 19 (1c) into the principal Act to maintain the preference advantage for Canada and Forum Island countries over general rate countries and to cater for the selective phasing out of developing country preferential rates for goods of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan Province and Republic of Korea origin. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill amends subsection 26 (1) of the principal Act by inserting two tariff subheadings in the table in this subsection. This amendment will allow the consumer price index adjustment factor to be applied to the rate of duty for certain mixed spirituous beverages of these subheadings. The changes are operative on and from the thirteenth day of February 1991. Schedule 1 is effective on and from the seventeenth day of August 1990 and provides a free rate of duty for aluminised steel for use in the manufacture of automotive muffler exhaust systems and components. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments contained in schedule 2 reduce the rate of duty on certain coated fabrics covered by item 40e of schedule 4 from 16 per cent to 8 per cent and delete the upward phasing rates which would have been fully implemented in 1993. These amendments are operative on and from the seventeenth day of October 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments contained in schedule 3, operative on and from the twenty-fourth day of December 1990, address administrative problems associated with the importation of industrial crafts covered by schedule 5 of the Customs tariff. The amendments remove the necessity for industrial crafts to be made of woven material and clarifies the batik process. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 4, which operates on and from the first day of January 1991, introduces a free rate of duty for defibrillators, heart pacemakers and wheelchairs. These changes are a result of the Government's decision on the Industry Commission report Aids and appliances for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 5 puts in place the tender quota and tender extension rates of duty for textiles, clothing and footwear goods for the period 1 March 1991 to 29 February 1992. Schedules 6, 7 and 8 implement the major tariff initiatives announced as part of the ministerial statement Building a Competitive Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The initiatives to allow duty free entry of aluminised steel for use in the manufacture of automotive muffler exhaust systems and components will involve a revenue loss of $1.83m in the current financial year and $2m in 1991-92. Tariff changes to wheelchairs, defibrillators and heart pacemakers will involve a loss of duty in this financial year of $400,000 and $890,000 in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> The value of the tender quota allocation for 1991-92 has been raised by 17 per cent above 1990-91 levels as a result of the expansion of quota ceilings. However, due to a general reduction in premium rates the level of duty is expected to drop by $101.3m. </PARA>
<PARA> Assistance measures announced in the economic development statement of 12 March 1991 and contained in this Bill will reduce revenue receipts by a total of $79.1m in 1991-92, $115.65m in 1992-93 and $491.65m in 1993-94. Other changes contained in this Bill have only minor revenue implications. </PARA>
<PARA> Summaries of the amendments contained in this Bill have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposes to amend the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act 1991, to incorporate into that Act a proposal to increase the duty on exported uranium concentrate, which was tabled in this chamber by myself on 10 May 1990, and is effective from 21 February 1990, being the date of effect of that proposal in accordance with section 273ea of the Customs Act 1901, clause 2. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal, which increases the export duty on uranium concentrate produced in the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory from $1.15 to $1.30 as from 21 February 1990, is incorporated in clause 3 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill provides an exemption from the increased levy where uranium concentrate was loaded onto a vessel, or was part of a consignment, the loading of which was commenced prior to the 21 February 1990 commencement of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy, which applies only to exports of uranium concentrate produced in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory, is imposed to partially offset the special costs of environmental monitoring and research activities undertaken by the Commonwealth to protect the Alligator Rivers region. The increase in the level of the levy reflects the Government's position that the costs associated with protecting the environment from the potential adverse effects of uranium mining should be borne, as far as is practicable, by the industry carrying out those operations, and not the ordinary taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> Successive governments throughout the 1980s have recognised that the Alligator Rivers region, which includes Kakadu National Park, requires special measures to ensure that its sensitive environment receives adequate protection from the possible adverse effects of uranium mining. The significance of the Alligator Rivers region should not be underestimated-large parts of the area have received international recognition by being placed on the World Heritage list. Australia has specific obligations under the World Heritage convention to ensure such areas are not degraded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's contribution to the protection of the Alligator Rivers region is through the operation and research undertaken by the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS) and other Commonwealth agencies, in addition to the provision of funds for services by agencies of the Northern Territory Government on behalf of the Commonwealth. The services provided by the Northern Territory on behalf of the Commonwealth include: the application of national codes of practice relevant to nuclear materials; safety, health and mining regulations; and environmental monitoring. The costs of these services are offset by contributions from the Commonwealth in the annual revenue grant to the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The programs and role of the Office of the Supervising Scientist have been reviewed and endorsed on a number of occasions. The most recent review, the Taylor review, concluded in November 1989 that the OSS is as necessary today as it was in 1978 when it was established, as the community continues to require assurances from an independent and competent source that the environment of the region is being protected from the adverse effects of mining. </PARA>
<PARA> The uranium export duty, which applies only to the export of uranium concentrate produced in the Alligator Rivers region, was introduced by the coalition Government in 1980. The increases in the duty that have occurred since 1980 reflect the Government's position that those involved in uranium mining activities in the Alligator Rivers region, and not the ordinary taxpayer, should incur, as far as possible, the costs associated with protecting that environment from possible adverse effects arising from their activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed increase in duty from $1.15 to $1.30 per kilogram from 21 February 1990 has been implemented in an effort to move towards full cost recovery of the Government's environment protection measures associated with mining in the Alligator Rivers region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government makes no apology for its policy of supporting full cost recovery of all government expenditure used in protecting the environment from uranium mining operations in the Alligator Rivers region. However, it recognises that limitations exist in the present export duty system which, for example, requires an amendment to legislation whenever a change to the amount of revenue required is needed. Further, it notes that the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts report on the potential of the Kakadu National Park region and the Taylor Review of the Office of the Supervising Scientist suggested that the levy could be applied more equitably as organisations other than uranium mining companies either utilise or benefit from the results of OSS research. The Government will be addressing these issues and examining alternative means for collecting these costs in a more effective and equitable manner. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The proposed increased duty raised an additional $0.222m during 1989-90 and is expected to raise an additional $0.932m over the full 1990-91 financial year. In the 1989-90 financial year the levy raised $4.007m. Between July and February of the 1990-91 financial year $6.146m has been raised by the levy, and based on current projected exports it is expected that a further $1.066m will be raised during the March-June period, giving an estimated total amount to be raised during the 1990-91 financial year of $7.212m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was speaking in this debate before lunch, I pointed out that this was a Bill that we really did not need to have. It was introduced to enable us to try to recover from the internationally embarrassing position brought about in 1988 when there was a press release on 2 June by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson. That press release welcomed the successful conclusion of the negotiations for a convention to regulate any future minerals activity in the Antarctic. By doing this the Government put Australia in an extraordinarily embarrassing position from which we are now trying to recover. Right from the word go our position should have been that there should be no mining in the Antarctic because of its very delicate and pristine environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But then the good senator, in his capacity as environment Minister, said on the Sunday program on Channel 9 on 9 April that basically he favoured signing the convention. It was only after the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) brought to the public's attention what an appalling thing was being proposed that the Government changed its mind and came into line with the coalition's policy, which was made quite clear in February 1990. I refer to the passage which says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal and National parties reaffirm their opposition to Australia becoming a signatory to the Antarctic Minerals Regime. </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear and precise. If the Government of the day had not embarrassed us internationally, this piece of legislation need not have resulted. Instead, we could have gone with our heads held high to an international convention calling for a moratorium on mining over all Antarctica, not just the portion that Australia is responsible for today. It is a great tragedy that we find ourselves having to debate this legislation in order to cover up one of the Government's past mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst saying that, I also add that the reason why this Bill comes forward is not of great importance, other than in the international context. I have already pointed out that most of the minerals in Antarctica are not of economic significance and are quite plentiful around the world. Perhaps the only resource that there has been some speculation about is hydrocarbons. There is some speculation that there are quite large deposits of oil in Antarctica, but, once again, when we look at this seriously from the point of view of mining, we realise that onshore it would be difficult, and offshore almost impossible. We have already seen the tragic loss of life in England where a North Sea oil rig collapsed some years ago. Mining in the North Sea would be like mining in the bath compared with the oceans of the Antarctic. The prospect of mining where there are gales, icebergs and what have you is just not on. The depth of water makes it technically not practical. Once again, from a practical point of view, the intention of this Bill is to recover from that embarrassing position that the Government put us into in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> I also add that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), who is, I believe, what one would call a romantic environmentalist, brought forward the Bill for that inner glow that makes her and most of her supporters-who are not practical in environmental matters but have this nice feather-headed, woolly way of thinking-feel warm. Their support gives her something to hang her hat on. Obviously the speech yesterday by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his attempt to give resource security to the mining and timber industries showed how totally ineffective she has been in the Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> How the Minister has trivialised that particular portfolio was further reiterated on radio yesterday when she took some 15 minutes to explain how she drives a car with a smaller engine that saves 1 1/2 litres of petrol per 100 kilometres, rather than getting on to the serious business of what the environment is all about. If she drove that car to the outskirts of Canberra, she could see the soil degradation that is going on and the really difficult issues in the environment that have to be attacked. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister really wanted to make a positive contribution to the environment, then there is a lead she could take. I picked up the Australian Financial Review and read of two history making voyages being made to the polar regions. While these vessels are going to the Arctic and not to the Antarctic, the article does specify that this is the latest place where people are going for holidays. It seems to me that if that pristine environment is under threat, that threat will come from tourists. If the Minister is serious about protecting that area, I would hope that in the international forum she is able to bring forward strict guidelines on how tourism ought to take place in Antarctica if, indeed, it is a right and proper area to go. Once again Australia can take the lead, as it did in the coalition years, in so many areas of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> I also take exception to what the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said. In winding up his speech on this subject, he referred to the mining and farm sectors `raping the environment of the rest of the world' and said that he did not want anyone doing the same to the Antarctic. This emotional speech once again points out how environmentally illiterate he is. To suggest that the farming sector is raping this community is an insult to the Australian farmers who have toiled very hard to be custodians of this land for many years. While they might have made one or two mistakes in that period-and those mistakes are being redressed as technology comes along-they are custodians, they live in a practical sense with the environment on a day-to-day basis, and they do not indulge in the woolly-headed thinking of the romantic environmentalists opposite, who have no practical understanding of and do not appreciate that the environment is fragile and needs practical people to look after it. Those very farmers wish to pass the land on to the next generation; they are not raping and pillaging it. I think that the honourable member for Throsby owes a great apology to the farming community of Australia who have, in a very strong sense, looked after their land. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also disappointed that the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) tried to trivialise the efforts on the environment of the coalition when it was in government. It seems to me that he failed to comprehend that the environment debate is very fluid and ongoing. The further Australia goes, the more environmentally sensitive it will be. He is applying today's conditions to what we did back in 1960 when we first introduced the Antarctic Treaty legislation. In 1971 we were the first government to introduce a Federal department for the environment. These are areas in which we were world leaders. We moved for the protection of the whale in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> The list of achievements includes so many other examples: the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park; the prevention of sand mining on Fraser Island; the Kakadu and Uluru parks; the Christmas Island National Park; and marine nature reserves. The list goes on and on. We took steps to overcome lead pollution by introducing unleaded petrol. We introduced the environmental protection rules for sea dumping in 1981; State grants for air quality monitoring in 1976; and water management in the Murray River in 1982. The World Heritage Commission secured the listings of the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu, Willandra Lakes, Lord Howe Island and Tasmania's wilderness area. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dobell commented on what a wonderful job the Government did in the Franklin dam debate. I think that debate ought to be looked at in the light of history and the thuggery that this Government carried out in the debate. The debate went along this way: `We will stop the damming of the Franklin'. Many honourable members on this side of the House would probably support that proposition, but we did not support the thuggery of the Government that went on. ``Honourable members from the other side of the House forget the action that the previous Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, took in connection with that. He went to the Government of Tasmania and offered an alternative power source-not thuggery; he worked with the State Government to get an alternative power source to that which required the damming of the Franklin, a right and proper method. </PARA>
<PARA> But no, these preservationists got up, stopped the Franklin-and what do we find in Tasmania today? That State has a genuine shortage of power. It has power restrictions right now. Its industry is being stifled. We find that the economy of that State is being run down because the actions in the Franklin dam issue were, firstly, to stop as in the preservation sense but, secondly, never to go ahead and resolve the total problems of the environment on one hand and industry on the other. Honourable members who are sitting over yonder who come from the mining sector or the timber harvesting sector should appreciate how the environment is cared for by those practical environmentalists, rather than those with the romantic attitude that they have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address the House on the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill 1991. Without honourable members throwing shots across the chamber at each other, could I just mention to the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Riggall) that it is part of this debate which has enabled this Government to say to the rest of the world, `We don't want mining in the Antarctic'. Further, though, we want a complete strategy for that area of land so that, for instance, if pressures arise from tourism, we can also ensure that there is no degradation arising out of that activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) last year in his speech on the Antarctic who announced the establishment of the Antarctic Foundation, I think with a grant of a million dollars, based in Hobart, which will enable us to develop a conservation strategy for the entire area. So I would suggest to the honourable member opposite that we are quite aware of the fact that there may be dangers to the Antarctic other than mining-and, to that extent, we are making sure we have a comprehensive means of combating any of those dangers. </PARA>
<PARA> What I would like to do is go back through some of the history of how we arrived at the present Australian position. It is true to say, as others have mentioned here, that the Government was presented in 1988 with the possibility of signing a treaty, called the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities. It seemed to many of us, myself included at that time, that it would be necessary to sign the Antarctic minerals convention in order to provide some means for the protection of the Antarctic environment from mining. But, of course, the debate waxed and waned and eventually the Government opted not to sign and then ratify that mining convention, but rather to achieve a much bolder step in order to conserve the Antarctic environment. So let me take honourable members through some of those debates. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, placing this issue in context, the group of nations that seeks to control the Antarctic got together in 1959 to sign the Antarctic Treaty. So it really is that group of nations that has continued this debate about possible future uses of the Antarctic. We can imagine then that the debate on resource use vis-a-vis environment has shifted enormously over that period of time. In the early days, the main stipulation of the Antarctic Treaty was that the area should be used for peaceful purposes; that there should be no nuclear explosions in the area; that it should be used principally for scientific study. </PARA>
<PARA> But by the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was some interest being shown in the possibility of mining in the Antarctic. The member states of the Antarctic Treaty started to work on a specific mining convention for the Antarctic and for some seven years worked on some possible protocols. Australia was part of that debate. So from 1981 until June 1988, we were, if one likes, focused on the possibility that mining might take place in the Antarctic and also on the issue of what legal means there would be to prevent it. </PARA>
<PARA> That was a real debate. We did not seek at any particular time to ditch that convention. People were telling us that mining in the Antarctic was a possibility at some stage. Therefore, we put heads together and started to consider the possibility that at some stage mining might take place-bearing in mind, of course, that no-one actually owns the Antarctic. A number of nations lay claim to sections of Antarctica. Australia lays claim to some 42 per cent of the area, so obviously we are a key player when it comes to the preservation and/or future use of that area. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the two sets of arguments. There were those who said of course that to sign a convention or be involved in a convention on minerals was in fact to say that there was a consistency between mining and protection of the Antarctic environment; and there were those of course who said that those two things were totally inconsistent and that we must move outright to ban mining. But it was not clear in 1988 which way we should go. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer to some of the debates which have been recorded because Senator Richardson, the then environment Minister, put some reasonable arguments concerning his fears about not signing and ratifying the mining convention at that time. He noted on 12 April 1989 in the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> My concern in the short term is not so much about mining in the Australian Antarctic Territory-it is for those areas that Argentina and Chile in particular have an interest in. Being further north than the Australian Antarctic Territory, the climate in those areas is not as extreme. Those countries pursue their claims in the Antarctic with considerable passion. One can actually buy maps of Argentina in Argentina which show Antarctica as well. As I said, these countries take these matters very seriously indeed. I am concerned that mining might first begin in these areas. I, for one, want to make sure that, if mining is ever to take place, some regime is established that might at least . . . keep (them) honest. </PARA>
<PARA>So there was genuine debate about whether the use of the minerals convention would be the best way to not have mining take place. Senator Richardson, the then Minister, continued in the same debate:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if one looks at the views on the Convention two principal positions are being taken by the community on this question. The first is the view that if there were no convention, there would be no mining. The second is that the Convention is the only way of ensuring proper regulation and environmental protection. I hasten to add that I do not subscribe to either view. I certainly do not believe that if there is no convention, there will be no mining. That is simply not the case. I believe, as I said, that mining will take place in some of the more northern parts of the Antarctic Territory, and I do not believe that is all that far off. This is why I would like to see something in place. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>I hope a convention, be it this or a renegotiated one, might be able at least to place some pressure on those countries and companies involved in a mining exercise to do so responsibly. I repeat: that is in the context of my view that there should not be mining in Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA>So the then environment Minister was quite clear. He wanted to make sure that mining in the Antarctic would be banned. The problem for the Government at that time was to find a decent instrument to ban mining and the only one we had in 1988 was the Antarctic minerals convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, the debate turned decisively in favour of not ratifying that Convention and moving to something else entirely. That something else entirely is where the Government has positioned itself now, quite rightly. It is seeking, with a number of other nations, France especially, to establish the Antarctic as a nature reserve-land of science-in other words, there should never be exploitation of minerals in that land; it should be used only for scientific observation. That is why we have introduced this Bill-so that as far as Australians and the Australian territories are concerned, as claimed by the Government, there shall be no mining. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Ninian Stephen pointed out to us very forcefully some of the weaknesses of the previous Minerals Convention. It helps explain why the Government moved away from ever signing the minerals convention. Sir Ninian, in The Monthly Record of October 1990, had this to say about the Convention:</PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of value judgments, the Minerals Convention calls for the making of many of them. For example, mineral resource activity is not to take place under the terms of the Convention unless it is judged that the particular activity will not cause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Significant'' adverse effects on air and water quality;</PARA>
<PARA> ``Significant'' changes in atmospheric, terrestrial or marine environments,</PARA>
<PARA> ``Significant'' changes in the distribution, abundance, or productivity or populations of a species of fauna or flora,</PARA>
<PARA> ``Significant'' adverse effects on global or regional climate or weather patterns. </PARA>
<PARA>The point that Sir Ninian makes in his paper is that, once the prevailing attitudes towards the environment shifted over the period when this minerals convention was being debated and drafted, it became obvious that one could easily interpret liberally in favour of mining, using that minerals convention. One could say that with a particular activity there were no significant impacts due to mining on flora, fauna or whatever. We all shifted a great deal in the 1980s and it became clear towards the end of that decade that almost any impact by mining in Antarctica would, in fact, be significant and could be ruinous to the Antarctic environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, to its great credit, has sought a new legal instrument to protect the Antarctic in all its environmental essences. Sir Ninian made this further point about the weaknesses in this minerals convention which we turned down:</PARA>
<PARA> A feature of the Minerals Convention is that it permits prospecting without any authorisation by the institution of the Convention. Should the results of that prospecting then disclose minerals of value, extreme national and commercial pressure to exploit would probably follow, pressure that might affect the making of those value judgments.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, those are the sorts of arguments that were playing on Senator Richardson's mind in 1988-89. Sir Ninian goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Two final points about the Minerals Convention. It provides security of title, as between all nations who are parties to the Antarctic Treaty, to any mineral venture that complies with its requirements. This provision for the first time of secure title to mining tenements must be a very considerable encouragement to mining companies considering the possibility of engaging in mineral activity in Antarctica. Secondly, it runs counter to the whole concept of the Antarctic Treaty system that knowledge gained should be shared between all parties when it permits the results of prospecting to be retained by the prospector as confidential information. </PARA>
<PARA>Having decided, because of those sorts of arguments, that we should not sign and ratify a minerals convention, it was then up to Australia to suggest an alternative-to be a practical conservationist-and we have done that. We have gone out to other nations to sell them an idea that we have and are now promoting. That idea is that, as I said before, we should establish the Antarctic as a nature reserve-land of science and, as a by-product, ban activities such as mining. </PARA>
<PARA> That does mean to say that previously under the Antarctic Treaty there was not a series of measures that had been agreed upon for the conservation of the Antarctic. From the original establishment of the Antarctic Treaty, over time there had been additions of six, seven, or eight various specific measures in order to protect the environment, but they were obviously going to fail when it came to the pressure of mining. So the whole debate has moved that extra step. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has performed extremely well in convincing a number of other nations that they should fall into line and seek this more general convention to protect the Antarctic environment. I will move across some examples. In addition to Australia and France initiating this idea, in September 1989, the Italian Chamber of Deputies committed the Italian Government to rejecting ratification of the minerals convention and instead supporting the idea of a world nature park for Antarctica; in January this year, President Gorbachev expressed concern about exploitation of Antarctica's natural resources and supported its preservation as a `global nature reserve and common natural laboratory'; on 20 September 1990, the Spanish Senate passed a motion that the Government should support measures which give the greatest possible protection to the Antarctic; the Indian Government affirmed its support for the Franco-Australian approach; and the United Kingdom, which has long been a strong supporter of the minerals convention, has not now taken the final step of ratifying that convention, even though there was legislation in existence in the UK for it to do so. Most encouragingly, the US has now moved its position considerably. A US congressional resolution reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The negotiation of a new agreement or protocol . . . providing full protection of Antarctica as a global ecological common and establishing Antarctica as a region closed to commercial minerals. </PARA>
<PARA>The US Senate agreed to the following resolution:</PARA>
<PARA>Fully support the negotiation of a new agreement to provide comprehensive environmental protection for Antarctica . . . at the November 1990 meeting of the Antarctic Treaty consultative parties in Santiago, Chile. </PARA>
<PARA>At that meeting in Santiago, Chile there was, again, considerable progress over the idea of a more general convention to protect the Antarctic environment. If I could report on the meeting which took place in December 1990: there is now general agreement, after a meeting of the Treaty partners, that there should be a new legal instrument or, rather, that one was possible-I do not want to overstate that; the parties agreed that a new environment protection instrument was needed and that the form of the document and its contents would need further discussion. A composite document, drawing on elements from all proposals produced during the meeting, was accepted as a basis for further work in developing a new instrument. This included an article concerning the prohibition of Antarctic mineral activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the best illustration of this decisive move away from even considering a minerals convention and to a conservation convention is that at that same meeting in Santiago, Chile, there were proposals about the liability protocol for the Antarctic minerals convention. It was reported that no delegations pressed for the opening of negotiations on the liability protocol. It was agreed that it was not appropriate to commence negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> So it seems clear that, because of Australia's initiatives and its ability to pick up the support of mainly European nations and the United States for our view that there should now be a nature reserve declared in the Antarctic, it is now quite likely that we will never have to ratify the minerals convention and that the Antarctic Treaty system will move towards a more thoroughgoing general and proper legal instrument to protect the Antarctic for all time. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to my original point, this is a bold move. It can work only if Australia is sufficiently strong to convince enough other nations of the intelligence of our move. I think we can do that. I congratulate the Prime Minister and the current Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) for their work in that regard. I think it is an entirely practical measure that this Government wishes to undertake in order to preserve the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is simply a step along the way, a signal that as far as Australia is concerned there shall be no mining in the Australian territory and there shall be no mining by Australians in any of the Antarctic territories. We ask that other nations, whether they are parties to the convention or not, do the same as us. Here in a very practical sense we are asking that other nations fall into line, and at other forums of the Antarctic Treaty we will continue to press for the nature reserve-land of science approach to the Antarctic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, before I address the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill, I give you my thanks for your courtesy in taking the chair in my place so that I can speak on this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Antarctica has got to be the most wonderful place in the world. It also has to be one of the most hellish, devilish, desperate, frightful places in the world. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to support this legislation. Whenever I consider the question of Antarctica I have to start by paying tribute to those early explorers-to Mawson, Shackleton, Scott and Amundsen. I also pay tribute to perhaps Australia's greatest photographer, Frank Hurley, who wintered with Mawson and went with Shackleton, and whose twin daughters live around the corner from me in Coffs Harbour. </PARA>
<PARA> I couple with that my praise and appreciation for the work done by the expeditioners of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition (ANARE), which is organised by the Antarctic Division of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. Those people, whether they be the administrators in the division at Kingston near Hobart or the people who go and spend a winter-12, 15 or even 18 months-in total isolation for most of the time, are deserving of the greatest respect and thanks of their fellow Australians and, indeed, of this House. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had the great good fortune to visit the Antarctic twice. First, I went to Casey in 1986-87. It was a mind-blowing, exciting experience, a once in a lifetime experience. I am like a cat, I suppose, to a certain extent; I have now been a second time. Three weeks ago I was on the ship coming back, the Ice Bird, having been to Davis and Heard Island and back to Davis and then to Mawson. </PARA>
<PARA> As I started by saying, the continent of Antarctica is absolutely amazing. Of course, unlike the northern polar regions, which are just ice and which nuclear submarines can go beneath, the Antarctic is a continent two and a half times the size of Australia. In Australia and right throughout the world most people's eyes widen when that is suggested to them. Their only knowledge is when they look at a map of the world and see a little bit of white down the bottom. But Antarctica is two and a half times the size of Australia, and we claim sovereignty over 42 per cent of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Others have spoken about the difficulty of mining. I can assure honourable members that, even if anybody wanted to mine, it would be far from easy. The greatest thickness of ice is four kilometres; the average thickness is two kilometres. The lowest recorded temperature in the world was at Vostok, a Russian base in the centre of the Australian Antarctic Territory (AAT), and it was minus 89.6 degrees celsius. The average winter temperature is minus 47 degrees and the average summer temperature warms up to minus 30 degrees. I was fortunate because I was there during a heat wave, when it was only zero degrees or minus one or two degrees. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the sort of environment we have to consider, and most people do not realise that. When one goes to Casey or to Davis or to Mawson, they are totally different worlds, even from each other. People talk about the pack ice and searching for oil and oil drilling operations in the water, but I do not believe that would be possible. In summer the pack ice, which is frozen sea water 1 1/2 to two metres thick, is a ring of ice right around the continent, with four million square kilometres of ice. In winter, that expands to 22 million square kilometres of ice. Time and time again, the ships we have leased or chartered have been stuck in the ice. The poor old Nella Dan was stuck season after season and rescued by the Russians or the Japanese or the Americans. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an amazing environment, and unless one has had the privilege of visiting it one's mind cannot encompass what it is really like. I must say, just for the record, that at a National Party conference here in Canberra in the second half of 1988 I argued strongly, forcibly and successfully that Australia should not sign the minerals convention. Subsequently, on 2 May 1989 the coalition adopted that as its policy. The next day former Senator Chris Puplick successfully moved in the Senate a motion along those lines. I am not going to join with some of my colleagues, who poured a little cold water on the Government's Johnny-come-lately turnaround. I am pleased that the Government has done it. I think it was the right move to take and, whatever the reasons for taking it, I congratulate the Government for doing it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Antarctic continent should be protected as much as possible because its environment is undoubtedly unique. I had the opportunity of a six-week voyage to Antarctica in what most people regarded as rough weather. I can assure the House that six weeks was far too long, particularly when in those 42 days I had upwards of six days ashore doing wonderful, fascinating, exciting things and 36 days on a cargo ship. I will not say anything about the cook, but the food was not terribly good. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) this morning, in speaking to the legislation, made the point that Australia is geographically close to Antarctica. I suppose that compared to Russia it is but, even so, to go by sea from Hobart to Davis takes 12 days by ship. In the course of that voyage one does not see a trawler or a jet trail in the sky. That is how isolated Antarctica is. The ship ploughs and rocks and rolls down through the Roaring Forties and the `furious fifties'-the wildest, roughest ocean in the world. On the way down, during the first six days quite a number of people thought the weather was pretty bad. We did have 10-metre waves and the Beaufort scale registered force 7, force 8 and occasionally force 9 gales. I suppose that in most people's books that is fairly rough weather. </PARA>
<PARA> Later, we were forced to up-anchor and to maroon 22 of our colleagues on Heard Island because the storm came in and we had 20 metre waves. The Beaufort scale only goes to force 12. The needle was on force 12 and quivering; it could not get past. The winds were over 150 kilometres an hour. The ship was listing 50 degrees to port and 50 degrees to starboard. I must say that at one stage the adrenalin was running because the ship seemed to pause on top of an almighty wave, shuddered, and then dived off Niagara Falls, smack bang into Ayers Rock. The ship stopped totally. The bow had buried itself into an enormous wave, and another one had come right over the foremast, crashing onto the deck. The ship stopped, the engine stopped and sirens went off. That got the adrenalin running a little bit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am speaking directly to the Bill. I am endeavouring to inform the House of the real nature of the environment that has to be faced if one is going down to Antarctica, as I did as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs along with my colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) to conduct an inquiry into the legal regime affecting the Australian Antarctic Territory and the territories of Heard Island and McDonald Island.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That inquiry is still proceeding, and it is incredibly relevant to the Bill before the House because the legal regime affecting Antarctica-and of course the Bill is now going to be a part of it-is quite frankly a can of worms. Now that we have self-government in the Australian Capital Territory, it is the law of the ACT in general which applies to Antarctica, apart from specialised Bills of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> We have certain Acts and ordinances affecting the Australian Antarctic Territory, and we are signatories to the Antarctic Convention. The provision to enact Australian law for the Australian Antarctic Territory is covered by section 122 of the Constitution, but our action is limited by our role as a contracting party to the Antarctic Treaty. That was signed in 1959. Twelve nations originally negotiated and signed it, and since then another 20 nations have joined us. </PARA>
<PARA> We claim sovereignty over 42 per cent of the Antarctic. Sovereignty is actually vital to the Treaty and was probably the most contentious issue when the Treaty was negotiated. In fact, only New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Chile, France and Norway recognise our sovereignty in Antarctica. I sometimes think that perhaps we are not terribly keen on maintaining our sovereignty-yet I happen to believe that we should. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the Treaty, we see that under article 4 all of the positions of the parties were frozen in terms of sovereignty. Under article 4(2) no acts or activities taking place while the Treaty is in force shall be taken as asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty or creating any new rights to sovereignty in Antarctica. On the other hand, nothing done under article 4(1) shall be interpreted as prejudicing or renouncing any existing claims to sovereignty in Antarctica. Perhaps we have the best of both worlds; perhaps we have the worst of both worlds. </PARA>
<PARA> Under international law, the enactment of legislation is one of the most obvious forms of the exercise of sovereign power. This is therefore an important way of demonstrating or indicating a sovereign intent. Yet, on the other hand, if Australia enacted far-reaching and comprehensive legislation as a genuine sovereign Act covering the AAT, it could possibly be interpreted-as this Act could be-as contrary to the Treaty, in that enacting law is supporting a claim to territorial sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA> Many speakers in this debate have spoken about the coal, oil and hydrocarbons that might be there. I have handled a piece of coal from the Prince Charles Mountains on the return journey. I have seen and handled fascinating things, for instance, petrified wood. I also handled petrified leaves-and you can bet your gumnuts that one of them was a petrified gum leaf. </PARA>
<PARA> Antarctica has a unique environment. It contains 95 per cent of the world's ice. If a person gets out at Mawson on the iceshelf and does not have chains on his boots, he is in very big trouble. In fact, Mr John Wilson, the Chief Engineer of the Antarctic Division, took three steps on the ice, and fell over and shattered his right arm because he did not have chains on his boots. I thought that they were only for car tyres, but down there on the ice they are absolutely essential. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present time, we do not by and large enforce our law applying to Antarctica. The Air Navigation Act 1920 applies to Antarctica, but we do not enforce it because we cannot. How would we do that? The Sea Installations Act 1987 applies to Australian Antarctic Territory, but we do not enforce that either. We have the Radiocommunications Act 1983. We license our radio activities, but where other nations or nationals are in our territory, we cannot apply this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> When I went to Law base I had the opportunity of visiting the Chinese Zhong Shan base, which was incredibly clean and tidy. The people there are doing a marvellous job with the environment. That followed on the heels of a formal inspection under the Antarctic Treaty. This is one of the things that happen; Treaty signatories make the effort to visit each other. I pay tribute to Dr Pat Quilty, the Assistant Director, Science of the Antarctic Division; Dr Harvey Marchment; and Mr Graham Fletcher of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who conducted that inspection of the Chinese base. One of the great things about Antarctica is the total cooperation and free flow of information and scientific research which is evidenced in the assistance that is freely offered if ever required. </PARA>
<PARA> As to this legislation, I have grave doubts whether we can enforce it apart from enforcing it on Australian citizens. The two main thrusts of the legislation are that there shall be no mining in Australian Antarctic Territory and no Australian will mine anywhere in Antarctica. Perhaps we can enforce the second objective, provided that the person involved comes back to Australia, but I do not believe that we can enforce the first objective. This will be very relevant to the inquiry being conducted on the legal regime operating in Antarctica at the present time. There is no way that the people at the Russian bases of Progress, Vostok or Mirny or the Chinese at Zhong Shan accept our sovereignty. Although they are very polite, they do not accept our sovereignty or our law. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the Americans, when they went to Heard Island a few years ago, did not seek permission to land. They asked whether they could use the huts at Atlas Cove, but they had so little regard for our sovereignty-even of Heard Island, which is sub-Antarctic and a separate territory-that they did not ask for permission to land. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that I am pleased to see the Minister for the Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) at the table. I know of her very great interest in this issue. I know that both sides of this Parliament are ready and willing to work together to see this legislation come into being. I make the point that I have grave reservations about the ability to enforce it. </PARA>
<PARA> If a plane crashes-and the Russians have had a few crashed planes-our Civil Aviation Authority should be able, under the law, to conduct an inquiry, but there is no way. We are looking at most of the Australian law in Antarctica, but we are not carrying it out. We do not have any framework, any infrastructure. Apart from the fact that the law of the Australian Capital Territory does apply, there is no way it can be applied. This is why I say I support this Bill totally. I think it is really on the right track. I would suggest to the Minister that we look very closely at how we can implement it with other than Australian citizens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, having listened to the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), I think he really should have been leading the debate for the Opposition on the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill because his comments displayed considerably more sensitivity and commitment to what the Antarctic is all about than many of the comments we had from people on the other side earlier in the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is certainly true that this legislation is, as the honourable member says, only one of the steps which need to be taken along the way in the process. I am sure the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), who is at the table, would be the first to acknowledge that point. Nevertheless, it is a very important step. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the criticisms raised by the Opposition in the course of the debate today about questions of sovereignty and the general complexity of legal form relating to Antarctica are precisely the reason there has been such a vexed debate, not only here, but internationally, on these particular issues. This Bill seeks to impose a penal code for the enforcement of a mining ban on Australian nationals in Antarctica, and it prevents mining by Australian controlled interests in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it can validly be said that it is both a testimony to the Hawke Government's commitment to environmental protection of this unique area of the world environment and a tribute, rightly, to the concern and interest that Australians have had in the region right back to the times to which the honourable member for Cowper referred. It has certainly been an area of great fascination, great excitement and great stimulation to many Australians-indeed, to many people throughout the world. It represents one of the world's last great wilderness areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a fair way of putting it. It is a unique sanctuary for millions of seals, whales, penguins and so forth, and gives an unparalleled opportunity for seabirds to exist there. Its awesome size and dramatic beauty are proclaimed by everyone who has studied the continent or has had the privilege of visiting it-as has the honourable member for Cowper. At the same time the harshness and the extremes that the region endures are something most of us can only marvel at. It is that unique ecology which gives it both its sense of excitement and its great sense of vulnerability. Therefore, the necessity to ensure the environmental balance in that region becomes of even more concern to us all. It is this balance, and the discussion of these issues, which really must lead to us all seeking the preservation of Antarctica. All members of this House in one way or another have expressed concern and interest in ensuring that that happens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should be said, however, in discussing this issue, that the debate has ranged far and wide onto other environmental issues, with people claiming they are the most green, or that others are not. The debate on Antarctica shows that we can really conduct a debate about environmental issues in a more mature fashion. I hope that is the way such debates will be conducted. Frankly, regions such as Antarctica will achieve the most significance if there is a debate based on intelligence and commonsense, which gives the full scientific worth of the region a chance to be considered, researched and properly documented. That has been the history of exploration in the region and the history of those Australians who have played such an active part in exploring and researching that area. They have brought back to those of us who have not had the privilege of being in that part of the world the opportunity to visually appreciate it through the marvellous photography and film we have seen. </PARA>
<PARA> With those things in mind it should be acknowledged that there is in existence the Antarctic Treaty to which Australia is a full party. This Treaty details the method of regulating international activity and control of the region, and stipulates that the region is not to be used for military purposes. Beyond that, as the honourable member for Cowper has said, the Treaty is vague and has shortcomings. The principal deficiency of the Treaty regime, and one that this Bill seeks to address, is that it makes no effective provision for control, exploitation and management of the natural resources of the continent and the surrounding seas. </PARA>
<PARA> In the late 1950s and early 1960s the cheapness of most raw materials, coupled with the cost of recovery from the hostile Antarctic environment, meant that exploitation of resources was not on the agenda. However, the rising cost of energy after 1973, plus potential raw material shortages and improvements in extraction technologies, have all combined to make the exploitation of Antarctica less improbable than was previously thought. One would have to say, and rightly so, that there are still considerable barriers and impediments there to those activities taking place, but the dangers are real. The possible damages that exploration and extraction could inflict on this region are innumerable. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to focus on a few of the most profound dangers this area could possibly be exposed to if a system of protective legislation is not embarked upon by claimant nations. Firstly, the cold climate in Antarctica means that any pollutant introduced into the terrestrial or marine environment will take an extremely long time to degrade, and it is therefore able to damage marine and terrestrial life for a far longer time than would be the case in temperate or tropical areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there are many associated facilities to mining ventures, services such as towns, shipping ports, airports, roads, power stations and other infrastructure. Many of these installations have to be established in relatively ice-free areas, of which there are few in this region. This scenario puts prospecting, exploration and mining in direct competition with wildlife which inhabits the limited number of ice-free areas. As a case in point I would ask the House to cast its mind back to the raw treatment suffered by the penguins when they were turfed out of house and home so that the French station could be established there. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the issue of human fallibility must be considered. No matter how good the technology, how comprehensive the safeguards, or how honourable the intentions, there will always remain the possibility of disaster. For that matter, mining companies, like others, do not have a 100 per cent record, or even a particularly satisfactory record, when it comes to limiting the adverse and quite probably irreversible effects of an accident. I remind the House, as was mentioned earlier in the debate, just how badly Exxon bungled the oil spill in Alaska. That was not even the Arctic. Such recent examples must surely cast doubt on the claims of the pundits who argue for regulated mining in Antarctica. Ultimately, there are no infallible safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA> Oil spills, as has been mentioned, pose a special problem. Climatic conditions mean that an oil spill in Antarctica will have a many times worse effect than in areas such as the Middle East. For these reasons it is essential that we act promptly and decisively to prevent mining and exploration from desecrating the shores of this unsullied, icy wilderness. That is exactly what the Government is seeking to do through this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the responsibility of the Australian nation to take a leading role in the preservation of Antarctica because we control 42 per cent of the region. But the recognition of the need to treat Antarctica as the last bastion of nature's unadulterated glory is being recognised by other claimant nations. Since the introduction of this Bill into the Australian Parliament other nations have been dealing with similar legislative initiatives which are designed to ensure the protection of the region and which are sure testimony to the region's future and the guarantee of that future. Other speakers in the debate have spoken particularly of the French Government's role in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with pride that I suggest that the Hawke Government has taken a leading role in this issue. We have displayed clarity of purpose and a strength of purpose in this issue. We have recognised the important need for the development of comprehensive protective legislation in the prevention of mining and exploration of the region but we have also developed pro-active initiatives to promote a wider understanding of the importance of the Antarctic region and its preservation. </PARA>
<PARA> An example of these pro-active initiatives was witnessed in November 1990 when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced details of the new Antarctic Foundation to be based in Hobart, for which $1m was allocated in the 1990 Budget. The Foundation underlies the special relationship we have with Antarctica, forged by the ties of history and proximity. It demonstrates to the world our commitment to fulfil our ongoing protection of the region and at the same time will ensure that Australia's interests in the area receive specific funding and conspicuous attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned the Antarctic Treaty but I think that in order to illustrate fully the commitment that this Government has given to preserving the Antarctic through our involvement with this treaty regime it is worth going into it in more detail. The Antarctic Treaty, to which Australia is a signatory, initiated the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities, the so-called minerals convention. There were two competing views of the purpose and effect of the minerals convention. The official model was that an unregulated scramble for minerals could occur, so rules would be needed to impose controls on such mineral activity. It was thought that these rules would put hurdles in front of mining, impose order and environmental protection, and maintain the security of the Antarctic Treaty and the southern zone. </PARA>
<PARA> The other view that was widely discussed and adopted by our Government was that an unregulated scramble was unlikely to occur in the absence of investment security and property rights conferred by the convention, that by providing property rights the convention would facilitate mining, and that the introduction of rivalry over strategic resources in the zone would introduce new and dangerous stresses to the Treaty and the area. This would endanger not only the environment but could lead to conflict and destabilise the treaty and the zone's demilitarised status. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government took a bold decision in 1989 not to sign the minerals convention. We did so in the face of almost total opposition from the other nations of the Antarctic treaty system. The grounds for our refusal to sign the convention rested in the realisation that the premise of the convention was a fallacy, that is, mining was inevitable and therefore we should promote safe mining. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to say that a wide debate took place in this country and in others about the relative merits of the two methodologies. Many people who were deeply committed to the preservation of the Antarctic took the view that some regime was better than what existed at that time, and there had been considerable world discussion about that. It is important to note that, as with all these environmental issues, we cannot look at them in a static fashion; we have to judge them over time. We have to take account of changing demands and changing information. It was because the Government has been at all times sensitive and conscious to environmental concerns and the need to ensure an ongoing regime of environmental protection measures that the Government rightly deliberated on this issue carefully and responsibly and came, I have no doubt, to what will be the right view and the long term view in the best interests of the region. That has been the way we have handled environmental issues generally. I reject the churlish comments we heard earlier in the debate that suggested that that was not our approach to the environment. That has always been our approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion made by the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Riggall) that we on this side practised what he called environmental thuggery because of our strong stance on the Franklin dam and our opposition to it does not do credit to the very considered and thoughtful approach that has been applied on this matter in which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) gave a strong lead earlier in the discussion about these matters when they were being discussed, as did the Prime Minister and as did many others in the community, including members of the Opposition. All of this is welcome because I think that is a very constructive approach to take. It is not necessary to indulge in point-scoring on these sorts of matters. We should all be prepared to acknowledge that we do have a special role, a special place, in the protection and preservation of Antarctica. All Australians should be quite proud to stand up and give their support and commitment to the lead that has been taken by Australia as a nation in the world community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government encountered a lot of international opposition and criticism because it dug its heels in and refused to agree to that convention. Some argued that our stand threatened the whole existence of the Antarctic Treaty. I believe nothing could have been further from the truth. We stood up for what we believed to be right. We also went one step further and developed an alternative policy. That policy was a comprehensive initiative within the Antarctic Treaty system. Together with the French, who have played a very constructive role, Australia proposed that the Antarctic be declared a wilderness reserve where no detrimental environmental activities could be permitted and where emphasis was to be placed on the scientific research capacity that the region offered. </PARA>
<PARA> Support from Australians for the Franco-Australian proposal was overwhelming and today we see the culmination of that proposal. Australia, like other nations, is turning that policy into law-I believe with the great support of the overwhelming majority of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill stands as testimony to the Hawke Government's credentials in environmental issues. We are proving ourselves as a nation to be responsible guardians of the global and national environment. We are ensuring that we maintain the lead we have given in many areas of environmental protection. Other illustrations of that commitment in the international environment include our recognition of the need to reduce emissions of the chlorofluorocarbon gases which are responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer. The 1989 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer ensured that Australia set the standards for the international reduction of these globally harmful gases. </PARA>
<PARA> At the national level I believe our record clearly speaks for itself. I notice that the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) is in the chamber. I believe our record does speak for itself. I believe that the Government's handling of the key environmental issues is much stronger and more effective than he actually said this morning when he made the claim that the Opposition's record on environmental protection was excellent indeed. I think that is a very dubious claim because not long after he spoke the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) got up and spoke about environmental concerns in Queensland. I do not think, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you or most other people would find a lot of environmental protection associated with the previous National Party Government in Queensland. Nevertheless, I think the people of Queensland rightly made their judgment in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> What is particularly important in looking at this issue is that this is something that is not just a matter that should be treated in the point-scoring way that was adopted earlier today. In my view it is like the Franklin dam-as time goes on it will be shown that the majority of Australians appreciate the importance of effective environmental protection legislation for Antarctica. Notwithstanding all of the difficulties encountered in trying to enforce those sorts of legislative regimes and all the legal difficulties that imposes, it is nevertheless a particularly important way for us as a nation, with our very strong and direct links with Antarctica and with our responsibility as world leaders in the preservation of the region, to say, `We are going to introduce legislative arrangements and Australians are going to ensure that they do not allow any of the potential dangers that could come from mining in Antarctica to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only clearly in Australia's interests as a world leader in environmental protection but also clearly and most importantly in the interests of the protection of the flora and all the animal life that exists in Antarctica to take the strongest possible steps to ensure that it cannot be sullied by the dangers that could occur from any form of mining activity there. That is something that not only we would appreciate in a debate today in this Parliament but also we would appreciate for decades-indeed, long after any of us have played any role in this legislative process. Generations to come will strongly appreciate the fact that we had a government here that took a world lead, that set the agenda for world opinion on the protection of Antarctica and that had the courage and conviction on behalf of the Australian community to see that issue through to its rightful fruition in the form of this legislation which, as I said before, is an important step. It is only part of the process but a very important step in fulfilling our commitment and a down payment to future generations in their concern about world environmental issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pleasure to be able to speak on the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill. It is also a pleasure to see at the table the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), the shadow Minister for the environment. It was nice to see that the Minister visited my electorate at the weekend, even though it was a very quick visit. She would have missed seeing some of the superb and wonderful beauty of the Blue Mountains because of that rushed visit. Nevertheless, I know that she has a very tight schedule. Not the least item in that schedule was to think about and bring before this House such an important Bill as the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think there has been perhaps a lack of bipartisanship in relation to this Bill. I feel that all honourable members agree with this Bill 100 per cent, but I think that there has been a bit of oversensitivity on both sides with regard to some of the issues and with regard to what has or has not been done by either side on various issues. I hope that that does not detract from the enormous importance of this Bill that the Minister has brought before the House. We need to be heard to do a lot more loud praising and soft blaming when we are dealing with very critical and important pieces of legislation like this. </PARA>
<PARA> This evening, I want to re-emphasise some of the statements made by the Minister, who has as part of her responsibilities the environment, in her second reading speech. She stated that the Antarctic environment was unique and that it represented the world's greatest pristine wilderness. Of course, that has been emphasised very clearly in the speech of the shadow Minister at the table and other members from both sides of the House. It was a great privilege to be present in the chamber to hear the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl)-who has been there and done that-relate in a very interesting way his experiences in the Antarctic. He certainly gave a very powerful speech in support of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Antarctic today is not isolated and, even though at this stage it is not overly affected by mankind-it could be argued that there are many areas where there have been major problems as a result of what man has done and the legacy he has left; the very earliest explorers were rightly lauded earlier for some of the things that they endured and some of the things that they discovered and opened up for us to be able to experience today-we must make every effort to protect this beautiful and fragile area. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention in this conservation debate a few things about the trusteeship that we as a nation and a part of the international community have not only for the Antarctic but also for the whole planet. We need to take a lot of notice of this trusteeship. The greatest threat to mankind, as somebody said, may prove in the end to be not nuclear war-which we have all been frightened of but are less frightened of in this day and age with the disappearance of the Cold War-but a peacetime peril. That is spelt out as being the despoilation of the earth's natural resources by human folly or greed. That is an important point of which we need to take a lot of notice. All life on earth is dependent on the biosphere, the narrow layer of water, soil and air in which we live. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention this in the narrow context of this Bill because we need to take on board the record of the human race in conserving this biosphere, especially this century, because it has not been a very good one. For example, there are vast acres of soil in America, Africa and Asia which were once fertile agricultural land but now, through misuse, are irrevocable deserts or dustbowls. Worldwide deserts have increased by 150 per cent during the past 100 years so that almost 50 per cent of the earth's land surface is now desert or semi-desert. The resource of coal, which is very precious to this world, does have a fairly long life left-some people say 2,000 years-but natural gas and oil will not last long into the twenty-first century. The disposal of radioactive nuclear waste has and is causing grave public disquiet. </PARA>
<PARA> I read with great interest that in the 1960s Lake Erie, which in the 1950s had yielded seven million pounds of blue pike every year, became so polluted by industrial and domestic poisons that every living creature in it died. Last year, I had the privilege of flying between New York and Albany and sitting with me was the director of fisheries for the Great Lakes. He said that not only have the blue pike died out forever but also a number of other important species in the Great Lakes will never regenerate because they have been totally destroyed by the carelessness of man. These lakes became so polluted by industrial and domestic poisons that every living creature in them died. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the influence of man, many rivers throughout the world have suffered the same fate as many lakes. Perhaps the most notorious of polluted rivers in the late 1970s and early 1980s was the Rhine. Mankind poured on a daily basis from industry into that river chloride, sulphate, calcium, magnesium and nitrate totalling nearly 62,000 tonnes. Of course, it had a tremendous and terrible effect upon the life in that river. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of pesticides on algae and plankton, on which we depend for oxygen, in our oceans is incalculable. We do not know what effect that has had. I also read with interest that in the United States alone about 142 million tonnes of smoke and noxious fumes are dumped into the atmosphere annually. Another point of interest is that every 10 minutes a four-engine jet aircraft emits 2 2/3 tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These are the kinds of things that mankind is guilty of in terms of looking after the biosphere which, as we have had described so many times here, is so fragile. </PARA>
<PARA> Another interesting point I read was that a single Sunday edition of the New York Times consumes 150 acres of forest land. I also read that 14 acres of forest are being destroyed in the world every minute. These are the kinds of things that mankind is guilty of. People ought not to wonder why we are now coming to our senses in Bills such as the one before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that some of the destruction of the environment occurred as a result of human ignorance-for example, the early dust bowls. Throughout our country today there are areas of salinity that are almost irreparable; they have resulted from what we thought were good farming techniques in cutting down all the trees. Farmers who did that sort of thing to create more agricultural land were even getting taxation rebates, and probably still are. This is proving to be a very serious problem for our environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly today's generation is beginning to take the responsibilities of the environment much more seriously. Every day there are news items that highlight some aspect of the need to take care of the environment or some policy with regard to the environment. Scientists are emphasising daily the delicate balance of nature, and we have heard that reiterated in many of the speeches today. The eminent theologian John Stott, whose commentaries on the environment I have taken the liberty to use a fair bit today, said:</PARA>
<PARA>God has established in nature almost unbelievable powers of recuperation and regeneration, and in particular a cycle for the renewal of energy from sun to earth through plants and bacteria and back again. </PARA>
<PARA>Barbara Ward, in Only one earth: the care and maintenance of a small planet, a book published by Penguin which she co-authored with a chap called Rene Dubos, called the powers of the planet to recuperate and regenerate `the most majestic unity' of our planet. She also said in relation to natural laws:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a dynamic equilibrium of biological forces held in position by checks and balances of a most delicate sort. </PARA>
<PARA>That really describes the pristine situation that exists in the Antarctic. A contributor to her book is Dr John Klotz, an American conservationist, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>They are so intricate that they could not have developed by chance. </PARA>
<PARA>If we despoil the green surface of the earth or destroy the plankton of the oceans we will quickly reach the point of no return in the recycling process. Barbara Ward said:</PARA>
<PARA>Our immense modern scientific knowledge teaches us one thing above all . . . the need for extreme caution, a sense of the appalling vastness and complexity of the forces that can be unleashed, and of the eggshell delicacy of the agents that can be upset. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend those very wise comments to the House. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the principal features of this Bill, I fully support the proposal to prohibit any mining or related activities in the Australian Antarctic Territory or any like activities by Australian nationals or corporations. The coalition's policy on this matter is well documented and in the past it has taken a high profile against any form of mining in the Antarctic. We vigorously opposed the signing of the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities and, as a result of increased pressure, the Government agreed not to sign the convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's current environmental policy has expressed its strong support for the Antarctic Treaty as providing `the most effective method for the control and protection of the Antarctic environment and opposes any attempt to alter substantially the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty'. We also opposed, of course, the signing of the minerals regime, as I mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> In a previous speech to the House I endorsed the comments of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, some members of which visited the Antarctic at the beginning of 1989. In particular, I endorsed the comments with regard to not signing the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities. The report carried that endorsement. At the same time I stated that it was a weak and inadequate convention and that we were right not to have signed it. At that time I placed on record the lead taken by the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), in urging the Government to block the Convention by not signing it. </PARA>
<PARA> The three concepts in environmental policy making should be fragility, interconnectiveness and human stewardship. There ought to be one key virtue, and that virtue is prudence or wisdom. I think the Government has shown considerable wisdom in this regard and the Opposition, in supporting the Minister, is also exercising a great deal of wisdom. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for a comprehensive conservation strategy for the Antarctic is urgent. We urgently need a development regime with strong environmental protection and impact statements covering any activities in the Antarctic. I also support the call to examine the feasibility of extending the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service framework to cover the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government response, especially in terms of resources, must match the significance and urgency of Antarctic environment protection and research. I notice that one of the permissible activities in the Antarctic will be scientific work. We have to be very careful about that. I recently came across an article headed `Who's polluting Antarctica', which said:</PARA>
<PARA>While scientists worry about the impact of tourism, conservationists say science itself threatens the fragile Antarctic environment. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very interesting article. We have to be very careful that we do not get too carried away by letting anything take place that may in any way affect the magnificent environment that is the subject of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Government must reflect new levels of commitment to meeting Australia's responsibility in the Antarctic, particularly with regard to the official government body that operates there. I do not think it is very well funded, particularly in terms of any future considerations in the area, and perhaps it ought to receive a lot more attention from that point of view. I am quite certain that any person who goes to the Antarctic will recognise that this is a special part of the world and, as the honourable member for Cowper emphasised so effectively, that it is a place well worth preserving. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay this debate very long, but I rise to speak in support of the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill. My interest in the environment and this area goes back quite a long way, as my academic studies were mainly in botany and zoology. My first real interest in Antarctica was aroused because a professor I had was very interested in the botany of the Antarctic, and I became interested in studying various aspects of the environmental ecology side of Antarctica.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the most important idea that has come through to me, watching and listening to people in this debate, is that we need to be good stewards, not only of Antarctica, this very large continent that is largely uninhabited and untouched by humans, but also, of course, of all of the world. The Antarctic continent gives us an opportunity to show that we can be good stewards commensurate with the knowledge that we have to manage that part of the world. In that respect, Australia has a particular privilege because about 42 per cent of that continent is largely under our control. </PARA>
<PARA> So we are in a privileged position as a nation to provide leadership in this area on how we handle and how we manage this particularly sensitive environment. But, of course, the way in which we prohibit activities there, whether they be scientific or mining, always has to be weighed against our total knowledge of the world. Scientifically, we gather knowledge each decade and we understand the world more fully as we gain that information. So I am one who supports the gathering certainly of some amount of scientific information from that part of the world because I think that is the way of the world and it is the way in which we increase our knowledge of this beautiful planet on which we live. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, at the present time there are high risks involved in any of our activities in Antarctica, due mainly to our lack of knowledge of that area and, of course, our incapacity as humans to control a lot of the extreme factors-whether they be as the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) indicated, travelling down there on a ship and encountering the huge waves and seas, or whether it is the extreme cold or whatever. The Antarctic environment, as we have already been told by many speakers, is a beautiful environment. It is amazing for us as Australians to see because it is so totally different from the continent on which we live. Our continent is a relatively warm one with very little ice and snow. When we go down to see that landscape it has a great impact, and I think the types of animals which one sees there in abundance-the seals and penguins-also have that sort of impact on us as Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to come back to where this debate began with regard to the Opposition and point out that the Opposition has maintained a balance right throughout the environmental debate. The Brundtland commission came down on ecologically sustainable development. I think in this area, members of the coalition have, as a party, maintained a very sensible balance with regard to environmental matters right throughout the period from the 1960s until the 1990s. Of course, our interest in the environment of Antarctica goes back to the Antarctic Treaty Act 1960. I believe that balance was spoken about today-particularly by the shadow Minister for the environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), who spoke earlier in the day and outlined how the coalition parties had maintained a sensible direction through a period in the decade of the 1980s when pressure groups were operating in Australia. They pushed different governments in Australia, including the Federal Government, past what one could say was a balanced position. </PARA>
<PARA> So I enter this debate to say not only that I support the position of the Government and Opposition with regard to this particular Antarctic environment, which is a beautiful one, but also to say that there is a wealth of evidence that the coalition parties have maintained a very sensible balance with regard to environmental matters in this nation. I have no doubt that we will continue to do so in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I would like to thank honourable members for their contributions. I think it is a very proud day for this Parliament when we can have an in-depth discussion of an important Bill like the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill; but I think, more than that, we have a commitment from both sides of the Parliament. I have listened to some of the debate today, particularly the speech of the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). One could not doubt his sincerity and his commitment. In fact, I am very envious of him for having been to Antarctica twice whereas I have never been there. That is one of the problems that one faces when one becomes a Minister-it takes so long to get there and Ministers just never have the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, in the last few months three members of this Parliament have been able to travel to Antarctica-not only the honourable member for Cowper, but also the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) and my own Senior Private Secretary. I have witnessed their conversion. I have to say that none of those people, with the exception of my own staff member, could be classified as being a deep shade of green, but I have to say that by the time they had returned they were the deepest shades of green as far as the protection of the Antarctic was concerned. I think it is one of those areas that win over one's heart and one's mind. We saw that very much reflected in the speeches today. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the tone of this debate will really help the Government in its attempt to get world recognition for our cause-that is, the banning of all mining in the Antarctic area. We have had some success. It seems that the Antarctic Treaty parties are listening to us. When we first announced our opposition to mining in Antarctica we were regarded as mad radicals. But I think the support for our position has been growing significantly, primarily because of the sorts of views which all members of the House have put. We are very committed to this and I think if anyone reads the speeches from today, he or she will see that we continue to pursue our views in relation to stopping mining in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> France, Belgium and Italy have now joined us as four co-sponsors of our proposal. At the Antarctic Treaty meeting in Chile in November last year 12 of the 39 parties to the Treaty called for a prohibition of mining in Antarctica. So we are getting there. Even the countries which are most firmly wedded to the Antarctic minerals convention have now accepted that it is unlikely that they will be able to get any force behind that convention. So what was seen first of all as a bold step now has very wide support and I think it is demonstrably the right course. </PARA>
<PARA> I found it a great experience when I attended a conference in Geneva about climate change when the Prime Minister of France stood up and espoused his country's support of our position and congratulated us on the leadership role we have taken in relation to that. So we are getting the rest of the world to think like us, and I again thank honourable members for enhancing this debate.</PARA>
<PARA> The Antarctic Treaty parties will meet again in Madrid in just over a month's time to continue their discussion of the future of the Antarctic environment. I think they would be very well prepared if they took some of the speeches which were delivered today. I am glad that the honourable member for Cowper is back in the chamber because, as I have said, his speech should be sent to anyone who has any doubts about which way to vote on this issue. I am convinced that, as we approach that meeting, more of our Treaty partners will come to accept the correctness of what we are seeking to achieve and will follow the lead that we are taking on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill shows our commitment to achieving meaningful protection of Antarctica. It demonstrates that we expect other countries to adopt this sort of approach in their own legal systems. The Government's view is that the environmental and scientific values of the Antarctic are so outstanding on a world scale that mining should never be contemplated. That view has been enforced by all of the comments made by the honourable member for Cowper. </PARA>
<PARA> There are very few issues in this Parliament on which we have such enthusiastic, united views. I think those honourable members who have been to the Antarctic understand the damage that mining could do to that area. It is not acceptable. I think the Bill soundly conveys that message. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of issues were raised in relation to the penalties and also in relation to the application of the legislation. I will refer briefly to those issues. In relation to the penalties, I have received some advice from the Attorney-General's Department. The question of penalties was raised by the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), who referred to clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill. In the case of individuals, the penalty has been set at a maximum of $100,000. Owing to the operation of the Crimes Act 1914, this amount is $500,000 if the offender is a corporation. The basis for that is that the Great Barrier Marine Park Act provides for a penalty of $50,000 for a similar offence by an individual and $250,000 if a corporation is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a trend in environmental legislation to impose higher penalties if the danger is more obvious. The penalty in the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill really reflects this. Not only can a penalty be imposed, but because the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 operates the court can also order that profits be forfeited. It is always difficult to set that right amount, but that is the sort of benchmark we have used in relation to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8 provides for minor offenders to be dealt with in a court of summary jurisdiction, and the lower penalty reflects this. However, for the offence to be dealt with summarily, it must be proper that it be dealt with in this way and the defendant and the prosecutor must consent to this. The rationale that is generally given is that the lower penalty reflects a more minor offence that is being dealt with summarily. However, it is still an indictable offence and the Proceeds of Crime Act operates so that the court can order profits to be forfeited. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as enforcement is concerned, I think that the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) made some very good points in relation to enforcement. This legislation is very difficult to enforce, but just because it is difficult does not mean we should avoid legislation like this that is based on a very firm principle that this Parliament is obviously committed to. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is a bit of a safeguard in that an offender is most likely to be a corporation and thus have a presence in Australia. Therefore, the prosecution could be pursued in Australia as soon as we have knowledge of the offence. It would require a fair amount of action on behalf of any particular corporation to actually start doing something which would offend this legislation and I think we have a pretty good idea of what is going on in the area. In reality it is highly unlikely that mining or even prospecting would begin without our knowledge due to the logistics involved in carrying out such an activity in Antarctica. The legislation is still not perfect, but I think that the reality of it is that we can take action if the offender is a corporation based in Australia. It is important that this matter should be raised. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important that the honourable member for Braddon should raise the issue of the application of the legislation to foreign nationals. Applying legislation to foreign nationals in the Australian Antarctic Territory does raise problems as many countries do not recognise Australia's sovereignty over the Territory. As he pointed out, that is one of the critical issues. We have had to be very careful that we do not use this legislation as a way of pushing our sovereignty case because that would just alienate many of the parties to the Treaty. The legislation is not about that at all; it is really about asserting the principles that we hold very dearly with regard to protection of that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does create problems of enforcement and, in particular, the difficulty of extradition from countries which do not recognise Australia's sovereignty. The Bill aims to balance Australia's position in terms of sovereignty and its environmental protection objectives within the Antarctic Treaty system. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of the current negotiations for a comprehensive environmental protection regime, Australia wishes to prohibit mining to the extent of its legal capacity, but at the same time minimise the concerns of other nations whose support we seek within the Treaty system. So it is a very fine balance. Accordingly, the Bill does exempt persons from prosecution if they are nationals of a country which has enacted similar legislation under which they are liable to be prosecuted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill's approach is very similar to other existing Antarctic legislation-that is, the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 and the Antarctic Marine Living Resources and Conservation Act 1981 which assert jurisdiction over any person in the Australian Antarctic Territory and Australians elsewhere in Antarctica. It also provides exemptions for those foreign nationals whose activities were properly authorised as provided for in the international agreements for which the Acts were implemented. So I suppose that one could say it is a balance. We really do not want to jeopardise our chances of getting other parties to actually support this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Other issues were raised, particularly the issue of conservation strategy to which, I would like the House to know, I am very committed. This is one of the issues that the Antarctic Foundation should deal with as a matter of priority when it is established and approach that strategy in conjunction with the Antarctic Division. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time like this it is appropriate that we pay tribute to the people in the Antarctic Division, and particularly those who go down to the Antarctic on a very regular basis. Those scientists, workers and leaders make an enormous contribution. I am sure they enjoy it and that is one of the reasons why they do it, but that does not take away from the fine contribution they make to preserving that very important part of the universe. </PARA>
<PARA> I also pay tribute to those members of parliament who over the years have also gone to Antarctica because it does show that they are people who are not content just to read about these areas in books or to theorise about the issues, but who are prepared to demonstrate their commitment by actually going and having a look for themselves. Then they are able to come back and help convert others. I am sure that the speech of the honourable member of Cowper did more to convert many non-believers, or even those who were apathetic, than any of the speeches that I would give or the documents that one would read from scientists. My thanks go to all honourable members for their contributions. I wish more environmental issues could be discussed in this chamber with as much enthusiasm and commitment as this one has been discussed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful that the House has moved to the committee stage because I did wish to raise further a matter which the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) did address in her concluding remarks-namely, this question of penalty. I raise it because there was concern in the Opposition party room about the scale of damage that could be done if this legislation were breached. The stakes are very high and anybody who had the economic power to breach this legislation would be a very large corporation. It was thought that the scale of penalty might not be sufficient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know how many members in my party room joined with me in not knowing about the general provision in the Crimes Act 1914, to which the Minister referred, which multiplies penalties by a factor of five where corporations are involved. I acknowledge that that means, therefore, that the penalty on the face of this document of $100,000 therefore represents $500,000 for a corporation. In the case of the summary proceedings, one goes from $10,000 to $50,000 and from $50,000 to $250,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I still ask the Minister to give consideration not merely in the committee stage but perhaps in the peace and quiet of her office when taking advice as to whether this is an area where larger penalties might be warranted. Looking at the scale of penalties that are involved in existing legislation, one finds, for example, in the Trade Practices Act 1974 penalties of up to $250,000 for a body corporate. In some of the proposals for company law reform one finds proposals for penalties on individuals of up to $200,000 which, on the multiplier principle which is actually specifically in the corporations law as well, means penalties of up to $1m for insider trading being regarded as desirable. The Trade Practices Commission has reported that, in its view, some of the existing commercial penalties are simply inadequate for the scale of offences involved. </PARA>
<PARA> When one tries to put it into the context of the Antarctic and the minerals convention, I also ask the Minister to bear in mind some of the points that were made by the Treasurer, Mr Keating, when on 21 September 1988 he wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, who was at that time a proponent in our signing of the minerals convention. Mr Keating, in supporting his case, said that he thought we should negotiate a better way. Of course the Keating view is the same as the view that the Opposition adopted and the one which was ultimately adopted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer, quoting his colleague the Minister for Resources and Energy, made the point in his letter:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the Minister for Resources has stated</PARA>
<PARA>that the outcome of negotiations in respect of an anti-subsidies article is also completely unsatisfactory. The prospect of subsidised minerals production is a real one in that countries may well decide to mine on a subsidised basis as a means of pre-empting access to Antarctic mineral resources, particularly for strategic purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>I just raise that as one of the range of possibilities. What the Treasurer is drawing attention to is that there could be circumstances where there are very large strategic, economic and, indeed, political issues involved in this area. Therefore, the half-million dollar penalty-which seems rather an enormous sum to a middle-class Australian-is probably not something that would be a button off the shirt of the sort of people with whom we might have to deal. I would therefore commend for our further attention that question so that we might consider whether some greater penalty is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I make that point and refer to the subsidy because in the Minister's reply to the second reading debate she specifically made the point that the financial penalties are augmented by the capacity to take action to recover profits. I think that was a perfectly sensible additional point and a potential additional penalty, but as her colleague the Treasurer has pointed out, one might be in a situation where people were quite knowingly going into this situation expecting to make losses and indeed being in a position of subsidising it, and therefore that additional penalty is not available. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to press the point in committee at this stage. This Bill will go before the Senate no doubt some time over the coming weeks, but not for at least a month, I would have thought, given that we are rising for three weeks at the end of this week. What I would ask the Minister at the table to do is simply consider that further and to let me have her considered reply. I am not at this stage indicating that the Opposition has adopted a final position. We have not. I simply acknowledge that, led by the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey), there was a general view in our party room that this is a matter that should be explored further and we should consider the possibility of moving amendments in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to speak in the committee stage very briefly. Initially I thank the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories for the kind words she uttered about my contribution during the second reading debate. Having the opportunity to have-and it will be brief-a second bite at the cherry, there are a couple of other items that I did not have time to mention in my previous speech, and I would just like to comment on those. I was prompted to do this by the Minister, who made mention of the scientists who were involved, many of whom go down year after year. I had omitted, in paying tribute to the early explorers and to the people of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition (ANARE) at the moment, to home in specifically on what is being done in the way of science.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australians should all be very proud indeed of what is happening down there. I will not attempt to go into the vast range of biological projects going forward involving the birds and the animals, including the seals, but the upper atmosphere physics research is of vital importance to the ozone layer, and that of course is of vital importance to the whole world. The cosmic ray research being done at Mawson-and I believe that is the only place in the Southern Hemisphere where this sort of research is being undertaken-again is of vital importance. I just wanted to pay a tribute to those scientists who are involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I might in particular mention Dr Pat Quilty, the Assistant Director, Science, in the Antarctic Division, who made a monumental find at Marine Plain in the Vestfold Hills last season when he discovered the fossilised skull of a dolphin. Fine, that is great. The reality is, though-although one speaker in the debate earlier today made mention of dolphins being down there now-that dolphins are not down there now. It is too cold for dolphins. So the significance of finding a fossilised skull of a dolphin is that it is direct evidence of a time when the Antarctic was significantly warmer than it is now. Of course that relates to the fossils I mentioned in my earlier speech-the gum leaf and even the petrified wood, which is quite outstanding and quite remarkable. That is very significant indeed. Also I had the pleasure about four weeks ago of being with Dr Quilty on the Marine Plain, out of Davis, and to actually see the fossilised skulls and vertebrae of several whales. This is such tremendous work that I felt it deserved my taking a little of the Parliament's time to pay tribute to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, my final point is that we desperately need an airstrip in the Australian Antarctic Territory. Davis is the place to put it. It can be built on a barren, rocky area very easily. We would not have the environmental problems that the French had at Dumont d'Urville. In fact, when we stop and consider, every one of the four Russian bases in Australian territory has an airstrip. The United States flies in and France flies in. Almost everybody flies in except Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The advantage to Australia is not just in saving me six weeks in going to and from, but it would save the Minister time. It would mean that Ministers of this Parliament, of this Government, would be able to visit the Australian Antarctic Territory. I believe that is vitally important. The Minister, I know, with her great enthusiasm, would benefit enormously from the opportunity of visiting the Australian Antarctic Territory. So I want to flag that, for me, this will be a continuing project which I will be pushing as long as I am here until we get it, because the advantage to Australia is great. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the fact that the Minister might be able to go. Most of the people doing the scientific work are moderately junior-they are postgraduate students or just graduates doing valuable work-but the senior people from our universities and our research institutions do not have the time to go down. I am convinced, as is everybody that I have spoken to about this, that if this airstrip were built we would get down there the more senior people from right around Australia-and indeed the world, because we are already very generous in assisting scientists from other countries going there. We had a Swedish palaeontologist on the ship on this last voyage. </PARA>
<PARA> If we can accelerate the input of senior scientists from right around Australia, it is going to be to the advantage of the scientific research programs which are vital to the future of Australia and, indeed, the whole world. So I commend, in conclusion, the thought that this Parliament, the Government and the next Government must work to get us an airstrip at Davis so that Australia can properly service its interests and the world's interests in the Australian Antarctic Territory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to speak to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill and the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill in this cognate debate. I foreshadow that I will be moving second reading amendments to both Bills. I shall start by looking at the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill and then turn to the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable members will be aware, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill before us today is legislation to provide cost supplementation funding for States, Territories and higher education institutions. The Bill also provides for the transfer of funds from the technical and further education (TAFE) sector to higher education in accordance with the transfer of certain courses in Queensland to the higher education sector. While the Opposition will not oppose this Bill I will, as I stated, be moving an amendment to the second reading motion and my remarks on the state of higher education and training will address the matters referred to in my amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only last week that I went to considerable lengths to point out to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins)-who, I am pleased to see, is in the House this evening-the very serious problems which are being faced in the higher education sector. I pointed out to the Minister and the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) the enormous disaffection which exists within the higher education community towards their disruptive and damaging policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Higher education is one more area where the Government's micro reform intentions have failed. The effect of the forced industry restructuring which has occurred since 1988 has been to produce a bureaucratically administered system dominated by ministerial discretion. The much touted reforms have failed to introduce adequate flexibility and incentives to enable Australia to maintain and extend an internationally competitive higher education system with world-class standards. The incentives to which the Government's changes give rise encourage competition for bureaucratic favours rather than healthy competition in the educational marketplace. It has created a situation where institutions have been bullied, bludgeoned and blackmailed, in a financial sense by the threat of withholding capital grants, into forced amalgamations and new institutional arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In Question Time yesterday, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services referred directly to a statement in the submission by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee (AVCC) to the Australian Education Council working party on higher education which, for understandable reasons, pleased him. He had referred to this statement in a speech he gave to this House on 7 March. He had foreknowledge of it because the document from which he quoted was dated 8 March. Let us just say that he was obviously being kept well informed. The statement to which the Minister referred reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Overall, however, the AVCC believes that the profiles and present data collection methods provide an excellent accountability mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA>He referred yesterday to the fact that in my speech last week I had quoted a contrary view from a person who was not speaking on behalf of the AVCC and that it was I alone, the shadow Minister, who had raised issues about the educational profiles process. I inform the House that the person whose views I particularly quoted last week was the Executive Director of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, Mr Frank Hambly. Mr Hambly spoke at a graduation ceremony at the Australian National University on 28 September last year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>While Mr Dawkins was at pains from the outset to claim that the system would be deregulated and that institutional autonomy would be preserved, the reality is that there is scope for much more government control over higher education than there was in the past. For example, through the educational profile process, the Government has considerable scope for telling institutions what they can teach, what research they can undertake and how they should manage their affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>In short, in Mr Hambly's view, the educational profiles process opened the way to extensive government intrusion into the matters where government should keep out. There is no doubt that in expressing this view-closely linked in time with the most recent profiles exercise-Mr Hambly was expressing a view which is very widespread about the profiles process and, indeed, the whole context within which the process operates. So the Minister must have been surprised and delighted to read that the AVCC, of which Mr Hambly remains Executive Director, believes that the profiles and present data collection processes provide an excellent accountability mechanism. Not `acceptable', not `preferable for the time being', not `useful for certain purposes', but `excellent'. Excellent is a strong word which does not easily admit a qualification. </PARA>
<PARA> When the AVCC has weighed all these matters, including presumably the fact that the process gives the Government considerable scope for telling institutions what they can teach, what research they can undertake, and how they should manage their affairs, the process is, overall, excellent. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose this raises some questions about the criteria for excellence in an accountability mechanism. There would be those, no doubt, who would feel that a process which gives the Government considerable scope for interference in institutional teaching, research and management was less than excellent; but then, they are different standards of judgment and different contexts. I am bound to say that context is always important in assessing what someone or somebody says. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other statements in the AVCC submission which, falling into the hands of someone who was intent on taking statements out of context, might give a misleading impression also. For example, there is the statement that:</PARA>
<PARA>The AVCC strongly believes that priorities must be set nationally. </PARA>
<PARA>This might be represented by such a person to be an endorsement of the way in which national priorities have been set, including through the national priorities reserve fund, which has certainly caused angst in some institutions. Of course, there are those who would think that such a statement goes too far when the main locus for setting of priorities and research and teaching should be the individual researcher team or department rather than the national government. Again, there is a statement in the document from which the Minister quoted that Australian higher education institutions `would all rather deal with one paymaster'. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken out of context, this apparently enthusiastic affirmation of thraldom runs strongly counter to the view of the Higher Education Council which, in its discussion paper The Challenges Ahead, has a section on diversification of funding. Of course, I am not saying that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has to agree with the Higher Education Council. The Higher Education Council states in that section of its paper:</PARA>
<PARA>In order to promote institutional autonomy and a greater degree of entrepreneurial activity, the Council recommends that institutions seek to increase their capacity to acquire funds from other than Commonwealth sources: private sources, industry and commerce, full-fee students. In the past it has been considered that Government funding was needed to preserve the independence of institutions and academics. It should now be clear that more than one provider is also desirable to preserve such independence, even if the non-Government sources provide quite limited funding at the margins. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement I have quoted from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee document might seem to run counter to this. It might be read out of context as a statement that the AVCC does not support any State funding for universities. It might indicate that the AVCC is rejecting the view that diversity of funding sources is desirable. There is, after all, some rhetorical strength in its statement that higher education institutions would all rather deal with one paymaster. The Minister might well seek to use such statements to support the system of bureaucratic control he has established. If he did so, he would soon find that the views of the higher education community had more diversity than he might imagine. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it is appropriate or proper for these views to be taken out of context. That context is a document which is concerned with the very specific issue of the devolution of responsibility of higher education to the States. That is a matter on which the AVCC has very properly expressed views and it has expressed them clearly. It is in that context that these other enthusiastic formulations should be read-though the flourish of the word `excellent' in relation to the profiles process in a system which, according to the Executive Director of the AVCC, allows considerable scope for telling institutions what they can teach, what research they can undertake and how they should manage their affairs is, perhaps, surprising. Still, the coalition will note the fact that the AVCC is not itself troubled by this potential. </PARA>
<PARA> While in no way wishing to follow the Minister in taking statements out of context, I feel that it is worth pointing out that the document the AVCC has issued makes it quite clear:</PARA>
<PARA>There are already complaints from institutions that the Commonwealth government imposes excessive and unnecessary demands on institutions for information, and that it is unnecessarily obtrusive in their affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>This comment, to which the Minister referred yesterday, directly contradicts his claim that it is only the Opposition that has raised questions about this process. There are complaints from institutions to exactly the same effect. It notes that the Minister has taken action to reduce the demands of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training on institutions. Whether this action is effective time will tell. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make the point that whether or not the Minister acts to reduce the information demands about which institutions have complained, this in no way touches the fundamental issue raised by Mr Hambly about the potential for abuse in this process; and it certainly cannot be said that the Government would not think of abusing the process. As I pointed out last week, at times the behaviour of this Government has been grossly irresponsible. I cite the attack by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training on Bond University. </PARA>
<PARA> The document from the AVCC, which has attracted so much attention in the last two days, is at some pains to clarify its criteria for recommending that an institution be called a university and for admitting the vice-chancellor to membership of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. It spells out these criteria, which include breadth and depth of course offerings, academic quality, awards that meet community standards, and funding of staffing, library and equipment resources at an appropriate level. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee states that Bond University met all these standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has called it an abject failure. This is surely one of the most irresponsible things a Minister could say and must be seen as a calculated attempt to undermine Bond University. Given this kind of ministerial behaviour, there is every reason to believe that a potential for abuse in the system of accountability will be taken. Indeed, institutions know well how far they can trust this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I pointed out to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training the gaping inconsistencies between the actions of the Government and his guarantee on 15 June 1989 in which he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this Government has explicitly stated that it will support only mergers which have the support of the institutions concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>The commitment provides a striking contrast with the appalling way in which, apparently, the junior Minister is seeking to dismember the Australian National University. We have still not had a comment from the Minister, who appears to be dithering on this issue, to clarify the Government's position. This is continuing, despite the upwelling of opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I spoke to a rally of students and staff attended by the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University and the deans of several faculties, who are all angered and worried by the Minister's efforts to jeopardise and destroy the security and standards of their institution, leaving them with a feeling of great uncertainty about their futures. At this point, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all the words after``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's continued mismanagement of higher education, and, in particular, it deplores the Government's failure to provide the sector with the flexibility and incentives it needs to address the academic staff shortage, and to provide for adequate opportunities to meet the diverse educational needs of students''. </PARA>
<PARA>The debate this evening takes place in the context of a statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) which, with one minor and welcome exception, completely overlooked the problems facing higher education and which made a mockery of the rhetoric of the clever country. It has been only a year since the Government's call for the development of a clever country and there is every indication that the complete antithesis is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> Such is the impact of this Government's initiatives that over this decade we are highly likely to see a major brain drain from Australia unless changes are made. Such is the impact of the ad hoc policies of the Government that it is serving to drive overseas the cream of Australia's academic world. Dr Des Nicholls, the dean of the faculty of economics and commerce at the Australian National University, offered these reasons in last Sunday's Canberra Times for the departure of many unhappy academics to overseas positions:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the instability into which Australian tertiary education has been cast; continued threats to the ANU as an institution; a real reduction in Australian academic salaries and the lack of flexibility of appointments and salaries within the ANU itself. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me comment for a moment on the issue of flexibility in salary and employment conditions for academic staff, because this is one of the fundamental reforms that must be made and to which no reference was made in the Prime Minister's statement. Staff morale remains at an all time low. Salaries are falling, staff shortages are increasing, and there is little likelihood that academic staff can be attracted from overseas. The Government's centralised wage fixation process remains one of the major impediments to a solution in this area, as it does in other areas of Australian life. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor McNicol, the Vice-Chancellor of Sydney University, advised the Government late last year that if it was not going to be able to provide the funds required it should at least give the universities the flexibility to respond in the ways they thought best to ensure quality. I quote Professor McNicol:</PARA>
<PARA>A freer market for academic salaries will arise when there is a free market for universities on the income side. We should begin by canvassing alternatives to the highly regulated unified national system of higher education . . . If the commonwealth cannot or will not increase the resources going to universities, it should not persevere with a system which impedes them from raising the funds themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor McNicol has more recently expanded on this view in the most recent edition of the University of Sydney News, released yesterday. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have opposed vouchers in the past, and recommended that the Commonwealth should persevere with profiles and HECS. However, the present system-</PARA>
<PARA>the system the Government defends to the end-</PARA>
<PARA>is so manifestly unable to provide the funds needed to satisfy people's expectations of higher education that other alternatives must be urgently canvassed. We need to examine the proposition that portable vouchers, plus the ability to charge full fees for local students, would allow the system to adjust itself to demand and provide more adequate resources to satisfy that demand than does the present Commonwealth-controlled rationing system. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth-controlled rationing system is what we have in higher education at the moment. The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne, Professor David Penington, also stated in January:</PARA>
<PARA>Deregulation of a kind which would allow flexibility, diversity and competition so as to attract and retain outstanding staff in the face of the looming severe international shortage of able academics will require deregulation of the present highly centralised funding system . . . we need new approaches if the problems are to be effectively solved. </PARA>
<PARA>These vital, indeed central, issues for higher education were completely passed over in the Prime Minister's industry statement. The only item that in any way touched on the issues was the increase in post-graduate research scholarships. It was a welcome increase, but it only scratches the surface of the problem. This was made very plain in the report from the National Institute of Labour Studies which the Government received recently. The report's conclusion stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the requirements for additional staff over the next decade are substantial and these requirements will not be able to be met from the flow of Australian produced higher degree graduates. This is not to suggest that the jobs will necessarily be unfilled, but rather that other sources of supply will have to be tapped. Holding all other things constant, our analysis cast considerable doubt on the ability to attract suitably qualified local and foreign staff over the next decade or so. </PARA>
<PARA> The case study evidence on the adjustment mechanisms associated with current staff shortages suggests the inevitable long-term effects include reduction in recruitment standards, together with declining teaching and research standards as staff-student ratios are allowed to increase beyond optimal levels. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the report is referring to the change of government that will be occurring in two years time when it says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is of course possible that important changes will occur . . . which will alter these outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA>Having quoted from Professors McNicol and Penington, I think the House will be aware of the sorts of changes which the leaders of higher education have in mind. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Our projections are not actual predictions. What actually happens will be determined by the range of factors underpinning student load and the recruitment and retention of academic staff in Australian higher education. </PARA>
<PARA>I have taken the time to read this extract from the Blandy report because it draws attention to the complete hollowness of the clever country rhetoric. Australian higher education is facing a crisis of awesome proportions. The leaders of two of Australia's most prestigious universities have called for radical thinking and for a quite different approach to the highly centralised and regulatory approach of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's industry statement completely failed to address the fundamental issues facing higher education and, thus, as in so many other respects, had a gaping hole where there should have been substance and where people were entitled to demand substance. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to turn my attention to the State Grants (TAFE Assistance) Bill. This Bill seeks to provide supplementation funding for technical and further education for 1991 and to make adjustments for the transfer of funding from the TAFE sector to the higher education sector. TAFE is another area of education and training which has felt the clumsy efforts of the Federal Government, pursuing the mirage of the moment to impose further regulation in the interest of national priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The advisory body of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the Skills Formation Council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, or NBEET as it is referred to, expressed its concern at some central aspects of the Government's approach in a report released in September last year. The National Board of Employment, Education and Training said that the Commonwealth's regulations are `quite onerous and do not necessarily assist the Commonwealth in ensuring that agreed priorities are met'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister undoubtedly would not have been pleased with some of the criticisms that NBEET made of him in a report issued that same month assessing performance indicators contained in the 1989 resource agreements for TAFE. NBEET made these comments about the Commonwealth's setting of performance indicators in technical and further education:</PARA>
<PARA>These appear in some instances to be excessive and inappropriate or counterproductive to achievement of the Commonwealth's objectives. Current emphasis lies in assessment of quantity and input rather than quality and output. </PARA>
<PARA>These words will undoubtedly ring long in the ears of Government members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member says, it is the same old story. They are exactly the same policy failures as the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, chaired by Senator Aulich, drew attention to when it examined the issue of priorities in higher education. Whichever level of education is referred to, this is the same story of quantity and input rather than quality and output.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unlike other areas of education, the area of training and technical and further education has been the subject of a recent independent inquiry by Ivan Deveson, the Chief Executive of Nissan Australia, who chaired a committee of inquiry into training costs. In October 1990 his report was submitted to the Minister. The report recommended that open and flexible training markets be developed. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>Existing training arrangements comprise an unclear mixture of market and non-market driven activities. With market related activities growing rapidly and intruding into erstwhile non-market activities, the committee believes that clarification of the appropriate role of market processes in the overall training industry is urgently needed. </PARA>
<PARA>It recommended that technical and further education be used to provide a supporting set of services for such a development. The Committee also warned-and the Chairman took the trouble to explicitly warn in his letter forwarding the report to the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the whole subject of training must not become excessively burdened with the rigidities of the industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, in its conclusions the report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there was a need to ensure that training issues did not become overly dominated by industrial relations considerations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt from these comments that the Committee was worried by this very possibility, and, it must be said, realistically so, for every aspect of education and training has increasingly been dominated in this country by industrial relations considerations as the accord has provided an avenue for the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) to extend its power throughout Australian society. The Deveson Committee noted that the award restructuring process, as foreshadowed by the Government, had been relatively slow in encouraging private sector training. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Evidence provided to the Committee indicated that although many industries and enterprises had commenced negotiations on award restructuring, the pace of change was disappointingly slow. </PARA>
<PARA>This was in October last year. This is a familiar chorus under the Government's reforms-the pace of change is disappointingly slow. In the industry statement on Tuesday, we saw that in many areas no change is what is to be expected. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition supports moving technical and further education into a more responsive, flexible and competitive structure, allowing greater diversification and provision for increased autonomy in staffing and course structures; and encouraging the raising of funds from non-government sources and the provision of subsidies through individuals rather than courses or institutes. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition supports the development of an open and flexible training market. The development of private sector training could have a significant impact on the development of training programs in Australia. Technical and further education has a particularly important role to play in such a development, that is, given that Federal and State governments permit it to be developed in an open and flexible manner allowing it to become responsive to the market demands that are growing for training in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In a welcome legislative amendment last year, the Government removed the condition on its funding for technical and further education which prevented the levying of fees for entry courses; but there is still a long way to go if Australia hopes to emerge from the position that the Deveson report claims we hold in training programs in the world. That report said:</PARA>
<PARA>We are now arguably, at the back of the pack in skill formation relative to other OECD Countries . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The successful countries, such as West Germany and Japan, have long surpassed Australia in the provision of training skills for their youth. In a culture which rewards and admires achievement and the attainment of excellence, such as that in Germany, there are clear, well-resourced, well-funded and industry recognised training schemes and a great diversity of training opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> In West Germany today, almost 80 per cent of teenagers-virtually all those not attending university or college-are undertaking some form of training course. This does not compare particularly favourably with Australia, which has a national average of only 20 per cent of young Australians receiving a vocational education. The only other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country with a worse record than Australia is Greece. The OECD average is around 50 per cent. Despite the rhetoric which emanates from the Minister's office, the pace of micro-economic reform, again within the technical and further education and training sector, remains painfully slow. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry statement shows that the Government is essentially unable, because of its alliance with the ACTU, to address the essential reform issues facing this country. This is as true for education and training as it is for the labour market, the telecommunications industry, transport, the waterfront or coastal shipping. The Government cannot introduce the vital reforms because the leaders of the trade union movement will not let it. It cannot face up to the vital issue of greater flexibility and institutional autonomy in the tertiary sector because it has been busy drawing this sector further and further into the web of the centralised industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> It cannot face up to the issues of literacy and numeracy and standards monitoring in schools because its industrial allies will not even let it ask the questions which are of great concern to the rest of the community, and which must be addressed if we are going to become internationally competitive, and if the concept of the clever country is going to mean something. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the original two Bills, and to oppose the amendment. The first Bill, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, is essentially a Bill to maintain the level of funding to the tertiary education sector as a result of the increased costs it has experienced with rising prices in certain of its inputs. This will amount to an increase during the triennium of $171m of the total funding to that sector, and I support that. The other Bill, the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill, is to change some existing grants to the States for technical and further education (TAFE) as a result of the transfer of certain courses from TAFE to other parts of the further education sector in Queensland. As a result of the adjournment being upon us very shortly, I will only have time to deal with the first of these two Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition spokesman on higher education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), has spoken against both of them, and has moved an amendment which I oppose, which talks about the Government's inadequacies in certain respects. The way in which he has argued the case has been, as has been typical of his previous speeches against Government policy, to use some fairly damning words, and to support them with very extensive quotations, usually from the professoriate in universities who have opposed the kind of reform program that this Government has implemented. I started to count the number of professors as against the number of non-professors, but I stopped when the professors were clearly in the preponderance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition parties are claiming that this Government is not operating quickly enough in the area of micro-economic reform. This is an instance of micro-economic reform, among other things, and, as in other industries, one will find workers, employees, particularly those who are employed by the public purse, will resist change if they think it is contrary to their own interests. It is the responsibility of the Government to then establish what the national interest is, and if this conflicts with workers employed in the public sector, to explain to them why their opposition to reforms is bad for the nation, and that they should change in accord with national interests. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the task that this Government faces every time it undertakes micro-economic reform programs in the economic infrastructure of this country in order to improve its overall efficiency, and in order to reduce the economic inputs into industry. It is a fact that when one undertakes micro-economic reforms, one will encounter obstacles, some of them advanced by employees who are possibly featherbedded, who are finding their association with the public purse very convenient. I could take honourable members through our micro-economic reform program and show them where it is opposed by employees who are not in favour of reform. In the unlikely event of the Opposition parties ever having to undertake a micro-economic reform program, they will encounter precisely that sort of resistance. In the past they have never had this problem to deal with because they never undertook micro-economic reform. When they do, if they ever have to, they will find that is precisely where the obstacles come from. </PARA>
<PARA> What will they do then? Collect quotations from employees in public sector organisations who say this is bad for their system of work, for their work practices, and then abandon reforms, or are they going to realise that in order to undertake reform of publicly funded industrial enterprises in this country one does have to confront work practices across a wide range of spectrums. In some instances the employees in the public sector will be correct, and their views will have to be accommodated in their and the national interest. In many other instances they are precisely the problems erasing productivity of labour and efficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the honourable member, the spokesman for the Opposition on tertiary education, is continually reduced to quoting only the upper echelons of a system of education that is almost entirely publicly funded, and has been for many years in this country, should lead him to reflect on whether that is the sole source of wisdom on how that sector ought to be operated, or whether there are other considerations of a national interest character, of a social equity character, and of a socially progressive nature which ought to be brought into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to turn my attention tonight to these other considerations. The system of education that this Government inherited was a system which, particularly in the tertiary sector, had been greatly expanded by the Menzies Government, and I pay tribute to that Government for that expansion. It had been further enhanced by the Whitlam Government, and I pay tribute to that Government for acting in that way. It stagnated under the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me describe the way in which the sector worked when we came into office. Generally, it was like this: about 65 per cent of kids left school well before year 12 and entered the workforce unskilled and hopeful of acquiring skills in a fairly haphazard system of training that involved apprenticeships, on the job learning, this, that or the other, and various other inadequate forms of training for modern industrial society, which we did not have, and for which they were not needed as a result. The other one-third were the only ones eligible for entry into tertiary education. They were eligible-one-third of them did not get in-but they were the only ones who were eligible. Two-thirds of the age group of those kids were immediately ruled out of tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA> Was this such a disaster? Yes, it was. It was a disaster in two respects. It was a disaster for the kids who, at 15, were culled from even having the ability to compete for a university education, the end product of which, a degree, would put those in possession of it in possession of $400,000 per head in terms of lifetime earnings, as opposed to those who did not get in. That is the first disaster-a personal catastrophe committed and perpetrated on them at such an early age, and unknown to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The second disaster was that as a nation we were wasting vast numbers of kids who were not getting trained at any significant level, and certainly not at the level of university and tertiary education that was common in those other countries with which we are now competing in our efforts to become a modern industrial society. </PARA>
<PARA> So who got into university under that system? The number of factors influencing university entry were myriad. They included one's natural intelligence, one's family environment, the school that one went to, the geographic area one was brought up in, one's ethnicity and one's gender. All these factors influenced it. However, I had the good fortune whilst still an academic, and president of the relevant union at that time, to be deployed to find out which people got into university and what caused them to get into university, in order to produce a scheme which would equalise opportunity of access to university. </PARA>
<PARA> I found that in South Australia, my home State-dealing with the University of Adelaide which was then the major and oldest university in the State of South Australia-there were about 200 schools and colleges which did matriculation, from which kids would get into university. What did we find when we broke down how they got from those 200 schools into the University of Adelaide? We found six schools always provided between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of entrants. Twenty-five per cent to 30 per cent of entrants came from six schools. Anybody from South Australia could tell you which schools they were. They were all private colleges, except one. </PARA>
<PARA> The next 14 schools provided another 25 per cent to 30 per cent of entrants. Most of them were private colleges. A small number were state schools with very strong parent-teacher associations, and in higher income catchment areas. The next 74 provided another 30 per cent on a much smaller number-it would be one or two from each of these schools. The other 100 schools in the system would provide the remainder, that is, about 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the intake. Some schools had never sent a kid to university-never!</PARA>
<PARA> The way it came out, as everyone knows, was that if one were a working class kid in a small country town, the likelihood of one ever getting access to tertiary education, or even knowing of its existence in many instances, was pretty remote. So what we had was a highly streamlined system of entry into tertiary education, the rewards of which were very substantial. Within that system there was further segregation on the basis of the higher the score, the more likely one was to get in to the professions, the professional training faculties-law, medicine, electrical engineering and so on. Those working class kids who did get through the state schools, who did get into university, would find themselves in general science, agricultural science or arts where they were destined for much lower but still substantially above average incomes over a lifetime. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address the House on the subject of the recent announcement by Mrs Kirner, Premier of Victoria, to introduce 10,000 gaming machines into Victoria's hotels and licensed clubs. At the same time the Labor Government is proposing to set up a new independent commission to regulate the gaming industry. The difficulties experienced overseas and in other Australian States in controlling the gaming industry and in keeping out criminal elements is such that it is difficult to see why a similar arrangement would be any more successful in Victoria, particularly considering the existing abysmal record of the Victorian Government in keeping the industry clean.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer specifically to a case previously mentioned in my speech to this House on 14 May last year when I tabled conviction orders against Mr Nick Balagiannis, the managing director of Olympic Video Gaming Pty Ltd, otherwise known as Olympic Amusement Pty Ltd. I cited convictions in the Melbourne Magistrates Court during 1986 for smuggling, producing untrue documents and making false statements. All the convictions were related to gaming machines. Despite these conviction orders, the company was given ministerial approval to manufacture video amusement and poker machines in Victoria in early 1988 after the Lotteries, Gaming and Betting Act 1966 was conveniently amended in late 1987 to fully accommodate the Victorian manufacturing operation, which was then in South Clayton. This approval was reissued in late 1988 to cover Olympic's new premises at Springvale. </PARA>
<PARA> Olympic has subsequently lobbied for the introduction of poker machines into Australian Football League clubs in Victoria and aimed to commence operations in Queensland until stopped by an adverse report from the Criminal Justice Commission of Queensland. Having obtained freedom of information documents from the Department of Sport and Recreation in Victoria, I believe the matter must be regarded as rather more disquieting. Despite extensive reports put together about Olympic, nowhere are the convictions against the managing director alluded to, nor do any specific police reports on Olympic appear to have been sought. A letter of 15 January 1988 from Mr John Condon, Manager of the Gaming Regulation and Control Section of the Sport and Recreation Department of the Victorian Government, states:</PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence of the recent amendment to the Lotteries, Gaming and Betting Act, the Minister may now issue an authority for a person to construct, offer for sale, sell and possess a machine for gaming, if the machine is for use outside Victoria. This is the situation of Olympic Amusement Pty Ltd and it is requested that an authority be drawn up for the signature of the Minister to legally manufacture gaming machines. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently, in February 1988 Olympic was given authority to proceed. A letter dated 9 February 1988, signed by P.J. Power, Victorian Director of Racing and Gaming, enclosed the following authority from the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>I, Neil Benjamin Tresize, in accordance with section 68(14) of the Lotteries, Gaming and Betting Act 1966, hereby authorise Mr Nicholas Balagiannis of Olympic Amusements Pty Ltd, to construct, offer for sale, sell and possess, a machine for gaming if the machine is for use outside Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>I am moved to ask: why did Mr Tresize issue such an authority, given Olympic's record? Did he ever check with the Victoria Police concerning the list of convictions against the Managing Director, Mr Balagiannis? If he did, why has this not shown up in quite detailed reports on Olympic? It must be said, on the most charitable interpretation of the freedom of information documents in my possession, that Mr Tresize was grossly negligent in the discharge of his duties as a State Minister and his fitness for that high office must be severely questioned. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I seek leave to table all Department of Sport and Recreation documents relating to Olympic, received by me under the Freedom of Information Act. </PARA>

He has successfully secured support from many people and sporting organisations for the project. </PARA>
<PARA> Sources of strong support include the relevant New South Wales Ministers; executives of School Education; the ViceChancellor and Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney; local members of Parliament; the Executive Director of the Australian Sports Commission; Rob de Castella, long distance runner and Director of the Australian Institute of Sport; the Womens Advisory Council; and Anne Sargeant, former Australian netball captain. </PARA>
<PARA> Westfields High School has recently secured $250,000 from a major sponsor and has been pledged $200,000 by the New South Wales Minister for Sport, Recreation and Racing. The New South Wales Basketball Association has offered the sum of $1m for the project. Altogether, $1.4m has been raised by the school for this initiative which now requires only a further $200,000 to be able to build facilities incorporating four indoor courts, weight rooms, a fitness laboratory and an aerobics room. Once built, the school will have full use of the facilities with community access available in the evening and on the weekend. </PARA>
<PARA> Westfields High School has also applied to this Government for a seeding grant of $75,000 from the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to enable this innovative program to go ahead. In return, Westfields High has offered to be a `lighthouse' model which could be adapted to schools throughout Australia, and the school would offer its human and physical resources to the whole of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Sport is an integral part of the Australian culture. The creation of a secondary school dedicated to endeavour and excellence in academia, service and sport will promote the individual and collective self-confidence of Australians and will assist students in their transition to the world of work, tertiary study and national and international sport. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no examples of this type of school in Australia, but there are parallels in other areas-such as the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music, Newtown High, which specialises in the performing arts, and selective and agricultural high schools. </PARA>
<PARA> Westfields High would remain a comprehensive high school open to placement of all local students as well as offering places to talented sports people from all over New South Wales. Undoubtedly, the establishment of such an institution in this area would enhance the collective self-confidence of the people of Western Sydney-an enhancement of great educational and social importance. </PARA>
<PARA> In its 28 years, Westfields High has achieved an outstanding record in educational innovation, student welfare and academic excellence and an initiative such as this is sure to be successful in the climate of energy, expertise and commitment found at the school. The school has enjoyed an outstanding reputation for sporting achievement and has such a highly successful image that it would take a number of school years before the people on the waiting list could be enrolled. Westfields High has an outstanding sporting tradition and participates in the Lansdowne Zone which is probably the largest and most competitive in New South Wales. In the last 20 years, Westfields High has been the champion athletics school on 17 occasions, the champion cross country school 15 times and the zone swimming school for the last seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> The school's performance in State knockout competitions has been of a consistently high standard. In the State combined high school and Australian championships it has won over 37 gold, silver and bronze medals since 1980. The staff at Westfields High includes the Vice-Captain of the Australian netball team and a New South Wales Champions player. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time I have I would obviously say that Westfields High School has not gone into this project lightly and it is exploring every avenue available to it to transform this initiative into a reality. I believe we, as a government who cares about the quality of education the children of our nation are receiving, owe it to these energetic and farsighted people to support this project in any way we can and I call on the Minister to do so. It is through initiatives such as this, that Australia will indeed become the clever country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many Australians have become more health conscious in recent years than they were previously. I suppose, to some extent, this follows the trend in the United States and other places. These days, we regularly see people jogging and swimming, and I notice the Government Whip, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), who is in the chamber, swims a number of kilometres in the swimming pool downstairs every morning.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member is not too bad at it. This health consciousness has led to the emergence of an increasing number of alternative medical practitioners, health food stores and publications. An interesting development has been the development of the so-called health farm or health resort. In my electorate, I have a couple of these. The one I want to talk about tonight is the Hippocrates Health Centre at Mudgeeraba in the Gold Coast hinterland. This particular health centre-which, I might say, has excellent facilities, including a swimming pool and a tennis court-was founded in 1985. It is actually one of only five in the world. There are four centres of this type in the United States, with the Gold Coast centre being the only one such centre south of Florida.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic principle at Hippocrates is to teach people how to get healthier. People come to this centre from all over Australia-it is not just for Gold Coast residents-with all sorts of ailments. Through a special diet of raw foods-and I emphasise raw foods because this is the only centre of its type in the world where nothing is cooked; everything on the menu is absolutely raw-noted improvements and, very often, cures for people's ailments or afflictions result. </PARA>
<PARA> Ronald Bradley, the Director of the Gold Coast centre, maintains that wheat grass juice, which is derived from fresh wheat grass and is very high in potassium and amino acids, is to be attributed for the centre's remarkable success stories. I have tried wheat grass juice. It tastes pretty much like one would imagine wheat grass juice to taste like. It is very green. It does not taste nearly as bad as one would think, particularly when one knows one only has to drink a small amount of it to do a lot of good. I do not think I could live on it, but to the extent that it is very good for you I could probably survive on it for some period of time. </PARA>
<PARA> I attended a dinner at the Hippocrates Health Centre some time last month and was treated there to a feast that included sprouts, sunflower greens, buckwheat greens, almond sauce, avocado sauce, chickpea sauce, stuffed mushrooms and dehydrated bread. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might wonder how one would react to such a meal. My family and I found it very interesting, quite palatable and rather enjoyable. I suggest that, if any honourable member wants to try something different, on any Sunday night they go to Hippocrates and, for the very small sum of $8, have a very healthy meal. </PARA>
<PARA> The clinic has had remarkable success in helping cure people of their addictions, particularly the addiction to nicotine, which is a considerable problem in our society. Apparently, when the body receives foods high in alkalines-and raw foods are such foods-it responds much better to withdrawing from substances such as nicotine. People who go there in order to give up smoking have said how easy they have found it to give up smoking in that sort of environment. The fact that they are not able to have their cigarettes with them, I suppose, helps them. But they are not locked in. If they get really desperate, I guess they could go round the back or behind the toilets or wherever they go to have a smoke, but people do go there and are able to give up smoking. The centre has also had some incredible results with weight loss. Some quite large women have gone there and in the short space of a week or two--</PARA>

They are some of the things that perhaps are not entirely good for us. The beauty of centres such as Hippocrates and other places that promote a healthy lifestyle-and I am pleased to say that there are quite a few in my electorate-is that, in the long term, they represent a considerable saving to the public purse. The old saying `An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure' is very appropriate in the case of health care. I suggest that the Government could look at ways of recognising these particular centres.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8J4">Mr LES SCOTT</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Oxley)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.45)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House an event next week in my electorate of Oxley which is not only of tremendous historic significance to the Ipswich and West Moreton region but also of great relevance to this place. I refer here to the one-hundredth anniversary of the first ever meeting of a branch of the Australian Labor Federation (ALF)-the forerunner to the Australian Labor Party-in Ipswich which was held in the then School of Arts in Brisbane Street on 20 March 1891. On this day, officials of the ALF went to Ipswich and held a public meeting in the School of Arts building and a resolution was carried to establish a workers' political organisation in the area. This building later became the town hall and is still standing today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This meeting followed the laying down of goals for an organisational framework for a workers' political party throughout 1890 by the Australian Labor Federation which at that time was the peak council of Queensland's trade union movement. Following the meeting in Ipswich, officials of the ALF set a goal, throughout 1891, of establishing units of this party in every Queensland electorate with the aim of returning working men to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> As members of this place would well be aware, this important event for the Ipswich community is part of the Australia-wide historic celebrations planned this year for the one-hundredth anniversary of the birth of the Australian Labor Party-something which will be highlighted on the May Day weekend in Barcaldine in central Queensland and other centres including Ipswich where, in fact, the first ever Labor Day march was held at 9.30 a.m., beating Barcaldine whose march commenced at 3.00 p.m. the same day. I am sure that the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) is looking forward to those important celebrations in his area. </PARA>
<PARA> The city of Ipswich in the electorate of Oxley stands as one of the first centres outside Brisbane to establish its own branch of what went on to become the Australian Labor Party. In those times, party units were known as WPOs. In fact, one of those present at the first meeting in Ipswich, Mr James Wilkinson, went on to serve as a member of the House of Representatives for the Federal seat of Moreton between 1901 and 1906, which makes him one of the original members of this House. His constituency at that time may seem odd to some members of this Parliament, given that the electorate of Moreton today covers areas from the inner south of Brisbane to the outer southern fringe, but such was the nature of the constituency of members of Parliament in those times. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time, the seat of Moreton covered a much larger area and included the city of Ipswich-a fact that the present honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) may find interesting. At the time of the formation of a branch of the Australian Labor Federation in Ipswich, the electorate of Oxley centred much around the Gold Coast strip at a time when the area was not as renowned for its attraction as a holiday destination. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wilkinson's record in other areas of public office is indeed worthy of praise and, given the historical significance of the centenary to the Ipswich area, I take this opportunity to put on record his other community achievements. Born in Ipswich on 30 November 1854, James Wilkinson went on to become the first Australian or Ipswich born person to represent Ipswich in the Queensland Parliament. This was between 1894 and 1896. He was also an alderman on the Ipswich City Council in 1914, President of the School of Arts from 1914 to 1915 and a member of the Ipswich Technical College committee. </PARA>
<PARA> With such a proud record in public office, I am pleased that some of James Wilkinson's descendants have been able to come forward with further details on the early days of the Australian Labor Federation in the Ipswich and West Moreton area. In fact, Ms Sheree Domrow, who is Mr Wilkinson's great grand-daughter, and Mr Graham Halliwell, who is Mr Wilkinson's great grandson, did not know of their relationship to each other until a letter to the Editor of the Queensland Times requested any people with information on James Wilkinson to come forward. </PARA>
<PARA> Reflective of the enthusiasm with which the Ipswich community has taken up the commemoration of the labor movement's formation in Ipswich is a call received at my electorate office from a lady who proudly claimed that she lived in the house first occupied by James Wilkinson at the turn of the century, which he in fact built. Local folklore has it that her house was the first weatherboard house actually built in Ipswich. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the willingness of these people to come forward shows their desire to be part of the centenary celebrations which mark an important page in the historic record of the city of Ipswich-the oldest provincial city in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The culmination of this activity will be a function to be held at the Ipswich Trades Hall on 20 March which will be attended by senior representatives at the Federal and State level and members of the local labor movement, together with many people interested in this historic event. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted to have had the opportunity to speak on this important event, for I am sure that in 100 years time there will be double the reason to celebrate the success of the labor movement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to follow the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), from Ipswich. We share the same name but not the same politics. I want to address a couple of areas in the industry statement made yesterday by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and a number of areas that he did not address. I was quite devastated by the statement and what it did not do for primary industries. The only concession I can find for primary industries is a concession for the removal of sales tax on lubricants. The Government did not even have the courage to look at other primary industries inputs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In particular, I refer to petrol and the fuel excise on petrol which is used in primary industries. In this deep recession we should consider the extensive use of chainsaws and motorbikes used in primary production. The bikes use petrol; they do not go on roads and they are used for mustering in primary production. Many tractors and harvesting machinery use petrol too, and so clear distortion exists where diesel fuel excise is exempt when it is used for primary industries but petrol is not. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area the Government did not look at is land care. Quite obviously this Government has no understanding of the environment and the problems that will be faced by the land care movement in rural Australia during this recession. I would have thought that would have been one of the priority areas. Many farmers will be desperate to survive, and land care programs are the first to be put aside. I thought there would at least have been some assistance measures which would have encouraged these ongoing programs to continue. Unfortunately they will not continue without some incentive or some assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> All this is against the backdrop of the worst recession in the postwar period here in Australia. I am not calling it a recession out there in the bush; I am calling it a depression. I have been travelling my electorate over the past few weekends between the sittings, and the news I bring to this Parliament is all bad. There is gloom and a feeling of helplessness. I think people were looking to the industry statement to give them some relief or some hope that they would come out of this. Clearly that was not in the statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer also to the wheat industry. Clearly, the wheat industry was sidestepped by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The wheat industry's case to the Minister for a base price for the coming year I believe deserves support, it has not received. Wheat growers are devastated. It is too late for wheat production to be geared up in some parts of my electorate-and in fact in much of Australia. Already in the Central Highlands, where wheat would normally be planted in this coming month, 90 per cent of the land that grew wheat last year will not go into wheat production this year. </PARA>
<PARA> This area is a prime hard wheat area of Queensland-the prime hard wheat area of Australia-90 per cent of wheat land is out of production. In fact, the loss of production in my electorate, which accounts for much of the wheat of Queensland, is illustrated by the fact that up to 35 per cent of land will not be sown to wheat. The tractors are in the shed in many cases and the paddocks right now are growing weeds and grass. </PARA>
<PARA> All this is at a time when we are looking to rebuild the Middle East market after the area was torn apart by the Gulf war. If we look at how much wheat we have delivered in the past to these markets, 40 per cent of our total production was going to the Middle East-to Iraq, Iran and Egypt. There will not be any reason for the Australian Wheat Board to try to hold those markets, to try to rebuild them after the war and to talk the Americans into not using their export enhancement program against us as we try to regain those markets, because we will not have the product at the end of this year to service those markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Surveys right across Australia indicate clearly that up to 40 per cent of Australia's wheat land will be idle this year. That is a tragedy when we are in the middle of a recession. Australia will have to dig its way out of the recession with export income, yet we will be losing something that we do well and that income will be lost. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing was mentioned about sanctions against South Africa. We have a golden opportunity to rebuild wheat ties with South Africa. Right now there is a potential for 750,000 tonnes of wheat to go to that market because of two years of prolonged drought in South Africa. Yet there is nothing in the industry statement that would give anyone encouragement even to talk to the South Africans about whether we can regain that market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to comment on the Federal Government's disability employment services program and to address the achievements and problems faced by two organisations in Adelaide-Pride Industries and Invicta Sheltered Workshops Ltd-who carry out an invaluable service in the employment of intellectually and psychiatrically disabled members of our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite tight fiscal parameters, the Federal Government has honoured its commitment to these frail citizens over the past eight years. Assistance for people with disabilities was increased from $362m to $419m for the 1990-91 financial year. An additional 4,000 places are being created in communitybased employment services funded under the Disability Services Act at a cost of $52.7m over four years. The Government now funds supported employment services, or sheltered workshops, and competitive employment training and placement for community-based and de-institutionalisation programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also acted to remove the obvious duplication of services that has become a feature of this field. It was decided at the October Special Premiers Conference that the Commonwealth Government would administer employment and vocational training services for the disabled. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to have the opportunity to become involved with these services in a more direct way. Pride Industries is an organisation which establishes, equips and maintains employment, educational and training facilities for people in South Australia with intellectual disabilities. I have had a long association with members of Pride's management committee, such as Bill Clifford and Eric Bicknell. </PARA>
<PARA> Its thriving manufacturing operations are situated at the Strathmont Centre, which is the major institutional complex for the disabled in South Australia. Under the management of Nick Cunningham, Pride produces and supplies wood kindling, pegs, wooden furniture and toys, and is subcontracted to building and metal products suppliers. It employs over 100 people at both its sheltered workshop and in the community. In line with the Government's policy of deinstitutionalisation, I am currently working with the management of Pride Industries to alter the balance of Pride's role from mostly sheltered workshop to most of its employees working in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also had recent talks with the management of Invicta Workshops, Phil John and Ken Lincoln. Invicta is currently facing funding difficulties, and I am at pains to ensure that it continues its vital role in assisting disadvantaged members of the community into worthwhile employment. Invicta Workshops is a non-profit organisation which runs shelters employing members of the community who suffer from psychiatric disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The employment of the psychiatrically disabled has been the responsibility of State governments, but under the rationalisation of services program it will become a Federal Government responsibility. The management and the Federal Government have taken this opportunity to undertake a full review of the activities and services offered by Invicta, with the desired aim of becoming a supported employment services employer. </PARA>
<PARA> Employment services for the intellectually and psychiatrically disabled are two examples of the overdue need for rationalisation of government services that is now being undertaken by this Government in conjunction with the State governments as part of the rationalisation of government services that will enhance and improve the micro-economic reform program being undertaken across the economy as a whole. </PARA>
