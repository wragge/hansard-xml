<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know what I am speaking on. I assume it is some amendments moved by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), the shadow Opposition Minister, but I do not mind, because I believe that the Government has made the greatest mess of Australia's telecommunications that it is possible to make. After all the struggle and negotiation we finish up, like the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), huge and monolithic. It is unwieldy; a national and an international organisation locked together. A small, tight, profitable organisation, OTC Ltd, is being locked in and unionised with Telecom Australia so that Australians become captive to this massive organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With all the opportunities that the Government had to do some imaginative thinking, at the end of the day the Minister, Telecom, the Department of Transport and Communications and the unions had their way and threw out those more enlightened people within the Cabinet and their propositions. They have stuck Australians now with a hopeless organisation, something that has as its competitor an organisation with a few satellites. The Government is hoping that somebody will come along with some finance and buy it up. The captive audience is sitting by interlocked with Telecom so as to provide an alternative service to Australians. That is the process the Minister wants Australians and this House to accept as an alternative, as an advance into the future for this important area of telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not good enough. It is nowhere near satisfactory for the current and future needs of Australians. The new socalled competitor will be dependent upon Telecom; it will be controlled by Telecom. The Government has formulas and X factors and so on to control the interconnect process of the new competitor to allow it to operate effectively. That organisation will be controlled by the worst of monopolies. So the competitor really is dependent on the sale of its product; it is dependent on being sold itself; it is dependent on capital in a scarce capital market; it is dependent on people willing to take a risk against a monopoly, a huge organisation. Its usefulness will be limited unless it is allowed to operate effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The control and conditions to be applied by the competitor are dependent upon the management style of Telecom because Telecom will be the main contributor to the so-called regulator, Austel. The information being supplied to Austel can be directed by the Minister. Then at the end of the day, he has further control. Where does he get his advice from? He gets it from the Government-owned organisation, Telecom, and the Government Department. So we have a Minister who can give directives to Austel, the so-called regulator. Then at the end of the day, when he gets that information from Austel as to what he should do, he relies on advice not only from his Department and Telecom-two government-controlled organisations-but also from another controlling factor of the Australian Labor Party, the Telecom unions; powerful and significant organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> How can the Minister come to the Parliament and present this as an enlightened alternative, an advance into the future? It is wrong in concept. The Opposition from day one has said that the Government has been wrong in creating this massive organisation by putting OTC in with Telecom. That was the Government's first mistake. Its second mistake was to try to convince the Australian people that there was going to be anything but a two-airline policy of the radio waves, because that is what it has created. The Government has the same sort of regulatory process and watchdog sitting on top of this duopoly as it had with the two-airline policy. It scrapped that policy, saying that it was not working, but it has not learned from that process. We endorsed the scrapping of the two-airline policy. When in government we were moving in that direction. But at this point the Government has re-established that process as, it claims, an interim measure. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that once there is an interim measure established it becomes permanent and gets extended. The legislation says that there will be new competitors by 1997, but Australia needs new competitors now. We need to open up that market if we are going to capture trade opportunities worldwide and in our near vicinity. </PARA>
<PARA> The two-airlines policy was administered by a price setting authority; the Government is going to have Austel controlling this organisation. Not only is Austel going to facilitate the interconnect process and the operations of the competitor-and other competitors in the future-but also it is going to be the policeman. Not only will it set the rules and the operation processes, but also it will police whether people are abiding by those rules and decisions of itself and the Government. That is unworkable. There is not a nation on earth that thinks that can be done where the regulator, the facilitator, is operating as the policeman. Not in Britain or the United States or anywhere else is there such a concept. How can we have the person setting the rules judging whether people are abiding by those rules? Australians are going to get the worst of every world in this process and these decisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1991 is a process which establishes the movement from the organisations that exist now-that is, OTC Ltd, Austel and Telecom Australia-to a new so-called commercialised structure. Part of the process that I wish to deal with in the brief time that I have available involves the factors that the Government has put in place which will set the price for that interconnect process. There is an X factor in the formula which is the basis of the Government's decision and it is supposed to relate to the cost of supplying the service. The Government has refused to put in place any idea of a complete audit of Telecom to establish what its real costs are in this process of setting fees. Until that is done, no-one in Australia knows what Telecom's real operating costs and real cost factors are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me point out to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and to the House that Telecom was the organisation which said that the community service factor for supplying remote areas of Australia cost it $800m. Subsequently, over a period, that argument has been demolished. Telecom stuck to that argument for five years to demonstrate how much support it needed from the Government in order to supply this community service factor. It did not have to justify its figures and it did not have to support the claim that the cost was $800m. It then turned out that the figure was about half that amount, and that was subsequently accepted by Telecom as being the right figure. The amount of $400m is approximately the cost to Telecom and the Australian taxpayer of that community service delivery. How can any-body in Australia accept that the Telecom organisation is either capable of supplying or willing to supply accurate figures as to the cost of that X factor in the formula which will be the basis for fees and licences that will be set?</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that unless the Minister and the Government are prepared, during this transitional stage in this process as outlined by the Bill before the House, to have a full audit of Telecom conducted by an outside organisation so that the community at large and those people who are setting up to compete against Telecom will know that they are dealing with accurate figures, those people cannot be certain that they are not being dudded in the process. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a factor for amplification of Telecom services. Every additional service has an amplification factor; there must be more cables or more wires or more switching gear further back in the system. That can be built in. Who is going to check all of that process? Where is the so-called transparency, if the X factor right at the beginning does not start from a sound basis? In any transitional process, such as in the setting up of boards, the setting up of combined management techniques, or the setting up of new proposals to allow Aussat and other competitors to assess whether or not they are going to enter this market and supply real alternatives to Telecom for the Australian people, clear guidelines have to be laid down. How can the competitors have confidence if in this transitional process there are not clear guidelines that will ensure fairness?</PARA>
<PARA> People say that there is a tilt in the process with the X factor and the consumer price index factor taken into consideration. Maybe there is, and I believe that there should be. But how do we know that the starting base is right? We do not know the starting base. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was referring to the fee setting process in my comments on the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill and I wish to pursue that a little further. The Government has established what I consider to be, given world trends, a reasonable price cap figure for supplying services, and the fee setting process is one that is in conformity with world practice. However, the price control formula is far from satisfactory unless soundly based. It is my view that, if we are going to foster genuine and sustainable competition-and those are the words of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley)-then right at the beginning there has to be certainty in the process. The Minister has given no assurances of any certainty whatsoever. There must be a requirement on Telecom Australia to provide that certainty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have given one example of where that large organisation has for years misled the Australian people or, if not misled, has not been capable of supplying accurate figures until somebody else went and did them for it. That is a shame, because that outside organisation supplied factual information on the real cost of supplying telephone services and other services to remote areas-the community service factor which every Australian really feels should be part of the communications system and which, by the way, would be a factor that must be supplied by any competitor. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of the word `transparent' applied to this area, as used by the Minister in his speech, is just an inanity. It is not transparent. The Minister has a hidden process of setting the X factor; he has a recommendation by Austel to himself. Sometimes he gives it a direction, then he makes the ultimate decision. He is the director of this process; he is the grand conductor of it. It is not an arm's length process. I know that the Minister, in the setting of licences, ultimately should have the say. I know that the Minister has an important role in this process and I would not want to take that away, but he has too much of an involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> The facilitator and the regulator in this instance are the single same person, and that person is almost captive to the Government, or can be captive to the Government; and that is not what the Australian people want. They want to have released into this field some real dynamics whereby those people around the world pouring brilliant stuff into this process of telecommunications and the linking of computing processes with telecommunications will open up a new future for Australia. That is going to rely on what Austel and the Minister think should happen. I believe Austel's facilitating capacity should be in some way split from its capacity to act as a policeman. It is the only way we are going to get fair play out there when we get a few really full-blooded private competitors in the field. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the only way that the Minister or the Government will know what Telecom is up to. Unless we separate those things the needed advice will not be available. There will be no sureness of direction and decision making which is needed in this vital area. </PARA>
<PARA> I am really fearful in this situation that we are going to waste the next two years anyway-this Government will no longer be the government after that-while a huge organisation continues to muck around with the lives of Australian people. There are good people in Telecom. It is a good organisation, but it needs to change. </PARA>

<PARA> I would also indicate, as I did at the commencement of this debate yesterday, that I think it is a tragedy that we are not going to be able to have a detailed debate through the committee stage of all the matters which relate to this Bill. This is a major change in the Australian telecommunication industry and the significance of the change will touch every Australian over a period of time. We believe there are fatal flaws in this Bill, as many of my colleagues have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, we have had a series of shadow Ministers here speaking-the shadow Minister for privatisation, the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale); the shadow Minister for environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney); the shadow Minister for trade, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer); and indeed the last member who spoke, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) will take some moments to indicate some concerns as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people on the Opposition side have been involved in the preparation of what has been a very detailed and complex package of legislation-the most complex that I have dealt with in the seven years I have been in this place. It is much more complex than the energy and resource taxation legislation and it has been a challenge to everyone. Although I do not usually do so in this place, I want to thank two particular people on my staff, Vivienne Shield and Robina Mitchell. Indeed, the departmental staff whom I have dealt with have been excellent. </PARA>
<PARA> To mark the significance of this particular piece of legislation, it is of note that sitting in the gallery we have today the Minister of Communications from New Zealand. New Zealand has made tremendous strides in this area. I acknowledge those strides and I think it is particularly significant that the Minister, Mr Williamson, is here today to witness the final stages of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> With those few words, I will leave it to the honourable member for Lyne to indicate why we are opposing the amalgamation of OTC Ltd with Telecom Australia. The legislation is bad law and bad prospect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My criticism of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Bill is that it does not properly cater for privatisation. I believe that the efficiency of Telecom Australia has improved, particularly in recent years. We have to appreciate that technology has improved not only throughout Australia but throughout the world, and this has been evidenced in the telecommunications area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But there are factors about the legislation that concern me. The main one is the fact that the Government has gone only so far with privatisation. The Government is being very cautious, though naturally we respect the fact that it has to take note of the unions to see that they are agreeable to the legislation. This has been done, as evidenced by the fact that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) has not been able to go as far as I am sure he would like with privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom itself should have had the machinery, and particularly the financial means, to be able to extend its services throughout Australia. There has been improvement, and I think that an extension of services could have been achieved, but Telecom required extra funds to do so-funds that were beyond the ability of the Government to supply through the Loan Council. Telecom itself has indicated the amounts that would be needed in order to keep up with the technology and development that we would like to see throughout Australian cities and country areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that either we should extend the services of the telecommunications organisation or we should completely privatise telecommunications. I am of the opinion that, by creating a situation for the operation of only Telecom and one competitor, the Government has not gone far enough. Austel will be in charge of the lot, answerable to the Minister. I have no objection to that; I think it should be answerable to the Minister when there is a small number of organisations-and there will be only two organisations. If there was complete competition, there would not be a need to be answerable to the Minister. However, I believe that the Minister must have the final control under the set-up proposed under the present legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We will see competition in the telecommunications field only if there are four, five or more players. We may see that after 1997, as mentioned in the Minister's second reading speeches on the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Bill and related Bills, but there is no certainty that we will see it or that we will see in Australia the competition that is so necessary to provide extra service, particularly to the people whom I speak about, the ones in the outback areas, the rural areas of Australia, who I believe deserve it. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) spoke very convincingly about opportunities for our balance of trade in exporting our technology-exporting it particularly to the Pacific basin area, but to anywhere overseas. We have in Australia the brain resources and the technology to enable us to export the things that we have developed, particularly to Asia, but I am principally concerned about giving our own people here in Australia the service they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) last night spoke about the educational side of telecommunications and what it can extend to people in outback areas; that is very important indeed. I know that honourable members who, like myself, represent the rural areas of Australia are often chided by the Government because they speak of cross-subsidisation, but that is a very big factor as far as we are concerned and I will not belittle it. I believe cross-subsidisation can be catered for if we have true competition in the telecommunications field. If that true competition were to exist, I would accept that there may not be a need for cross-subsidisation because that competition would keep down the cost of extending services to the country people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> People in my electorate are often 20 or 30 kilometres up the valley from their nearest neighbour or even from a person who has a telephone. We are concerned about these people. As well as manufacturing industries and the smaller businessmen around the country, these are the people we do not want to see paying those extra charges. I make no excuse at all for the present cross-subsidisation because people in country areas are disadvantaged to a great degree as far as freight and general costs are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the people about whom I wish to speak today in order to emphasise to the Government that unless it goes right down the line with privatisation and puts everything into competition, the legislation now before the House will not be sufficient to allow for the matters I am addressing. Will they be catered for within a budget? For example, if there is a competitor to Telecom and it says that it will take a line to a certain point, whether that be the front yard or the street front-it might be five miles down the road too, and that is important-the property owner who wants the telephone will have to pay the extra cost to get it put on. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the involvement of private enterprise in the maintenance of telephones and the laying of a lot of the cables. I do not believe I am wrong in what I am saying; I believe I am correct. If honourable members looked at the legislation and said `Righto, this is not the case', I think they would be wrong. I believe it is the case. If I am wrong, the Minister might inform me where I am wrong in regard to the connection point further down the road or outside the property, which, as I said earlier, could be quite a distance away. I emphasise my concern about the provision of a service to people who require a telephone that needs to be of a particular quality simply because of the distance between their property and a telephone exchange. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about the cost of a local phone call. I know that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said that untimed local phone calls will remain. In my electorate, anywhere around the countryside, and even in the suburbs of cities, if someone rings a person a mile away that is not a local phone call, and that is because of the zones that are within the area. Because such phone calls are not local calls, they will cost more. Why is that? Is that overcome in the Bills that we have before the Parliament? I do not believe that it is. I do not believe that the problem will be overcome even though a certain amount of competition may be provided. Maybe the Minister can explain that for me. As I see it, anomalies do exist within the legislation before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that time is very short, and I appreciate the opportunity of being able to say a few words. I have not actually prepared any notes on this legislation, but I wanted to voice my concern about what country people are going to pay and about the quality of the service that they are going to get. I believe that Telecom is doing a reasonable job. Its services could have been extended. But if the Government does privatise, as is planned here, it should do it properly to provide the competition that will enable us to keep our costs down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is that right? The views put forward by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) are certainly taken into account in the legislation. We are most concerned about the situation of rural consumers. Though they may not necessarily believe it, they will be among the principal beneficiaries of the competitive regime which is put in place. Basically, as the honourable member would know, most rural consumers operate through the subscriber trunk dialling system, not through the local call system. There is no doubt at all that the people who will experience the greatest price falls once competition is introduced will be people who operate their accounts primarily through that system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member is also concerned about community service obligations. They will also be met in the competitive arrangements that are established. There has been a claim that what is being created here is a behemoth-and the suggestion is that it is one somewhat of my dimensions. Were that only true! I would not be in this place if I ran some operation which enjoyed the profitability of telecommunications companies. That not being the case, I am obliged to be here introducing legislation about them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have many more friends than I have at the moment. People are a little unaware of the situation relating to competition. It is true that we are combining OTC Ltd and Telecom and the organisation will be more powerful than its individual parts. There is no question about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two consortia are now vying to buy Aussat, which is neither here nor there in reality to the competition; Aussat is irrelevant. What matters is the fact that the outfit which acquires Aussat will have a licence to compete exclusively, but ultimately in a broad field, across the board for the next six or so years. </PARA>
<PARA> The two consortia already in place-of course, we hope there will be more-are twice the size, at a minimum, of Telecom. They are at least twice as powerful as Telecom in the telecommunications system. Telecom is going to experience competition at the hardest conceivable end. Those two operations which are currently bidding for it, and have a profitability that dwarfs that of Telecom, are going to find it pretty easy to operate in a competitive mould. The last thing they want to do is get into bed with Telecom. Their interests in the long term-because they will face open competition after 1997-lie in ripping as much market share off Telecom as they possibly can in the shortest possible order, and they have the financial means to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> If we do not combine OTC and Telecom we will not have an operation that is effectively able to compete internationally on some of the highways that the Opposition spokesman on privatisation, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), and other spokesmen such as the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) talked about. But we will have in this country a couple of operators who, in their capacity to absorb and create new markets and to rough up new opponents, are of an order that Telecom has never even conceived. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition welcomes the introduction of the Veterans' Entitlements (Rewrite) Transition Bill 1991, as it also welcomed the associated Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 1991, which provided for a plain English rewrite of part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. This Bill is a transitional one associated with the rewrite, and it acts as a conduit between the old and the new part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The most important intent of the Bill is to ensure that changes made to the Veterans' Entitlements Act during the 1990 Budget sittings are included in the rewritten plain English part III and to ensure that there is a continuity between the old and the new part III.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Significant Budget changes rewritten in plain English by this Bill include the deeming provisions and the tightening of the definition of `allotted for duty' for the purposes of establishing qualifying service and thus eligibility for the service pension. The Bill also includes consequential amendments to other parts of the Veterans' Entitlements Act, mostly in terms of cross-referencing, in light of the new part III. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill features the inclusion of plain English indexation provisions, which take into account the latest consumer price index figures so as to be current on 1 July, when this Bill will commence. I note that this transitional Bill is subject to the same assurances from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) as the initial rewrite Bill: namely, that any unintended consequences will be legislatively attended to as quickly as is practically possible. I commend the Government for its efforts to make veterans legislation more accessible to the veteran community through this plain English approach. All members of parliament have had to deal with complex problems from veterans in their electorates, and I am pleased to see that the Government is moving to a more easily understood format for veterans legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context the role of the Returned Services League of Australia (RSL) must be acknowledged in the way it has assisted veterans in dealing with various complex veterans matters associated with legislation which was not written in plain English format. So I take this opportunity to commend the RSL for the way it has approached this task over many years. Many hundreds of sub-branches of the RSL have voluntary counsellors who have given great assistance to veterans in helping them interpret and understand their entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the coalition will not be opposing this Bill; however, I would like to reiterate to the Minister some concerns of the Opposition which were signalled by my colleague the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) during the debate on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 1991. Over the years the Government has consistently said that there would be no integration of the repatriation hospitals without the consent of the RSL. It is plainly obvious that the Government is pushing ahead with integration despite the fervent opposition of the vast majority of the veteran community, and the RSL in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister cannot blame the RSL for representing the ex-service community-that is what it is there for-and the ex-service community in 1991, by and large, wants to retain the repatriation hospitals. The Government has not been successful in communicating to Australian veterans its case in regard to hospital integration, and it has gone back on its promise that it would not go ahead without their consent. For that the Government stands condemned. </PARA>
<PARA> Can I also say to the Government that its tactic of going around the RSL on this subject, with a huge mail-out to some 360,000 veterans and war widows, will raise much anger in the ex-service community. The pamphlet is entitled `The Repatriation Private Patient Scheme-How You Will Benefit'. I say to the Minister that the benefits of a repatriation hospital scheme are already well known to the ex-service community. I believe that the RSL will continue to heavily criticise the Government for its steamrolling tactics. I make the point to the Minister that under a coalition Government there would be no such breakdown in relations between the Government and the RSL. The Government is fond of boasting of its consensus approach when it comes to its mates in the union movement. However, when it comes to Australia's veterans community it seems that a steamrolling approach is acceptable, and I say to the Minister that such an approach is not acceptable to the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, the coalition has not lost sight of the fact that when we are dealing with veterans legislation we are dealing with compensation as opposed to welfare. As a nation we owe a debt of gratitude to members of our veteran community for their service to the nation. The vast bulk of our veteran community is now at an age when it requires assistance in one form or another from the Government. The vast majority of the veteran community believes that this Government has approached this matter with a begrudging attitude. I assure the House and the veteran community generally that the Opposition acknowledges the compensatory nature of the benefits and will act accordingly when in government after the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Entitlements (Rewrite) Transition Bill 1991 deals in the main with a continuation of the process now becoming entrenched in the Hawke Government legislation; this being the gradual conversion of key documents into what could be described as plain English versions. This Bill basically mirrors the legislative changes which have been made in the Social Security Act 1991 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 which passed through this House on 16 May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is not only desirable but also necessary because of the need for related social security, taxation and veterans' affairs legislation to be identical and legally sound in their language and specifications. The process of language demystification, began by the rewriting of the Social Security Act 1947, can be seen as an attempt by the Government to ensure that obligations and entitlements under the law are not obscured by outdated, interpretationally unclear and/or esoteric language. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a sensible and long overdue initiative which can only lead to more certainty in the law and, therefore, a higher degree of compliance with the law's intention. In broad terms, this Bill provides the necessary legal machinery for the transition from the former part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to the new part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> The objectives which it includes are: the consolidation of savings and transitional provisions; the inclusion of plain English indexation provisions; amendments to part III resulting from the 1990 Budget legislation; the consequential amendments of other parts of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and other veterans' affairs legislation; the consequential amendments of other Commonwealth Acts; and further amendments to part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> In similar terms to the new division 1aa contained in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Bill is intended to reflect existing policy. It therefore does not involve any policy initiatives and does not have any financial impact on veterans' pensions or entitlements. As the Bill could basically be described as being of a machinery and non-controversial nature, I will not take up the time of the House by going into further detail on the matter. Suffice it to say that all of us in this House have reason to strongly support a demystification of the legislative process. I am sure that every member has witnessed, during the course of the day to day representations on behalf of constituents, the confusion and uncertainty that can surround the finer delineations of legislative intent. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the old Social Security Act 1947, with its myriad of amendments, would stand as a perfect example to us all. How many times have honourable members in this House had to make lengthy representations to establish entitlements under that Act because of the confusion that has been generated and maintained by the nature of the Act's wording? As honourable members know, Australia is in the midst of a micro-economic efficiency drive which will reshape our economy and set up the framework for this nation's development as an export oriented and successful member of the world community. We should remember that it is not only the well publicised multi-million dollar micro-economic issues such as waterfront reform that are important to us; it is also the countless numbers of small issues such as plain English legislation that contribute to the process of efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that confidence and trust in the intent and certainty of the law permeates very positively through the different levels of society. As far as I am concerned, the rewriting of the Social Security Act 1947, which started the process of plain English translations of legislation, stands as a tribute to the abilities of both the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), who initiated the process, and Senator Richardson, who pursued the matter into law. The procedure they have begun will without doubt play its part in the restructuring process that is vital to the future economic health of this country. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to take this opportunity once again to speak on a veterans' affairs matter, even though the Veterans' Entitlements (Rewrite) Transition Bill essentially does not involve any policy changes. As has already been said, this Bill provides the necessary legal machinery for the transition from the former part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to the new part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. One of the reasons I choose to speak in these debates on veterans' affairs is that I believe that veterans need to have a strong voice in this Parliament. Fortunately, there are a number of honourable members on our side, and a number on the other side too-although very few are here this morning, except for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys)-who are able to present that voice within this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The veterans represent an important sector of the community at large and therefore they deserve very special consideration in this Parliament. We are talking not only in a narrow sense about veterans. There are very few First World War veterans still alive these days, as we saw with the Gallipoli reunion a couple of years ago, but there are a very significant number of veterans from the Second World War, Malaya, Korea and Vietnam, and now very much younger veterans have been accorded that status, having returned just recently from active service in the Gulf. We are not talking only about veterans but also about the interests of war widows, the families of veterans who have passed away, Legatees and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, I take this opportunity to commend the ongoing, vital and ever-growing work of Legacy. I think it is truly a tremendous community organisation. I particularly commend the Legacy organisation on the northern beaches of Sydney, where my mother lives. As a war widow, she is constantly attending Legacy functions. That organisation is extremely generous and kind to war widows. </PARA>
<PARA> There needs to be a sympathetic and understanding approach to policy in the area of veterans' affairs. Being one to give credit where credit is due and having done so before, I am pleased to say that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, is sympathetic and understanding of his portfolio. I think that is widely recognised in the community. That does not necessarily mean he is perfect, and certainly we on this side of the House do not see the Government's record on veterans' affairs as being entirely perfect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister reminded me in the debate last week, I think it was, that I have 23,000 veterans in and around my electorate on the Gold Coast. Many of them are aged, and with age sometimes comes a sense of insecurity. Many of the changes that have been implemented affecting aged pensioners, such as the deeming provisions and so on, and some that have been implemented in the veterans' area are threatening to these members of our community. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention again the Government's policy in respect of repatriation general hospitals (RGHs) and the concerns that the Returned Services League of Australia still has about that policy. I take the point the Minister has made here on occasions that in many respects the availability of public hospital services and even private hospital services for veterans is commendable. Certainly for veterans in my electorate it may save them having to travel to Brisbane. Nevertheless, for many veterans the availability of ongoing RGH services is important. They see that as something that has been specially provided in recognition of what they have done. They believe that they get very special service and understanding in those hospitals, although that is not to say that they would not get it elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Having been in RGH Concord myself at one stage, I know that it has a real empathy with veterans and their widows. I see that the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), is at the table. I think he was on the staff at RGH Concord, so he knows exactly what I am talking about. It needs to be recognised not so much that services are available elsewhere for veterans but that the integration of RGHs into the State health systems is unsettling for the veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> We also ought to recognise-I know the honourable member for Lowe has pointed this out-that the demand for services in the RGHs is increasing. The community may well have the impression that, with veterans ageing, the demand is decreasing. My understanding is that the demand is increasing and will not peak until 1995. That is not so much a product of the numbers of veterans but of the fact that, as they get older, they require more and more services. That is perhaps one area where we could point to the Government's handling of the issue not being perfect, although it is in a sense defensible, and the Minister has made that point in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that in relation to this Bill the Minister has undertaken to consult fully with the ex-service community and to correct any unintended consequences that may arise from the legislation. The honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks), who spoke earlier, was critical of the process of consultation in respect of one or two matters. However, in this particular area the approach of the Government has been commendable. We in the Opposition make the statement very clearly to the veterans' community that we would be totally committed to an ongoing process of consultation with the various veterans' organisations and the veterans themselves in respect of any changes we proposed to make to their existing rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in a sense, has been inclined to play hard ball with some service and ex-service personnel. A survivor of HMAS Voyager recently visited me in my office. He was in a very bad state. It surprised me that he had suffered so much. I must commend the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) for the way in which he has pursued that matter. In speaking in this Parliament on 12 February 1991 he referred to the Bernie Verwayen case, which had been decided in the High Court. He was one of the sailors on the Voyager in 1964 when it was rammed by the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne. The fight went on for many years for the survivors of the disaster and for the families of those who did not survive for some form of compensation. Successive governments played that matter very hard, but the High Court finally decided in favour of Bernie Verwayen. Consequently, one expected that that would be a test case which would flow on to all other sailors. </PARA>
<PARA> I now find, however, having investigated the matter with this particular constituent, that it is not all plain sailing, if one could perhaps excuse the pun, because now the Government is expecting every one of those sailors to go through the court system and for each one's particular circumstances to be examined very closely. I can understand a reason for that, but I would encourage the Government to speed up the process as much as possible, because this particular constituent who came to me is suffering rather extreme hardship while he waits for his settlement. In fact, he is trying to get some form of disability allowance from the Department of Social Security, he is awaiting what is called a compensation clearance, but the bottom line is that he is once again disadvantaged by bureaucracy and I am very concerned that if any invalid payment is made to him, eventually he will have to pay it back out of his court settlement when that is finalised. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very anxious to see the whole process sped up in favour of all of those who are waiting. Some of them are not young any more, some of them are in a surprisingly poor state of health, and they definitely need to have that process speeded up. </PARA>
<PARA> Veterans, of course, have a great interest in the whole matter of defence. They of all people have very often paid a very high price for preserving the freedom which we enjoy in our country today, and they, of course, have a very real concern about the way defence has gone in this country in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is timely that we should be discussing this particular legislation, in view of the prospect of what at least we on this side of the House see as being a further diminution of the funding available for the defence of this country. This has been a process of a run-down in defence which has been going on now for some years. Veterans' organisations will speak very volubly about that when they get the opportunity of seeing exactly what the Government has in mind in respect of its new defence strategy. However, the Opposition has made it clear that it opposes any Defence Force structure cuts which will impact on combat capability. </PARA>
<PARA> As we see it, the Government proposes to significantly reduce combat capability. It intends to place a ceiling on the Army's combat force. At present there are approximately 12,799 combined front line combat and immediate support combat troops, which means there will be a reduction of 1,744 in the Regular Army combat forces. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that I would be going beyond the bounds of this debate if I were to go too much into the defence proposals, but I do want to sound the alarm for the Government and let it be fully aware-I am sure the Minister is aware-that veterans' organisations, and indeed veterans at large, are very concerned about the defence of this country. After all, as I have said, they are people who have gone and fought to preserve what we have, and they would be extremely concerned if they saw any reduced capability in our defence forces. I think the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), when he makes his statement, will need to do some pretty fast talking to convince veterans, and indeed the Opposition, that the Government is going down the right track. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of matters relating to defence which I was intending to canvass briefly, but I might just leave a little bit of time because the Minister may want to make a few remarks before this Bill is guillotined. It is not, as we have said, a momentous Bill. In fact, its intentions are commendable because, as has already been said, one of the main points of the Bill is to give effect to the plain English rewrite of part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The Opposition has no problem with that. However, I make the point that for us, veterans' affairs remains a very important policy area, an area where we believe ultimate consideration should be given, that it should be a policy area which is extremely conscious of the need of veterans and their families. The Opposition supports this Government initiative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank all honourable members for their contributions and I would like to make a few points in relation to some of the comments made by them, especially the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks). He was saying-and it sounded as if I had heard that speech before somewhere-that we were breaking our promise to the Returned Services League (RSL), which is totally incorrect. I would invite the honourable member to read my speech where I said that if the RSL had any reasonable concern, there is no going back on the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), my promise or the Government's promise to the RSL.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Riverina-Darling also mentioned a little about the breakdown in communications. I would like to refute that comment also. I am sure the honourable member for Riverina-Darling and also the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) would read the RSL National Newsletter. I know that you do, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I know that the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) does too. I will quote from page 5, from part of my message to the RSL this year, which marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of the formation of the RSL, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> For 75 years now the Returned Services League has played a preeminent role in representing and promoting the values of those men and women and their dependants, in working for their well being, and in commemorating those who have died in, or as a result of, war. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Commonwealth Government I offer sincere thanks to the League for 75 years of service to veterans of service to the Nation. I extend best wishes for the anniversary activities this year and look forward to a continuing close relationship with the League, and to working cooperatively with it for the common good of veterans. </PARA>
<PARA>That is part of my message. I would also like to refer to page 8, where there is this statement by the National President:</PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, there was not, nor is there a clash with the Government and no basis to the claims of either the Sun-Herald or SBS TV. </PARA>
<PARA>He was quoting on programs and a comment by a journalist. Later he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Brigadier Garland said that in the last few days he had been in touch with the Prime Minister's office about the award of an American military commendation to the First Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, requiring Mr Hawke's signature. </PARA>
<PARA>Then he goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>If we had been on the nose, we would not have been in communication. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like all honourable members to read my message and that of the National President, because they just go to prove to the honourable member for Riverina-Darling and other honourable members who think that there is a breakdown in communications that there is not one. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the comments of the honourable member for Riverina-Darling about the integration of the repatriation hospitals into the State system, I would like him to tell me how many veterans in his electorate want to travel to Concord. I am sure the Broken Hill veterans, if they could be treated locally, would not be wanting to come down to Concord, even though it is a great hospital. There are great hospitals out in his electorate. I might just remind him that last year 41,000 veterans were treated in repatriation hospitals and 50,000 were treated in public hospitals. Some of those 50,000 may have been treated as private patients, but after integration all of them will be able to be treated as private patients in public hospitals. I would like the honourable member to tell me what is wrong with that. There were 30,000 veterans treated as private patients in private hospitals. So there were 80,000 outside the system and 4l,000 inside the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for McPherson said that the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) claimed in relation to Concord that there were supposed to be 20 per cent community patients and 80 per cent veteran patients, whereas previously there were 37 per cent community patients and 60 per cent veteran patients, so that there is no increase in the requirement of treatment of veterans. Do not forget that some of those veterans who make up the 60 per cent are required to go there, and some of them would like to be treated where they live. I ask him to keep that in mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main purpose of the Customs Amendment Bill 1991 is to implement changes to the anti-dumping and countervailing procedures announced in the 12 March 1991 industry statement. The Bill contains some minor changes to Customs search procedures introduced last year. The proposed changes to the countervailing procedures are of quite major significance-first, in themselves because of the effect on primary producers in particular and, second, because they signal to Australian industry and indeed to our trading partners that we are getting serious about stopping unfair trading practices. Moreover, the fact that we need these changes, which the Government has indicated are just the start, and that an inquiry to be completed by the end of the year could recommend more also indicates that two years ago the Government got it wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The current revamped anti-dumping system, we should remember, has effectively really just commenced. It is the culmination of years of review. But from the start, the new procedures really were inadequate and it is encouraging to see that finally, if belatedly, the Government has recognised this. </PARA>
<PARA> Anti-dumping measures are and always will be, I suspect, a rather vexed issue both philosophically and at a practical level. Many economists will tell us that the dumping of products generally is in the national interest of the recipient country because it gives that country access to cheaper goods. The effect is not positive, however, if an efficient local producer is forced out of business and the foreign exporter, once it has wiped out that competition, eventually raises its prices. Such predatory dumping can do untold damage to our industry and standard of living, as we all know. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition does not agree with the view that we should not have an anti-dumping mechanism at all because, in the real world, there are cases of genuine dumping which should be speedily dealt with. I think there is no doubt that, as our industries become more efficient, which they most certainly will under a coalition government, and develop high quality products destined for the export market, dumping will become less of a problem in this country, or at least less of a perceived problem. But that does not mean to say that we should not have an effective mechanism in place just in case. However, we are also strongly of the view that an anti-dumping mechanism must not be used as an alternative form of industry protection to shield industries from genuine international competition. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that we believe a mechanism must be in place to counter dumped and subsidised products, and it also seems to us that, if this is agreed, the mechanism must be surely effective. We concede that, because of the danger of the mechanism yielding arbitrary protection for certain industries, the procedures must be balanced and thorough. However, the current mechanism and, indeed, even the proposed new shortened mechanism take so long that a local industry could be for all practical purposes destroyed before the provisional measures can be imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall be moving an amendment at this, the second reading stage, which amendment I have asked to be circulated, calling on the Government to reduce the current three-tier investigation process to two; that is, a 55-day preliminary investigation period, after which provisional measures can be imposed, followed by a single 120-day final investigation stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I should remind the House that, when the current arrangements were debated in 1988, the coalition successfully moved amendments to shorten the first two stages from the Government's proposal of 70 and 180 days to 55 and 120 days. At the time we were told that 55-day and 120-day periods were impossible and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, said that the amendment would lead to it being `much more difficult for the Australian Customs Service to reach the sort of quality findings' that it had been reaching in the past. Not only have these critics been proved wrong, but now it is the Government itself which is proposing to reduce the maximum time for establishment of a prima facie case from 55 to 35 days and for the preliminary investigation from 120 to 100 days. This still means, however, that an industry which is suffering material injury from dumped or subsidised imports could have to wait 135 days before receiving any relief by means of provisional measures-and that is 4 1/2 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The final investigation undertaken by the Anti-Dumping Authority takes another 120 days, another four months. Altogether the process, even under the improved arrangements, will take up to 8 1/2 months. We do not accept that this is the best that can be done in a world of computers, faxes and satellites. We announced some months ago that we consider that one layer of investigation could be removed and that the preliminary investigation period could be condensed into the initial 55-day period. This would allow provisional measures to be imposed after this time. Ironically, these time limits, or at least the targets in those days, were in place before the latest group of changes and, indeed, Professor Fred Gruen, in his 1986 review of the anti-dumping system, recommended that the Customs Service should make substantial efforts to meet the targets of 55 days for preliminary findings and 120 days for final findings in normal cases. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Government will be conducting a review of the anti-dumping system later this year, and I sincerely hope that this question is looked at more closely, the proposed 40-day shortening of the preliminary injury period to be implemented by regulation being just the first step. I would in particular request the Government to explain why countervailing inquiries, for example, need to take so long as opposed to anti-dumping inquiries, when the information about subsidies ought to be and is generally publicly available. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, however, the Customs Amendment Bill addresses other related aspects of anti-dumping and countervailing measures, most importantly by increasing access of primary producers to the mechanism. The change is long overdue; it was also recognised by Professor Gruen; and it was at the heart of the coalition's decision to require a Senate inquiry into, amongst other things, this aspect of current anti-dumping and countervailing arrangements. Upstream producers will now be able to claim relief from dumping or subsidisation of processed agricultural goods, provided that the goods are closely related to the raw agricultural material. In other words, as I understand it, citrus producers will now be in a position to claim relief against dumping of orange juice, for example, but I assume that sugar producers would not be able to claim relief merely because sugar was used as a preservative in the same juice. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition accepts these necessarily strict tests of vertical integration to ensure that importers are not harassed by dumping claims from peripheral suppliers to the local industry. The legislation also provides for the calculation of a full dumping margin at the preliminary findings stage of a dumping or subsidisation inquiry in order to help speed up investigations. Presumably, this margin is more easily determined because it does not require an estimation of the extent of injury to the local supplier. Again, the coalition will support this change, although I seek the Minister's clarification that this change is consistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) articles. I also note that the Minister has said in his second reading speech that the Government will be monitoring the new provisions in light of the changing international trading arrangements and GATT requirements, and we endorse this approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The third amendment relates to the sunsetting of countervailing measures and effectively removes an anomaly whereby sunset provisions are dated from the first notice relating to subsidised product and not to the current notice. In effect this means that countervailing measures against subsidised product A from country B might be sunsetted after just a few months because measures against subsidised product A from country A had been in place for almost three years. That proposed amendment will ensure that the three-year sunset period applies to each notice for a full three years. We support it. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill makes some minor changes to Customs search procedures and specifically extends the potential pool for judges for appointment as `Division 1B Judges' under the Customs Act 1901. We do not oppose those changes. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Opposition does not oppose the Bill. The measures relating to the anti-dumping and countervailing procedures are long overdue. They are a step in the right direction. We believe another step in the right direction would be to shorten further the investigation process in line with Opposition policy, as I have described. I commend the amendment standing in my name and move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> `whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that, in conjunction with the amendments to antidumping and countervailing procedures contained in the Bill, the Government should further streamline these procedures so that Australian producers have adequate defence against dumped and subsidised imports, by condensing the entire preliminary investigation period to 55 days, after which provisional measures can be implemented, followed by a final investigation period of 120 days'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation we are debating this morning, the Customs Amendment Bill, in fact is to give effect to certain anti-dumping measures which were announced in the Government's 12 March economic statement, Building a Competitive Australia. It includes extending antidumping remedies to certain primary producers and seeks to ensure that anti-dumping remedies are kept in place for a full three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation clearly demonstrates yet again a commitment by the Government that, once announcements are made in industry statements or in documents such as Building a Competitive Australia, we are serious about removing impediments to efficiency associated with government operations, with the private sector, with private industry and so on. In fact, as is recorded at page 5.18 of the Building a Competitive Australia document, the 12 March statement delivered by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Government is committed to further trade liberalisation but it will not allow Australian industry to be seriously damaged by imports at dump prices. </PARA>
<PARA> In that regard it was recorded in this document that as a first step the Government had decided to strengthen anti-dumping processes immediately by speeding up processing of anti-dumping and subsidisation complaints by Australian industry, by providing better access to the system for Australia's agricultural and horticultural producers and by ensuring that anti-dumping actions will be kept in place for a full three years whenever they are warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> To further speed up the process, preliminary measures imposed by Customs will be based on the dumping margin or amount of subsidy rather than on a calculated non-injurious export price. The basis, therefore, was set in that document and, as indicated today, we have the legislation which translates that announcement by government into legislative effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) at the table went to the provisions associated with the legislation in detail in his second reading speech. Therefore, there is no need to recount all the bases of the legislation itself. I would like to go to one or two issues associated with this whole problem of dumping, and that goes more to the question of proof of dumping-the question that once a case in fact is proven by the Australian Customs Service and the anti-dumping authority and so on then that particular case should be widely publicised so that it acts more as a deterrent. </PARA>
<PARA> The question associated with the legislation of actually shortening the period to give consideration to the three stages, which the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) referred to, goes some way at least to speeding up that process. But of course by the time the actual determination is made the goods have been dumped in this country, they have been dispersed through various mechanisms and, as a result of that, there is already some injury which has been wrought on the Australian producer. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the day, if that dumping case is proven, it becomes a responsibility to act on that proof and to take appropriate deterrent action against the importer, against the dumping organisation. So in effect we are sending out clear signals that whilst we in no way stand in the way of trade liberalisation, as I have already indicated, at the same time we are not prepared to allow that to occur where we will see Australian industry seriously injured by dumping. </PARA>
<PARA> One only has to look back over history to see cases where dumping has occurred. I can recall one case involving tyres being dumped in this country. There are many other examples. This legislation appropriately now extends the principles to agricultural produce. As has been said time and time again, we in Australia enjoy the most efficient agricultural industry in the world, yet there are always barriers and impediments thrown up against the efficiency and the opportunity for our agricultural industries to earn their correct rewards for their efficiency and effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of dumping, this serves as an example as to where a further barrier can be put in place with people on the land correctly earning what is their right and due. This Government, as I have indicated, is aware of such considerations. I do suggest to all members of this House that this document, which unfortunately probably did not receive rave reviews when it was brought down on 12 March as some of us would have liked, nevertheless does contain some very important provisions. Today's legislation is one such measure. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister rightly indicated in his second reading speech, the objectives of this amendment to give additional protection to agricultural producers are appropriate. There is that question of vertical integration and the definition thereof which the honourable member for Barker rightly referred to as a consideration, but nevertheless it is appropriate for the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the second amendment here is to correct some technical drafting changes in respect of internal body search provisions of part XII of the Act. These of course were introduced in this place, and were debated and passed last year. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration canvassed this particular issue in its review of the Australian Customs Service over the last 12 months or so and made recommendations about searches and so on, and the provisions for detecting illegal imports into this country of narcotics and other prohibited substances. It corrects anomalies which escaped the Parliamentary Counsel or the drafters of legislation. Accordingly, all this legislation is timely, and I certainly join with the honourable member for Barker in commending it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Customs Amendment Bill because it is vitally important to rural Australia. We have a situation where the horticultural industries of Australia in particular are being swamped and destroyed by imports coming in willy-nilly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to make the point that before this Labor Government came into power we had a good scheme. We had a scheme that worked. The Government wrecked it, and all it is doing now-in spite of the commendation of the Bill by the last speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), when saying what good boys they are-is trying to correct some of the mistakes it made to get it back towards the workable scheme which we had in position before. But it is not going far enough-nowhere near far enough. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely disgraceful that we can see on our morning television orange orchards in the Riverina being bulldozed because of imports. Even in my own area of the north coast of New South Wales there was a threat some time back, which has gone now, of the importation of bananas which could destroy the Australian banana industry, not just through economics but through the importation of disease. Therefore, I repeat that I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It is important to all of rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot allow a situation where imports come in from countries all over the world. I have seen, for instance, apricots from Turkey which were of such poor quality that, although they were good enough to be imported into this country, when the importers brought in too many and wanted to export them from Australia, the apricots did not meet our export standards. That is not good enough either. </PARA>
<PARA> The current legislation reduces the period for investigation to 135 days. That is a step in the right direction; there is no doubt about that. But we in the coalition have put forward a proposal in this amendment. I hope the Government will accept it. We have proposed that there should be only 55 days for the preliminary investigation and 120 days for the final investigation. </PARA>

I would like to have a list of products that are susceptible to dumping and a requirement for the importer to prove before products come in that they are not being dumped. I would not have months and months of investigation. That is no good for our primary producers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Mallee says, industries are indeed destroyed while that is happening. In the present economic situation, which has been brought about by this failed Labor Government, with its economic policies, the rural producers of Australia cannot afford to suffer dumping of horticultural and other products for as long as the investigation is proposed to take. I make the point very strongly-and I make it to people on my own side of the House as well as to members of the Government-that we should consider the reversal of the whole anti-dumping legislation and that we should consider the whole culture and philosophy of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should create a situation where, if people want to import a product that is in danger of threatening our own industries, they have to prove first that they are not dumping. They must prove that prior to importing, prior to putting our own rural industries at risk. I think that is fair enough. It is fair to our people and it is fair to the importers and producers in other countries, who would still have the opportunity of exporting to us. Our importers could still bring products in, provided it could be established and proved that they were not dumping and not putting at risk our own rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that time is limited and that other members of the House wish to speak. I conclude by saying again to the Government: please accept our amendment; let us speed up the introduction of anti-dumping measures and, preferably, down the track, let us turn things right around and stop dumping altogether. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Government initiatives, including general tariff reductions and the re-vitalisation and redirection of scientific and research and development effort and business taxation reforms were introduced to help industry to increase efficiency and compete more effectively in an internationally competitive environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To assist Australian horticulture specifically, the Government established the Australian Horticultural Corporation (AHC) to encourage and coordinate horticultural marketing and facilitate exports of Australian produce. At the same time, the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation was established to foster efficient and competitive horticultural industries through research and development and the Horticultural Policy Council was established to advise the Government on policy matters relating to horticultural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The effectiveness of these bodies relies to a great extent on the level of support they receive from industry. The more industries become involved with the corporations and Council, the greater is the potential for coordinated and effective marketing, research and development and policy advice. In some areas industry has been slow to take up the opportunities, particularly in relation to the AHC. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government agrees that Australian industries should not be subject to unfair market competition from imports and has in place anti-dumping legislation which was strengthened in 1988 by the establishment of the Anti-Dumping Authority. The current anti-dumping and countervailing arrangements are frequently reviewed to ensure their continued effectiveness. The Customs Amendment Bill proposes to amend the Customs Act 1901 to implement certain reforms to the current anti-dumping and subsidisation regime which were announced in the 12 March industry statement and to effect technical drafting changes to the internal body search provisions of the Act to clarify the nature and function of judges' orders made under those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the standards and inspection of imported foods, since July last year the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has been responsible for testing a range of imported foods to ensure that they comply with the requirements of the food standards code developed by the National Health and Medical Research Council. Foods subject to inspection are tested to ensure that they meet microbiological standards and, where relevant, are within the approved Australian tolerances for residues of chemicals or heavy metals. </PARA>
<PARA> The program assigns imported foods to one of three risk categories which determine the nature and frequency of inspection and analysis carried out. The Government believes that decisions to control food imports should be consistent with our international trading obligations and should be justifiable on the grounds of demonstrable health risk. Consistent with this position, it is unlikely that fresh and processed horticultural products, which generally pose little risk to human health, will necessarily be included in the program. </PARA>
<PARA> While I can appreciate growers' concerns about the effect of the value of the Australian dollar on the competitiveness of our exports-and this has been raised many times-it is important to recognise that it has been necessary to reduce unsustainable levels of domestic expenditure and demand for imports. But it is also important to note that the Australian dollar is trading at something like 20 per cent less than it ever did under those on the other side of this House. </PARA>
<PARA> The topic of increased competition from imported food products has been widely reported in the press, and it is important that the threat of these imports is put in perspective. In 1989-90, Australian horticultural imports, excluding wine imports, were valued at approximately $415m, compared with exports of about $520m. Similarly, the value of wine imports and exports in 1989-90 were $52.7m and $118.3m respectively. Australia is therefore a net exporter of horticultural products. It makes sense to recognise that if we were to stop those products coming in we would simply stop the net export value that we have already going out. The Government understands the concern at increasing competition from imports of horticultural products; at the same time, as a major agricultural exporting nation, we have much to gain from the liberalisation of trade. Of course, we support the need to move that way. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia cannot seriously seek the removal of trade distorting subsidies and high tariffs in other countries without similar systems operating here. It must be remembered that Australia exports a higher percentage and a broader range of agricultural products than does any other country. Something like 70 per cent of all our agricultural produce has to find markets overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The livestock and cropping industries, which constitute a significant proportion of the Australian agricultural sector, have an even higher dependency on exports. Australian agricultural industries would not just gain from increased liberalisation of trade; they have much to lose from an increase in international protection. All imports involve a level of risk, and both the risk and the level of acceptability will vary according to the commodity and the pest and disease considerations. Clearly, if assessment indicates that the risk is sufficiently low and that economic and other considerations point to quarantine procedures being appropriate, there can be no technical justification for prohibiting such imports. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fairly clear, as I have said, that we cannot afford to put up protective barriers because Australia itself is so vulnerable to the vagaries of world trade. We can help to reduce this problem in other ways. The Government has introduced compulsory labelling of fruit juices and is working with the States to have compulsory labelling of country of origin of all produce, both processed and unprocessed. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which we promote Australian products is also important. Given that the second great State of Origin match will be played tonight, it is important to note that the Brisbane Broncos are out supporting the Queensland banana industry. That is the way in which Australians must promote their products; it is a great idea. The Brisbane Broncos have had a bit of bad luck lately, but it is still the greatest team in the Winfield competition. That is the way in which Australia must promote its products-by getting out and having a go. Australia produces the best quality product and so has a great opportunity to outdo its competitors, but it must not succumb to the temptation of putting up trade barriers. Australia has much to gain by liberalisation of trade. </PARA>
<PARA> I support these Bills and I commend the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), who is at the table, for his concern, dedication and interest in freeing up trade, and for the effort he has put into this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will add a little to the words of my colleague: I would hate to be a primary producer or horticulturalist in the electorate of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). Getting all those platitudes, claptrap and regurgitated Government propaganda does not alleviate the problems of Australia's primary producers and manufacturers. That sort of rubbish does not go anywhere with those people because they are going broke and their families are suffering. Government platitudes are no substitute for careful thought and good policies-the sorts of policies the coalition is presenting to the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has had two policies to run Australia: it has had a policy of high interest rates and a policy of reducing tariffs. Those policies are diabolical for anybody who is providing jobs or manufacturing anything or self-employed or lucky enough even to have a job. No wonder unemployment is rising; the Government is exposing the Australian people to a flood of imports while charging them extra money for homes and for everything they buy or want to get hold of. The aspirations and incentives of Australians are dead, and their opportunities are non-existent. Those are the policies of the Australian Labor Party (ALP); if those were the policies it wanted to implement, it has been extremely successful in doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time the Government moved to restrict the implications of its policies by preventing international cheats or those who abuse the openness of the Australian market by putting products onto it that are either subsidised or have a loss sale factor. The technique that can be used is to put on the Australian market for a short period a product-be it a manufactured good or a primary product such as orange juice, potatoes or whatever-at a low price so that Australian producers and manufacturers are eventually forced out of production and out of business. They are forced out of business because they cannot compete with imports. </PARA>
<PARA> Because Australian producers have been knocked out of business, Australian consumers and the Australian market are exposed to whatever price the foreign goods are lobbed on to the market for and the importer requires Australians to pay. While a period of competition between Australian and imported products is good for consumers initially, my concern is that, if unfair advantage is used in this process, Australian consumers will ultimately suffer because they will become captives of those foreign producers or manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has moved some amendments to the existing dumping legislation through the Customs Amendment Bill. The idea of this legislation is to allow Australian manufacturers and producers to have the Australian Government charge importers who are cheating the system full price for their goods if the Australian producers and manufacturers can demonstrate that those goods are being dumped here-that is, being sold below the price they are sold for in their country of origin or are being subsidised by the government of the country of origin. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation seeks to redress some of the changes made by the Government in earlier years. My friend the honourable member for Hinkler said that these changes were apparently sensible at the time but have proved to be impractical. Senator Button when introducing these changes said they would improve things for Australian producers. They did nothing of the sort; they made the situation more complex, lengthy, time-consuming, involved and legalistic. Further, they are seen to be less than effective. So the Government is now moving back to the situation it found on coming to office. </PARA>
<PARA> I applaud the Government for that, but the legislation really does not go far enough. For example, it extends the opportunity not only for the actual manufacturers but also for the producer of a like good to mount a dumping case. An easy example is that of citrus growers producing oranges to be processed into orange juice. Previous legislation would not allow citrus growers to take a case of dumping against the import of citrus juice. That seems crazy, but that was the legislation. This legislation extends the capacity of the producer of like goods to mount a dumping case; I think that is a worthy and sensible amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also provides that the time for hearing these matters be limited. That does not go anywhere near what the Opposition has proposed, which is that there should be a 55-day preliminary hearing, after which penalties or charges should go on-the countervailing duties. If anyone then takes the matter further, a 120-day hearing process is to be entered into and fine detail ultimately decides the question. However, if somebody is dumping, the Opposition proposes that action should commence against the person or organisation after 55 days. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole process has great complexity because Australia has to balance anti-dumping steps with its international obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. That is an agreement by trading partners around the world that they will try to play a fair game, and that when they have a dumping procedure or tariff measures the trade process should be as open as possible. The Europeans run their own outfit and do not listen to anybody, including Australia and the United States (US); they are absolutely selfish and single-minded about protecting their own markets and do not care about the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the comments by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), neither has achieved a single thing in the trade area to free up or to improve Australia's trade opportunities with the rest of the world. They have made a lot of placatory noises to the producers and their families, who are suffering, but they have achieved nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> In the process of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Australia must apply to itself some sort of discipline in the way in which it enters into decisions on dumping and the restriction of the entry of imports into this country. This is a complex matter, and countries around the world do different things about dumping. From the initiation of cases, the determination of nominative values, export prices and the prima facie inquiries people have, the domestic price determination and the production costs, every country does a different thing; Canada, the United States and Europe all do different things. </PARA>
<PARA> One tries to assess Australia's position in this process. I would have to say that Australia is free and open-certainly it is not the most open and free, but somewhere about the middle-while the United States, for example, might be more restrictive than most countries. Yet there are countries to our north such as Singapore and the other Asian countries that feel the rest of the world is far too restrictive about letting goods in, and that includes Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians know that if we were to have an open door process for the importation of all goods there would be massive unemployment and dislocation of the Australian economy. While we move to restrict the application of tariffs, and do that fairly quickly and sensibly, there must also be an underpinning factor that prevents international trading cheats from knocking off Australian jobs, manufacturers and primary producers. The Opposition has strong views about this and it has sensible policies as alternatives to those put up by the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been slow in introducing these amendments, which are partially effective. The Government does not understand the urgent need for a quick decision in the preliminary hearing, nor does it understand the damage that can be done to Australian producers or processors while evidence is being gathered. The Opposition does understand that and its policy takes account of it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another area that the Government needs to apply attention to, and that is the area of standards. Australian manufacturing producers are obliged to meet certain standards but others may not be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again we come to this critical part of the session where we have few days left and a lot of legislation to go through. As usual, the health legislation amendments in connection with nursing homes and hostels are brought in at this stage. I understand that there is yet another one to be introduced tomorrow afternoon which has to be passed through this House next week. The point I want to make is that we have never had an opportunity to really debate the issues of the aged in nursing homes and hostels and within the community with any degree of freedom, because we are being caught in this vice of speaking to a timetable set by the guillotine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, I will be one of only the few Opposition members who will be able to speak to this matter. If this is the manner in which the Government continues to treat these very vital matters affecting the most critical part of our community-the aged, who need to have a reliance within the community on certain factors-then its social justice program stands for nought. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Health Amendment Bill contains minor amendments, on which we have sought information from the Department of Community Services and Health as late as this morning. In our consultations with the industry there seems to be one area that is causing some concern, and that is the area of exempt homes. Our consultations with the major sectors of the industry have suggested that there has been a lack by the Department of consultation with these people and with the consumers. To the extent that we have looked at that aspect of it, and in preference to opposing the legislation, we have suggested that this matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. That has been done in the Senate and I understand that the Bill itself and these provisions relating to exempt homes will come up during its consideration of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that the problems with the exempt homes stem right back to the introduction of the original provision. The coalition allowed it through on the basis that we wished it luck but we believed that there were many things to be sorted out on the way through. Apparently the industry believes that they have not been sorted out adequately. The concept of the user pays principle that is contained within the exempt homes provisions is being frustrated by applications not being made because people are still sceptical about it. Where the applications are made, there seems to be some unnecessary delay in getting it onto the books. It appears to me that the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) has quite a few determinations that can be made together with a discretion, which might also affect the position. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the aged care industry, particularly the nursing homes, if we look at the statistics in the years ahead it appears that the way that we are moving does not seem to take into account the ageing of our population beyond the year 2000. In many cases nursing homes are being closed and preference is being given to the establishment of hostels which will become-I understand that the Minister would agree-light nursing homes, but with a subsidy much less than that paid to the nursing home at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important-it is essential-that a bipartisan approach be taken to the attitude of exempt homes, particularly as to where the funding will come from in the future. I shall just give one example. As I said, the hostels will become light nursing homes, available only on geriatric assessment team approval, which makes it most unlikely that husbands and wives, or couples, will be admitted to hostels in the future. Yet at that stage there is an entry contribution available to the hostel owners in order to supplement what have been, in some cases in the voluntary sector, losses on operations. If this is going to be the trend, we see a need to address the problem of why this entry contribution cannot be taken further in connection with that principle. As I said, we will refer that matter to a Senate committee. I understand that it will not mean that there will be any deferment of the legislation; but it will provide the opportunity for consultation with the people involved at that stage. The Opposition will be moving a second reading amendment, to this effect:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House expresses its regret at the uncertainty caused by the Government's delay in concluding a Charter of Residents' Rights and a form of agreement between nursing home residents and proprietors. </PARA>
<PARA>We will do this because we think it necessary to remind the Parliament and its members of just what the process was. I know that, in the rush up to the 1990 election, the Opposition was being blamed for delaying the implementation of the charter in December 1989, at which time we sought to have inserted in the legislation a provision for parliamentary review, in both Houses, of the agreements and the documents, which were not then available. The accusation made at that stage was that we were delaying implementation. I know that some people in the aged care industry believed that and blamed us for it. But that was back in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of last year we then had the rush to lay down a draft. I have mentioned in this House before the draft that came before us as far as the residents' rights were concerned. Also, the residents' agreement with the owners was far from what I believed was the standard required by this Parliament. Again there was a rush to legislate in December 1990 so that these things could be confirmed and put in the hands of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Upon asking the Minister about the timetable, I understand that we now have a new timetable for implementation of the legislation. There has been another change, which means that this will not become available until 1 September this year. At the moment there is market testing of the information kit within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition also understands that there has been some delay in seeking confirmation of the constitutionality of that agreement and also of the residents' rights document. We have not been advised about the concerns that were expressed previously. Again, this shows that the huge rush that was made in order to satisfy an election deadline, and also to satisfy those consumers and residents, has not been successful. We understand that from 1 September 1991 all new residents in nursing homes are to be offered the agreements to sign. I hope that they are in a form which is constitutional and which can be signed without any repercussions from that point. Existing residents may also be offered the opportunity to sign agreements as from 1 August 1991, but must have been offered that opportunity by no later than 31 January 1992. I point out that that is over two years since the process of the legislation began in this House, and probably three or four years from the process of starting it in the first place. That amendment to the motion for the second reading will be moved later on. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to residents' rights, the concern presented to us by the Catholic bishops still has not been addressed, and the Little Sisters of the Poor highlighted the problem they had. The Government did accommodate the Little Sisters of the Poor in the first situation, but has not in the second situation. In a question on notice, I asked the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services what would happen with Commonwealth funding if, as threatened, the Little Sisters of the Poor and other organisations would not sign the agreement. The answer was that the proprietor offers each resident an agreement for signing. If the proprietor complies with the conditions of the agreement, that is okay, but if the proprietor refuses to sign the agreement, there are a range of options which the Government may pursue and, in an overall context, the level of care and accommodation provided by that nursing home would be taken into account. I am not too sure how comforting that will be to the Little Sisters of the Poor or to the Catholic bishops. It shows that in this whole process there is a lot to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA> One problem within the industry at the moment is that, in some respects, there is a de facto application of the residents rights and also the charter. While the objections by the Catholic bishops have not been addressed, there are still many concerns in the industry as to where they stand. At the moment I think they feel that they are in no man's land or no woman's land. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention some of the other problems that the industry and the consumers have had in connection with the aged care industry. Firstly, a unilateral approach was adopted by the Government at the last Budget where there was defunding of the hostel subsidy. The care aggregated module (CAM) hours were reduced without any reference to the industry, in spite of the fact that inquiries were taking place in connection with CAM at that time which would be finalised in the future. The Government's attitude was that the CAM hours were reduced without any consultation, which caused problems for people in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> A concern was expressed to me by the small nursing homes, more particularly the Victorian Bush Hospitals Association, and also the country hostels which were operating very small units, all of which were approved and encouraged by the government of the day. The threat of the top up funding being stopped on 31 December this year is causing some concern. In my talks with the people in the bush hospitals, I know that consultations have been taking place with the Minister's staff and his Department, but I believe that they still require some firm plan. I agree with the principle being adopted that there should be an overall strategy for nursing homes and hostels that will be affected in country areas. There has to be some strategy in place to appreciate what can happen, but there should be some guarantee of funding so that nursing homes can continue into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Coming from a country electorate, I know that people in the country, in smaller townships, have exactly the same needs when they are aged, whether it be for residential or hostel accommodation or whether they stay at home. All these needs can be addressed if we pursue the principle of the multipurpose facilities, genuinely believing that they do provide an answer. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that there is also a problem in connection with the listing for exemption from deeming provisions on gifts and donations. The Department has ensured that those matters receive the approval of the Department. The last time I heard, many applications had been lodged, but very few commitments had been given at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I have talked about nursing homes being exempt and also the method of funding into the future. As we see it, the nursing home industry is being cut down on CAM, but we all know that the CAM component does not provide for any profit to the organisation. Whether it is a private or a voluntary organisation, it should be used to provide the care specified within the residents classification instrument. From speaking to people in the industry, I understand that there is very little fat left in the standard aggregated module, which means that there is no contribution flow through to hostels. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a concern, particularly in Victoria, that nursing home beds are being reduced because of their size. This is in conformity with what is required from 1990 to the year 2000. This means that in the year 2000 there could be a vacuum in the need for nursing home beds. There appears to be no long term planning in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just mention the clause about community visitors. We certainly agree with the amendments that are being suggested in this regard, in that the community visitors no longer have the responsibility of judging the standard of care. I know that has been a concern to dons and staff where visitors come in through the front door and look over the shoulders of the nursing staff to make sure that, in their opinion, they are doing the right job. The Opposition believes that visitors should come in, as I think the Act says, to observe the requirements of the patients themselves. I think that is a good move. </PARA>
<PARA> I will move to another area away from the visitors to the advocates because I believe there is still a major problem there. The Minister will be aware of correspondence that I have had with him in regard to an example of a government nursing home in Maryborough, Queensland, where in fact the advocate not only went on the basis of a claim, but also made comments to the press afterwards and made it a public matter before the Department's own complaints unit was able to deal with it. I do not believe that is good enough and the Minister's response in this regard is worth reading. We do not disagree with some of it, but there is a point. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>A major aim of the advocacy services is to protect and safeguard the rights of these residents. In this context, as the services are not affiliated with either public or private sector bodies, they are not subject to any restrictions on whom they may speak to on behalf of a resident. This includes the press. </PARA>
<PARA>I know in the agreement about the residents' rights we did have some conflict at that stage, but, basically, we said that an advocate who goes into a nursing home should reveal the name of the person who is the complainant. I believe that was the manner in which it was justified. But I do not believe that it is up to that advocate then, out of his own opinion, to go to the press and make those comments. It is interesting that the Minister justified this in a letter to the organisation:</PARA>
<PARA>In cases where press coverage does result from the involvement of an advocacy service, nursing home and hostel proprietors are free to provide rebuttal in the press, if that is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>The reality is, and I think the Minister would agree, that the only news and press one gets about the nursing home industry is not what good is being done, but every time there is somebody thrown out because of an exempt bed provision or when an advocate goes and makes declarations to the press. That is an initial charge that cannot be rebutted irrespective of where one stands with the press. I believe there should be some restriction on advocates speaking to the press, particularly before the complaints unit of the Department is able to investigate it. Once one is condemned in the first headline, it does not matter how much there is a withdrawal or a rebuttal on the back page, which obviously follows the next day; that does not overcome the national headlines that ensue from that initial reaction. So I do wish the Minister would look at that aspect of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Opposition has taken this opportunity with the National Health Amendment Bill to introduce an amendment in connection with the discretion of the Secretary to the Department being available in connection with the pharmacists. What I understand is the situation is that a determination made by a delegate of the Secretary to the Department of Community Services and Health is not required to be tabled and is therefore not disallowable, and the determination made under section 98c (1) (b) of the National Health Act 1953 makes changes to the system that pharmacists use to make a claim for payment from the Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several determinations available to the Secretary to the Department in this regard, all affecting pharmacists, but, unfortunately, the discretions are in the hands of the Secretary and they are not subject to any appeal or other system of an independent review of that particular decision. </PARA>
<PARA>,The particular amendment that we would have moved had we moved into committee, but which will be pursued in the Senate, would make those determinations subject to disallowance. Other than the points that we have made, we support the Bill. I move:</PARA>
<PARA>That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House expresses its regret at the uncertainty caused by the Government's delay in concluding a Charter of Residents' Rights and a form of agreement between nursing home residents and proprietors''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking in support of the National Health Amendment Bill, but in particular to amendments which will include the Commonwealth's outcome standards as a condition of approval for all approved nursing homes. Outcome standards for Commonwealth approved nursing homes were introduced in 1987. A series of parliamentary reports, including the McLeay and the Giles reports, recommended changes to the administration of the aged care program, including the issue of standards of care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1984 Giles report made a comprehensive examination of the quality of care standards in nursing homes and found evidence of substandard care. Amongst other things, that Committee, the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes, recommended that a Commonwealth nursing home standards committee be established to develop uniform guidelines for minimum standards of nursing hours, physical facilities, para-medical services and quality of care. Subsequently, the 1986 nursing homes and hostels review recommended sweeping changes to the Commonwealth's administration of aged care, and its recommendations included that standards for quality of care and quality of life should be controlled through input and outcome measures which would need to be met as a condition of funding, and that the Department of Community Services and Health should-in consultation with State authorities, consumer organisations and the industry-formulate a manual on quality of care and quality of life for nursing homes and nursing home residents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government took action to develop appropriate standards and to ensure that residents of nursing homes have the quality of life that they deserve. Development of the outcome standards resulted from a sharing of skills and experiences in an intergovernmental forum and through extensive national consultations with industry, union and consumer representatives. The nursing home outcome standards emphasise the importance of residents as individuals and as members of the community. The standards set out the care and lifestyle objectives which the nursing home industry is expected to achieve for all residents. They represent a significant change in the way the Government perceives nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, regulations and legislation have primarily addressed the inputs to care and the physical environment of nursing homes rather than the quality of care and lifestyle of residents. Outcome standards also recognise the changing perception of nursing homes as being the long term homes of residents as well as providing health care facilities. In other words, they have to be places that people would like to live in. They are not specifying inputs or processes. The standards encourage flexibility in nursing home design, service provision and work practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The intent of the standards is also to encourage and enable residents to perform activities, maintain responsibilities and receive support according to their individual needs and capabilities. Due to the residents' increasing frailty, it is recognised that not all residents will be able to avail themselves fully of freedoms which are properly theirs. However, this is no reason to qualify or withdraw those freedoms for the majority of residents in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government understood from the outset that for this new approach to be implemented, the industry would require assistance. Significant funding has been provided by the Government to meet these needs of industry. However, it is important to understand that this is a regulatory program. The Government needs to ensure that residents receive the care that they are entitled to as citizens of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> For the small percentage of nursing homes that have not performed as high quality care providers, it is this Government's responsibility to take action. I draw the House's attention briefly to the fact that the member for Perth in the State Parliament of Western Australia, Ian Alexander, has recently highlighted a number of problems in nursing homes in that State. I think that the Government's action in trying to control that small number of nursing homes is extremely important in the context of his comments. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments to include outcome standards as a condition of approval of all nursing homes will make clear, particularly to those proprietors that provide substandard care, that action sometimes needs to be taken. The amendment clarifies that action can be taken to withdraw or suspend Commonwealth benefits to a home when it is not satisfying standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not shirked from taking action against homes that have failed to meet the standards where these have been drawn to its attention. Since July 1990, when sanction action for failing to comply with the standards became available, the Government has implemented sanctions against 17 nursing homes. This action has met with a great deal of success. This means that residents are receiving a better quality care. In nearly every case the nursing home has improved its performance to meet standards almost immediately. In a couple of other cases the home has closed or new admissions have not been allowed to the home until the standards were improved. This action, therefore, highlights the important regulatory role the Commonwealth continues to play in the aged care program and, indeed, one that it has to play. </PARA>
<PARA> However, to talk only of a regulatory program is to concentrate on the few bad apples in the barrel who fail to provide quality aged care. As most Australians are aware, the aged care industry has a proud record of providing excellent quality of care to its clients. The huge majority of nursing homes provide an excellent level of care by dedicated staff doing an extremely good and a very rewarding job. The last few years have seen significant changes in the provision of care and a recognition that the changing size of the aged population and their care requirements of the aged will provide even greater challenges well into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the Government's residents' rights strategy and intention to ensure information about nursing homes is widely available, the Government publishes reports of its visits to nursing homes and hostels for the aged. These reports are given to the proprietors of nursing homes before they are published. A recently released report on the outcome standards by Dr John Braithwaite of the Australian National University found that the industry overwhelmingly supports the standards. </PARA>

The major industry associations, consumer groups, unions, nursing home staff and residents are generally supportive of the standards and Dr Braithwaite reported that, despite inevitable tension associated with the day to day operation of a regulatory program, the underlying reality is one of industry and government working together constructively to improve the quality of care for nursing home residents. On 1 January 1991 the Commonwealth introduced similar outcome standards for hostels. The standards are another step in the Commonwealth Government's reform of aged care in Australia, which emphasises rights and dignity for individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to make at this point a comment about Barridale Lodge, which was opened in my electorate on Saturday by Senator Pat Giles-as it turns out, the person who chaired the Committee that produced the Giles report in 1984-and to indicate that the quality of this particular lodge is excellent. It was built by a constituent of mine, and the charter of residents' rights was well and truly on display in the foyer of the hostel. I am sure that, if we can continue to have excellent facilities like this made available and if those facilities are able to offer proper care to aged Australians, then this Government's achievements in this area will go down in history as being very great. Accordingly, I commend the National Health Amendment Bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the National Health Amendment Bill I wish to draw the attention of the House to a very serious problem in relation to aged people with an intellectual disability. I am glad that the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) is in the House today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In summary, the problem is that the option of retirement is not available to many such people. My attention has been drawn to this issue by Mr Trevor Caldwell, Director of the Noweyung Centre, and members of the centre's board of management. Noweyung Centre is an officially designated adult training support service and is located in Bairnsdale in my electorate of Gippsland. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, Noweyung is a day training centre helping intellectually disabled people to become more independent and training them for employment. It hardly needs to be said that these objectives receive the enthusiastic endorsement and support of all members of the Parliament. There are approximately 40 clients at Noweyung ranging in age from the late teens to the sixties. I say in passing that Noweyung is very highly regarded and is supported both morally and financially by the east Gippsland community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council for Intellectual Disability Agencies (Victoria) Inc. held a zone meeting in early April in Maffra, which is also in my electorate. It was in the form of a workshop to consider options in Gippsland for aged people with an intellectual disability. Naturally, Noweyung was represented at that workshop. The workshop identified a number of significant issues affecting the intellectually disabled aged in Gippsland. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the issue upon which I wish to concentrate my remarks in the very brief time allowed today is that of the requirement for the intellectually disabled aged to attend day training centres. In other words, sadly they are unable to retire to their residences because of a lack of staffing during the day. A number of clients of Noweyung reside in CRUs-community residential units. These are houses located in the community in Bairnsdale and they reinforce the goal of independence for people with an intellectual disability. CRUs are generally owned by community organisations and in Bairnsdale are owned by the Noweyung Centre or by the Kilmany Family Care Organisation, which is very well known in east Gippsland and is an agency of the Uniting Church. However, State and Federal governments share the recurrent costs associated with CRUs. The State Government provides the majority of funding and the Commonwealth funds administrative costs and some ongoing costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Since staffing of the community residential units is for a morning and an evening only, every person at a CRU must find a day placement. That is fine for a young person who wants to attend training centres like Noweyung to obtain independence and training skills, but what about the people of retirement age? Many of them wish to remain at home in the community residential unit and pursue gardening interests or handiwork-work of a personal nature. Some will be interested in pottery; some might be interested in woodwork. This is the problem in essence. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote directly from the minutes of the workshop held in Maffra by the Council of Intellectual Disability Agencies of Victoria in early April because it best summarises the problems for us. With respect to the major issues affecting aged people with an intellectual disability, the minutes state:</PARA>
<PARA>Lack of options in Adult Training Support Services for ageing clients who are no longer interested in training and employment and for whom these services are no longer relevant. </PARA>
<PARA>Providing for aged clients is not a function of Adult Training Support Services, therefore these services are not appropriate for the aged and retirees. Everyone has a right to retire. </PARA>
<PARA>CRU residents cannot stay at home during the day. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an assumption that residents attend other programs such as adult training support services. CRU's are not funded to provide a service during the day. Lack of choice for the aged-e.g. can't decide to stay at home for the day. </PARA>
<PARA>The need for choices, options and flexibility is the key issue. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, this is something of a new problem. The easiest and most obvious way to solve it, I think you would agree, is to increase funding for daytime staff in CRUs. That may not be financially realistic or even necessarily the best solution to the emerging problem. What can be said with certainty, however, is that governments must consider as a matter of some urgency solutions to these problems. Perhaps work that I am not aware of has been done by governments. If so, I will be glad to know of it from the Minister for the Aged, Family and Health Services, who is at the table. This is most certainly an issue which I will pursue on behalf of Noweyung and the intellectually disabled aged generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in supporting the National Health Amendment Bill because of what it will do not only for aged Australians in general, but also for older people living in the region which I represent. I think that this Government has a record of quiet reform in this area which has been quite positive. It has developed a national policy towards the care of the aged which has centred upon the needs of the aged rather than having other things as its focus. I think it is very important that the Government has considered the needs of those people and has tried to put in place policies which reflect and cater for those needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, one of the major thrusts of this Government's aged care policies has been to enable older people to remain in their homes for as long as possible. To do that, we have put in place the home and community care (HACC) program. Over the last five years that program has been of enormous benefit in expanding domiciliary care services such as home nursing, home help, personal care, Meals on Wheels, home maintenance, transport services and day care centres. A part of the HACC program has been the flexibility which has been allowed to fund services that in the local communities are of benefit and cater for the needs of those it is servicing. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thrust of the aged care policy of the Government is the provision of a high standard of residential care. No matter how we would like to provide services which would enable older people to stay in their own homes and live within their own communities, there are people who do need to go into residential care. The Government has addressed the important aspects of the standards required for nursing homes and the techniques with which we can monitor those standards. It is no good having nursing homes that are of poor quality. The people whom we are talking about are entitled to receive the best quality care. This Bill contains additional measures that will further assist this process. </PARA>
<PARA> The third aspect the Government has addressed is that of the fees charged to residents. Up to now, many residents in private nursing homes have paid well above the minimum resident contribution, which is set at 87 1/2 per cent of the full single pension plus rent assistance. When we look at the fact that 90 per cent of nursing home residents are pensioners, we see that paying above the minimum fee set is a considerable burden. It is pleasing to see that from 1 July this year, no resident in any nursing home need pay more than the minimum resident contribution. It is an enormous achievement after five years to have reached the point where residents of nursing homes can be completely secure in knowing that they can afford the costs of their care. </PARA>
<PARA> In the brief time that I have left to speak I would like to mention two projects that cater for older people in my electorate. The first is a project that is under construction at the moment. The auspice body, the Villa Maria Society for the Blind, is constructing Villa Madonna, stage 1 of a 40-bed nursing home. The Federal Government has provided $1.2m for this, which has been extremely appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that it does illustrate is that, in a sense, we have encouraged people to cater for older people with special requirements, whether it be because of disabilities or whether it be because of-importantly to my electorate-coming from migrant communities. I am pleased to see that the Government is continuing in that vein. </PARA>
<PARA> The other program that I would like to mention briefly is, of course, the Bundoora Extended Care Centre (BECC). It describes itself as a centre of excellence in the care of older people. I think the people who know that centre would agree that it can indeed entitle itself in that way. The important services that it provides are geriatric assessment teams which ensure that people are placed within, or put within and targeted towards, the appropriate services. </PARA>
<PARA> The BECC also has a computerised nursing home waiting list which can give us valuable information on the needs for nursing home places in the region which it services. Another project is its community care project, which is an extension of the HACC philosophy where it assists people to match themselves up with services which will assist them in remaining in their own homes. In February last year it opened an information centre which provides, in a citizens advice bureau style, information to older people on all aspects of accommodation, health care and community services that cater for old people. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, of course, it will go into the provision of nursing home placements. The nursing homes that it has put in place have unique and very innovative designs that will ensure that the older people placed within those homes get the type and standard of care that they are entitled to. In conclusion, I have great pleasure in supporting this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank my colleague the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) for allowing me a few minutes to answer some of the questions that were raised in this debate. I refer, particularly, to the speech by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). I appreciate that he wants to have aired in the Senate the issues on exempt homes. But I put to him and to other honourable members that the changes we are proposing in the Bill do give very good security-great security-to the people who are living in exempt homes now, and indeed in the future, so that they will be protected. We do not want to put those people in a position where they feel that, if after being in an exempt home for two years they could not afford the fee, they would have to leave. I do not think that that is what anybody would want for a person at that stage in life. I understand the wishes of the Opposition and I am sure we will be going through that process in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was one other point that the honourable member for Dawson raised and I mention this as a means of clarification. He spoke of assessment for admission to hostels by geriatric assessment teams. This does not mean that, if one person is assessed for admission to a hostel through geriatric assessment team procedures, that would mean that the partner would not be allowed to go into the hostel. It is different from a nursing home and that is why there are differences in funding. </PARA>

<PARA>Overall, Australian taxpayers will pay more tax because it is essential to raise more in tax revenue than you will later give back in tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA>He also went on to demolish the Opposition theory that the tax might do something about helping savings. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The theory is that saving will be increased, but in other countries where the tax has been introduced there is no evidence of that.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has its own backbencher saying that, whatever the existing tax system, it will ensure that Australian taxpayers pay more tax. That is what the Opposition is about-not less tax.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, we have a situation under the existing tax system where there is tax on some goods. One does not need to be a genius to know that. What the Opposition is about is very simply raising a very significantly increased amount of taxation, as the honourable member for O'Connor says, and what is so pitiable and objectionable about it is that the Opposition is not doing it for honourable or decent reasons, it is proposing to do it only so it can shovel back billions of dollars into the pockets of the already rich.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5H4">Mr HAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought, given the rare occasions I get to the box, that people would be interested in what is a very important issue. There has been a lot of misinformation and hysteria surrounding the Cambodians and the movement of these people. Let me go through the facts and processes we are required to adhere to if we are to maintain the integrity of the migration program and our international obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dealing with the Cambodian boat people: since November 1989 five boats with a total of 320 people have arrived from Cambodia. It must be remembered that unauthorised boat arrivals have technically not entered Australia. Despite this, they can lodge claims for protection on refugee grounds. As prohibited immigrants, these people cannot under law simply move into the community. They can enter only when they have a legal basis to remain in Australia. For this reason they must be kept in custody. I point out to the House that last year I attempted to move all of these people into the one facility. For a whole range of reasons, mainly through the intervention of community support groups, I was persuaded not to do that. Some of these groups put to me most strongly that in the interests of natural justice the boat arrivals should not be moved to a central location.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House of the process these people are involved in to establish their refugee status. All applicants for refugee status are assessed against the United Nations definition of a refugee. This definition has as its guiding principle the concept of well-founded fear of persecution. I cannot emphasise strongly enough how fair and just this system is. I believe that nowhere else in the world do applicants have the opportunities they have in Australia to substantiate their claims. Nowhere else in the world are those claims so thoroughly assessed. The checks and balances that have been built into the system are second to none.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the question of the movement of these people. Last Monday week one group of Cambodians was moved from Sydney to Darwin. The media has been running hot with alarmist and distorted stories about this. We have been accused of heavy handed tactics and secrecy over decisions on these people. I want to put a couple of things straight for the record. The basic privacy principles prevent me or my Department from discussing individual decisions. It is not my intention now to discuss the merits of these specific cases, or ever in the future to discuss the merits of individual cases, especially ones so sensitive as those involving applications for refugee status.</PARA>
<PARA> The applicants themselves, or those purporting to represent their interests, have made the decisions public. I must emphasise that, contrary to reports, these people have not been deported. No-one has been deported. They have their review rights, which they have yet to exercise. Given the outcome of the primary decision, there was a strong case for transferring the group to more secure accommodation than the relaxed conditions in which they were being held. The move was made in a responsible way and in the interests of the welfare of the people.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that no telephones were disconnected. The only telephones they ever had access to were the public ones and in the manager's office. They were in fact given access to the phones in the manager's office. The elderly lady herself chose, after discussions with departmental officers and members of her community, to go to Darwin. We put a doctor on the plane with her, so she was fully covered healthwise. The group's legal representative was advised at 11 a.m. and the group left Sydney at 2.30. No individual was handcuffed, either in Sydney or during the journey to Darwin. The dignity of all individuals involved was fully respected at all times.</PARA>
<PARA> So where does that leave me today? If there is one message I would like to get across it is this: if a person arrives in Australia without documentation, the proper processes must be adhered to; otherwise it will distort our immigration program and the significant reforms we have brought into the migration area over the past few years. Some months ago-this might be of interest to those people purporting to support the Cambodian people-I initiated discussions with the Cambodian authorities to establish an orderly departure program from that country. This would prevent people making the hazardous, treacherous, dangerous voyage-in terms of pirates and other threats-they are forced to make. I look forward to that day.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has been enjoined by the Opposition, and by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer in particular, to adopt far more radical solutions and radical policies for the continuing economic restructuring and transition of Australia. As part of those propositions, the Leader of the Opposition has said just a day or so ago:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I am dedicated to making fundamental structural reform in Australia, and a lot of key elements of that-industrial relations is probably the biggest element, the tax reform is also a very important element, the goods and services tax is essential, the tax reform process. We are 100 per cent committed.</PARA>
<PARA>Then he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There are now, for example, at the Federal level fundamental differences between the Government and ourselves on industrial relations, on the waterfront, on privatisation, on reform of the public sector, on tax reform and so on.</PARA>
<PARA>The same was said by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who also said that he wished to abolish the capital gains tax as well.</PARA>
<PARA> The reform package which the Government has been enjoined to adopt contains a broad-based consumption tax, as the Prime Minister has just mentioned; the mooted abolition of the company tax; a State income tax; State levied income taxes; zero wage increases; a zero inflation target, adopted through a draconian monetary policy, despite the fact that it is to be accompanied by a 15 per cent addition to the price system coming from a consumption tax; health vouchers; education vouchers; no lump sums for workers until 65 years of age; cuts of $3 billion in government spending; privatisation of the social security system; privatisation in general; deregulation of the labour market; and work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA> This is the package which the Opposition enjoins the Government to adopt, even though the Government has already dramatically changed the way in which Australia functions as a market economy, via a floating exchange rate, removal of exchange controls, the first structural Budget surplus ever, a shift in the factor shares, a radical change in the tax system and a 39 per cent corporate rate.

For example, unofficial figures in the United States indicate that some 20 or so of the latest 24 fatalities that have arisen as a result of dog attack are relevant to this issue. That is, pit bull-terriers or similar dogs have been involved in those fatalities. I think honourable members need no reminding about the recent spate of incidents in the United Kingdom-most recently an attack on a young child that very nearly was a fatality-and not so long ago in Queensland one instance of an attack where one of these dogs killed a Shetland pony, another dog and a cat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a serious issue. I have announced a review to be conducted by the primary industries and resources committee to look at the whole raft of issues involved here. We need to be cognisant of the right of owners to have these breeds of dogs, but at the very minimum we should look at whether we should continue to allow such dogs to be imported and, if we do import them, under what conditions. Possibly, as in other instances, we would have neutering of dogs to ensure that there was not a proliferation of these dogs. We might also look at issues such as compulsory muzzling and other regulatory requirements when the dogs are in the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I think honourable members will be aware from the growing incidence of these types of dogs in their own communities that they represent a real threat to the wider community. One need look only at the reactions of parents as they walk their children down the street and one of these dogs comes along-either on or off a leash-to realise that at the very minimum this matter ought to receive detailed and serious consideration by the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the Government came to office it has systematically tried to deal with tax avoidance by broadening the tax base and by removing opportunities for avoidance where most of the avoidance schemes had, in the main, a capital gain pinned underneath them. We dealt with that by the adoption of a capital gains tax-which both the Leader of the Opposition and his deputy this week have committed themselves to removing-by the establishment of the fringe benefits tax, which was opposed by the coalition, by substantiation; by the abolition of entertainment as a deduction; by reducing tax rates to lift compliance; and by reducing the Opposition's 60 per cent marginal rate to a top personal rate of 47 per cent and the rate of tax on distributed income from 78c in the dollar to 47c for companies. At the same time, as far as the elderly are concerned, we removed full rate pensioners from the tax system, and by 1995 we will remove even part rate pensioners from the tax system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is why the tax base of Australia is now more secure. It is one of the reasons why fiscal policy has been more successful in the last half dozen years, because now the tax system is doing its proper job. The tax administration has had the proper support, with both personnel and resources, and a courageous commissioner supported by the Government, instead of a commissioner trodden under by a government which was interested in supporting tax avoidance-the former coalition Government.</PARA>
<PARA> It becomes a bit of a laugh when we have the Deputy Leader of the National Party asking a question and arguing to the Prime Minister that there should be a consumption tax to stop tax avoidance. As if the coalition ever had the slightest interest in tax avoidance! It had none as the tax system fell apart under the weight of the tax avoidance industry. We saw all that history. He said that there should be reforms such as dividend imputation where shareholders only get a rebate if the primary tax has been paid. That is one of the reasons why corporate tax collections have gone up 500 per cent since the Government came to office-because of more growth and more activity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As distinct from that inevitability, what is being proposed by those opposite is not some minor anomalies between classifications but something which is a major social disaster. If they believe it is not an anomaly, let alone a disaster, to impose on every person in this country a massive increase in tax which will discriminate against the poor and the low to middle income earners, then they have another think coming. I can tell them that if they go on with this proposal, which we sincerely trust they will, the people of this country will make their judgment about it, because they will know that what they are motivated by is what, historically, has motivated members of the tory parties in this country. They have always been about having a tax system that gives a further opportunity to those who are already rich and privileged to avoid making a contribution to the Commonwealth revenues. That is what has characterised every conservative government in the history of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those opposite will go to the top of that conservative class, because on this occasion their proposal is to impose this regressive tax, this broad-based consumption tax, that will make the poor pay as much as the rich for every item that they buy. In doing that, they will increase their revenues so that they can shovel billions of dollars back into their pockets, into the pockets of the already rich. That is what they are about. The honourable member for O'Connor knows what it is about, and I am sure that no-one, whether up there in the gallery or elsewhere in Australia, will avoid the obvious conclusion that, as a result of last Saturday, those opposite are starting to get very worried indeed about their capacity to hoodwink the people of this country. All we on this side say is, `Start to spell it out'. For instance, just last week the Leader of the Opposition confirmed that the consumption tax would apply to electricity accounts.</PARA>

They should explain to the pensioners of this country how they will justify a situation where they impose this consumption tax upon the use of their telephones. As we know, the phone, for many pensioners, is their connection to the outside world. How will those opposite compensate them? Will it be on an average sort of charge so that the people who need to use it most will pay more? What about their electricity accounts? Are those opposite going to provide some sort of subsidy to the States to cover the pensioners in regard to their electricity accounts?</PARA>
<PARA> These are the questions of detail in regard to the poor and underprivileged in this country that we are waiting for members of the Opposition to spell out. They have had plenty of opportunity. They say that they never come up with a proposal until they have thought through it in detail, but on every occasion when they are asked by the press or by anyone else to give some detail they say that they have no detail. When they get the detail in regard to what they will do to pensioners we will be waiting for them but, more importantly, so will the pensioners be waiting for them in 1993.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At my request, a delegation lead by Professor Ross Garnaut of the Australian National University, including a Deputy Secretary of my Department and officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau visited Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Pretoria from 9 to 16 May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The achievement one day of a non-racial democracy in South Africa is now inevitable. I have long believed it will be of immense importance that the Government which comes to power in South Africa when apartheid has been scrapped should have the will and the capability to manage the economy of that country effectively. The economic policy experience in postcolonial Africa has not been a happy one and it will be tragic if the same or similar mistakes were to be made in South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA> In particular, it has been my consistent view that as South Africa moves towards a more equitable and just society there must always continue to be a place for white business, for enterprise and capital. It is clear that South Africa has embarked on an historic process of political transition, albeit one that is complex, challenging and will undoubtedly proceed in fits and starts.</PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that the African National Congress seems to be developing economic policies which are practical and sensible, the greater will be the confidence in South Africa about making the transition to majority rule. I and members of the Government have discussed these matters on a number of occasions with leaders of black opinion, people who will have an influence in a future democratic South Africa. Most recently I had the opportunity of having such discussions here with Nelson Mandela.</PARA>
<PARA> The mission that I sent to South Africa was designed as a practical and useful follow-up to these ideas and to these discussions. It went there with two essential purposes: first, to undertake discussions with a range of relevant interest in South Africa about economic policy for the post-apartheid period and, second, to consider ways in which Australia might assist with the development of the intellectual infrastructure for sound economic policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The mission held very extensive discussions with organisations and the mass democratic movement, with the Government, with academic economists, with representatives of South African business, both white and black, with analysts of the South African economy and with other people.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has received a very useful report from the delegation which is currently under study. I am not in a position at this stage to announce decisions, but I will say that the delegation has provided useful recommendations in relation both to enhancing the capability in South Africa for economic research and policy development and longer term training and education.</PARA>
<PARA> When decisions are taken by the Government, I am confident that honourable members will see them as a constructive expression of our wish to look beyond issues such as sanctions and the present difficulties in South Africa, important though those issues are, and to position ourselves in this country to make a contribution to the well-being of all South Africans in the non-racial democratic South Africa which surely will one day come about.</PARA>

According to the Centre for Policy Studies at Monash University, at least $1.2 billion a year is paid in sales tax on business inputs for export products.

These are figures which not only should he not reject but of which he should be proud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The premise of his question is that Australian industry is not competitive. How then does he explain the facts which I have put before the House on a previous occasion and which I put again? These are the figures from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development which show the comparison of Australia's performance in the latter part of the 1980s with the rest of the world and with the OECD. How, if we are not competitive, do those opposite explain the fact, in regard to manufacturing exports, that the average for the OECD from 1983 to 1989 was an index figure of 100, and in 1985-base 100 for the OECD average-there was a 31 per cent increase? The index went from 100 to 131. That was the index for the OECD. Australia's performance was up from 100 to 179.</PARA>
<PARA> If the honourable member begins to have any knowledge of the subject on which he purports to ask a question which is based upon the premise that we are not competitive, how does he begin to explain that the OECD average in this period was a 31 per cent increase in manufacturing exports and Australia's was 79? The premise of his question is false. The reason why the premise of his question is false is that this Government, by a series of decisions, has created a more competitive economy in this country, not least because we have a wages policy in this country which the Opposition has never had and which it would never be capable of introducing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question and acknowledge that the honourable member has been a leading opponent of driftnet fishing. As the Parliament is aware, this Government has actively opposed the use of driftnets in the South Pacific, particularly since the sudden upsurge in driftnet fishing towards the beginning of 1989, particularly by Japan and Taiwan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The action we have taken in the region, first of all, is with the conclusion of the Wellington Convention in November 1989 to ban driftnet fishing-we worked on that convention-and globally, of course, through the United Nations in relation to driftnet fishing. Therefore, the Government welcomes the entry into force last week, on 17 May, of the Wellington Convention, which bans driftnet fishing in the South Pacific. Australia itself will be able shortly to ratify the convention once the amending legislation has been passed through the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> We also welcome the United States signature to the convention and its first protocol. We note that the American Administration has sent a message to Congress advocating ratification of the convention. Also, we welcome the fact that Japan from July 1990, and Taiwan earlier this year, ceased driftnet fishing in the South Pacific. The entry into force of the convention means that driftnet fishing has now completely ceased in the South Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA> This is a major regional achievement, which has involved extensive cooperation between Australia, the Forum Island countries and the Forum Fisheries Agency. Of course, we are not satisfied with that achievement. We have still got concerns about driftnet fishing operations in other oceans, including the Indian Ocean, where large Taiwanese fishing fleets still operate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I inform the House that all State and Territory governments, along with the Federal Government, believe that the existing self-regulatory system for alcohol advertising needs re-examination. A national survey was done under the national campaign against drug abuse of community attitudes on alcohol advertising. The vast majority of people perceive that the current code of alcohol advertising seems to be in conflict with what they see on their television screens, read in their newspapers and hear on the radio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issues the Government is concerned about spring basically from the sad fact that in Australia about 6,000 Australians die every year because of alcohol abuse, at a cost of at least $6,000m annually to our economy and our society. There are also very extensive costs to industry, which are difficult to quantify because that $6,000m does not cover the cost of sickies and absenteeism, workplace and low productivity that come about as a result of alcohol abuse, in the workplace in particular. At the moment very little information is collected on these particular matters. I do not think that Australia can afford to lose one life, let alone the costs associated with alcohol abuse.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also pertinent to note that alcohol abuse, as distinct from reasonable alcohol usage, is associated with crime and violence. I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question because I know he is very concerned about these issues. It would be instructive for members of this House to go back to the first speech of the honourable member for Moreton in this House, when he raised the issue of violence, particularly domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA> There are things that governments can do and there are things that the whole community is responsible for. What the Federal Government is seeking, along with every other State and Territory Government right across the political spectrum, is community involvement and participation in dealing with these issues. The State, Territory and Commonwealth Ministers have asked the Media Council of Australia to look at alcohol advertising.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a discussion paper currently circulating in the community, in a major community consultation, and we expect the Media Council of Australia to report back to the Ministers of the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy by September.</PARA>
<PARA> I have also recently established an Alcohol Industry Consultative Council which has representatives from all peak alcohol industry bodies, from the manufacturers through to the retailers. This will enable a formal, regular and constructive process to operate in which the Government can work with the alcohol industry on issues such as advertising and labelling.</PARA>
<PARA> We are trying to address the issue of alcohol abuse, as distinct from reasonable usage by the community, by working with the community and with industry and to seek their active participation in dealing with these problems. It is only by active participation of all involved in coming to terms with a very serious problem in our community that these issues will be resolved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I claim to have been misrepresented by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). During Question Time the Treasurer completely misrepresented matters affecting my administration as Treasurer in two very important respects. The first of those was that he quite erroneously claimed that the large number of documents that were tabled in relation to tax avoidance matters in 1982 were documents tabled by the Commissioner of Taxation, the implication in his answer clearly being that they were tabled against the wishes of myself as the then Treasurer. The truth is that I initiated the preparation and publication of that book, and in fact in doing so I established quite a precedent in respect of providing documents that are normally classified as confidential, flowing between the administration and the Treasurer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second area of misrepresentation is his oft repeated claim that no anti-tax avoidance legislation was passed by the former Government. I would remind the Treasurer and the House that, in the time that I was Treasurer, I passed the following landmark pieces of tax avoidance legislation: I outlawed the Curran tax avoidance scheme, the dividend stripping scheme; I introduced the new part IVa of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which was necessary in the face of the literal interpretation being then given by the High Court of Australia to section 260; I introduced the Crimes (Tax Offences) Act of 1980, which was the first occasion that any government in this country--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unless politicians are prepared to give some leadership to fight for a better tax system and a better industrial relations system, and unless politicians are prepared to tackle the hard issues facing this country, then I say that basically this country is doomed. The Government can run all the scare campaigns it likes. It can run up to the next election with a scare campaign on tax-as it will, I am sure-but I say to the Government that we will fight this issue literally tooth and nail all the way down the wire for the simple reason that this country needs a better tax system. It is an essential, fundamental part of the restructuring of the Australian economy which we will implement as we go into the next election and then start to implement our policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This country has some pretty basic problems. We have a massive debt-$131 billion and climbing. We literally have a rural crisis, if not a rural depression. We have trade union leaders who have too much power. We have a Government which is bloated and inefficient. We have the States' finances in a deplorable state. We discourage people from saving. We have a tax system where people pay not only too much tax but a system which is in itself inefficient. On top of that, what are we facing? We are literally staring down the barrel of a depression. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the response of the Australian Labor Party? I say to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), honestly, I think he ought to be ashamed of his response. On leadership-he undermines his own leader to pursue his own personal ambitions. He puts the country's interests second best to that. He spends all his time running around with his campaign managers and others to advance his own cause.</PARA>
<PARA> On policy-he is up here with his deception and his fiction about the state of the Australian economy. A couple of months ago the Treasurer actually said that `the recovery was coming through now.' Every year he has the gall to say, `things are getting better'. Remember that one when he said, `we are entering a golden age'? He said, `Australia has turned the corner'. There was that Budget one when he said that he was going to bring home the bacon. </PARA>
<PARA> Every year this economy worsens. The bottom line is that there is a decline in living standards for the average Australian family. As a result we face the really horrific prospect that we as a generation could pass onto the next generation a lower level of living standards than we ourselves have enjoyed. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at the Government's wages policy. It is an absolute shambles. The Government does not have a wages policy. It is literally in no man's land. It has abandoned its own centralised system in, literally, a fit of pique. It has adopted the rhetoric of an enterprise bargaining system but it does not have the guts to take on its mates in the trade union movement to adopt a decent enterprise system. </PARA>
<PARA> Fiscal policy-it is literally out of control. The Treasurer himself said last August that fiscal policy was the rock upon which his policy was based, the foundation of his policy. What have we seen since then? The Government had an $8 billion surplus virtually disappear down to $2 billion, and it is likely to go below that. The public sector borrowing requirement-the Government's impact on the national pool of savings-in a couple of good years the Government made a contribution in the total government sector of 1.2 per cent, but what is it now? The Government does not have its wrist in the national pool of savings; it has its whole arm in the national pool of savings with all the implications that has for high interest rates for the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The deterioration in fiscal policy is literally of Whitlamesque proportions. As a consequence, when the Treasurer looks to monetary policy-because he has done nothing else in micro-reform, on wages policy or on fiscal policy-he continues to rely on high real interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Governor of the Reserve Bank said the other day, interest rates in this country are still very high. What has brought on the recession? What is the instrument of the recession that the Treasurer said that we had to have? It is high interest rates, of course. </PARA>
<PARA> On tax policy, apart from more tax-and the honourable member is the world's greatest Treasurer, he is the biggest taxing Treasurer that we have ever had-where is his policy for the next election? We have already put out one of the most detailed tax policies that any Opposition has ever put out-as detailed as any tax policy-yet the Treasurer has the cheek to come in here and ask us for more policy details. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go through the only pre-election tax policies those opposite have ever had. Do people remember? Back in 1983 the Australian Labor Party said: there will be no capital gains tax. We got a capital gains tax. In 1984 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), sitting in a radio booth in Perth, announced a tax summit. During the last election, what was his policy? It was the luxury car tax. What a fiasco that has been. What a fiasco the Treasurer is as a tax reformer. As we go to the next election, what attraction will the Labor Party be offering the Australian electorate? It will be offering the honourable member for Blaxland as Prime Minister and waging a scare campaign against the Opposition's tax reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party will be absolutely annihilated at the next election, because people in the electorate want solutions to Australia's problems; they do not want a lot of silly political games. The only reason that this issue has had a bit of a run this week is that Nick Greiner did not do as well as people thought he would do in New South Wales. Those opposite wanted a distraction from the leadership issue, so they thought they would pin it on the consumption tax. But they have only to ask anybody in New South Wales to find out whether the consumption tax is an issue. If only the Treasurer had gone back to his electorate during the election campaign, he would know it was not an issue. It is just a dead non-issue. Even the Treasurer's own Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said that the consumption tax was not an issue. Of course, none of the polls give any support for the argument. </PARA>
<PARA> In due course, we will put out some more detail on the goods and services tax. We will do so at a time that suits us-and for very good reason. Firstly, people will be very much attracted to the tax policy we will put out. Secondly, it is a policy which addresses this country's basic problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the very extensive detail we have already put out on the goods and services tax. The first thing is that, under a coalition tax policy, people will pay less tax. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give the Treasurer the answer to that. We will soon debate how we collect tax but, if people want to pay less tax, governments have to cut expenditure. In the last election, we had a list; we were up front. There was none of this business about keeping the tax policy in the bottom drawer. We told people what we were prepared to do by way of cutting back the size of government expenditure-the only route to reduce total tax take if someone is genuine about tax reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We intend to abolish the wholesale sales tax. In the last few years, those opposite have doubled their de facto hidden consumption tax and have never paid a cent in compensation. The tax is regressive, it hits low income earners and it causes no remorse whatsoever for the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course this is a matter of concern. That is the reason I went to New Zealand. New Zealand has introduced a goods and services tax. I went to an outer suburb of Wellington, I went to the local parish priest, I went to the Salvation Army, I went to the local accountants and I walked down the main street and talked to people with small businesses. I went doorknocking in a housing commission area outside Wellington and I went to a preschool centre. I asked people the same question: `What do you think about the goods and services tax introduction in New Zealand?'. They said, `It is a fairer, better tax system'. And so it will be when we introduce a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> We will abolish taxes on exports. Blind Freddy can see that we need to boost Australia's export performance to do something about our massive and accumulating debt. It is a joke. The Prime Minister said in here yesterday, `The bush will be opposed to a goods and services tax'. Why then is the National Farmers Federation a strong advocate for this change? The answer is very simple. For starters, we will abolish tax on exports. The Government says, `Let us boost our export performance', but at the same time it has a wholesale sales tax that imposes a penalty on people who are exporting. Something like $1.2 billion is paid in tax on exports. That is a massive millstone around the necks of Australian exporters, the very people we want to encourage. </PARA>
<PARA> For people in rural and provincial Australia, the abolition of the wholesale sales tax will mean the abolition of literally billions of dollars on transport and transport equipment. That will be a massive boost in the arm for rural Australia as a result of our introduction of a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> We will also reduce the effective price of fuel for the person on the land. One of the big costs of running any farm is the cost of fuel. Under us farmers will get a rebate for that proportion which is the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> We will tax foreign tourists. I reckon that is a fair thing. They come out here and use our facilities. Anywhere one goes in the world, foreign tourists make some contribution to the facilities that they use and enjoy. That is the sort of tax system that we will have. </PARA>
<PARA> We will abolish the tax on business inputs. There will be none of the mucking around of the Government in the March industry statement. The Government was looking there at $300m. The total level of intermediate tax business inputs in this country is $5 billion to $6 billion, yet the Government is preening itself for having moved $300m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is going to get rid of the lot, which will be tremendous for business. It will give it a real boost that in the end will mean jobs for people. It will be good for small business as well because it will pick up a cash flow benefit from the introduction of a goods and services tax. The Opposition is going to tax the cash economy. Five years ago the Treasurer himself said that if we really wanted to get into the cash economy, we had to have the guts to introduce a goods and services tax. Sure, it is a tax on spending, but the Opposition is saying, `Let us have a bit of a tax on spending so we can make way for big increases in what people earn, a big reduction in personal income tax.' That would put some incentive back into the tax system and Australians would have the motive and the incentive to drag the economy out of the recession the Treasurer said we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very instructive to go back to 1985. When the Opposition announced this decision originally it put out a booklet entitled, `Why you should vote for a consumption tax, by Paul Keating'. At the nub of the Treasurer's argument then was the personal income tax burden on the average Australian. Basically, the person today on average weekly earnings plus 30 per cent is paying the same marginal tax rate as he was back in 1985, which was the justification for the reform the Treasurer then proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of this overall package the Opposition is going to abolish the capital gains tax. Why is it going to do that? We want to give people incentive to build up their assets, to build up their family wealth, and in turn to build up the productivity base of this country and give it a chance to get out of this recession. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of other advantages: it is a self-policing system; it is efficient to collect; it shores up the income tax system. It will also mean that people will actually know the taxes they are paying. A lot of taxes paid today are hidden taxes. They are part of the Treasurer's trebling of taxes: the man who opposes a consumption tax has actually increased his de facto consumption tax take from $3 billion to nearly $11 billion. It is a huge, ramshackle mess, and a lot of people do not know they are paying it. </PARA>
<PARA> I can tell the Treasurer that by the next election all the people will know exactly what they are paying. As they go into the supermarkets they will understand that virtually half the things going over the scanners are subject to the existing wholesale sales tax. The Treasurer does not pay any tax on his designer suits or the caviar he has for morning tea, but the ordinary average Australian faces a huge tax burden. Look at all the things Australians pay tax on: there is a 20 per cent tax on Palmolive soap; a 30 per cent tax on alarm watches; a 20 per cent tax on Sunsilk; a 20 per cent tax on Kleenex tissues. </PARA>

Australians cannot get out of bed in the morning without paying tax to the Treasurer. They pay a 20 per cent tax on black and white portable television sets. Anybody watching this debate today is paying a 20 per cent tax on the television; if they are listening to it on the radio, they are paying a 30 per cent tax here and now to this man, who has the cheek to say that he opposes a consumption tax. In every school-bag, home, workplace and supermarket in this country Australians pay his wholesale sales tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is broad support for this change. It is not the be all and end all because there is no single solution to Australia's economic problems, but this reform of the tax system as part of a broader tax reform package, as part of a broader economic package, is one of the many things that will turn around this country's economic performance. What narks the Treasurer is that the trade union movement said no to him one night in a motel in Canberra, and the last thing the Treasurer wants to see is the Opposition go on to finish the job. </PARA>
<PARA> After the next election, the Opposition will introduce a goods and services tax; it will cut people's income tax; it will abolish the capital gains tax; it will have a decent compensation package; it will tax the cash economy; it will abolish tax on exports; and it will be good for this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a coincidence that on the day following the day when the consumption tax was debated for one hour in the Liberal Party caucus meeting-where 20 speakers apparently spoke and where the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) urged them not to panic-we have this ham-fisted attempt by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) to promote a goods and services tax-a consumption tax. We saw the confidence which was striking the Opposition backbenchers as they heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition stumble his way through what was supposed to be a convincing expose of why a consumption tax should be introduced. We could see their minds ticking over, saying, `If this is the best we're going to get out there when it really counts, we're in trouble'. They are dead right; they will be in trouble.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first claim the honourable member made was that this Government is a government which is `bloated'. This is a government with outlays at the levels of 1973, a government which has got outlays down to the levels of 20 years ago, with one of the smallest public sectors in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). And it is supposed to be bloated. He said that we are staring down the barrel of a recession. Apparently, he thinks he should make it worse by lifting taxation, thereby cutting disposable income, on a range of goods from food through to building materials-every item and service in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader said that the Government does not have a wages policy. Average weekly earnings for the year came out a couple of weeks ago at 5.1 per cent, in the middle of a boom at 6.5 per cent when employers were seeking to pay 15 per cent wage increases. He made the totally nonsense statement that the Government does not have a wages policy. Then he talked about high interest rates, just as bill rates are nudging 10.5 per cent, which is not by any definition high but is by most definitions low. Then he said that I was the biggest taxing Treasurer and that Australia is a highly taxed country. The truth is that we are the second lowest taxed country in the OECD. We are 0.1, one decimal point, away from being the lowest taxed country in the OECD, which is Japan. We are on the bottom of the list. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader claimed that the Government is bloated, when we are at 1973 outlays levels; we are staring down the barrel of a recession, but he wants to increase the tax; we do not have a wages policy, but we have wages running at 5 per cent of average weekly earnings; we have high interest rates, but interest rates are now down to 10.5 per cent; and we are a big taxing country, but the fact is we are the second lowest in the OECD. This is the sort of absolute arrant nonsense that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition trafficks in. How he can ever believe this sort of rubbish will be persuasive when the weight is on has me beat. Let him go on deceiving himself. He will not even ask me a question. Talk about having me beat; he is so afraid of me, that he will not even ask me a question. The only chance I get to reply to him is when I have to get up to respond to him on a matter of public importance. He will not even ask a question these days. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the Deputy Leader said that the consumption tax was an issue in New South Wales, and had I been in New South Wales I would have known that. He said that if I had been in his electorate I would know that it was an issue. Some time ago I received a letter from the Combined Pensioners Association in Bankstown in my electorate. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>After a great deal of discussion between our members I been asked to write to you regarding the introduction of a consumption tax. We feel it would place a great deal of hardship on the elderly, as well as everyone else, and we wish to state that we totally oppose a consumption tax being introduced. </PARA>

<PARA>Bankstown Branch. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what people in my electorate think of the Opposition's consumption tax. I notice that members of the Opposition are always getting back to the grassroots. We had the Leader of the Opposition saying, `I have to explain things a bit more and spend a bit more time developing techniques to get people at the grassroots to understand'. Back to the grassroots. He said that anyone in New South Wales would know that the consumption tax was an issue. Then the Leader of the Opposition said, `I had, I guess, only particular knowledge of one seat, which was Vaucluse, in which I spend all my time'. Perhaps that is the manicured grassroots, the hand-clipped grassroots. </PARA>
<PARA> A Government member-Out with the workers of Vaucluse. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right-out with the proletariat in Vaucluse! Out with the grassroots! Of course, the honourable member would not know what went on in New South Wales, because he got clobbered. He trundled his consumption tax out, and he got kicked to death; that is the long and short of it. As well as that, he got beaten around in his own party room.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member gets up in the House like a Toltoy-one of those silly things which is knocked over and which bounces back and finds its equilibrium again. He is up in the House today doing his Toltoy number: he can be booted down but-boing, boing, boing-he is back up again with his facile defence of a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Then he said that I would not know what people thought about it, and went on to say that there would be big reductions in personal tax rates. How-when, as has been conclusively demonstrated, even to just compensate taxpayers for the impact of a consumption tax there are no funds left to cut marginal rates of tax? The tax base is so much broader now than it was in 1985. In 1985 there was a thing called the fiscal yield or fiscal dividend. That has gone. Because the tax base is now so much broader, it costs so much more money to compensate for such a measure. That is why, if we were to fully compensate taxpayers and social security beneficiaries for a consumption tax, we would actually reduce the surplus. So this absolute nonsense about how a consumption tax would reduce income tax rates is unbelievable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader then went on to talk about designer suits bearing tax. The fact is that clothing does not bear tax in this country. However, the honourable member would have the same tax on designer suits as on bread. That is his policy. He would tax everything-bread, butter, all the basic essentials of life. He gets up here with these silly questions, these silly points, about whether certain biscuits or certain beverages are taxed. In this country, beverages are taxed, as is confectionery. Just as confectionery is taxed, products that can be regarded as confectionery are similarly taxed. They are not anomalies. It is to avoid an anomaly. Food is not taxed in that sense; that is, meat, vegetables, butter, bread-all the basic things-are untaxed. However, those opposite want to tax them-at the same rate as they would tax cars, suits, television sets, and everything else. They consider that this is the rate that should be put on basic things. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member then went on with this rubbish about things that are taxed in relation to babies. For the record, babies' items which are exempt under the current sales tax arrangements include: food and milk, clothes and footwear, cots, prams, strollers, pushers, bassinettes, cradles, booster seats, safety seats, restraining harnesses, drugs and medicine, medical services and baby blankets-all untaxed. But wait until everyone finds out that their phone bills, doctor's bills, dentist's bills, cab fares and haircuts all carry 15 or 20 per cent tax, the same amount as their bread, their can of baked beans, the bricks for their house and the gyprock for their ceilings. Wait until they are told that all those things carry 15 or 20 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The next time the Toltoy is dragged out to get banged around, it will not come up again. It will be squashed by the weight of public opinion. The back bench opposite know that. They have worked it out. Premier Greiner went in there with the approach: `We are the managers, we can manage-and, by the way, we will have a State income tax, we will have a consumption tax, and at the same time we will give you very high State taxes and charges, but we will manage your affairs for you.' The public said, `No, you won't, we'll manage you'-squash, splat, and a big squelch! Now we find the Liberals saying, `That wasn't much of a strategy. That is now out. Sorry-back to the drawing board; that's out'. The Liberal back bench said yesterday, `Listen, about this strategy'. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, back at the ranch, we have got our friend the professor-who I believe will be one of the Labor Party's great assets-as he starts running through all of these options about the radical program which he has. The consumption tax is just a modest part of this program before he gets onto such things as health vouchers, education vouchers, zero wage increases and a zero inflation rate. We will start to see some of these issues emerge, such as the abolition of the capital gains tax. There is a facile claim that people need the incentive to take their income free if it is in the form of capital, but to be taxed if it is in the form of income. What a nonsense. All the tax avoidance began in the first place by turning income into capital and taking it free. </PARA>

That is how decent pieces of tax law are carried when they are explained and when they are equitable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition wants to remove it-it wants to untax. We have had a property boom and a stock boom over a period of five or six years and members of the Opposition want to take all of those untaxed gains and hand them back free retrospectively. Absolutely billions of dollars worth of tax would be handed back free, while, at the same time, they would tax bread, butter and meat at 20 per cent. Then they would not compensate pensioners; they would let the low income earners carry the burden, while somebody who has stored up capital profits in the tax system unrealised gets them handed back free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely those opposite do not think that our society will cop that kind of unfairness. Do they think the glib silly behaviour that we just saw a few minutes ago from the honourable member for Flinders is enough to put that sort of shabby inequity across? Of course, it will not be. That is why they will be nailed for the party they have always been-a sectional party interested in looking after only the income of the wealthy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I have listened to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) make some most outlandish claims on a range of issues and use emotive rhetoric as his argument. But the real issue in this debate involves what I tried to do at Question Time today; that is, use some concrete examples to illustrate that every single day of our lives we pay sales tax on a huge range of everyday items: taxes ranging from 10 to 20 to 30 per cent. These taxes are hidden in the cost of the goods. They are taxes that the Treasurer does not want to talk about. I think it is about time that the hypocrisy of this Government was revealed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at a cross-section of these hidden taxes. Take, for example, a young couple-let us call them John and Mary-who are about to marry, set up their home and start a family. Before the big day, Mary's parents had sent out printed invitations to the wedding. They paid 20 per cent sales tax on the stationery. I guarantee that none of the guests who gave presents to the young couple had any idea that the paper and curling ribbon they had used to wrap their presents was taxed also at 20 per cent. The family friends who gave them, for example, a tapestry did not know that there was a hidden sales tax of 20 per cent on their purchase; nor on the wall clock, the cost of which included sales tax of 30 per cent. The bridal coronet and veil that Mary wore on her wedding day and her jewellery were taxed at 30 per cent and her make-up and perfume were taxed at 20 per cent. Her bouquet of silk flowers was also taxed at 20 per cent. The satin bows and ribbons on her bouquet and gown were taxed at 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> John, of course, wants to look his best and play the part on this special day, too. His cufflinks, tie clip and collar pins are all taxed at 30 per cent. The dried flower in his lapel was taxed at 20 per cent, as was his leather belt and aftershave lotion. At the wedding reception the bride's father had to pay 30 per cent tax on the alcohol consumed, and the cost of the ice-cream wedding cake included 10 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA> John and Mary are saving to build their own home, so they decided to go on a camping and bicycling honeymoon. The car was taxed at 20 per cent and the bicycles strapped to the car were also taxed at 20 per cent, and the caravan hooked to the car was taxed at 30 per cent. Even the tourist map they had to buy was taxed at 20 per cent. John wanted to ensure their comfort and safety for their camping holiday, so he purchased car accessories, including fog lights, carpet mats and seat covers and paid 20 per cent sales tax. The fruit juice and savoury snacks that they kept in the car were taxed at 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> After their honeymoon John and Mary set about the business of setting up their home. The first room they decided to furnish was the kitchen. They put out a `welcome' doormat and paid 20 per cent sales tax. The vinyl floor covering was taxed at 10 per cent. Their Hoover household appliances and the fridge, freezer and stove were all taxed at 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In trying to save money on joinery costs of built-in cupboards, they decided to buy free-standing cupboards and paid 10 per cent tax. The goods in these cupboards-Morning Fresh detergent, Mr Muscle oven cleaner, Handy Andy and even the pot scourer-were all taxed at 20 per cent. All the cooking utensils, pots and pans, toasters, china, place mats, electric jug, broom, vacuum cleaner and percolator, to name but a few, were taxed at 10 per cent. Even the tins of pet food they kept for their favourite pooch were taxed at 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The screen doors on their home were not included in the package deal from the builder. Ten per cent sales tax was paid on every screen door they added to their home. Of course, they needed a bed, sheets, blankets and towels-10 per cent sales tax was paid on all these items. Cushion covers, laundry bags and mattress covers were all taxed at 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> To celebrate their wedding day, John and Mary, like many other young couples, purchased a photo album for their wedding photos. They paid 20 per cent sales tax on the album and they paid another 20 per cent sales tax on the frame they bought to display their wedding photo. In setting up the bathroom of their home, John and Mary, like all of us, would be horrified to learn the amount of sales tax they paid on everyday items. Toothpaste, toilet paper and tissues are all taxed at 20 per cent; cosmetics, 30 per cent; skin repair lotion, 20 per cent; soap and talcum powder, 20 per cent-as is hair spray, perfume, bath salts and deodorant. Safety and electric razors and hair dryers are all taxed at 20 per cent. Mr Deputy Speaker, you probably would not be aware that even the brass washer in the taps is taxed at 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> John and Mary could not afford to curtain their home all at once-there is 10 per cent tax on continuous curtains and 10 per cent on labour-so they put up blinds, but they paid 10 per cent tax on the blinds as well. This young couple, like many others, could not afford to centrally heat their home, so they used personal heaters. They paid 20 per cent sales tax on those as well. </PARA>
<PARA> On every single item of furniture-lounge suite, occasional tables, lamp stand, bookcase-John and Mary paid 10 per cent tax. However, neither of them realised that when they saved their money to buy the colour television set, radio and compact disc player they would be paying 30 per cent tax on those items and 20 per cent tax on the discs and blank videos. These items would be found in nearly every Australian home. </PARA>
<PARA> When this young couple moved into their new home there was no garden established, so they set about landscaping it themselves. In order to do so, John had to buy some basic equipment. The shovel, rake and wheelbarrow were all taxed at 20 per cent. The plastic trellis and insecticide were also taxed at 20 per cent. He then bought a toolbox and paid 20 per cent sales tax on that, plus he paid 20 per cent on the tools to put in the toolbox. A ladder was 20 per cent and even paintbrushes cost him 20 per cent sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> After both working hard all week to pay the mortgage on their home, they liked to relax at the weekend. John liked to play tennis. He paid 20 per cent sales tax on his racquet. Mary liked to play netball. She paid 20 per cent sales tax on the netball. But the real hobby that they pursued together was photography. They paid 30 per cent sales tax on their cameras, and for every accessory they bought for their cameras they also paid 30 per cent sales tax. Not only were the flashlights that they bought levied at 30 per cent, but also the bulbs used were taxed at 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> They often needed a tripod to set up their shots and they paid 30 per cent sales tax on the tripod. The film they used was taxed at 30 per cent. They liked to develop their photographs themselves. The chemicals and photographic paper they needed to develop these photos cost them 20 per cent sales tax. When they did not develop their own photographs and had them processed and printed, that cost them 20 per cent also. If they wanted to mount any of their shots into a slide mount it cost them 20 per cent sales tax and the cost of the slide viewer was another 30 per cent sales tax. Any magnifier they needed to buy attracted 20 per cent sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Even all cleaning material needed for maintaining their cameras, whether cleaning brushes or cleaning cloth, attracted 10 per cent sales tax. Even the lens tissue cost 20 per cent sales tax. The entire lens cleaning kit was also taxed. If they wanted to frame any of their photos and hang them on the wall, the framing cost them 30 per cent, and the hooks that they used to hang the frame also cost 30 per cent sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This typical young couple that I have used as an example today is paying through the nose on all those items and hundreds more. Is it any wonder that this arbitrary form of taxation has escalated during the reign of this Government from an amount collected in 1983 of $4.9 billion to a massive $10.6 billion in 1990? Taxes are levied at these exorbitant rates but are concealed, so most people have absolutely no idea that they are paying, and they are paying these taxes every day. </PARA>

The honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) chose to trivialise the consumption tax issue, and I would like to take her up on one or two matters. I think it is important that we understand these things. First, all the items she mentioned-the refrigerator, the stove, the freezer, the Hoover, the blankets, the bed, the sheets, the towels-are taxed at 10 per cent at the moment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then please tell us what the level is. It also needs to be understood that an item that costs $10 and has a wholesale sales tax component of 20 per cent has a tax component of $2. If the retail mark-up is 100 per cent, which is relatively standard, then with a 15 per cent consumption tax the consumer pays $3 tax on that item. Those opposite need to understand the mathematics. They need to understand, and people in the community need to understand, that there are a number of items that are taxed already within the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What those opposite are proposing is to tax milk, bread, cheese, fruit, vegetables and meat at 15 per cent. It is lovely to have items such as a motor car and a bicycle, but many people in the community are wondering how they are going to buy their milk, cheese, bread, fruit and vegetables. The fundamental difference is that those opposite are suggesting an increase in the tax impost on people who require these basic necessities. What will they do with the revenue? Hand it to people who do not need it, people who are wealthy. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of their whole tax structure, if they have one, and I doubt it, is that they will remove the capital gains tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I am saying to those opposite quite simply is that for those people who are in between there is a tax reduction. The Opposition was proposing at the last election a situation where there was no tax for those people, retrospectively. It is clear that there should be a tax impost on someone who earns that amount of money. Opposition members are saying they will defray it over time. Why should people not be eligible for that tax liability? If I earn $30,000 in any year, whether it be income from my salary or rent or dividend or a capital gain, then I should have a tax liability. What the Opposition is proposing is the removal of that tax liability. It is indefensible that it should propose that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of this item there are some arguments that can be made for a broad-based consumption tax. Many of us on this side of the House in 1985 took that position. The arguments are in respect of the savings benefits. Across the Tasman we have an example where there has not been an improvement in the savings position of New Zealand as a result of the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax. We cannot draw a cause and effect relationship because of the fact that savings as a percentage have decreased in New Zealand, but what we can say is that since the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax there has been a decrease in savings in that country. If we look at savings as a percentage of gross domestic product, in 1986 the figure was 13 per cent; in 1987, it was 11 per cent; in 1988, it was 12.1 per cent. We do not have figures beyond that. What is very clear is that there was no increase in savings as a result of the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax. So the argument falls down. </PARA>
<PARA> If the tax is to be neutral, by definition there will not be an increase in disposable income, so the savings argument falls through anyway. If it is not to be neutral then one has to argue against the case which says that this is a very unfair and inequitable tax. Opposition members do not want to take up that argument. If they take it up, they cannot say that there is going to be any savings benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> With the cash economy, I think there is a case for a marginal benefit as a result of the introduction of this tax. But we have to look at the way in which the cash economy occurs at the moment. Most of that economy occurs in personal and household services. In those areas, the person who pays the amount does not make a claim against taxation; that is why it is possible to avoid taxation. The person who pays for the service does not make a claim to the Australian Taxation Office and therefore it is possible for the service provider to avoid taxation by being paid in cash. That will not change, whether there is a consumption tax or not. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, if those opposite argue that the system is unfair at the moment because of the wholesale sales tax system, they have to say that some of the people who spend the cash are at least paying some tax because of the wholesale sales tax system: that must be the case. If they introduce a broad-based consumption tax, they are saying that those people will have to pay at least some tax when they dispose of the income. I am saying to them that such people are already paying some. If the Opposition thinks that the benefit is going to be enormously significant then maybe it has a case, but there is no evidence anywhere to suggest that that is going to be the case. That is the argument the Opposition has to put. But that case has not been substantiated and cannot be substantiated. </PARA>
<PARA> Having argued the For case one has to look at the Against case, and that case is significant. If the Opposition's tax policy is going to be part of its total economic strategy, those opposite need to tell me how they are going to get a target of zero to 2 per cent inflation when they increase the consumer price index by about 5 per cent or whatever it is going to be, depending on the level of consumption tax they establish. It will be inflationary. The Opposition's inflation target will go out the window; It will not be able to deliver. One does not need to be top of the class, one does not need to be a professor of economics, to understand the connections that are made there. So if the Opposition's taxation policy is part of its total economic strategy, then it makes no sense. It is logically inconsistent to do what the Opposition is proposing. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem-not the greatest problem, in my view-is what will happen in the future. We saw in the United Kingdom and in New Zealand that as soon as this tax was available governments took the easy option. Rather than expenditure restraint, rather than control over outlays, they took the easy option of increasing the consumption tax when they wanted more revenue. That is something we do not want in this country, and we have done everything possible to reduce outlays. I think the case is very clear. One has only to look at the Budget Papers to see the results. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important issue here is that of fairness. What Opposition members are talking about is taxing people on the necessities. They can stand up in this place and say, `Look at all these things that are taxed at the moment'. The things that are not taxed at the moment are important to people. When we get a haircut or go to the movies or go to the physiotherapist, when we buy bricks or gyprock for the house or pay a cab fare or go to the doctor, none of those things are taxed-but they will be taxed under the Opposition's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> More important than those are the fundamental things. This issue refers to the fundamental need for a consumption tax. I say to those opposite that the fundamental items that everybody needs are things such as milk, bread, cheese, fruit, vegetables and meat. What about the farmers and the freight on goods? All of these items are important. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of Major Explosives Storehouses, Stage 1, at Myambat, New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>The works currently before the House are the first stage of the Army's major explosive storehouse project, or Mesh-P, planned for Myambat, near Denman, in New South Wales. The proposal will initiate the Army's need to store explosives ordnance in earth-covered explosives storehouses in accordance with North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) safety principles. </PARA>
<PARA> Existing facilities at Myambat were constructed during World War II and during the 1960s. The World War II buildings are no longer suitable for the secure storage of ammunition and present a continuing maintenance problem. The 1960s buildings are limited in their capacity to store some explosives under current United Nations-NATO regulations which were introduced after the construction of the buildings. As a result, these existing facilities are not sited to optimise the storage of the most hazardous nature of ammunition. This resulted in Myambat not being able to store significant quantities of Hazard Division 1.1 ammunition. Therefore, the basis of this proposed works is to provide more efficient and suitable storage for explosives, in accordance with the relevant guidelines and improved associated facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed works are located in three designated areas, and these are: the explosives storage area, the non-explosives area and the administration-camp area. Work will be undertaken in each of these three areas, including the construction of new explosives storehouses and upgrading of the access road and railway siding. A new returned produce store, depot store, support building and new accommodation for all ranks will be constructed. </PARA>
<PARA> Phase A will see the minor upgrading of the existing kitchen and mess facilities, pending their replacement in phase B. Associated engineering services will be undertaken, existing water and sewerage services will be upgraded and improved road works will also be included. </PARA>
<PARA> The project is expected to cost $34.4m at October 1990 prices but will be split into two phases. Phase A is estimated to cost $23.4m, and phase B $11m. It is planned to go to tender in June 1991, with completion of phase A taking about three years and phase B a further two years. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report, the Public Works Committee determined that a need exists to provide permanent ammunition storage and living, messing and working accommodation at Myambat, but the Committee raised three specific issues. Firstly, the Committee recommended that the Department of Defence study the costs and benefits of retaining Wallangarra as a second national wholesale ammunition depot and that the results of this study should be passed on to the Committee. The Department of Defence has agreed to carry out additional studies and submit the findings to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Committee recommended that all projects referred to it be analysed to ensure the most efficient use of energy in the completed buildings, and that it receive copies of the results of these analyses. Australian Construction Services will make these arrangements on all future projects for which it has responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Committee recommended that the Department of Defence continue to resolve outstanding issues with Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd. On this matter the Department of Defence has agreed to further examine the matters raised by Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd and to continue negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to thank the Committee and its Chairman, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), for their support, and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Redevelopment of the Singleton Area, Stage 1, New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>This must be stage 1. Singleton Range, near the township of Singleton in New South Wales, was acquired in 1941 and a hutted camp was constructed during World War II. Some existing facilities have been around since the base was first established, whilst other temporary facilities were constructed in 1965.</PARA>
<PARA> From 1965 to 1973, these facilities were used by the 3rd Training Battalion to train national servicemen in recruit and infantry skills. With the ending of national service and the reorganisation of the Army, the infantry centre was relocated to Singleton from Ingleburn to occupy these vacated temporary facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Service personnel at Singleton currently total 434. It is expected that the military strength will not vary significantly in the foreseeable future. Student numbers average 478. However, these numbers vary significantly throughout the training year, dependent upon course programming and availability of staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed redevelopment of the base is aimed at upgrading existing facilities to provide sufficient and appropriate training, working and living accommodation for functions currently undertaken at the base and to clear the way to reorganise Singleton Range by relocating the existing, centralised range infrastructure of small arms ranges and buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> These works form stage 1 of the base redevelopment and will specifically involve the construction of new living accommodation for living-in staff and students, improved training efficiency of depot company working facilities and the construction of new range control facilities on Singleton Range. </PARA>
<PARA> The limit of cost estimated for these works is $29.3m at November 1990 prices. It is planned that the work will go to tender in 1991, with completion of construction expected in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report, the Public Works Committee determined that a need existed to replace existing inefficient training, working and living accommodation which does not meet current standards and that facilities at the Singleton Range need to be relocated to enable best usage of the range training area, but raised the following issues: the Committee recommended that all projects referred to it now as well as in the future be analysed to ensure the most efficient use of energy in the completed buildings, and that it receive copies of the results of these analyses. Australian Construction Services will make these arrangements on all future projects for which it has responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to thank again the Committee and its Chairman, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), for their support, and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

I note that both in the reference to the Public Works Committee and in the Minister's statement today reference is made that service personnel were to currently total 234 in strength and are not expected to vary significantly in the foreseeable future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, I make the observation that the Minister for Defence (Senator Ray) will be making a major statement tomorrow, and I feel that it may have been more appropriate to have delayed this decision for at least a day or two, because we may have to consider the broader implications of base rationalisation in the context of whatever changes may be made in that statement tomorrow. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990, the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990 and the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988. These Acts relate to the provision of superannuation benefits for Commonwealth sector employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Bill does not contain any major new initiatives for the reform of Commonwealth superannuation. Rather, the Bill proposes some changes to bring the 1976 Commonwealth superannuation scheme into line with the occupational superannuation standards; proposes some changes to streamline the administration of the Acts and the schemes; removes some anomalies in the benefit provisions of the current legislation, thereby providing greater equity between members; and makes some drafting amendments to clarify the intention of the existing legislation. Most of the amendments are technical in nature. Most amendments relate to the 1976 Commonwealth scheme, the detail of which is set out in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally speaking, the amount of the benefits is neither increased nor reduced. An exception to this statement would be a potential increase in the amount of the benefit payable when a pensioner or contributor under the 1976 scheme dies leaving behind more than one spouse. Currently, no additional benefit is payable where there is more than one eligible spouse-for example, where a person in a de facto relationship is also supporting a separated legal spouse. The Bill proposes that, where there is more than one eligible spouse, the benefit available for allocation will be calculated by treating the additional spouses as if they were dependent children, subject to the same overall maximum that currently applies to spouses' and children's benefits. Another exception would be amendments to remove the potential for some persons in certain circumstances to receive double benefits in respect of a period of service. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention that there is a small number of provisions that are to be backdated. This has been done to protect the members' interests. An example is the amendment to the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act that enables benefits to be paid directly to the 1990 Commonwealth scheme, rather than going through an industry fund and incurring that fund's charges. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention some changes to bring the Commonwealth schemes into line with the occupational superannuation standards. The Bill proposes the cessation of the cash-in-hand lump sum superannuation retrenchment benefit in the 1976 scheme from 1 July 2000. This amendment has been foreshadowed some time ago. Another amendment to the 1976 scheme resulting from the standards is to provide persons who change employment after reaching their minimum retiring age with the option of postponing receipt of their pension until genuine retirement from the work force. An appropriately adjusted pension would be payable at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasingly Commonwealth authorities are setting up their own superannuation schemes. The authorities usually give their Commonwealth scheme members the option of joining their new scheme. Where employees join the authority scheme, they cease membership of the Commonwealth scheme. Sometimes they join the authority scheme without any benefit for their past membership of the Commonwealth scheme. In the past, they have either been paid a benefit from the Commonwealth scheme or preserved their benefits in the Commonwealth scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The standards do not permit the payment of superannuation scheme benefits to members when there is no change of employment, even though membership of a scheme may have ceased. Therefore, the Bill provides that the 1976 and 1990 scheme members who join an authority scheme authorised by the Minister for Finance in such circumstances are not to receive a cash benefit, but are to receive preserved benefits in the Commonwealth scheme. The normal five-year qualification for preserved benefits in the 1976 scheme will be reduced to one year in such cases. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of amendments have been proposed to simplify and streamline administration and I give some examples. Functions relating to leave without pay and preservation have been transferred from the Minister for Finance to the Board of the 1976 scheme. The administration of the 1976 scheme is split between the Board and the Commissioner, but a transfer of functions to the Board is more consistent with the occupational superannuation standards. A proposed amendment to the Superannuation (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act will mean that notice of certain changes to the ministerial guidelines relating to superannuation schemes set up by Commonwealth authorities does not have to be served on employers not affected by the changes. Other proposed changes bring the administrative procedures under the 1976 and 1990 schemes into line. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, the Bill proposes to replicate in the Superannuation Act 1990 certain provisions in the Superannuation Act 1976. The provisions relate to the bulk transfers of members from the 1990 Commonwealth scheme to a scheme set up by a Commonwealth authority where that new scheme gives credit for past Commonwealth scheme membership. The amendments provide for an orderly transfer of moneys from the superannuation fund of the 1990 Commonwealth scheme to the authority scheme, so that neither transferring nor remaining members are disadvantaged. The provisions also permit payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the authority scheme to help fund benefits in the authority scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In my introduction, I mentioned that some amendments remove anomalies in the legislative provisions. One of the proposed amendments is backdated to 1986. The amendment corrects an anomaly in the provision relating to earnings by invalidity pensioners under the 1976 scheme. Currently, it is possible that a few invalidity pensioners can receive benefits based on one salary, but have the earnings test applied to a much lower salary. The amendment provides that the salary used for benefits is to be used for the earnings test. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment extends the powers of the Commissioner for Superannuation to apportion benefits on the death of a pensioner or contributor under the 1976 scheme. This power is limited to cases where there are dependants from more than one relationship. A discretion to apportion benefits in such cases is the only practical approach. It would be impossible to lay down hard and fast rules to cover every combination of domestic relationships that could exist or arise. This power would also help remove some of the anomalies that can arise under the current legislation. For instance, it is possible for a spouse of a deceased contributor to the 1976 scheme to disentitle children from an earlier relationship who were not living with the deceased contributor. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to a proposed amendment that could be important to those members of the 1976 scheme who are deciding whether to transfer to the 1990 Commonwealth scheme or stay in the 1976 scheme. A benefit classification certificate records the medical conditions existing at entry to the 1976 scheme. Should invalidity retirement or death be connected with one of these conditions, reduced benefits may be payable. In certain circumstances, the Commissioner may be required to issue certificates some time after a person has joined the scheme-for example, where medical reports are misplaced and not discovered until some time after entry. Such certificates, in effect, are issued retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be inequitable for a member to make a decision to stay or transfer on the assumption that he or she does not have a certificate, only to find that a certificate is later issued retrospectively. The Bill proposes a moratorium on the retrospective issue of certificates so that existing members of the 1976 scheme can make their decision with some certainty. The moratorium is to be effective from 1 April 1991. The moratorium does not extend to cases where there has been non-disclosure of the relevant facts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides that the 1976 scheme Board will have the responsibility for setting the rate at which deductions will be made to productivity benefits because of tax paid by the superannuation fund. Productivity contributions are now included in the assessable income of the fund and tax may be payable on that income. Although the nominal tax rate is 15 per cent, the rate of tax may vary from year to year as offsets are allowed against particular components of the fund's assessable income-for example, investment losses. Moreover, taxation payments are not made until after the end of the financial year to which the tax relates, but contributors may leave the scheme before the rate of tax is known. </PARA>
<PARA> To leave the decision on the tax treatment to the Board, which consists of equal numbers of persons appointed from the employer and member side and an independent chair, would be consistent with the occupational superannuation standards which place the day to day decisions of a scheme with the scheme trustees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes amendments to the Superannuation Acts 1976 and 1990 to clarify the arrangements to apply with regard to membership of the Commonwealth schemes. These amendments will ensure the availability of the broadest possible options for persons resuming Commonwealth employment with rights under the 1976 scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the financial impact of the Bill. It is impossible to quantify the financial impact of the proposed amendments. Some amendments have the potential to increase costs, while others may reduce costs. What can be said with some certainty is that any financial impact is likely to be small. This follows from the fact that most of the amendments with financial impact would affect only a small number of persons. </PARA>
<PARA> Those amendments that would tend to increase costs include the moratorium on the issue of benefit classification certificates and the additional pension that may be payable where there is more than one eligible spouse. Savings may result from the removal of the possibility of double benefits. There may be small administrative savings and additional revenue may arise from some further employers being asked to pay a share of the costs of running the schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendment that appears to have the most potential for financial impact is the inclusion in the 1990 scheme of provisions to enable payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund when bulk transfers of members to a separate scheme set up by a Commonwealth authority occur. However, the amendment could not have any financial impact until an authority with staff in the 1990 scheme sets up its own scheme and permits 1990 scheme members to transfer to that scheme and the scheme is approved by the Minister for Finance. Even then, the authority would have made payments to Consolidated Revenue to fund its Commonwealth scheme benefits. It is only appropriate that when an authority provides its own superannuation benefits it gains access to an appropriate share of past moneys paid. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the payments from Consolidated Revenue under such an arrangement are spread out over a long period, possibly up to 40 years, thereby protecting the Budget from any significant short term outlays. I commend the Bill to the House, and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The commencement of the new national companies and securities scheme on 1 January this year marked the completion of the first phase of this Government's program for the reform of corporate regulation in Australia after the excesses of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have in place in Australia a single national regulatory structure that provides an effective framework in which the Government can begin the major task of redressing the damage done to our business reputation and the confidence of investors in our markets during the `decade of greed'. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) under the new national scheme, and the provision by the Government of substantially increased resources for corporate regulation and enforcement by comparison to that which was provided under the former cooperative scheme, is tangible evidence of this Government's determination to overcome these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally as important as the need for the timely and effective enforcement of companies and securities laws is the need for those laws themselves to clearly establish the standards of behaviour that the community is entitled to expect of its corporate directors and managers and market participants. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the legislative framework for the new national scheme was being prepared, I foreshadowed publicly that, following the establishment of the new scheme, the second phase of the Government's corporate reform program would commence. This second phase involves the reform of key areas of law that in the 1980s were shown to be deficient. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill marks the first step in this second and most important phase of the reform of corporate regulation. The major amendments contained in this Bill will bring about the necessary and long overdue reforms to require companies to consolidate their accounts and those of the entities they control and to strengthen insider trading regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes machinery amendments relating to the clarification and re-enforcement of the legislative framework of the new national scheme. The key law reforms contained in this Bill will complement the very considerable law enforcement effort of the ASC to raise the level of compliance with the law and bring about proper standards of corporate and market behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, this Government is committed to an ongoing program of key law reform. This will involve a major review of the substantive companies and securities laws over the next few years. It is an ambitious program. It must be: for too long important law reform was not undertaken under the former cooperative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of laws which establish proper standards of corporate and market behaviour, that are capable of being enforced effectively and that will restore the confidence in the Australian market for both Australian and foreign investors, is essential to our future economic prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of this process, the Government expects later this year to bring forward two further Bills to amend the Corporations Law. The next Bill will deal with a number of important matters. In particular I mention proposals to facilitate shorter settlement periods for share transfers. This will enable the Australian Stock Exchange to improve its efficiency and increase the international competitiveness of our share market. Further amendments will include proposals arising from the review of the Australian company number (ACN) requirement and the clarification of certain aspects of the fundraising provisions. I expect this Bill to be released for public exposure in June this year and to be introduced for passage during the Budget sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> The following Bill, the third in the program for 1991, will contain major reforms in relation to loans to directors and related party transactions, the framework for corporate insolvency, directors' duties and the rights of shareholders. A full process of consultation with business and the community generally will be undertaken in relation to these proposed reforms. To this end I envisage that the third Bill will be released for public exposure during the Budget sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> Having outlined the Government's future program, I now turn to the specific reforms set out in the Bill I am introducing today.There have been widespread abuses of the existing company accounting and reporting requirements under which the true financial position of a group of companies has been able to be disguised by off-balance sheet reporting. This has enabled the financial statements of the company to be manipulated in such a way as to mislead investors and the market generally regarding the real level of liabilities or performance of a company or the group as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> These abuses have been possible because company reporting requirements apply to companies and their subsidiaries. The definition of `subsidiary' has a rather technical meaning in the law which does not reach non-corporate entities. Further, group accounts have not been required to be consolidated, with the result that they can be very difficult to analyse. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the consequences of these practices has been a significant loss of investor confidence, both amongst Australian and overseas investors, in the reliability of corporate financial information in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> To address these problems, the Bill provides for amendments to require that a company's directors must produce a single profit and loss account and balance sheet for all companies and other incorporated or unincorporated entities controlled by that company. The Bill will include a broad definition of control which focuses on the reality of control rather than technicalities. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to reinforce the requirement to comply with accounting standards, and to bring about greater consistency in accounts, a related amendment is to be made to the corporations law. Currently, the law provides that the directors need not ensure that financial statements are made out in accordance with an accounting standard if to do so would fail to give a true and fair view. This has provided the scope for some companies to use some dubious accounting treatments in reliance on the more general, and vaguer, true and fair test, rather than to comply with a relevant appropriate accounting standard. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the amendments, financial statements will have to both comply with the accounting standards and give a true and fair view. In this way the obligations under the law in relation to accounting standards will be brought into line with the obligations under the law applicable to the requirements of schedule 5 of the corporations regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Insider trading has become a matter of increasing concern within the securities industry and amongst the wider community, contributing to the deterioration of public confidence in the securities market more generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs-the Griffiths Committee report Fair Shares for All: Insider Trading in Australia-in November 1989, recommended significant legislative reform and administrative action in relation to the enforcement of the existing insider trading provisions. The Government's response to the report, tabled in Parliament on 11 October 1990, accepted the majority of the Committee's recommendations for legislative amendment, and in December 1990 draft legislation and an accompanying explanatory paper were released for public exposure. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions in this Bill represent the outcome of the Government's consideration of that report in the light of public submissions on the exposure draft. The key elements of the new provisions are as follows. The definition of an `insider' will encompass corporations and partnerships as well as individuals. There will be no need for the prosecution to establish a connection between the person in possession of inside information and the company to which the information relates. Instead, any person, including a tippee, who is in possession of inside information will be prohibited from using it to trade in or subscribe for securities of the company. </PARA>
<PARA> A statutory definition of inside information is to be included, based on a `reasonable person' test. A person will be prohibited from trading in securities whilst knowingly in possession of information that is not generally available and where if it were generally available a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of securities. </PARA>
<PARA> Information will be defined as being generally available where it is disclosed in a manner which would, or would be likely to, bring it to the attention of persons who commonly invest in securities of a kind whose price or value might be affected by the information and where a reasonable period of time for the dissemination of information has elapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> The offence will be extended to trading in prescribed interests, such as units of unit trusts, and other relevant securities. The definition of securities will be clarified to ensure that it includes prescribed interests, options and convertible securities. </PARA>
<PARA> Monetary penalties will be increased to:</PARA>
<PARA> - in the case of a natural person, $200,000, or 5 years imprisonment or both or</PARA>
<PARA>in the case of a body corporate, $1,000,000. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, a body corporate that issues securities will be able to recover any profit accruing to the insider through dealing in those securities. Further, the ASC may bring an action in the name of, and for the benefit of, the body corporate. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed provisions aim to strengthen the law relating to insider trading while at the same time not lessening the basic protections given to the accused under our criminal law. The provisions seek to ensure that legitimate business activity can continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the abysmal failure of insider trading prosecutions, the onus of proof will remain on the prosecution in respect of all elements of the offence, including knowledge that the information is inside information. However, the operation of these provisions will be monitored to see whether they are effective in preventing insider trading and in restoring investor confidence in the securities markets. The futures insider trading provisions are also being reviewed with a view to adopting similar provisions to those proposed for securities in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Other significant amendments to the Corporations Law are proposed to be made in the Bill. To more effectively administer the unit trust industry and other prescribed interest schemes, the ASC will be given additional powers to regulate compliance with trust deeds by managers and trustees. The Bill proposes an amendment which will treat a breach of a covenant of a trust deed as a contravention of the law. However, such a contravention will not amount to an offence. This will enable the ASC to investigate non-compliance with the provisions of deeds and to exercise its powers of civil enforcement where it discovers that such conduct has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> A further proposed amendment will facilitate the maintenance of an accurate ASC information base relating to company officers. It will require the retiring directors, where more than half retire or resign at one time, to notify the ASC of that fact. This will overcome the substantial difficulties created for both the ASC and the former officers which presently arise when a company is in effect `sold', and the incoming directors do not lodge the appropriate forms as they are required to do under the law. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the decision of the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities at its meeting in February 1991, the Bill proposes a statutory moratorium in relation to the requirement for companies to include their Australian company number on their business documents and negotiable instruments. This amendment will further minimise any cost or possible confusion for the business community in relation to the ACN requirement. Companies and bodies will not have to comply with this requirement until after 31 December 1991. There is a corresponding proposed amendment in relation to the Australian registered body number. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains proposed amendments to the Corporations Act and the Australian Securities Commission Act to deal with various machinery, jurisdictional and transitional matters. </PARA>
<PARA> As the functions of the National Companies and Securities Commission have been assumed by the ASC, and the further existence of that body is redundant, the National Companies and Securities Commission Act is to be repealed and the NCSC abolished. The Bill provides for the winding up of the NCSC and the disposition of its assets, rights and liabilities, and will deal with related consequential and transitional matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is to be made for the preparation of a final report and financial statements, and the vesting of former assets of the NCSC in the ASC or the Commonwealth, as appropriate. These machinery provisions deal with the legal ownership of NCSC assets and liabilities. They do not affect the joint commitments by the Commonwealth and the States under clause 31 of the heads of agreement to share financial responsibility for the liabilities of the NCSC, nor do they affect the obligation of the Commonwealth to account to the States for half the value of NCSC assets calculated in accordance with the heads of agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 9 of the Corporations Act is to be amended to confer cross-vested jurisdiction under the Corporations Law on the Family Court of Australia and the Family Court of Western Australia. The amendments will restore to the family courts the jurisdiction those courts had in relation to matters arising under companies and securities legislation immediately prior to the commencement of the Corporations Law on 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the introduction of the Corporations Law, the family courts had jurisdiction to deal with matters under the cooperative companies and securities legislation by virtue of the general scheme for the cross-vesting of jurisdiction for Australian courts. However, the Corporations Act excluded the general cross-vesting scheme and replaced it with a special regime for the vesting and cross-vesting of jurisdiction between the Federal Court and the State and Territory courts on Corporations Law matters under which all those courts have full coordinate jurisdiction under the Law. </PARA>
<PARA> In the present Bill, the approach has been taken to give the family courts the same status under the Corporations Law as they had under the general cross-vesting legislation in relation to jurisdiction under the former companies and securities codes. The family courts will be subject to requirements to transfer Corporations Law matters to other courts in accordance with provisions which follow closely the general jurisdiction of courts cross-vesting legislation. This will enable the family courts to deal with Corporations Law matters when they arise in an ancillary way in relation to family law proceedings. A family court will be able to transfer a case to any appropriate State supreme court or the Federal Court of Australia having jurisdiction under the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the federalising approach of the legislation. Various amendments are proposed to the provisions of the Corporations Act to make more explicit and clarify, in relation to the national scheme laws applying in the Australian Capital Territory, the `federalisation' formula under the State application Acts. That legislative device is the mechanism by which the Commonwealth laws relating to the investigation and prosecution of offences, and the review of administrative decisions, apply to matters arising under the State corporations laws and ASC laws as if those laws were Commonwealth and not State laws. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to commencement and the application of certain changes. One further feature of the Bill that it is appropriate to mention concerns the amendments contained in the Bill that are proposed to commence from the date when the new national scheme began operation. The purpose of providing retrospective application for these amendments is to provide commercial certainty by avoiding the possibility of an unexpected and/or unnecessary loss of rights, or the imposition of additional liabilities, on the business community and other persons. This is particularly the case in respect of those provisions which are intended to put beyond doubt that no substantive change in the law occurred on 1 January 1991, such as the provisions in the Bill recognising the national effect of the registration of company charges under the corporations law of a jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amending provisions to commence on 1 January 1991, such as those amendments relating to the legislative machinery of the new national scheme, reflect corresponding provisions in the State application law and seek to reinforce the valid national operation of the new scheme, or make explicit what was intended to be implicit in the operation of the new national scheme laws when they came into force on 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining provisions of the Bill propose various technical and clarifying amendments and make minor drafting corrections to the Corporations Act, the Corporations Law and the ASC Act and ASC law. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the arrangements under the heads of agreement relating to the new national scheme, members of the Ministerial Council for Corporations have been fully consulted on the Bill. Some members of the Ministerial Council made specific comments on the draft Bill. The Bill was also refined in the light of comments from the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee and its various subcommittees, and the Australian Accounting Standards Board. Following consideration of the comments from the Council and others, a revised draft Bill was circulated to the members of the Council, which has now voted to approve the Bill in the form in which I am introducing it today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill marks the first step under the new scheme on the path to restoring our international business reputation. The Bill will assist in establishing a corporate and market environment in which business and investors may carry out their essential activities and prosper with confidence in the stability and fairness of that environment. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Foreign Judgments Bill will provide a framework for the enforcement of foreign civil judgments in Australia by a simple registration process. This Bill will replace existing State and Territory legislation governing registration and enforcement of foreign civil judgments in State and Territory supreme courts. It will also implement arrangements agreed with New Zealand as part of closer economic relations, and an agreement entered into with the United Kingdom last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Having Commonwealth legislation rather than separate State and Territory laws will provide greater efficiency in negotiating and implementing arrangements with other countries for enforcement of judgments and will permit better use of resources. The introduction of Commonwealth legislation has received general support from State and Territory Ministers. Consultative arrangements that have been developed between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories will continue. The Commonwealth will consult the States and Territories before entering into any arrangement with another country for enforcement of civil judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> At present foreign judgments can be enforced in Australia either by bringing an action at common law based on the judgment or by registering the judgment in a State or Territory supreme court or State or Territory law. Most State and Territory laws providing for enforcement of foreign judgments are substantially uniform, being based on the United Kingdom Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933. </PARA>
<PARA> The uniform legislation is based on the principle of reciprocity. It provides for registration in the supreme court of a State or Territory of money judgments given by the superior court of a foreign country to which the legislation is applied. The legislation may be applied by instrument with respect to a foreign country where that foreign country gives substantial reciprocity of treatment to judgments of the relevant State or Territory supreme court. </PARA>
<PARA> A judgment is not registrable under the uniform legislation unless it is final and conclusive, is for a sum of money-other than a sum in respect of a revenue debt, fine or other penalty-and is enforceable by execution in the foreign country. Once registered, a judgment has the same force and effect for the purposes of execution as if the judgment had been originally given in the registering court. </PARA>
<PARA> The uniform legislation contains safeguards which enable registration of a judgment to be set aside in certain circumstances. These include an inappropriate assertion of jurisdiction by the foreign court, public policy and registration in contravention of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is based on the legislative scheme reflected in the uniform State and Territory legislation. The problem with the current scheme has not been the legislation itself but rather the multiplication of effort involved in implementing and keeping arrangements up to date under the various State and Territory laws. Under the current scheme there is invariably a long delay in implementing arrangements in all jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA> Other problems that have arisen with a scheme based on State and Territory legislation are lack of uniformity in the arrangements made with other countries and lack of capacity adequately to deal with judgments of Australian Federal courts. Commonwealth legislation will facilitate negotiations, enable satisfactory arrangements to be made for judgments of all Australian superior courts, increase efficiency and reduce resource needs. At the same time, the State and Territory supreme courts will continue their role under the present law for enforcement of foreign judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will widen the scope of the judgments enforceable under the current uniform scheme. In addition to providing for the enforcement of money judgments of foreign superior courts, the Bill provides for:</PARA>
<PARA> - enforcement of judgments of foreign inferior courts where the foreign country provides reciprocal treatment for Australian inferior court judgments-agreements on this have been reached with New Zealand and the United Kingdom;</PARA>
<PARA> - enforcement of foreign non-money judgments-for example, injunctions-also on the basis of reciprocity, by registration in the same manner as money judgments agreement on this has been reached with New Zealand, and</PARA>
<PARA> - enforcement of New Zealand revenue judgments, including penalty components of such judgments, in the same manner as civil money judgments. Revenue debts include income tax, capital gains tax and customs duty. </PARA>
<PARA> Considerations of justice, convenience, greater certainty in international transactions and comity between nations show the desirability of the scheme reflected in this Bill. With the increased mobility of persons and money across borders, the need for, and benefits of, an effective capacity to enable a judgment given in one country to be enforced against assets in another country are obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is a good example of the efficiencies that can be achieved through Commonwealth, State and Territory cooperation in allocation of functions. While the Commonwealth legislation will replace State and Territory legislation, the States and Territories will still be directly involved through the consultative process on proposed arrangements with foreign countries and in the continued enforcement of foreign judgments in their courts. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not expected that this Bill will have a significant financial impact. The Bill will permit some resource savings for the Commonwealth, States and Territories by removing multiplication of effort involved in each State and Territory having to implement arrangements under its own law. In the short to medium term, savings at the Commonwealth level will be offset by the need to bring existing arrangements under the Commonwealth Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and table the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill will amend several Acts within the Attorney-General's portfolio. The Bill contains amendments which are of a minor policy nature or which correct existing legislation. None of the amendments concerns major new policy proposals or sensitive policy issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments will not have a significant financial impact. The proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Legal Aid Act 1977 are expected to lead to savings of the order of $15,000 per year. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 will permit the Trade Practices Commission to charge for material published by it. It is estimated this will result in revenue of $33,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. I intend to confine my comments to the more noteworthy amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> A provision is to be inserted into the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 to provide that where a State or Territory law alters the name of a body or of an office, a reference in the Commonwealth Act to the body or office under the old name shall be construed as a reference to the body or office under the new name. The amendment will overcome difficulties which recently arose where the name of a State Crime Commission referred to in a Commonwealth Act was altered by State legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment will also be made to allow a board member of a statutory body to participate at board meetings by telephone, closed-circuit television and other modern electronic means of communication. Several Acts already make provision for this form of participation. The amendment will remove the need to enact such provisions in individual Acts, and overcome the problems which arise if members are precluded from participating in board meetings unless physically present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will repeal provisions in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Family Law Act 1975 and the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, requiring estimates of receipts and expenditure to be approved by the Attorney-General before moneys appropriated can be spent. These provisions are not necessary, as the Tribunal and courts operate under the Department of Finance ledger system, whereby the funds appropriated are controlled and released by the Department of Finance in accordance with validated claims submitted by each agency. Such claims must be in accordance with Finance regulations and directions. The issue of funds is also in accordance with the running cost splits separately identified in the Budget papers. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1933 will clarify the current provision dealing with proceedings related to the winding-up of companies. The revised provisions will make it clear that the powers given to the Master and the Registrar in relation to winding-up proceedings may be exercised interchangeably between the Master and the Registrar. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the ASIO Act will bring procedures for the handling of warrants relating to postal articles into conformity with the procedures for the handling of warrants relating to telecommunications and will place the Australian Capital Territory in the same position as the States and the Northern Territory so far as the performance by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation of its functions is concerned. The Bill also includes other amendments of a consequential nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment to the Bills of Exchange Act 1909 will remove the provision for adding three extra days, known as `days of grace', to the maturity date of bills of exchange that are not payable on demand. This practice, which allows extra time for payment of a bill of exchange or promissory note, is out of step with general international practice. The proposed amendment will bring Australian law into line with similar provisions under United Kingdom and New Zealand law. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Commonwealth Legal Aid Act 1977 have a twofold purpose: first, to abolish the National Legal Aid Representative Council; and second, to amend the Act to enable a further member to be appointed to the National Legal Aid Advisory Committee (NLAAC). </PARA>
<PARA> The Council, a 20-member body, was established administratively in September 1987, and given a statutory basis by the Commonwealth Legal Aid Amendment Act 1988. The Council is one of two advisory bodies established by the Act, the other being the NLAAC, a seven-member body of persons possessing particular expertise relevant to legal aid policies and programs. The Council was created to give representatives of major legal aid providers and consumers a forum for discussion and to enable them to provide advice to the responsible Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past three years, both bodies have been responsible for advising the Minister on legal aid matters. However, while the NLAAC meets about five times a year, the Council only meets once a year. The three occasions on which the Council has met have shown that it is not an effective body. Its continued operation, at a cost of approximately $20,000 per year, is an unjustified duplication of effort, given the role of the NLAAC. In July 1990, the NLAAC presented a detailed report on a two-year review it had conducted of legal aid programs and policies. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report, the NLAAC has recommended that there be regular national and international legal aid conferences at which a wide range of interested organisations, groups and individuals could discuss legal aid issues. Such conferences would provide a more effective forum for exchanging ideas and developing new policy proposals than the Council. The other amendment will expand the NLAAC to eight members, thereby broadening the relevant expertise and experience of its members. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments to the Statutory Declarations Act 1959 will simplify the processes for witnessing statutory declarations and provide a more accessible service to members of the public and business community by broadening the categories of persons able to witness statutory declarations. The amendments will also remove the requirement for the Attorney-General, or his delegate, to make appointments as a commissioner for declarations. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 will authorise the Trade Practices Commission to make charges and impose fees in certain areas of its activities, thereby improving the Commission's revenue base and providing a means for the utilisation of the user pays principle in relation to some of the Commission's activities. The amendments will authorise the Commission to make charges in relation to the supply of material it publishes in the course of carrying out its functions or exercising its powers. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will also enable regulations to be made permitting the Commission to make charges or impose fees in relation to a person's attendance at or participation in an activity arranged by or on behalf of the Commission, such as a seminar, the provision of prescribed discretionary services by the Commission, such as providing a speaker at conferences, and the making of an application for an authorisation or the giving of a notification to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments to the Law Officers Act are to ensure that a pension will be payable to a Solicitor-General who has served in that office for at least seven years. The Act currently provides that a pension is only payable to a Solicitor-General who has served at least seven years and who has not been reappointed at the end of his or her term of office. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is an omnibus Bill amending five Acts administered within the Transport and Communications portfolio. While none of the proposed amendments are highly significant, they are important for the functions of the portfolio. Details of the amendments follow. </PARA>
<PARA>Civil Aviation Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation Act and regulations contain numerous offence provisions. There is, however, no clear articulation in the legislation of the powers of investigators when they are investigating alleged breaches of the legislation. One of the ramifications of this has been that recently prosecutions for alleged dangerous goods offences were unable to proceed because of doubt regarding the extent of the search and seizure powers of investigators. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, in its second report on air safety regulation, the Air Safety Regulation Review Task Force expressed concern that the powers of investigators were not clearly set out in the Act and recommended that the Act be amended accordingly. The amendments proposed to the Act will provide investigators with adequate and clearly defined powers. These will be subject to strict safeguards to protect the rights of individuals against whom the powers may be exercised. The safeguard provisions proposed by this Bill are in line with similar provisions found in other Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 98 is also to be amended in order to clarify the power to make regulations dealing with the Authority's powers in respect of the preparation and approval of various technical documents specified in the Bill. The Bill also allows for the making of regulations via the adoption of instruments, or other documents, as in force at a particular time or from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> A major effect of these amendments will be to ensure that a person selecting a particular system of aircraft maintenance will comply with subsequent changes to the system as determined by the aircraft manufacturer or the Authority to be necessary in the interests of safety. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act provides that, where assets are transferred from the Commonwealth to the Authority, the Minister administering the Act and the Minister for Finance may determine the value of assets as on the day of transfer and may determine an amount which is deemed by the Act to be a loan from the Commonwealth to the Authority. On 20 June 1988, a determination was purported to be made determining the value of assets intended to be transferred to the Authority on 1 July 1988, the date when the Authority began operations, and the loan in respect of those assets. The Attorney-General's Department subsequently advised that this determination is invalid, as a consequence of technical deficiencies in the procedures originally used to transfer the assets. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill allows the Minister to now make a valid determination of the value of those assets at the values set in their determination of 20 June 1988. This action is intended merely to affirm the Authority's initial capital structure.</PARA>
<PARA>Federal Airports Corporations Act 1986</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Airports Corporation Act is to be amended to make airport security a function of the Corporation. It will also be a function of the Corporation that it be responsible for the provision of aviation security safeguards at all Federal airports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to rationalise responsibilities for airport security by making airport operators, including the Federal Airports Corporation, responsible for counter-terrorist presence, overall access control and security of the air side areas of airports. </PARA>
<PARA> In making this decision, the Government had two main objectives in mind. The first was to provide a single point of responsibility for security at each airport. The second was to ensure that there was a cost discipline on the provision of security measures, particularly in relation to counter-terrorist first response presence. I consider that the airport operator is in the best position to integrate the various security functions at the airport and to ensure cost effective delivery of security services. Airport operators will be required to ensure that the aviation security functions are performed to minimum standards being developed by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1 July 1991, the Corporation becomes subject to income tax and its taxation year will be 1 July to 30 June. Consequently, this Bill will change the Corporation's financial year from one ending 31 March to one ending 30 June. This amendment will preclude the Corporation from having two balance dates each year, one for statutory financial reporting purposes and one for taxation purposes, being just three months apart. </PARA>
<PARA> If the two years did not coincide, there would be significant inefficiencies and a substantial increase in costs to the Corporation owing to it having to duplicate many of its financial and administrative, accounting and reporting functions. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act enables Australia to adopt the three recent amendments to the Annex to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973. These amendments also substantially increase the level of penalties for pollution offences and will allow summonses to be served on the master, owner or agent of a ship when prosecuting such an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as the above amendments, the Bill will make some minor amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1988, the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986, the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment making the Federal Airports Corporation responsible for airport security at and in relation to Federal airports will save the Government $15.9m in each financial year. The other amendments will have no effect on Government revenue or expenditure. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>The Bill also makes minor procedural and technical changes to the Act and deletes obsolete provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of local roads funds, the Special Premiers Conference of October 1990 decided that funds for local roads would be untied and paid to local governments, or to State governments where they are responsible for local roads, via general purpose grants. The decision indicated that funds would be paid at the same real level as at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Following consultation with local government and the States, the Government has agreed on the means by which it will give effect to the Special Premiers Conference decision. It will introduce interim arrangements for 1991-92 under which:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) local roads funds would be untied and the bulk of funds currently provided for local roads under the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 will be provided as general purpose assistance under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) an additional $296.1m in base funding for councils will be provided under the latter Act in the 1991-92 financial year. This figure represents an adjustment of 1990-91 funding levels for inflation, with funds to be further adjusted in 1991-92 and subsequent years in line with existing general purpose grants;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) existing State distributions will be maintained and intercouncil distributions will be in accordance with relevant principles currently operative under the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988. Of the additional $296.1m in base funding, $272.7m relates to funds that will be provided to councils using a formula based on population and road length and $23.4m relates to funds that will be provided to councils on the basis of an assessment of special works needs; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) in the case of moneys allocated to both local government and the States, the former local roads funds would be separately identified within general purpose assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>The interim arrangements will provide a period of stability while consultations proceed with local government and the States on the detailed arrangements to apply in 1992-93 and beyond. The Government expects to decide on the longer term arrangements by the end of 1991 following further consultations with local government and the States and following consideration of a wide range of options. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I want to stress that the arrangements we are proposing in relation to local road funding have been developed with the full cooperation, assistance and advice of local government through the Australian Local Government Association. I place on record my appreciation of this local government contribution and note that it is a practical reflection of the aspirations for a more effective partnership between the Commonwealth and local government that both spheres of government are seeking to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major objective of the Bill is to adjust the funding formula in the Act to account for the transfer of the debits tax base to the States and Territories, with effect from 1 January 1991. The reduction in general revenue assistance to the States to compensate for the transfer of the debits tax base would have, under the current funding formula, the effect of reducing general purpose grants to local government. The Bill provides for the effect of the transfer to be disregarded in 1990-91 when calculating local government funding entitlements. In the absence of any remedial action, the consequential reduction in general purpose grant entitlements for local government would be $9.1m in 1990-91 and $21.8m in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for legislative changes to the Act to accommodate changes in funding arrangements with the States highlights the need for more flexible provisions to be included in the legislation to cover contingencies of this type. The current formula allows the Government no flexibility to vary the level of payments to local government as a result of changes to the basis on which payments to the States are made. </PARA>
<PARA> Such changes have been required in each of the previous two years-in 1988-89 because identified health grants were discontinued, and in 1989-90 because of the transfer of payments under the State Government Loan Council program to the Commonwealth-State housing agreement-and now a further change is necessary in respect of the debits tax base. The Special Premiers Conference reforms could also require further changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The third major objective of the Bill therefore is to provide the Treasurer with the discretion to set the level of general purpose assistance to local government at a level consistent with the underlying growth in general purpose payments to the States. This is the outcome intended under the existing funding formula. The Treasurer would be able to make adjustments to reflect changes in the classification of payments or in the distribution of expenditure responsibilities and revenue powers to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer would consult me in making the determination of the funding adjustment factor and the Bill requires that a copy of the determination is to be delivered to State and Northern Territory Treasurers, including an explanation of the use of any discretion. I would of course ensure that local government was also advised of any changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth and final major objective of the Bill is to extend to local government the same commitment announced by the Treasurer at the June 1990 Premiers Conference that general revenue assistance to the States be maintained in real terms for the next three years, that is, 1991-92 to 1993-94. That commitment was conditional upon its not applying if Australia were to experience a major deterioration in its economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Existing arrangements under the Act effectively provide local government with close to a real terms guarantee with approximately 97 per cent of the funding formula linked to the level of general revenue assistance to the States. However, general purpose capital payments which currently comprise the balance of the funding formula have been nominally fixed in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill therefore proposes that a new set of comparable grants for the States, including the Northern Territory, be defined for the purpose of calculating the factor by which local government grants change. The Bill makes provision for the movement in general purpose assistance to local government to be directly linked to the movement in general revenue assistance to the States and Northern Territory. This move would greatly simplify the funding arrangements with local government and provide greater certainty in funding for the next three years. The financial impact of the changes proposed in the Bill are relatively minor. </PARA>
<PARA> As already outlined, establishing a direct link between the movement in general purpose assistance to local government and the movement in general revenue assistance to the States and the Northern Territory will effectively provide local government with a real terms funding guarantee for the next three years. The estimated cost of this move is $0.9m in 1991-92 and $1.9m in 1992-93. This results primarily from the removal from the funding formula of the non-indexed general purpose capital assistance payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes that we are proposing will simplify the administration of the legislation and will provide benefits for local government. They reflect the importance which this Government attaches to the role of local government in our Federal system of government. They are another measure in a long list of measures which successive Hawke Governments have taken to strengthen the capacity and raise the status of local government. They are measures which, when combined with the very positive developments that are continuing to occur in local government in a wide range of areas, can only lead to a better local government in this country. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="4225" SPEAKER="Lloyd Mr B." NAMEID="2E4" PARTY="NP" ELECTORATE="MURRAY">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Export Control Amendment Bill 1991 indicates that the Government is slowly and hesitatingly trying to make export establishments responsible for much of their own export inspection through quality assurance programs. This is supposed to ensure that the number of inspectors and, therefore, costs are reduced. While there has been some improvement in a small number of establishments, the change to self-regulation is stalled in bureaucratic and union red tape.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Once again, it raises the question: to whom does the Government give consideration or have responsibility in this matter? As always with this Government it seems to be to unions and unionised labour and not to whom it should be; that is, the producers of the product that is exported or the exporters. The attempt to have the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) look at its own structure has failed. I commend the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths)-at the urging of the industry and the Opposition-for instigating an independent inquiry, but it has only been given a month to carry out its work. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will be supported by the Opposition because it recognises that with self-regulation there is a need for exporters to be penalised for making false statements. There is a need for significant penalties so that standards are maintained. The Bill makes it an offence for an inspector to receive goods or services from registered establishment owners; legalises the issue of health certificates-even in cases where the importing country does not insist on them-which are often used as an aid to trading to prove that the product meets the requirements for domestic consumption and to obtain payment; clarifies the ability to remit fees as well as collect; and removes references to monetary penalties for offences where terms of imprisonment are also provided, allowing the Crimes Act to be used to convert the term of imprisonment into a monetary penalty where the court so requires. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been forced to make it an offence for an inspector to receive goods or services from abattoirs, mainly because meat inspectors have been taking gall stones. One could say that this is particularly galling to the abattoir owners. It is claimed that these gall stones are an aphrodisiac which sell in Asia for about $2,000 a kilogram. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, many proprietors have had to stand by and let inspectors take them because, if challenged, the inspectors would find some way of getting even with the abattoir owner. In those circumstances, it is not uncommon for meat to be condemned as a way of getting even. </PARA>
<PARA> This is just one of the reasons why there is a need for major restructuring of the export inspection service of AQIS, instead of just tinkering around the edges. In saying that, I am not, as such, being critical of AQIS. It has a dual role: the quarantine role and departmental responsibility for export inspection. For a variety of reasons and over a period of years, the present structure has developed. In some comments that I will make later, I will show just how bureaucratic that has become. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision by the Government in the last Budget, for its own budgetary reasons-I believe that this was not at the instigation of AQIS-to move to 100 per cent cost recovery on export inspection has changed all the rules of the game. Everybody who is in export inspection has to understand that. Of the total budget of AQIS-about $170m-export inspection is $132m, so it is the major cost factor. That $132m is being completely paid for by producers and exporters who have no accountability whatsoever of the efficiency of that expenditure of their money, particularly at a time of very low rural income. That has become a very urgent consideration. I acknowledge that the Minister, following the budgetary announcement to move to 100 per cent cost recovery from 1 January this year, did instigate that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> To my knowledge, it is the most expensive system in the world of export inspection in relation to who pays; that is, the producers and the exporters. In some countries-for many years this was the situation here-it was seen to be a public health responsibility, so the exporter paid nothing, or it is seen to be assistance to exporters and, therefore, there is still not a requirement for them to pay. New Zealand has implemented an accountable system. Its costs for fish inspection are now 72 per cent lower-that is, the cost to the exporter-than the fee charged in Australia. So the indication there is very clear. What has been a situation in the past cannot be allowed to continue in the future. If this Government does not do it properly, the coalition Government will. </PARA>
<PARA> The position has been generally adopted-and this goes back to beyond the 100 per cent cost recovery requirement-that there is a need for corpor- atisation, so that there is a better accoun- tability and efficiency in this service, but also a need still to maintain, generally, an on-line system. Presumably, in the creation of a more efficient and accountable system, there is a need to remove the unnecessary inspectors that are there now; and during the period of the 50 : 50 cost recovery situation that was introduced by the Labor government in an earlier period, that was the general coalition position; that is, to move for corporatisation and greater accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> But one has to ask the question now: is that still adequate? Is it enough? Will it provide the efficiency that is required? The answer, from the coalition point of view, is that the whole system needs changing and that more has to be done. This is the view not only of the Opposition but also of abattoir owners, the meat industry and, in particular, the Chairman of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, Dick Austen. He is the most senior man in the meat industry in Australia today. Of course, meat inspection is easily the most significant part of that $132m-I think it is about $100m for meat inspection out of the total of $132m for export inspection. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Austen was quoted recently in some rural papers, following a meat and allied trades conference in Canberra, about changes to meat inspection. I want to quote from a letter he wrote to the Land newspaper following the reports of what he said in the paper. I am quoting exactly what he said, not what he was reported to have said. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have never advocated the abolition of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. </PARA>
<PARA>My comments relating to meat inspection came at the end of a speech to industry people attending the Australian Meat Industry Convention. In the lead-up to my comments, I had praised the industry for its efforts in taking over management of quality assurance procedures through AUS-MEAT. </PARA>
<PARA>I expressed the view that health and hygiene matters, currently under the auspices of AQIS, could in time be managed by individual meat processing companies, monitored by AQIS. AUS-MEAT provides the model. </PARA>
<PARA>As Resources Minister Alan Griffiths correctly points out in the article-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the article that was published in the Land-</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's overseas customers have strict demands on health and hygiene for which AQIS has responsibility. The negotiation of self-regulation monitored by AQIS would be a lengthy process with these customers. </PARA>
<PARA>My comments were intended to stimulate debate about the inevitable move to self-regulation within the meat industry. It is only self-regulation that will impose the necessary disciplines, cost-effectiveness and customer-orientation within the industry. In making these comments, it was not my purpose to criticise AQIS as an organisation or its employees. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian meat and livestock industry has made substantial gains in recent years in raising its quality standards and practises. The industry is mature and responsible enough to extend its self-regulation to health and hygiene but this must be done in a realistic way, involving the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service. </PARA>
<PARA>No-one is saying that AQIS should be abolished. What is being said, in the words of Mr Austen, is that we do have to get rid of the unnecessary middle management and bureaucracy, and industry must itself have a basis of self-discipline and self-promotion. </PARA>
<PARA> The aim should be for abattoirs to employ their own quality control inspectors. They should be government qualified meat inspectors. Most of them would, or could, be the same people who are employed by AQIS today. In this way, we could have a very positive solution, because the inspectors themselves would be better paid, with a more responsible job as a company quality controller. Honourable members should recall that at the moment the abattoir pays $65,000, but inspectors receive only $30,000. The rest is lost to the bureaucracy. It would mean a reduction in cost to abattoirs and growers, resulting in a more competitive product to overseas markets. More exports would lead to more export income and a better Australian trade performance and lower overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, this does not mean an end to government inspection, which is required for many of our markets, but it would result in the export inspection section of AQIS consisting of a small group of highly qualified inspectors who had the right and the responsibility to visit any abattoir at any time and randomly check both the abattoir and the work of the company inspectors. Naturally, there would be penalties and they would have to be very severe. That is the reason, as I have said earlier, that we are supporting this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> That raises the question: where does this put corporatisation? I am worried that if we do go the corporatisation route that will be seen as an end in itself and will not really achieve the efficiency-and, for that matter, the better standard of quality control-that needs to be there. If we have that on the way then it is harder to move on to the ultimate, and it is better to move all of that inspection service, or as much as possible, out of the government sector and into the company self-regulation sector, and then leave with AQIS-with those check inspectors who would remain with AQIS-that ultimate responsibility for overseas market requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I mentioned the problems of how bureaucratic the export inspection service has become. Now I want to detail that charge. Of 1,654 meat inspectors there are 1,249 who are directly engaged in inspection services at a particular time. That means that there are always 405 inspectors, 25 per cent, not engaged in inspection. Of this number, 87 inspectors are deemed to be surplus to requirements. A further 155 are estimated to become surplus within the next two years. On top of that there are 162 inspectors who provide relief for those on holidays, sick leave, et cetera. To cover the cost of these inspectors who do not earn a direct recovery from the industry, a figure of $14,200 is loaded on every working inspector. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand-and I am quite happy to be corrected on this, as I am on anything else I have said-that once an inspector becomes surplus, that does not mean to say that he is no longer on the payroll, because it can take a long time for him to be removed from the payroll. I would be interested to know how many actually have been removed from the payroll who have been declared surplus. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently, in answer to a question from my colleague, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), the Minister admitted to 63 meat inspectors still being stationed at towns where abattoirs have been closed, some for as long as five years. I put out a press release drawing attention to this. That received a certain amount of attention, particularly from some of those meat inspectors, who rang up and were pretty unhappy. I guess that is fair enough. They said some interesting things. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will leave out the colourful parts. They said that all of these meat inspectors are fully employed and are working in other abattoirs as relief inspectors. To prove the point-and the Minister has given information-the travelling allowance for these inspectors amounted to $811,621 in 1989-90. For example, some Bendigo inspectors have told me that they have all had at least two interstate trips to places like Geraldton in Western Australia for 13 weeks at a time, and what a hardship that has been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why, when there is a surplus of so many inspectors and when 162 inspectors are provided for relief, did they have to go anywhere? If one assumes a modest average of $100 a day for each of these inspectors to cover travel and accommodation, it works out at 128 days of work per inspector for 1989-90. Surely, even in the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service that is not full time. Even if it was full time, that begs the real question: why do we continue to employ these people when there are surplus inspectors and when I have been advised-I am quite happy to be corrected-that they refused relocation assistance when the abattoir closed down? Surely they cannot have it both ways. They cannot refuse relocation, and then continue on in employment and run up this additional cost for less than full time employment. It seems to me a bit like somebody who wants to be a beach inspector but wants to live at Wagga rather than along a beach. It cannot continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I get plenty of examples of the problems, and one has to acknowledge that in any system, whether it is an inspector or an abattoir owner, there are going to be people who are not pulling their weight or returning their income or being completely honest all the time. I shall detail three recent examples that have come to me. One from the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association came in a couple of days ago. It reports on the abattoir at Alice Springs, which slaughters 10,000 cattle a year. With the new meat inspection fee from next month, that will cost $67,154, or $6.70 per beast. As the average weight is 190 kilograms, that means a cost of 3 1/2c per kilogram of carcass weight. </PARA>
<PARA> In the letter to the Cattle Council, the Northern Territory Association says that two weeks ago the meat inspector told management early in the week he would be crook on Friday. He presumably had it worked out well in advance when he would be crook. An inspector was flown up to Alice Springs from Adelaide, stayed a few days, and then went home as the local inspector was not crook after all. All the cattlemen know they are paying for this. But it does not stop other costs or charges for each working inspector to cover the following: field administrative expenses at $5,432; training expenses, $101; superannuation at 15 per cent of base salary, $4,769; Comcare premiums at 54 per cent of base salary, $1,833; leave loading at 1.5 per cent of base salary, $477; regional office administrative expenses, $6,421; and central office administrative expenses, $5,065. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other examples. In one Victorian abattoir there are more inspectors than are needed, so whenever the races are on one will always be at the races. In another abattoir in Victoria, where I was speaking to the people a few weeks ago, they have nine inspectors, three supervisors and a vet. They say they need about half that number. In fact, half that number is all who work at any time because they take it in turns to work half hour on and half hour off. The company still does some quality control at the end because it is jealous about maintaining its own quality standard, which it believes it can do better than the inspectors. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's farmers and export companies deserve better than this. We have got to have a leaner, better and cheaper service. The best way to do that is to get the Government out of it as much as possible, get as much as possible back to the companies, and then leave AQIS to provide the necessary inspection for overseas requirements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Export Control Amendment Bill is relatively short and simple, encompassing two new offences, namely, misrepresentation to government officials by food exporters that export requirements-by that I mean health and safety, quality and description-have been met, and the receipt of goods and services from exporters by food inspectors. Both measures should reduce malpractice in the food exporting industry and thus be of assistance to an important source of export income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Other provisions of the Bill allow for the widening of circumstances for providing health certificates for food and the power to cancel them if found to be incorrect. The remaining clauses are largely procedural in nature. While the context of the Bill does not represent a significant change in policy, I should like to take this opportunity to point out the potential and possible value of raw and processed foods from Australia and some of the challenges and difficulties facing growers and processors before maximum exports can become a reality. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had frequent meetings with the small crop growers in my electorate. The Bundaberg area, as I am sure you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, being a Queenslander too, is now the biggest horticultural centre in Australia. Only a few weeks ago the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) came to Hinkler to launch a logo for the integrated pest management program and to talk to local farmers and exporters about the difficulties they are facing. </PARA>
<PARA> The huge possibilities of export to Asia have often been canvassed and are certainly recognised by Government bodies such as Austrade. Growers in my electorate mainly export to New Zealand, where we have just had news of some possible relief in the export inspection charges by having the official protocol for the number of pieces inspected in a small consignment reduced from 600 to 450, but it is yet to be ratified by New Zealand. That is particularly important to the small growers because their cost is more difficult to spread across a small volume. </PARA>
<PARA> Fruit and vegetable growers in my electorate have experienced considerable hardship and a loss of export trade due to the presence of Atherigona orientalis eggs in cucurbits. During 1989 the New Zealand quarantine authorities initiated new production and inspection procedures covering the import of fruit fly host material from all countries into their country. This was in response to increasing numbers of interceptions of fruit fly larvae in consignments at their ports. </PARA>
<PARA> At various consultations in 1989 and 1990, industry was advised that this potentially serious pest is not present in New Zealand. Accordingly, industry was advised that the Bureau of Rural Resources has been requested by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) to undertake a reappraisal of the quarantine significance of the pest. I do not believe it does offer a threat to New Zealand, but we have to convince those authorities first. I understand that the Queensland Department of Primary Industries has been involved in discussions with industry groups to have the necessary studies undertaken. The result of the research projects will then be a basis on which a formal approach could be made to New Zealand for atherigona to be reclassified as a non-quarantine pest if the results supported this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Horticultural Research and Development Corporation (HRDC), established in 1988 to assist horticultural producers to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of horticultural production and post-harvest handling, has been of great assistance to growers in my area. I cannot speak highly enough of the work done by the HRDC. We have requested that New Zealand, when determining the official protocol, examine the climate requirements of atherigona. The fly is restricted to tropical climates and, although I am no expert in this field, I doubt that it could ever establish itself in New Zealand because of the difference in climate. </PARA>
<PARA> Japan and the United States are already importing fruit from countries where the fly is present without it being treated as an object of quarantine. This is one of the difficulties we often get into with our products where other countries use quarantine or health as a hidden tariff. </PARA>
<PARA> We have recently had the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy visit my electorate to listen to farmers' concerns about their export problems. Australia is internationally known as a fairly reliable supplier of such bulk items as sugar, wheat, milk products, and so on, but our international reputation and success in exporting citrus, tropical fruit and vegetables is much less impressive. For example, in the 29 March edition of Business Review Weekly it was claimed that direct access to overseas markets for Australian fruit and vegetables requires a different marketing expertise from those employed for bulk goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian rockmelons are too big for Asia. Our oranges are too small and tart, and much of the produce is packed in containers that are too big and lack stylish presentation. Networking and common brand names are too often lacking for export maximisation. Lack of understanding of what the foreign customer wants and using only surplus produce for export are the other criticisms. Processing of food for export provides the greatest earning potential, but here again Australia tends to be beaten to lucrative Asian and other markets. Only last week the growers in my electorate were praising the work done by the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. What we need to look at now is more marketing expertise and advice. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's horticultural industry is unlikely to improve its export performance while it is left just to government to ensure that exporters comply with minimum export quality standards. The industry itself must take prime responsibility for its export performance. </PARA>
<PARA> While I have mainly talked about the horticultural industry, as it is relevant to my area, AQIS inspects meat and livestock, wool, grains, fruits, dairy products, fish and other rural products prior to export. The inspection of goods prior to export aims to ensure that only products of a sufficient standard are exported. This is essential to maintain Australia's reputation as an exporter and to prevent a decline in Australian export of rural products. The meat substitution affair in 1981, and more recently the discovery of chemicals in meat-particularly dieldrin-showed how vulnerable exports are to problems concerning quality. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill introduces several amendments to the Export Control Act 1982, and the amendments include: a new offence of entering goods for export, where the conditions for export have not been complied with; a new offence of authorised officers receiving goods or services from owners of registered establishments; the broadening of power to issue health and fitness for human consumption certificates; clarifying that the regulation-making power to impose fees for the performance of services by authorised officers includes the power to remit fees; and removing the references to monetary penalties for offences where terms of imprisonment are also provided, thus allowing the Crimes Act 1914 to be operated to convert the term of imprisonment into a monetary penalty where the court so requires. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that what we need to do is ensure that we get the most effective and efficient cost delivery with regard to AQIS, because with full cost recovery it means that the exporters, the primary producers in particular, do have to bear that full cost. It is full cost recovery, not just the cost of wages of the inspectors themselves. I believe the Government is moving towards that end, but it is not easy, it is not simple, to work out the optimum number of inspectors. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have to be cautious and careful about is not to reduce the number of inspectors dramatically. We have moved a number of inspectors through the system; they have gone out of the system already. But if we reduce the number to less than the number we require, and we down-value our inspection service, the primary producers themselves are the losers. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is going to be difficult to get to that optimum level, and it is going to take a lot of hard work and goodwill. We have to do that, because the more efficient and effective we are, as I have said, the better it is for the primary producer. But it is difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other things I have found in my area regarding the times of inspections is this: while in the beef industry it may be that there are normal hours of, say, nine to five or whatever, or even seven to four that apply, they are not applicable in the fruit and vegetable industry because there is usually no fruit to inspect in the sheds of the primary producers before lunchtime. So the hour structure is totally different. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot of hard work to be done in consultation with the inspectors to try to work through those sort of mechanical problems that exist. There is also the matter of having inspectors who are able to relieve at the right time. </PARA>
<PARA> The other difficulty is with abattoirs that are open for only a few months of the year. Of course, in such a large nation, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia, where there is only a few months of operation, it is costly to make sure that those inspectors are there. Nevertheless, I would be concerned if we moved out of the inspection service to allow private enterprise or the producers-particularly in the meat industry-to manage or oversee the inspection, because we have already paid the price once, in 1981, and the cost of that would again be very high. Because we are in such a competitive world market it is important that we produce the best quality and that we ensure there is no way that any of our competitors or any country can use health or quarantine as a hidden back door to use tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, it is important that we get to that optimum level in efficiency; but it is not easy, it is complex. However, we are moving that way and I believe, consequently, that this Bill helps in some way to improve the system, and therefore I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Food Authority Bill represents the Government's attempt to reform Australia's food regulatory system and it results from decisions made at the Prem-iers Conference and representations from most of the major food industry groups. There was unanimous agreement at the Premiers Conference in Brisbane last year to establish a National Food Authority (NFA) in an attempt to resolve some of the many problems that have occurred in this industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some of those problems include: the lack of uniform national standards-they vary almost from State to State; the lack of clear objectives in the industry in terms of its regulation; the standards are often excessively complex and rigid; the time taken to vary standards or to introduce new standards is too long; there is a lack of consistency in many of the decisions; there is a lack of ability of the public in many areas to have any representations or to have their say upon the decisions that are made; there are regular complaints about administrative inefficiencies, and the end result is that the efficiency and the competitiveness of the export industry in Australia is severely restrained. </PARA>
<PARA> Those complaints have been echoed not only by the food industry but also by the Commonwealth's Business Regulation Review Unit in its report of 1988 and indeed by the Industries Assistance Commission, as it was then, in its 1989 report on the food processing and beverage industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say that the Opposition supports the principle of the Bill. We have one reservation, in respect of which we will move an amendment, and there are some other minor points that we would like to make. I think the thrust of the Bill is very important to the food industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In many ways it is a landmark Bill inasmuch as the States have agreed to cede some of their powers to set their own standards to the Commonwealth via this National Food Authority, which will be a statutory authority. Although, of course, in principle we are unhappy about establishing yet another statutory authority, we do believe in this particular case that the end result for Australia-which is what counts-will be a good result. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the setting up of that statutory authority that provides us with the major reservation which we have, and it relates to the definition of chairperson of the Authority. There are limits upon the age of the person who can be appointed, and the age is limited to 65 years. It is clearly inappropriate for any individual to be excluded or included on the basis of age; it is simply discrimination. We have pointed this out in regard to a number of other Bills. Indeed on some occasions I understand the Government has been prepared to remove that particular requirement that age be a bar to becoming chairperson. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment that we will move in committee, if we get a chance, will be that clause 41, page 22, subclause 5, lines 4 to 7 be omitted. In view of the fact that we are unlikely to get to the committee stage, I seek leave to incorporate this amendment in Hansard. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1K4">Dr BOB WOODS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of organisations have raised problems in relation to the Bill, but by and large we are supportive of the Government's position. There have been some criticisms, for example, that the Bill concentrates on public health issues rather than food quality issues, and indeed it does. I have to say that it is probably a very sensible thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not believe that the Government should be responsible for monitoring the industry's food quality beyond the level of ensuring that there is no damage to public health and that the food is basically sound and healthy. The actual promotion or otherwise of food quality should be entirely outside of government's responsibility. Also, government should not really involve itself further in consumer affairs, including advertising of the particular product. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of consumer protection has been raised. There seems to be a worry about whether there will be a lowering of standards of the current requirements for protection. It has been suggested that we should insert an addition making it a requirement of the Authority, in this regard, to also prevent fraud and deception in the promotion and sales of foodstuffs. By and large, that requirement is already covered by the Trade Practices Act, amongst others, and I think it would be superfluous to instruct the Authority to have regard to that particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Some complaints have been made about the definition of some of the limits covered. This relates in particular, for example, to the production of food and it mentions additives. There was a suggestion that there should be a number of other factors which are actually mentioned in the wording of the legislation. I have to say that I think again the Government has got it right-in the same way that a Bill of Rights, once it spells out the rights of an individual, almost by definition limits those rights. In the same way, to spell out here all the things which should be included would, of course, limit those others things which may not be on that particular list. So I am happy with the definition of the production of food and the mention about additives in particular, since there is a particular concern there. </PARA>
<PARA> We have lobbied for time limits in other Bills such as the Therapeutic Goods Bill, so I have no particular problem here about prescribing time limits for the procedures to be followed. Indeed, I think this can only be advantageous and, as I will point out in a minute, there are some examples of fairly lengthy periods which have been gone through in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some concerns-and I think these are major concerns-that the standards might be lowered. There is a requirement that the standards be correlated with international standards. Hopefully, we will receive later from the responsible Minister an undertaking that in fact the standards will not be lowered but that the high standards for which we are famous in Australia will be maintained and that international standards will have to reach those standards. There obviously are some problems there with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and we will have to ensure that those are not con- travened. But I would be happy to hear from the Minister the principle that high standards for international foods will be maintained and that we will not allow international foods of substandard quality to enter the Australian market. I believe that will be the case, and I would be happy to have confirmation of that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a suggestion that all hearings of the National Food Authority should be made public, and that seems to me to be completely impractical. I think there is a provision already for some of the deliberations of the Authority to be made public, and I think that does cover the issues. </PARA>
<PARA> One issue which has been raised, I think, does have some legs, that is, the question of appeal. Generally, the problem here is that any requirement or proviso for an appeal to be made is for an appeal by the applicant for a new or varied standard. It does not allow other interested parties to institute an appeal against a particular decision. It does seem to me that there is room here for both applicants and bodies, for example, submitting evidence as part of the ongoing process to be allowed to appeal against particular decisions. I think that would be an amendment which would certainly improve the Bill in terms of allowing appropriate appeals. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a question about the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS). We discussed this briefly in relation to the previous Bill. There have been some suggestions that there are problems inasmuch as the NFA is separate from AQIS. It was suggested that those two bodies might be merged, but I would see this as a mistake. In fact, I see the NFA very much as a legislative body, a body which makes decisions about standards. It is not an enforcement body; it is not the policeman of the food industry and, indeed, should not be so. So again, I think, in those regards, the Government does have the matter fairly correct. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that there are a number of issues which have been an ongoing problem for people in the food industry, and there are some amazing inconsistencies. For example, in terms of low fat products, `low fat spread', `low fat cheese', `low fat yoghurt' and `low fat cream' are all completely acceptable terms, but `low fat ice-cream' is an unacceptable term. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a record in regard to ice-cream of a submission being lodged in 1988 with the Australian Food Standards Committee (AFSC)-a decision could be made at an out of session meeting of the PHC. Ice-cream is a seasonal product. Any delay in approval, therefore, could result in deferral for another year and the cost to industry, of course, is enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the issue of low fat table spreads. That has been on the agenda now for some four years. Low joule confectionery has been on the agenda for more than two years. Those are attempts to permit production of dietary aids to help consumers comply with good general medical advice that they should reduce sugar and fat intakes. That generally commendable aim is one which is not assisted by the complex and lengthy approval processes which often have to be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> The classic example in a related area is the question of NutraSweet and the artificial sweetener Aspartame, which has been a great breakthrough in artificial sweeteners inasmuch as it is virtually tasteless and is an excellent replacement for sugar and yet has no calories. But there have been enormous delays. For example, the approval process for six products of Aspartame took some three years. That cost the company, in this case NutraSweet, something like half a million dollars and the estimated forgone sales revenue across the board was something like $50m for this product alone.</PARA>
<PARA> There is another example, Isomalt, which was approved in November 1989 and it was circulated out of session in June 1990 for final endorsement. It took seven months to circulate the AFSC decision to the PHC, which was far too long-yet another example of the delays and inefficiencies in the system. There was a minor revision of the milk definition discussed in February 1988, but it was not until December 1989 that that decision was gazetted. It took four years before the amendments concerning the use of humectants in confectionery and revisions to claims such as `no sugar added' and `unsweetened' were finalised. They are all examples of the enormous bureaucracy which is associated with the current program. </PARA>
<PARA> The current program is that each State and Territory adopts standards which have been developed by the National Health and Medical Research Council and then agreed to unanimously at present by members of the National Food Standards Council. But the existing agreement does allow States and Territories to make unilateral variations to those standards and, accordingly, for example, New South Wales sells unpasteurised goat milk and South Australia allows the addition of a red colorant to its prawns to increase their commercial appeal. There is a whole range of exceptions to the standards similar to those which I have touched upon there. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other examples of delays. There are enormous ones. I could go on forever, but let me just touch upon a few more. The use of nisin in high moisture hot plate products was deemed urgent. It took, however, from November 1988 to December 1989 to have this resolved. The use of stannous chloride in canned asparagus was first submitted for a decision to the FST in October 1987 but was not gazetted until November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The gap between FST meetings and AFSC discussion adds extra time to the decision making process in a number of areas-for example, adding ferrous gluconate to olives. The first meeting was in June 1988; gazettal did not occur until 1989. There are five different bodies, at least, through which decisions have to proceed. They have to be referred; the bodies all meet sporadically throughout the year; there is no coordinated program to expedite the decisions. The end result is that there are substantial disincentives for firms to engage in innovative developments and, of course, lost opportunities are in the end borne by the Australian consumer and the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Bill provides for fast-tracking of an application where the NFA believes that it is appropriate; it defines particular durations which the process cannot exceed; and, by and large, I believe that the bureaucracy has the potential, so long as the NFA is run appropriately, to be vastly improved.</PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned in the beginning, we support the legislation. We do have this one amendment which we will move in the Committee of the Whole if we get half a chance. But in the interests of the other speakers on this particular Bill, I will terminate my discussion and hopefully resume in committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I was most interested in the comments made by the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) in relation to the National Food Authority Bill. I note that some of the points he raised, which have also been brought to my attention by some of the consumer organisations, relate to such things as the role of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) and the standard for food production, and I will go to those issues later on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out to the House that I believe this Authority will be well received by consumer organisations, by industry and by the general public because in many ways it is long overdue. Its history goes back officially, I suppose, to the 1989 report by the Industries Assistance Commission into the food processing and beverages industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I can recall some 10 or 12 years ago when the debate around the model food Act was still high on the agenda. There was discussion then that Australia needed a national food authority. There was strong argument in those days for a national, uniform approach when it came to standards, when it came to assessment and when it came to things like labelling and packaging. So it is not new. But I believe it will be most welcome. This is another initiative of this Government in the area of consumerism, in the areas of public safety and also public health, and I personally welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred a moment ago to the report by the Industries Assistance Commission. The report highlighted regulations and rules at the State levels, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that entailed significant compliance costs and delayed the introduction of new products, hampered innovation, disadvantaging both producers and consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a fairly good summation of the situation. That does not mean to say that everything that has been happening at State levels has been causing those sorts of problems, but there have been those difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> These matters were taken up originally by the Australian Health Ministers back in June 1990 and then at the October 1990 Premiers Conference, initiated again by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) as he saw the need-and he was backed by relevant Ministers in this House-to ensure that we got rid of those inefficiencies, that we brought about uniformity and that we overcame the duplications. I know these things will be further discussed at the forthcoming Premiers Conference and later this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased this Bill is before the House because it will be of significant benefit to consumers. It is important that as a nation we develop food safety standards, and this will be that initiative. It is important that we do coordinate food recalls. We do not want seven-or eight-different systems, including the States and Territories. It is far better that we have a uniform national approach. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important that we coordinate imported food assessment. We have some difficulties in this nation where one State could allow something to come into the country-as happens with so many non-consumable items where it can come into the country because it has been random tested-then, under section 92 of the Australian Constitution, it can go anywhere within the nation. That can create some dilemmas as we have seen with so many consumer products which have proved to be harmful to the Australian public. So here we will have coordination, and I believe that will be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also promote uniformity between domestic and international food standards. I have a personal view on this. I state on the record that this is my view and not a Government view. I feel it is a pity that, whilst the National Food Authority will be setting the standards, we will still have the implementation, when it comes to rules applying to imported goods, carried out by AQIS. I am not trying to cast aspersions at our authority in this area, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, but I really believe if we are going to go all the way to uniformity and overcome the duplication then, at some point in time, which I hope is not too far away, there ought to be further consultation between Ministers and departments so that that role could even be given up by AQIS. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be people who argue against it. We saw a situation not long ago where we had some seaweed coming from Japan. There was some doubt at the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) level, yet AQIS still agreed that it be sold in Australia. Fortunately, the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) in his wisdom passed the matter on to the scientific body within the National Health and Medical Research Council. The Council quickly said there were some problems. The matter then went to a higher body and there were some changes made. The risk was that AQIS had agreed to the product being dispersed throughout this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately it did not happen, but it could have happened. It raises some questions in my mind, when we are dealing with imported products, as to whether or not we ought to have two systems of control. I stress that it is my point of view, but it is a valid point of view, I believe, and I hope at some point we can either get greater cooperation and coordination or that we come under one authority. I see that the structure of the National Food Authority lends itself perfectly to the concept I am proposing here. </PARA>
<PARA> The NFA will achieve national food standards. I just hope, as the honourable member for Lowe said, that this is not a diminished standard outcome. There are concerns amongst consumers that once consumers are taken away from being involved at the decision-making level that that can happen. As honourable members will know, under this structure neither consumers nor, for that matter, industry will be involved at the top, senior levels. But the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) has made sure, where decisions are being made on standards, that the proposals will go to community groups and obviously then to industry and consumers, so they will have an input. That will be the test, and time will tell. </PARA>
<PARA> We will also see some pluses. We will see the protection of the health and safety of the public because we will have this national approach. We will not have different standards at a State level; we will not have different standards at a Territory level. We will have a national approach. It will not matter where the product is made; Australians, regardless of where they might reside, will have that in-built protection. It will enable consumers to make informed choices because of the availability of information on food ingredients, and again I welcome this. I hope, however, it will be in simple English terms. It is all very well to say the information is there, but if it is in some scientific terminology it will mean nothing to the consumer. Again, we will have to see how this organisation addresses that need out there in the community where there are different intelligence levels and certainly people with different skills when it comes to understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also clear that the NFA will promote fair trading practices. Whilst this is at the national level, and it is recommendatory because of the States' concurrence, one would hope we will see some fair rules and practice out there in the marketplace. It is a far cry, as I said, from the model food Act and the way it was brought about where it was gradually introduced State by State. Whilst it was a worthwhile initiative-and as you, Madam Deputy Speaker, as a Queenslander will know, it was Queensland which led the way and pioneered that, and I might add that it was under a conservative government and I give credit to the Minister at the time-it took years to get the measures across the nation, it took years to enact the provisions, and when it was all said and done the outcome was one of a lack of uniformity. </PARA>
<PARA> This new structure is national; it is all-encompassing and it is uniform. It is really a win for consumers. It is a far cry from a view advanced to me when I was on the Gold Coast some time ago-in fact the new Leader of the Opposition, Dr John Hewson, was also speaking at that conference but he was not a member of parliament at that time. It was a Housing Industry Association conference. I sat around with people at that conference when they were advancing this view that they wanted to get rid of every rule and every regulation. They were true deregulators, admittedly from the extreme right of politics, but they saw no need for rules or standards. They pursued the line of caveat emptor-let the buyer beware. If someone bought something at risk, their attitude was that they would not go back and buy it again. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is quite ridiculous as they were really pursuing the law of the jungle. They were pursuing the line that the consumer should carry all risks. That is simply not on, and the National Food Authority is a clear indication that this Government is not prepared to go down that track. It is prepared to get rid of the inefficiencies; it is prepared to set up a mechanism which will fast track the solving of problems; it is prepared to find a way of setting new standards, a way of letting industry get rid of the burdening costs because of the different State rules. It will create that national approach. It truly is an example of good cooperation between the States, the Territories and the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a model for community input, it will allow the consumers and industry to have a say and it will allow for a new approach to ensure that there is a high tech and scientific input, for it has the power to set up scientific advisory bodies in microbiology, food science, food analysis and, particularly, food law interpretation. It will remove the inefficiencies that have been caused by the various regulatory regimes that have existed in the different jurisdictions at the State and Federal level. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vital that we have these changes, because the food processing and beverage industry is important to our overall economy. These industries account for some 16 per cent of employment across the nation and about 18 per cent of value added in manufacturing. In 1987-88 there were almost 4,000 food processing and beverage establishments in the nation. Thus one sees how vital these changes are to the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I fully support the changes. I have a couple of concerns and I will be watching very closely to ensure that there is not a diminishing of the standards that we have already. I will be watching also to see that, where there are provisions that allow the authority to hold certain types of hearings and inquiries in camera, those provisions do not overrule the Freedom of Information Act, because I have some concerns about that. At a later stage I will be speaking in relation to the appeal provisions and, because I cannot go to the clauses at this point, I will be seeking some clarifications in relation to aspects of the standards with regard to food production. </PARA>
<PARA> Otherwise the legislation certainly is most welcome. It will promote the domestic uniformity our nation needs, it will promote trade and commerce in the food industry, it should maximise the important information that consumers demand and need in the area of food products, it should maximise food safety and hygiene activities and, to reiterate, it will provide a national approach for dealing with problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I suggest that the elements are in place. The test will now be how effectively the legislation works. This will no doubt depend on willingness and ability to enforce the standards. I am quite optimistic about the National Food Authority, as it proposes what is truly an innovative, central, consumer oriented national food standards regime for the country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, like other speakers in the debate on the National Food Authority Bill, welcome this initiative. It has been a long time coming. The difficulties that have been experienced by the Commonwealth Government in setting national food safety standards have a long history. It has been a history of competition between various State governments, each one having its own views as to what is appropriate for the citizens of its State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has chosen the course of establishing a national food authority with powers to set safety standards. I think that that is critical and vital. The Authority will also have a capacity to set standards which may go beyond those health safety standards, and that could be of some concern. I would not like to think that there is a preconceived idea of what the food tastes and requirements of Australians may be. I would not want us to see any diminishing in the variety of foods available to Australians, particularly foods that are produced within this country. I would want to see an environment maintained where producers of new and exotic foods are encouraged and where obstacles are not put in the way of producers to prevent them from developing and marketing their products. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not want to see unnecessary legalistic and bureaucratic control of the development, say, of new cheeses. Australia has seen a blossoming of the Australian cheese producing industry over the last 10 or 15 years. Australia is now producing some excellent cheeses. In the process of making cheese, bacteria and food are mixed to produce an edible product. The processes have to be hygienic and well controlled. At the end of the day the product itself must be suitable for human consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> Producers of foods such as cheeses are constantly experimenting to produce new products and provide the Australian consumer with a larger variety. I want to see that continue and I want to see it encouraged. I hope that there is nothing in the administration and attitudes of the National Food Authority that would prevent the continuation of those processes. On the other hand, I would like to see that the conditions which it is eventually decided will apply to Australian pro- ducers and manufacturers of food products should be applied also at the front gate of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is a requirement that Australian food producers meet certain standards-not safety standards, but certain standards-then it is imperative that there should be amendments to the Customs Act to prevent foods entering at the front gate. It is no good allowing foods to enter, be tested by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service or State authorities and then ultimately be released on a limited basis even though they do not meet what are laid down as Australian standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The imperative must be for standards that are a prerequisite for Australian production to apply automatically, at the front gate of Customs, to every import. This is critical at a time when Australian manufacturers and producers are under attack from cheap imports, some of which do not meet Australian standards. I am not looking for restrictive process in this; I am just looking for fairness for Australian producers. </PARA>
<PARA> Around Australia, stories are legion of products coming in that do not meet Australian standards. One which I know of was mentioned in the House today. Apricots from Turkey, allowed to be brought into Australia, could not be sold because their quality was so low that the consumer would not touch them, but they could not be exported again because the quality was so low that it would not meet Australian standards. </PARA>

<PARA> The critical point is that products that are intended to be imported must be blocked at the front gate by the Customs process. Those products should not be allowed entry, unlike the current situation, until somebody in a State government or in the Quarantine and Inspection Service says that they are suitable. Importers must know that they will not get past the Customs process in Australia, and that is that. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Food Authority will deal with the labelling of food and beverages products. Labelling is a critical factor if consumers are to be able to make informed decisions. I trust that, in considering labelling, proper consideration will be given to the clarity, size and type style of lettering on all containers. </PARA>
<PARA> A whole range of labelling is taking place in Australia, particularly for lines produced in bulk for the major food outlets, and I am uncertain about whether consumers are really being informed. It seems that terms such as `product of', `produced in' and `packed by' are used fairly loosely. Consumers need to know the country of origin of a product; if the product has been repacked, consumers need to know precisely what the contents are by weight, volume and analysis. So the labelling process needs to be looked at carefully. Even the description processes are very important. For instance, I do not know how consumers can make up their minds about fruit juices and their derivatives when the percentage requirements were not marked clearly and boldly on the label. The confusion between cordials, drinks and juices has worried consumers for a long time and is an area that needs attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation now before the chamber is part of work being done by Commonwealth and State governments. The last Premiers Conference determined an agreed framework for regulatory reform which set out to determine areas where the achievement of national standards and regulations are essential to the efficient working of the Australian economy. The Premiers Conference also agreed that mutual recognition should apply everywhere in Australia. It also sought to have mutual recognition in areas where national standards are initially considered desirable. If uniform standards were unable to be achieved within a tightly prescribed time frame, other alternatives to develop the process further should apply. This is sensible decision-making. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly commend to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and to the House the Greiner initiative on mutual recognition. I think that was an enlightened contribution to the discussion. Mutual recognition between the States, with each State recognising the others' standards and eventually contracting that large range of regulation and recognition down to what is nationally acceptable, I think is a wonderful starting point. It has puzzled me for years that it could not be instigated, and I am pleased that the Premiers Conference has started on it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premiers, along with the Commonwealth, have stated that during the Premiers Conference to be held later this week they expect to deal with packaging and labelling; that is, the registration and labelling of agricultural and veterinary chemicals, industrial chemical labelling requirements, and pressure vessels, including design rules, registration, testing and compliance procedures. The Premiers Conference to be held in November 1991 will cover areas such as planning and building approvals and food inspection. That is another area in respect of food that is being dealt with by the Premiers. I just hope that the horrible mess that has been created in the meat inspection services throughout Australia can be resolved. </PARA>

<PARA> The Premiers Conference in November this year will look at food inspection. The food processes are in train and there will be a number of efforts to achieve some regulatory reforms in regard to a whole range of products. The Commonwealth and the Premiers Conference have laid down provisions of the agreement on standards and quality and have set time frames and other requirements to achieve uniformity. I do not like the word `uniformity'; what is meant is some uniformity of regulation for the benefit of consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> As this process moves ahead, I would bring to the attention of the House-because this is the first and vital instance-that not only are we looking at food products; medical products have also been properly dealt with, and a whole range of other products will be considered for national standards. Again, the principle must be that building materials, timber products, curtaining and other manufactured goods-all sorts of products produced in Australia-have State or Commonwealth standards regulations applying to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian manufacturers must abide by volumes of standards. It is crazy for us as a nation to go on requiring our manufacturers to apply these standards if importers are not required to meet the same standards. The process as it applies now with food products is this: unless someone lodges a complaint about something being of low or improper standard and an appropriate regulation is established debarring entry of that product, it is allowed to come in. I would like to see a blanket provision which says that everything not acceptable in Australia is not acceptable for import and will not even come through. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by saying that this legislation is a good first step. It needs to be not too bureaucratic and restrictive, but it must apply through the Customs process to imports as well as to Australian products. I would like to see the extension of that concept not just to the food and beverage area but also to the other areas that are being considered by the Commonwealth and the State Premiers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the National Food Authority Bill 1991. There is no more basic necessity of life than the primary subject of this Bill. I refer, of course, to food, the quality of which, like the air we breathe and the water we drink, has a major influence on our general health and well-being. The ready availability of adequate supplies of high quality foods is something most Australians take for granted. Australian people are fortunate in that this country has never suffered from an acute shortage of food in recent memory, something which tragically is an all too frequent occurrence in some other countries. For these countries the primary concern of food authorities is sufficient food to provide basic sustenance to their often undernourished populations. They are rarely troubled with concerns over the nature of additives or colourings used in foodstuffs or about chemical contamination during food processing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, in most of those countries there are set standards of quality and safety which food must meet to be acceptable for human consumption. While food is a basic necessity of life, contaminated or unsafe food can also be the harbinger of disease or death. This fact has led historically to the formation of basic regulations controlling food. The level and nature of that regulation varies from country to country, although there is an increasing move towards international standardisation. In the more developed and affluent countries, basic food standards-items covering hygienic handling and distribution of food and the regulations designed to reduce the risk of contamination by disease or other substances-have been expanded to cover a wide variety of food-related issues. </PARA>
<PARA> In some of these countries, food standards also include items such as requirements for certain information to be included in food labelling and advertising, restrictions on the type and design of packaging, and licensing requirements for food producers and distributors. Australia is one of these countries and, as is commonly the case, these extra restrictions and regulations have developed over a long period and in an ad hoc manner. Often different government departments and regulatory bodies have responsibility for various issues relating to food standards. This Bill attempts to create a more coordinated approach. </PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8J4">Mr LES SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I mentioned prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner, shortage of food has not been a problem for most Australians. If anything, and given that we have just had dinner, they have probably suffered from the reverse-an overabundance of modern high-tech foodstuffs full of mystery ingredients. Some of this food is absolutely saturated with various chemicals and other additives designed to enhance its flavour, colour or storage potential, or the residue of chemicals and other materials used during its production and processing. The transportation, packaging and presentation of foods for sale can also subject it to various forms of contamination, either natural-bacterial or fungal-or artificial, foreign objects or other pollutants. All of these things can pose serious health risks to the people consuming that food.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further, while some additives or chemical residues may have no serious effect on the majority of people, they can often produce severe reactions in people who have certain medical conditions or a specific allergic reaction to that particular substance. So there is a need for consumers to know both that the food they are purchasing has been produced, packaged and distributed in a safe and hygienic manner and what ingredients and additives, if any, have been used in its production and/or preparation. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's consumers also have the reasonable expectation to know the details of the country of origin of the food they actually purchase. Over the years governments have developed laws to address these potential problems and hence protect public health and safety to enable consumers to make informed choices about the products they consume. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of the States and Territories has some form of legislation which establishes food standards, basic hygiene requirements to be met in the process and handling of foodstuffs, labelling and packaging requirements for food for human consumption, and a multitude of other matters associated with the production, distribution and consumption of food generally. Historically, State and local governments hold the primary constitutional authority in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the contribution towards national food standards through the National Health and Medical Research Council and various heads of government agreements, the Federal Government's authority in this area is reasonably restricted with probably its major role being the setting of certain standards for export foodstuffs to meet international requirements and regulation of imports. Because of this individual State and territorial regulation of food and the food industry over the early years, there is a strong potential for a number of differing requirements and standards governing various aspects of the food industry to apply throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the significant reforms in food regulation that have taken place to date through the efforts of the National Food Standards Council, there is still much more to be achieved in this area. Pres-ently all food sold in Australia is required to comply with the provisions of the food standards code. The code is developed under the auspices of the National Health and Medical Research Council, which produces a draft standard for consideration by the National Food Standards Council, which comprises the State and Territory Ministers responsible for food issues. If the standards are unanimously agreed to by the Council, each of the Ministers then goes back to his or her own government to have the standards ratified, after which they are then adopted into State and territorial legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Each State prepares its own legislation. Often because of drafting variations between States there is difficulty in maintaining uniformity in the national standards throughout Australia. Further, the current agreement allows each State and Territory to make variations applicable in that State or Territory to the standards set under the code, without consultation with the Commonwealth or other States or territories, thereby opening the way for further differences in the standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The present system for determining the standards is itself extremely cumbersome and time consuming. Further, it provides little opportunity for general consumer input or review. Under the current arrangements, the product recall process is not as efficient as it could be, owing to the individual requirements of each State and Territory. These problems have been recognised for a considerable period and a great deal of discussion has taken place between the various Ministers responsible. As a result of early consideration of these matters, some changes were introduced in 1987. However, these have not produced any major improvements in the overall food standards process, and dissatisfaction with the system has continued. </PARA>
<PARA> After further consideration of ways to overcome these difficulties and establish a truly effective and efficient national food standards system, the Australian health Ministers conference agreed to the establishment of a National Food Authority to develop and review the domestic food standards for recommendation to the National Food Standards Council. The health Ministers conference also agreed to a recognition of a national food standards agreement to provide for true uniformity between the States of the agreed national food standards resulting from the work of the National Food Standards Council. This Bill is the result of that decision and the agreement on micro-economic reform arising out of the Special Premiers Conference on Commonwealth/State relations held in October last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the establishment of the National Food Authority, clearly defines its objectives and sets out firm guidelines for the performance of its functions. It also puts in place provisions for consumer and industry involvement in the development of standards and fixes time frames which the Authority must meet in dealing with specific issues. Although the Authority's primary function will be to develop and review standards relating to food available in Australia, including both domestically produced and imported foods, and to make recommendations to the National Food Standards Council, its functions will cover a broad range of issues which have relevance to food. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to continue at any great length. I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise this evening to support this Bill. The introduction of the National Food Authority Bill will clearly create an efficient food standards setting mechanism with objectives that recognise that there is a range of interests involved and that standards setting is not costless for consumers, business or regulatory authorities. The end result should be a more efficient and cost effective method of regulating the food industry and providing Australians with access to a continuing supply of high quality nutritious foods. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed a pleasure to rise to speak to the National Food Authority Bill. I know that honourable members on both sides of the House have shown a great deal of goodwill in their desire to see that this Bill does as the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) proposes that it will do. Apart from the Opposition's wishing to move a minor amendment, which I am sure the Minister will support, it goes forward with, as I said, the goodwill of both sides of this House. I am very pleased to speak to it for that particular reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In doing so, I believe it is reasonable for the Opposition to look at the pitfalls in nationalising a food testing authority and the factors that the Minister ought to take into consideration in setting it up. I would like to bring to his attention some of the complaints from the industry groups about the current regulations. I think they are worth while looking at briefly so that we do not make those mistakes again. </PARA>
<PARA> The first and most obvious complaint is the lack of uniform national standards. One would hope that this Bill would certainly overcome that and that the States do not choose to opt out of it for some political reason or for short term political gain. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point that the industry groups were concerned about was the lack of clear objectives. Perhaps in that single statement lies the success or failure of this new Authority. If it does not have clear objectives and does not enunciate them properly to the industry, confusion will reign and we will end up in a bureaucratic nightmare that is centralised control. Excessively complex and rigid standards are what these groups have had to put up with at the moment. I think that is self-explanatory. Time taken to vary standards is far too long. The Minister should take on board that we should try to fast-track simple regulations or innovative ideas, and that industry should not be held up by this national Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Lack of consistency in decisions is another concern expressed by the industry groups. Once again, we would hope that the National Food Authority would certainly overcome that problem. Inability of the public to make submissions or have their say was one of the other complaints put forward. Administrative inefficiencies and the reduced experience and competitiveness are an impediment to the development of the export industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister would do well to consider how this Authority can help our export trade. Recently, on an overseas delegation to South East Asia, I could only be impressed by the understanding that the nations there have of the quality of Australian food. At one factory that I went to, which sourced its milk powder from both Australia and the European Economic Community, we were told that it had to mix the EEC powder with Australian powder to get it up to sufficient standard to send it to Bangladesh. That is certainly not only an indictment of the quality of the EEC product but shows that Australian food standards are extremely high and a credit to our exporters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the shadow Minister at the table-the factory should have taken all our produce, and I hope that it will in the near future. But this is certainly a great idea that can help our export industries and, no doubt, that will become part of the operation of the Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A couple of points come to mind that we ought not lose sight of. This is a diverse society; some people would call it a multicultural society. This being so, some minority groups have imported foods that perhaps are not of the same health standard as Australian food. I would hate to see those people who bring in traditional food annexed out of the Australian market by this regulation. If they have for many years been used to eating the national foods of their homeland, one hopes that they will be permitted to continue to eat those foods in Australia. Perhaps on such food there could be adequate warning labels that preservatives and so on are not to our standards. </PARA>
<PARA> This is also a great opportunity for this nation to move to some sort of uniform labelling code, whereby labelling accepted in one State of Australia would be accepted right across Australia. When people pick up a product, they should know from where it has been sourced, whether it has been repackaged in Australia and what additives are in it. In our society today many people are allergic to certain foodstuffs and require the protection of adequate labelling so that they can make sure that their dietary intake is as they require. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out to the Minister that, in the abattoir industry, we have a national testing standard which seems to have failed by standards that are applied in the country, but we also have a peculiar situation whereby the standard for export to the United States is different from that which applies internally in Australia. One hopes that such a thing does not occur with our other food industries, as that would impose an unfair impost on those industries. Those things sometimes sneak into our negotiations and we are forced to make such extraordinary decisions, whereby the regulations that apply to food that we export is different from those which apply to food consumed in Australia. These things are to be avoided. In the main, one has to look at the positive side of this. I very much take on board the points that the Minister made in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill requires the proposed National Food Authority to pursue set objectives in making recommendations for the introduction, removal or amendment of food standards. The Authority will be required to have regard in priority order to:</PARA>
<PARA> the need to protect public health and safety;</PARA>
<PARA>That is obvious and commendable, and we hope that it is done in such a way as not to impact on reasonable business standards. A further objective is:</PARA>
<PARA>the provision of adequate information relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices;. </PARA>
<PARA>I have already covered that point, but I point out once again that people from an ethnic background may very well want to import food of a standard slightly different from that which we allow in relation to food produced in Australia, and I hope that those people are not unfairly treated under this Bill or under the bureaucracy. A further objective given is the promotion of fair trading in food. I think that is extremely desirable. This matter has already been covered by a previous speaker. Where food is coming into mainstream Australia, we must ensure that it is of a standard that we would expect in relation to food produced in Australia. The Bill further provides for:</PARA>
<PARA>the promotion of trade and commerce in the food industry and the promotion and consistency of standards which apply to the food in international trade. </PARA>
<PARA>All those things are great objectives, and I wish the Minister well in his deliberation and his administration of this Authority over the next couple of years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Food Authority Bill deals with aspects of the reforms to the food regulation system in Australia announced after the special Premiers Conference on Commonwealth-State relations held in October 1990, namely, that uniform food standards would apply across the nation and be regulated by a National Food Authority. Such a reform has the potential to achieve substantial efficiencies in food production and distribution throughout Australia. It also has the potential to be a boon to consumers. I earnestly hope that that is what it proves to be. An outline of the Bill states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>While public health and safety will remain the prime objective of food standards, in developing new standards, the Authority will also seek to promote, as far as possible, consistency between domestic and overseas food standards in recognition of the benefits to be gained from increased international harmonisation. </PARA>
<PARA>Although consistency between domestic and overseas food standards is an important factor in trade, I would caution the Minister and the new Authority on this point, in the context of the debate on food irradiation in 1988 and 1989. The catchcry of much of the food processing industry at that time concerned the need for consistency with international standards and our trading partners. Consideration of public health and safety and the rights of consumers appeared to be given only very cursory attention, in the face of that commercial imperative. </PARA>
<PARA> For those people who do not know, food irradiation is a process whereby food is bombarded by highly radioactive gamma rays in order to kill off the insects, bacteria and other micro-organisms which can cause food to spoil. Its advocates claim that the process can be used as a substitute for other methods of food preservation that are considered harmful by consumers. It is strongly supported by tropical fruit and vegetable exporters in the northern areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, however, whilst not causing food to become radioactive at the levels which would be used-hence, the complaint at the time about food that glows in the dark-food irradiation does involve the creation of radiolytic substances which could be harmful to humans and which could also cause a loss of nutritional value in the food. There was also a lot of concern about the possibility of cancer being caused by food irradiation. There was not a great deal of proof, though, because at the time Australian research was very thin on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> In his second reading speech on this Bill, the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) made particular mention of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations and the fact that those negotiations have identified the need to avoid food standards being used as barriers to trade. He went on to say that the GATT goal is to ensure that national standards should be based on the standards developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission or, where they differ, they should do so on a scientifically justified basis. It is intended that the National Food Authority will contribute to the decision making on Codex standards and, in turn, harmonise our domestic food regulations, where appropriate, with Codex. It is maintained that this harmonisation would remove the potential for accusations that Australia was using food standards as a non-tariff trade barrier. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, this proposal does not inspire me with confidence, given my experience on the food irradiation front; and I would strongly urge the National Food Authority to be on its guard against back door attempts to tie it, and Australia, into the food irradiation web. Had it not been for the alertness and energy of one particular member of this Parliament, namely, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott), I believe that Australia would have been presented with food irradiation as a fait accompli, via the model food Act in 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA> Many State governments were keen to establish food irradiation facilities within their borders-particularly Queensland-and national agreement would have been relatively easy to obtain. However, once alerted, consumer opposition was extremely strong, and it would be strong again if this proposal were resurrected in the context of the National Food Authority's deliberations over food standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Many honourable members of this House, me included, lodged petitions opposing the importation of equipment and fuel rods as well as calling for a ban on irradiated foodstuffs at the Federal level. Under the chairmanship of the then honourable member for La Trobe, Peter Milton-an excellent member, I might say-the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts conducted a substantive inquiry into the use of ionising radiation and reported to the Parliament on 9 March 1989. In his tabling speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The report which is now before the House is the culmination of two years of extensive investigation which resulted in 4,000 pages of oral evidence and many thousands of pages of written submissions and technical documents. Hundreds of petitions from all over Australia containing thousands of signatures were also presented to the House by individual members, indicating strong consumer resistance to irradiated food. In essence, the report concluded that the processing of food irradiation should not be permitted in Australia until such time as adequate research studies have been undertaken which can conclusively show that irradiated food is safe for human consumption and that a routine commercial method of detection of irradiated food has been developed. </PARA>
<PARA>While consumers are concerned about additives, preservatives, colouring agents and pesticides in food, they are equally wary about the prospect of food irradiation. The Minister for Resources also said in his second reading speech that public confidence in the food supply is essential to protect the marketability of agricultural produce and processed foods. The clean, green image of our exports and domestic produce must not be undermined. </PARA>
<PARA> I am most supportive of the proposal to establish the National Food Authority. It is a very necessary development, which should ensure that uniform standards are achieved and that consumer rights are protected together with those of industry. I earnestly hope that its laudable aims and objectives are never perverted by those, both here and overseas, who would wish food irradiation on the Australian public. I very much commend the Minister for his work in obtaining agreement with the States for this legislation and commend the Bill to the House without hesitation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Food Authority Bill when being introduced by the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) was lauded as providing an opportunity for the Federal Parliament to debate the issues and contribute to the reforms in the field of food regulation. The Government has demonstrated its commitment to that debate by allowing just over an hour for the introduction of this important Bill and me just a few minutes during the State of Origin match to comment on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The food industry is a very important Australian industry amounting to some 20 per cent of our manufacturing industry. It has a turnover of around $30 billion and employs 173,000 people. There is often criticism about the $2 billion worth of food imports that come into this country and there is good reason to be critical of many of those imports. It also needs to be remembered that this country exports four times that amount in food exports-about $8.5 billion-around 20 per cent of our exports. Trade in food is very important to this country and so the development of standards is also a critical issue. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill seeks to develop some degree of uniformity in standards by developing the National Food Authority, which has a degree of control in the area-with the States, which have the constitutional power in this area, agreeing to abide by those common standards. A number of areas have troubled the food producers in Australia over many years. One difficulty that has been referred to often is that there does not seem to be any commonality in the standards for imported foods compared to domestically produced products. I hope that this is one of the issues that will be addressed under these new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who would prefer to be free traders rather than fair traders often forget about the need to maintain common and fair standards for all. In the past, I have often referred to the problems with the import of peanuts from China. That is an excellent example of double standards being adopted. Chinese peanuts have 50 times higher residue levels of BHC chemicals, organochlorin, than those produced anywhere else in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Most countries in the world will not accept Chinese peanuts. The Americans do not; but Australia has been gladly receiving them over recent times. In fact, under some considerable pressure from the main importer, our National Health and Medical Research Council is moving to set a limit in Australia of 0.1 parts per million of BHC chemical residues. That is 50 times higher than is acceptable in most other places of the world. Even Argentina, which is hardly noted for its high health standards, has a level of 0.02 parts per million of BHC chemical residues and that is the kind of level that is being pursued by Australian farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> Consumers do not know when they buy a packet of peanuts whether they are getting Chinese peanuts which have high levels of chemical contamination. That is one of the other issues that needs to be addressed in the development of common standards. Even though many of these peanuts come from China, they will have on the packet `Product of Australia'. That is the kind of dishonesty in labelling that we need to look at closely in developing uniform standards. </PARA>
<PARA> One of my constituents wrote to me some time ago and suggested that in Australia there ought to be a clearly identified trademark placed on products that are 100 per cent Australian. It is true that at present one can pay a few dollars to have certain logos placed on one's products. But if there were a trademark readily available for 100 per cent Australian products, it would help the shoppers when moving through the supermarket to know when they are buying a genuinely Australian product. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that the words `Product of Australia' on the label these days means nothing. Little or low local content can still have `Product of Australia' written on it. We have often heard the story about orange juice which is made of Brazilian concentrate, sometimes even in imported containers, yet because it contains Australian water it is labelled `Product of Australia'. I know of even worse instances where the contents of canned foods were imported-even the cans were imported and the labels were printed overseas, and yet they have `Product of Australia' on them. There are changes that need to be made in developing our new standards. </PARA>
<PARA> It is bad enough that we are importing these products from Brazil, Israel, Romania, Turkey and every other imagin- able country, but when the housewives and shoppers do not know that they are getting products from those countries and do not know that they are buying products that do not necessarily meet Australian health standards, then I think it really is time that we took a stand on these sorts of issues. My constituents' idea of having a readily identifiable trademark would be very helpful to people so that they are able to choose between what is Australian and what is not Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard other people say that all the Australian goods ought to be in one part of the supermarket, and all of the foreign goods should be quarantined in another area. That may not be so practical. Certainly, I think it is essential that consumers be aware of their opportunity to buy Australian and the contribution that they can make to the Australian economy by buying good Australian products. They are not only benefiting the Australian economy and Australian producers by taking such action; they are also guaranteeing that they are getting a high standard of product that meets the Australian health requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> Hopefully, this National Food Authority will move to ensure that the imported foodstuffs also meet these Australian requirements. In common with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen), I think it is essential that we ensure that the Food Authority does not allow our standards in any way to be compromised and does not succumb to any sort of pressure from importers or others for lower standards to be adopted in this country just to accommodate imports, even if those imports do come from a big and powerful country such as China. We have a right in this country to demand the higher standards. Australian producers have been in the forefront in the world in producing the very best quality products, and we have a right to expect those standards from producers in other countries who want to exploit our markets as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should say loudly to shoppers in this country that they ought to buy Australian in their own interests and in their country's interests. Perhaps this Bill will start to redress the problems of labelling and standards, which are in many ways contributing to the difficulties that our industry confronts at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before the House the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, an omnibus Bill designed to amend various Acts concerned with crime, law enforcement and criminal justice. The Bill was introduced last Thursday and, at the last minute, as has been seen by the change in the orders of the day, has come on for debate this evening. The coalition will not be opposing the Bill, although we have a number of concerns about some aspects of its drafting. Furthermore, during the committee stage I will be moving some amendments to the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill contains a number of amendments of a very technical drafting nature, as well as many amendments involving policy matters. Before proceeding further I will give a brief overview of the major features of the Bill. Part 2 of the Bill amends the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 to extend the scope of the witness protection scheme and to streamline the procedures for management initiated retirements. Parts 3 and 7 of the Bill amend the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 respectively. Parts 4 and 9 amend the Crimes Act 1914 and the Passports Act 1938 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments relate to the cancellation of or refusal to issue passports to persons charged with or convicted of serious offences. Parts 5 and 6 amend provisions of the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 and the Customs Act 1901 in response to recent court decisions. Part 8 amends the National Crime Authority Act 1984 so that the Australian Capital Territory Government can participate in the activities of the intergovernmental committee. Part 10 amends provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 in response to some recent court decisions. Finally, the schedule to the Bill makes further amendments to the Crimes Act relating to the Federal sentencing legislation which was introduced by the Crimes Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1989, which came into force in July last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Before proceeding any further it may be appropriate that I give an outline of some of the queries or concerns that the coalition has with the Bill's drafting. I had intended doing so earlier rather than later so as to allow the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to give appropriate responses in order to clarify some of the queries I am raising. But the Attorney-General has not bothered to attend at this juncture and perhaps those who are necessarily required to advise him might from outside the strict precincts of this place take note of what is being said and I may get a literate response from the Attorney when he finally arrives, after listening to these remarks and reading the notes that I dare say his advisers will in all propriety pass on to him. </PARA>
<PARA> The first query relates to clause 5, which seeks to amend section 26e of the Australian Federal Police Act to provide that, where at the time of appointment a determination has not been made with respect to the compensation payable to a staff member upon early termination, the Commissioner may make such a determination later, at the time of the earlier termination. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that questions relating to redundancy or termination payments should have been settled at the time of appointment. It is certainly the usual case in the private sector to settle at the time of appointment matters such as what you are going to pay someone in termination. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that the Government has made efforts to improve and modernise employment structures within the Australian Federal Police (AFP). I see that the Attorney has arrived-not that I would normally languish for his attention, but I have matters of great plausibility and moment to put to him, on which I would like his pearls of wisdom, based on the advice that will be tendered to him. The officials have taken note of part of the first query that I make in regard to determinations and compensation on the termination of a member of the AFP. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Attorney-General entered I was saying that I acknowledged that the Government has made efforts to improve and modernise employment structures within the Federal Police-efforts which have received our support. But it would seem that this provision that I have been discussing, about not settling compensation matters upon appointment and settling them later on, could be open to abuse. It may allow for what I might call retrospective golden handshakes. I do not blame him for the outcome of the matter-I do blame him in the end result because of the advice he gave me at the end of the day-but I would say that it might also give rise to the type of farcical situation that the Government experienced in attempting to bring the appointment of the Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See, Mr Burke, to an end. </PARA>
<PARA> One day Mr Burke had resigned and his resignation had been accepted. The next day he had been dismissed. The day after, his appointment had been terminated. These are the sorts of things in which, if the manner in which the termination payment is to be paid is not settled correctly at the time of an appointment, there may be the sorts of cyclical confusions that occurred on the resignation, retirement, termination, dismissal, et cetera, in the case of His Excellency, the former Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See. </PARA>
<PARA> So it would seem appropriate that the amendment to section 26e be subject to a sunset clause. After the relevant date there should be a clear and unequivocal obligation on administrators to ensure that at the time of appointment questions relating to termination payments are settled once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA> The next query I have relates to clause 12a, which alters the protection given to cash dealers for incorrect reports of suspect transactions made pursuant to the provisions of section 16 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988. Under the amendments, a cash dealer will be protected for conduct carried out in the `mistaken belief' that such action is required by section 16. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that this is necessary as it has always been intended that cash dealers acting in `good faith' be protected. However, it seems to me that the phrase `mistaken belief' is wider than the phrase `good faith', and the former is not restricted to the bona fides of the relevant cash dealer. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the Attorney-General can explain to me why the amendment does not faithfully pursue the objective spelt out in the explanatory memorandum. Clause 12 (b) inserts into section 16 of the Act new subsections (5a) to (5c) to impose upon cash dealers an obligation of confidentiality, non-compliance with which will constitute a criminal offence. Under the amendments, an exception is provided whereby cash dealers may disclose such information either pursuant to the terms of the Act or to a court by way of evidence. However, I query why no provision has been made to allow cash dealers to make such disclosures to legal representatives in the preparation of court proceedings. At the moment, having regard to the existing terms of the Act, it is only the Cash Transaction Reports Agency, as opposed to cash dealers, which may make such disclosures to legal representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Another query I have with the amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act relates to clause 14, which seeks to amend section 23 of the Act. The amendment will alter the obligations of cash dealers to keep records so that they may retain copies, including microfiche copies, rather than original records. Although this change is undoubtedly a sensible and practical one, problems may well arise relating to the application of the best evidence rule, which requires the production of original documents in court proceedings. No doubt the Attorney-General, in considering the drafting of the Bill, has addressed the issue. I would be pleased to hear his comments on how the amendment may impact upon the best evidence rule. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to consider some of the policy issues involved in the Bill-a Bill, I might say to the Attorney-General, that I indicated we will not be opposing but to which we will be moving some amendments. In this respect I wish to make some comments about the National Crime Authority Act, the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Cash Transaction Reports Act. Part 8 of the Bill amends the National Crime Authority Act so that the Australian Capital Territory Government can participate in the activities of the intergovernmental committee. Among other things, the intergovernmental committee is responsible for making special references to the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority is at the moment conducting a comprehensive review of the Authority's activities. There have been reports that the intergovernmental committee, which is chaired by the Attorney-General, has put a submission before the parliamentary Committee suggesting that the parliamentary Committee be abolished and replaced by a judicial arbiter. I assume those reports are accurate and, if not, I am sure the Attorney-General will be able to clarify the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make it clear that the coalition would not entertain a suggestion that the parliamentary Committee be abolished. The workings of the parliamentary Committee are essential to ensuring that the Authority is made accountable to Parliament. This is particularly important given the wide powers that the National Crime Authority has and given that its operations are conducted, obviously and necessarily, in a secretive manner. Much of the criticism over past years that has been directed to the Authority has centred around a supposed lack of accountability. The abolition of the parliamentary Committee could only support such criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> It would also seem to me that the proposal to abolish the parliamentary Committee may well be contrary to the views of the Chairman of the National Crime Authority, Mr Justice Phillips. If I am wrong, perhaps I can be advised. I say this because of proposals that Mr Justice Phillips himself put forward in February of this year which are designed to make the National Crime Authority's operations more open and accountable. Central to the proposals put by him was the need to address the relationship between the Authority and the parliamentary Committee. At the time His Honour announced these proposals I issued a public statement saying that they had much merit and deserved careful and detailed consideration. Subsequent to that, by letter dated 21 February I made a submission to the parliamentary Committee expressing my in-principle support for those proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> I will briefly outline the proposals that have been made by Mr Justice Phillips and my response to them. First, His Honour suggested that section 51 of the Act-that is, the secrecy provisions-be amended so that they have no application to the workings of the Committee. I wholeheartedly agree with this proposition and, for the record, I note that in November last year the coalition resolved to support a private member's Bill introduced by Senator Noel Crichton-Browne which was designed to make it clear that the secrecy provisions had no application to the Committee's proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, His Honour has suggested that the words `a matter relating to' appearing in subparagraph 55 (2) (a) of the Act be deleted. Again, I agree that an amendment of this type is desirable as those words are problematical and leave room for doubt as to whether any given line of inquiry taken by the Committee may contravene the provisions of subparagraph 55 (2) (a). Clearly, the intent of these provisions is to ensure that the Committee does not investigate criminal activities. In my view, that intention would not be affected by the removal of those words. </PARA>
<PARA> The third proposal put forward by His Honour is that Committee members be subject to a statutory obligation of confidentiality. Again, I wholeheartedly agree with this suggestion. In my view it is simply a matter of commonsense that, should the Authority be more open in its dealings with the Committee, members of the Authority must have confidence that the Committee will treat sensitive information, particularly concerning any ongoing operations of the National Crime Authority, in an appropriate manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth proposal His Honour makes concerns the publication of sensitive material in the reports of the Committee. In particular, His Honour has suggested that should a dispute arise between the Committee and the Authority regarding publication such dispute should be referred to a judicial arbiter for determination. I think it is desirable that a non-litigious means of dispute resolution be available. I have some reservations as to whether determinations of an arbiter should be final and conclusive in all respects. In my view, it may be prudent to consider whether provisions should be made for rights of appeal, particularly, for example, appeals on questions of law. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in my submission to the Committee, this is a matter the Committee would be in the best position to consider in the light of its working relationship with the Authority. I also indicated that the proposal to refer disputes regarding publication to a judicial arbiter may have a wider application for other sorts of disputes between the Authority and the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Mr Justice Phillips has suggested that the provisions of subsection 25 (5) of the Act be amended so that the Authority may have discretion to conduct publicly hearings or parts thereof. Again, I agree with such an approach as it is often said that open hearings are an essential element for the fostering of public confidence in the administration of the criminal justice system. My only reservation is that it would be desirable to ensure that rights of review for aggrieved individuals are provided for in the event that a dispute arises as to the appropriateness of conducting an open hearing.</PARA>
<PARA> If there are said to be problems in the working relationship between the Authority and the parliamentary Committee, the way to resolve such problems would be, as Mr Justice Phillips has intimated, by addressing the legislation that governs the operations of both the Committee and the Authority. The suggestion by the Government and the intergovernmental committee to simply abolish the parliamentary Committee will have drastic ramifications for the accountability of the Authority and its operations. It is a suggestion that ought to be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to consider some aspects of the Cash Transaction Reports Act. On previous occasions I have made clear to the Attorney-General some of the concerns the coalition has with certain aspects of the Cash Transaction Reports Act. Let there be no doubt that the coalition is supportive of the objective of the Act, namely, tracing the money trail left behind by organised crime. In essence, the coalition is concerned with the overreach of some of the provisions in the Act. The approach the Act adopts is analogous to driftnet fishing; whilst it may catch some major criminal elements, it may do untold damage to many innocent individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken about the breadth of identification documents, I have written letters to papers, I have made speeches as to how absurd the situation has become at this juncture, where not even a birth certificate on its own appears sufficient to open a bank account and where a passport is not sufficient in itself. All these things will be attended to by us in government. </PARA>
<PARA> When I last spoke in the House I did call on the Attorney-General to consider reviewing the provisions of the Cash Transaction Reports Act together with the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act. It is interesting to note that in his second reading speech on the Bill that we are discussing tonight, the Attorney-General indicated that the Cash Transaction Reports Act would be `reviewed in 1993 in accordance with the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs'. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not entirely sure that those comments accurately reflect the recommendations made by the Senate Committee. If I could quote from paragraph 8.26 of the Committee's report:</PARA>
<PARA>In the case of the Cash Transaction Reports Bill, if it is enacted, the Committee considers three years from its commencement to be a suitable period of time. It considers that by that time the scheme proposed by the Bill will be fully operative, costs of implementation would have levelled out, and there would be some indication of the Bill's success or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA>The various schemes in the Act have been subject to staggered commencement dates. For example, the requirements relating to false-name accounts commenced on 1 July 1988; the requirements to report suspect transactions commenced on 1 January 1990; and the requirements to report significant cash transactions came into place on 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> On my reading of the recommendation by the Senate Committee, it would not seem open to conclude that the review is to be conducted in 1993. According to the Senate Committee, the review should be conducted within three years of the commencement of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> If there are any doubts about the matter, it may be appropriate that the Committee conduct its review in stages. For instance, it could immediately commence a review of the requirements of the Act relating to false-name accounts, and thereafter could proceed to consider the suspect transaction reporting obligations and so forth. This is a matter which my colleagues in another place may take up. We on this side of the House are certainly of the view that the earlier the review takes place, the better. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Proceeds of Crime Act. As with the Cash Transaction Reports Act, the coalition has some concerns about the overreach of certain aspects of the Proceeds of Crime Act. Again, the coalition is supportive of the objectives of both pieces of legislation, namely, the pursuit of the money trail, firstly, by tracing the proceeds of crime and, secondly, by removing the incentive for crime by confiscating the ill-gotten gains of illegal activity. </PARA>
<PARA> In February this year I raised with the Attorney-General the case of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation and the Director of Public Prosecutions against Kunz. Is the Attorney-General with me on this?</PARA>

<PARA> In the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation and the Director of Public Prosecutions against Kunz, Mr Justice Vincent of the Supreme Court of Victoria handed down his decision on 3 July 1990. In that case the Supreme Court was concerned with the purposes for which retraining orders should be used under the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act. The decision of Mr Justice Vincent raised a fundamental issue of policy: namely, whether the powers under the Act should be used in such a manner as to satisfy taxation liabilities or to otherwise ensure compliance with taxation laws. Mr Justice Vincent clearly rejected this proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> When I raised this case with the Attorney-General he indicated that it would be inappropriate to comment upon the policy issue, given that at that time His Honour's decision was subject to an appeal. I understand now that the appeal proceedings have been discontinued. In the light of that, I would ask the Attorney-General to advise the House as to what policy the Government has on this matter and whether it condones attempts to use the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act for taxation purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> I will conclude my comments by repeating my request to the Attorney-General that the Government give consideration to reviewing, at the earliest pos- sible time, the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Cash Transaction Reports Act. It is a question of striking a balance, if you will, between effective law enforcement and individual liberty. I acknowledge that this is not always easy to do. However, it is an objective that clearly we are obliged to pursue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) raised various matters. Leaving aside for a moment the policy matters, and leaving aside the somewhat tenuous connection between the proposed amendment-that is, the first one he spoke to, section 26e of the Australian Federal Police Act - and the case of the determination of the commission of Ambassador Burke, which I will deal with in a moment, I think that probably the best thing to do is to run through the various matters that he raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of the first matter raised by the honourable member for Kooyong-that is, section 26e-as has been indicated in the second reading speech and as I confirm tonight, the amendment to section 26e of the Australian Federal Police Act will improve the management-initiated retirement scheme. I must say I did not understand how it could in any way relate to some sort of procedure whereby something could happen which, I think the honourable member for Kooyong implied, might be somewhat sinister in relation to golden handshakes. What will happen under that section is that the amendment-and I think this is probably understood by the honourable member for Kooyong-will allow the Commissioner to make a determination of compensation when a member or a staff member is retired early, if such a determination was not in fact made at the time of the appointment. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr DUFFY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem in relation to that was something that I thought the honourable member for Kooyong was aware of. Currently that is a problem if the appointment, for some reason, is not validly made. All this is doing is bringing about an improvement within the Australian Federal Police Act related to management-initiated retirement, because currently, if an effective determination is not made on this matter at the time of the appointment, the Commissioner has no power to correct it. That is all it is in fact doing. All that the amendment does is allow the Commissioner to make a determination ending the person's appointment early. Currently, only the person who made the original appointment can make this determination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That would cause problems, as would be obvious, I would have thought, because appointment terms are for five to 10 years and the person who made the original appointment may not be available five or 10 years later to make the determination; and the amendment simply makes the provision more workable. It was an amendment to the provisions of the Australian Federal Police Act to improve the management initiated retirement scheme. On the direct point raised by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong, I repeat: currently if an effective determination is not made, which can happen for all sorts of reasons, the Commissioner has no power, in fact, to correct it. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kooyong made a point of trying to connect this matter with the termination of the commission of Ambassador Brian Burke as Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See. I would not, of course, take the point of relevance to this debate, but now that the Attorney-General has touched on this matter, I will say that one of the problems he has had with that whole issue-and I say this quite seriously-is that he has always seen something sinister in the Executive Council minute in respect of the termination of Ambassador Burke's commission. What the Executive Council minute said, as he has correctly stated from time to time, is that the commission of the ambassador was terminated. I would have thought that `terminated' simply meant `brought to an end'. There are two examples of how that could have happened. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Actually, I did not have to look at anything to ascertain what `terminate' meant; it was something that I had understood for a fair while. What `terminate' means and always has meant, as I said a moment ago, is `bring to an end'. There are two ways in which that could have been done; there are two examples that I can give to the shadow Attorney-General. Firstly, it could have been terminated on the basis of a resignation by the ambassador in the case that the shadow Attorney-General is referring to. Alternatively, it could have ended on the basis of a termination on the recommendation of the relevant Minister. In the case that now is being referred to, that would be the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). But I think it is worth making the point tonight, because I do not think it has been understood, that how it was terminated would not have made any difference. Whether the termination came to an end on the basis of a recommendation accepted by the Governor-General, a recommendation by the relevant Minister, or on the basis of a resignation, the Executive Council minute would be the same. It would say: `The commission of the ambassador has been terminated'; and `terminated' in that sense would mean simply `brought to an end'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The thing that seems to have concerned the honourable member for Kooyong about this over the period is that he always seems to have expressed the view that `terminate' was used in some way in order to protect the payment to be made to the ambassador at the end of his term. I just want to make it plain that all of the advice that I have seen on this indicates to me that that would have been paid irrespective of the way in which it had been done. I do not think that, in fact, the question that the termination--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Peacock" NAMEID="MI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr Peacock</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr DUFFY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow Attorney-General has made that point over and over again, and what I have said to him is that the termination of that appointment, irrespective of how it was done, would have read as it did in the Executive Council minute. As I said to the honourable member, on the advice available to me, there would have been no question that that termination payment would have been payable, whatever the reason for the termination taking place. Getting back to the Bill, because I diverted from that in order to attempt to clarify a couple of the matters that the shadow Attorney-General had raised in relation to that--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Peacock" NAMEID="MI4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr DUFFY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the shadow Attorney-General very much. The second matter he raised was clause 12(b), which relates to the Cash Transaction Reports Act; that is, the amendment to section 16. As he is aware, there is already an agreement in existence between cash dealers and the Director of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency that the suspect transaction reports are to be treated in strictest confidence. But the agreement has been placed on a statutory basis in compliance with the international anti-money laundering initiatives, and the G7 financial action task force report on money laundering recommended that financial institutions should not be permitted to warn their customers that a suspect transaction report is being made. That is a matter we have discussed before-not in relation to these amendments, but in relation to the Cash Transaction Reports Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The financial action task force report also recommended that financial institutions should not be permitted to warn customers that a suspect transaction report has been made. Apart from the given reason that such warnings might result in funds being placed through other undetectable channels, the present position places cash dealers in a potential conflict between their obligations under the Act and the duty to their customer. It is our view that the proposal to amend section 16 to include a direction that cash dealers must not inform the customer that a transaction will or has been reported under the provisions of section 16 is necessary for those reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the question of record retention by cash dealers-clause 14, amending section 23. The honourable member for Kooyong raised the problem of evidence. I must say that, as I understand the position, there is not any problem of evidence there. Those records are admissible and there is, in fact, provision for that type of evidence-that is, the records of bankers-to be admissible. Section 23 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act requires a cash dealer to retain original documents in relation to the account verification procedures, as the shadow Attorney-General indicated, and in relation to disclosure of commonly known names under the false name account provisions set out in section 24. </PARA>
<PARA> What we propose here is to amend section 23 to enable some documents to be retained in a copy form. During the period of consultations with representatives of financial institutions on this particular issue, in order to settle the requirements for account verifications procedure, there has been criticism-and I think the shadow Attorney-General is aware of this-of the present requirements based on what are alleged to be administrative difficulties and the cost of storage of large amounts of original documents. If copies were permitted, the documents could be stored on microfilm, which, as the shadow Attorney-General conceded, was probably a pretty sensible arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 23, as currently set out, appears to require the retention of originals of some documents, copies of which would be permitted under the Proceeds of Crime Act; and section 77 of the Proceeds of Crimes Act requires financial institutions to retain-I do not want to go through them all, but I will give the honourable member some examples-the original of each `essential customer generated financial transaction document', a copy of each `customer generated financial transaction document', and so it goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential customer documents that are referred to there create the problem. What we are saying here is that now we are moving to the stage where that amendment to section 23 is necessary because of what appears to me to be some reasonable criticism-without necessarily saying it is entirely correct-of the administrative costs and difficulties relating to the storage of documents where they cannot be copied, particularly, as we have indicated, in relation to the microfilm. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member may be proved to be correct, but I do not think he will be on that issue. I thank him for his good wishes. In respect to the other matter that the honourable member opposite raised, I go back to a previous discussion we had in this House back on 13 February where he referred at that stage to the decision of Mr Justice Vincent in the case of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation and the Director of Public Prosecutions v. Kunz. At that time I did refer the honourable gentleman to the view he expressed to me back in October 1990 when he indicated some detailed knowledge of this, a very complex area of law. I said then that I believed it would be inappropriate to amend the Proceeds of Crime Act at this stage. I still believe that it is better to take that view at this stage. My reply at that stage was couched fairly carefully for obvious reasons, which the honourable gentleman is aware of, and that was the question of the appeal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did mention on that occasion, and I repeat tonight, that that has been reinforced by the fact that there is a subsequent, and at that stage unreported, judgment on the same issue of Mr Justice Teague of the Victorian Supreme Court. In respect to the honourable gentleman's view on the Kunz matter, although the decision of Mr Justice Vincent in the Kunz case is no longer under appeal-and the honourable member opposite is correct about that-the subsequent decision of Mr Justice Teague that I referred to on the same issue, raising the same matter, is under appeal. The appeal books on that matter--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Peacock" NAMEID="MI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr Peacock</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr DUFFY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The appeal books have been lodged, and the appeal is unlikely to be heard before November of this year. It would be unwise in those circumstances to comment in respect of that matter. In fact, if we look at what was the unreported decision that we discussed back in February, Mr Justice Teague stated that both section 218 notices and orders under the Proceeds of Crime Act have a powerful intrusive effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> His Honour went on to say that he was satisfied that an order under the Proceeds of Crime Act had a greater priority than a section 218 notice in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary. There is another case of Kunz and Slade v. Director of Public Prosecutions and others, the judgment having been made in January 1991. Therefore I again disagree. It is on the same issue. I do not think that the time has come to say that the matter should be amended when appeal books have been lodged in the matter involving Mr Justice Teague in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to general policy, the honourable member raised an important matter in respect of the judicial arbiter and the National Crime Authority (NCA), and the matters under discussion between the intergovernmental committee and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority overseeing the operation of the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge for the first time, I suppose, this evening that the constructive attitude that the honourable member for Kooyong has adopted towards the NCA-and particularly the efforts of Mr Justice Phillips, as the Chairman of the National Crime Authority-has been appreciated by the Authority, as it has been appreciated by the Government, but when the Committee found itself in the position where in camera evidence became public, that created particular problems for the intergovernmental committee. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Kooyong is aware, but I think it ought to be put on record, the intergovernmental committee is a governmental committee involving Attorneys-General, and all Ministers for police, of all States and Territories of various political persuasions. The honourable member was not suggesting to the contrary, but there is nothing political about that committee. It is, in fact, very much a bipartisan committee in terms of its political structure. </PARA>
<PARA> That committee had very grave concerns about that matter, and that is why the committee put to the Parliamentary Joint Committee its view that we should revert to the judicial arbiter position. This, of course, is not a new position. That was the original position in the original Bill which, for reasons which may be repeated, the Senate altered. </PARA>
<PARA> A meeting is currently scheduled for 13 June, I think, in Melbourne of the intergovernmental committee and the Parliamentary Committee where all of those issues will be discussed. I take on notice the honourable member's view that things should remain the way they are, but I can assure him that there is a very strong view within the intergovernmental committee, subject to the discussions with the Parliamentary Committee, that the position in respect of the overseeing of the operation of the NCA should be changed. </PARA>

<PARA>(2) Page 4, after clause 11 insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA> Interpretation</PARA>
<PARA> ``11a. The following definition is inserted in subsection (1) of section 3 of the Principal Act:</PARA>
<PARA> `serious offence' for the purposes of paragraph 16 means:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a serious narcotics offence as defined in section 4 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987; murder, kidnapping or equivalent offences; an offence against section 81 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987; receipt, possession, concealment, disposition of or bringing into Australia any property, including money, that may reasonably be suspected of being proceeds of crime, being an offence against section 82 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987; or an offence against section 83 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987; and</PARA>

<PARA> ``(aa) by omitting from subparagraph (1) (b) (ii) `an offence' and substituting `a serious offence' ''. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) that similar amendments were moved in February 1991 this year but, in order to overcome the same question rule, the amendments now being moved have been recast so that, in effect, a different question is being put. Knowing the Attorney-General's quintessential undoubted powers of recall, he may well have picked up that these amendments have been before him. I just foreshadow that we have recast them so that any point he takes will inevitably fall to the ground. I would not wish him to meet with a lack of success before this Committee on that point. Having done that for him, perhaps he will listen to my plausible arguments and accept my amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 1 inserts a new subclause 2 (A) into the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). The purpose is to defer the commencement of provisions relating to section 16 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act, which are to be amended by amendment No. 2. Because amendment No. 2 alters the obligations imposed upon cash dealers with respect to the reporting of suspect transactions, it is necessary that the commencement of the changes be deferred so as to allow for the Cash Transaction Reports Agency to issue new guidelines about the reporting obligations under section 16, and for cash dealers to have sufficient time to familiarise themselves with the new changes. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 16 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act obliges cash dealers to make certain reports where they suspect that information they may have, amongst other things, may be relevant to the investigation or prosecution of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory. I emphasise that it is an offence against `a' law. The obligations imposed by section 16 relate to a wide range of offences, from the most trivial to the most serious. The amendment seeks to confine those obligations to information which may be relevant to a serious offence as defined. The effect of the amendment, if carried, will be to narrow the net cast by section 16. It will go some way towards alleviating the concerns held by many that section 16 as presently drafted poses very serious risks to civil liberties and unduly intrudes upon rights of individual privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> I get the feeling that the Attorney-General will not accept this amendment. He has not said so, but I get that distinct impression, on the basis of responses in the past on these kinds of points. As I recall it, on matters such as these, according to the Attorney-General there is a concern that the amendment, if carried, would force cash dealers to behave as investigators in order to determine whether the information may be relevant to a serious offence. </PARA>
<PARA> My reply to that is twofold. Firstly, cash dealers are already, in many respects, placed in the position of having to carry out investigative functions. Secondly, the amendment, if carried, will only relieve cash dealers of some of their more onerous obligations in ascertaining whether information may be relevant to `an offence against a law'-and I emphasise the word `an'. To narrow the ambit of section 16 can only make life easier for cash dealers. Narrowing the ambit of section 16 will confine its operation to the purpose intended, namely, the pursuit of the money trail left by organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 3 flows from amendment No. 2. Section 16 of the Act is to be amending by omitting from subparagraph 1(b) (ii) the words `an offence' and substituting the words `a serious offence'. The phrase `a serious offence' is defined in amendment No. 2 by reference to certain specified offences. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The premonition, if I can put it that way, of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), that his amendments are not acceptable is correct. What again he is attempting to do here is narrow the effect of section 16. The shadow Attorney-General wants to confine the effect of section 16 to serious offences because he says that `a Commonwealth law' is too wide and he wants to narrow it. He says that my objection to that is that it puts the cash dealer into an investigative role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To some extent I can understand what he is saying there, but I think it goes a bit further than that. It puts cash dealers into more than an investigative role if we say that within the terms of the Cash Transaction Reports Act they are only to report serious offences. It is not necessarily the investigative role that is the main problem, though that causes a lot of difficulties. The definition of `serious offence' in the interpretation provision of the proposed amendment would require, as I have said before in this place, a bank teller, for example, to be placed in the position of becoming somewhat of an expert in criminal law. We would probably get to a stage at which this section would become almost unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is reasonable to say that the remarks made earlier by the honourable member for Kooyong are correct in the sense that although he and those advising him have very cleverly recast the amendments, we have been through this before. My recall is that it has been dealt with in some detail and I do not propose to go through it again, other than to say that I think we would get to the stage where this section would be almost unworkable. We would be placing people in the position of saying `We will report this' or `We will not report this', depending on whether they thought it was a serious offence. </PARA>
<PARA> I previously quoted some examples of that. I do not want to go through them all again, but I shall give one example. To make those circumstances narrower for which a report must be lodged, as the amendment does, would require a cash dealer to carry out an examination, and even perhaps go to the stage of seeking legal advice, before deciding whether a matter would be reported. It would not work; it is just not practical, in my view. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons the Government cannot accept the amendments, not because the proposal has been dismissed out of hand but simply because, with the narrowing of the class of offence to a serious offence, as proposed, the exercise becomes that much more difficult, and perhaps even impossible, for a cash dealer. I am not being dismissive when I say that the proposal put forward previously and again tonight would just not work. In fact, I think it would defeat the purpose of the section. </PARA>

<PARA> (8) Page 20, omit ``SCHEDULE'', substitute ``SCHEDULE 2''. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments are very extensive and detailed, but they have previously been before the House in another form. Amendment No. 4 seeks to amend section 3 of the Crimes Act 1914 by adding at the end of the definition of `Commonwealth Officer' a reference to agents of the Commonwealth for the purpose of proposed sections 54, 55 and 56. Those proposed sections are contained within amendment No.= 5, which can be divided into two parts. It seeks to introduce into the Bill new clauses 21a and 21b. Clause 21a seeks to repeal sections 31 to 44 of the Crimes Act 1914 and to substitute new provisions relating to the administration of justice. Section 21b seeks to insert into the Crimes Act a new part IV dealing with bribery and corruption. </PARA>
<PARA> This really is a series of amendments that the Attorney-General can pick up. Here the Government has a report brought down by the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law, a committee chaired by the former High Court Chief Justice, Sir Harry Gibbs. I presented a private member's Bill that picked up the drafts recommended by this eminent committee, which is supported by the Government. As the Government's approach to law reform is somewhat glacial, it did not pick it up. Here is the second chance. The Attorney-General can now make his name as a great legal reformer in the field of criminal law and he does not have to do a thing but pick up these amendments tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The genesis is the fourth interim report of the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law, chaired by the former Chief Justice of the High Court. The Attorney-General can ignore all my previous speeches. He can just switch off what I am going to say now, save and except when I remind him that his own body has recommended these amendments. They are drafted. His officials do not need to do any more work. A simple yea instead of a nyet will get him into the record books as a great reformer in the field of criminal law. </PARA>
<PARA> All the Attorney-General has to do to achieve that tonight is to pick up these amendments. The Attorney cannot disagree with them; they have been so plausibly argued in the reports of the Gibbs Committee of Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law. The chamber will be aware that on 6 December last year I introduced into the House a private member's Bill designed to implement the recommendations of the Gibbs Committee. At the time I urged the Government to respond to the recommendations of the Gibbs Committee and support my private member's Bill. I do not give up; I felt that my appeals might fall on deaf ears, and they did. My private member's Bill was withdrawn from the Notice Paper last week and that allows me to introduce it here in the form of the amendments to the Bill now under consideration. I supply that information in case someone with a lofty notion of the Standing Orders seeks to have these amendments not put any further. That private member's Bill evaporated like the Government's hopes for the next election evaporated last week. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times the issue of institutionalised corruption has received enormous attention. The various State royal commissions and other inquiries, particularly the one in Western Australia that has caused the Government so much damage, and properly so, have highlighted the need to strengthen criminal laws relating to bribery and corruption. One voice of affirmative action would place the Government in a position of repute and it would come to any further discussions on WA Inc. with very clean hands if the Attorney were to pick up these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole question of bribery and corruption is particularly contentious given the Government's proposed ban, for example, on political advertising, which the Government says it will address or avoid the risk of institutionalised corruption at the Federal level. Time does not permit me to explain in any detail the absurdity of that proposition. Needless to say that, if this Government has a serious concern about corruption, it should move with the greatest speed to accept and implement the recommendations of the Gibbs Committee. The simplest way to do that would be to accept my amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the beneficial reforms contained within the amendments is the extension of the Crimes Act to trade union officials. Many honourable members, particularly those from Victoria, will be familiar with the so-called Tennis Australia saga, where it is said by some that a threat to impose industrial action if a donation of $10,000 were not forthcoming did not constitute the offence of demanding money by menace, blackmail or any other criminal offence. To put it mildly, I find that proposition to be spurious. In any event, if carried, my amendments would resolve the matter and would bring trade union officials within reach of the Crimes Act. Conduct of the type involved in the Tennis Australia saga would fall within the provisions of proposed part IV. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand the Attorney may be of the view that, instead of writing his name into the record books as a great reformer in criminal law in the attack on bribery and corruption, he will not take action to pick this up at this stage because he has not yet responded to the third report. Honourable members will recall that my amendments reflect recommendations in the fourth report of the Committee, and the Attorney, allegedly working his way through these reports seriatim, has not yet responded to the third report of the Gibbs Committee relating to the principles of criminal liability and the Committee will be handing down a final report later this year. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I inform the Attorney that my amendments do not rest upon the need to implement the recommendations of the third report. They do not alter the existing principles of criminal liability. That point was made in the fourth report. Furthermore, as the fourth report said, the recommendations could be implemented immediately and there is no need to wait for the Committee's final report. I could probably walk away from this Parliament a satisfied man tonight and I may even rethink the period I remain in this Parliament. So much work would be done by the Attorney simply picking up these amendments that his name would go into the record books. I would feel then that I had played a minor contributory role by moving these amendments, and the Attorney-General would be rested from a shadow Attorney-General who seeks to move amendments to everything the Attorney-General brings into this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Just think of the enlightened and detached approach that the Attorney-General would be able to take if he did not have me snapping at his heels. A simple affirmative answer to the question that the Chair will soon put will establish satisfaction all round and, more to the point, will write into the laws of this country a proper and effective approach to attacking bribery and corruption. If the Attorney-General says no it will not mean that he is not serious about these things; it will just indicate that he is again dawdling his way through law reform. This glacial approach is not acceptable, and I urge the Attorney-General to support us. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments Nos 6, 7 and 8 are of a consequential nature and flow from amendment No. 5. I await with great expectation the Attorney-General's response to the question that the Chair will put. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dealing firstly with the lighter side of the issues raised by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), it is not really a matter of writing one's name in the record books as he suggests that I could do by adopting these amendments. One would not want to encourage his departure from this place anyway. He started by saying that if he could get this up he would be happy to leave the Parliament this night. To go away, I thought he meant, and come back tomorrow. But then, by inference, I thought it was going to be a far grander gesture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The one thing he ought to understand by now-I have known him for about 30 years, which is a horrifying thought, and it is even more horrifying when one thinks that he has been here for most of that period-is that flattery will get him nowhere in relation to adopting amendments in order to write someone's name in the record books. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, I think the honourable member for Kooyong is wrong about this matter. Turning to the more serious aspects, I have to say that a lot of work has been put into these amendments that have been moved by the honourable member. I do not know whether he would admit it-perhaps he would say that the legislation to which I am about to refer has been redrafted cleverly-but they do have a very familiar ring to them and they sound similar to the terms of the Crimes (Bribery and Corruption) Amendment Bill 1990, which was a private member's Bill introduced by the honourable member for Kooyong. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments, or the Bill, whichever way one might like to refer to them, are based on the fourth interim report of the Gibbs Committee. They are really based on the model Bill that is contained in the fourth Committee report. That model Bill is, in turn, based on the principles of criminal responsibility which are recommended in the third report of the Gibbs Committee, and those principles are not based on existing law. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it extraordinary that the honourable member for Kooyong really wants to pursue that at this stage. What he really wants to do is pass a Bill which purports to implement parts of that fourth interim report of the Committee chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs. I do not know whether the honourable member for Kooyong disputes this fact, but the Bill relies on the criminal responsibility recommendations contained in the third report, which in turn, I think it is reasonable to say, may well result in entirely unintended consequences. I do not think the honourable member intends this to happen, but both sides of the House have had some experience of unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> This latter possibility is a very real concern because the proposed Bill is drafted on the premise of a set of principles of criminal responsibility that not only are different from the present scheme of Commonwealth criminal law but also may not be enacted, at least in their current form. We do not know about that at this stage. It should be added of course that the Gibbs Committee found the existing laws to be adequate to deal with offering and accepting bribes in circumstances involving a corrupt discharge of official duties or a corrupt failure to perform duties under the existing applicable principles of criminal responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Once these principles are reformed and formulated, the recommendations in the fourth interim report, including those concerning bribery and corruption, may need further review. It is true that everyone would like to see the reports of the Committee chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs dealt with-not, as the honourable member seriously put, at any glacial pace but as quickly as possible. We are attempting to do that. They have to be worked through in that way. I am surprised that the honourable member wants to pursue this on the basis, as I said earlier, that this Bill is undoubtedly drafted on the premise of a criminal responsibility that is not only different from the present scheme operating under Commonwealth criminal law but may not be enacted, at least in its current form. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated to the honourable member-and I will repeat it-the Gibbs Committee found the existing laws adequate. For that reason, until we have dealt with those reports-not in a glacial manner but as quickly as possible-all of these issues will be dealt with in a sensible way rather than our implementing legislation based on something which may well change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the House too long on the third reading, but I will exercise my right to say a few words. I could go on at great length expressing my disappointment that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) did not wish to pick up these amendments and be established in the minds of all those who follow law reform as one of the great performing Attorneys. I will not go on at great length about that. However, I will say, very seriously, that the Attorney is well aware of the regard and the respect I have for him. I do not in any way impugn him in the words I am going to say because I regard him as a man of principle-sometimes wrongly applied; but a man of principle-a man of candour and a man of honesty. But there are some in his Party who are not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The man who has just ceased to be the Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See is one whose credentials are open to question. Had the Attorney-General picked up those amendments tonight, the Government would have had an opportunity to consider charging Mr Burke because Mr Burke had received commissions while he was a Commonwealth officer. The evidence that has come out of the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters indicates that not only stamps and gold bars were accepted and played with by Mr Burke when he was Premier of Western Australia, but also that funds were being made available to him while he was an officer of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> By not accepting my amendments, the Attorney-General has tonight stepped away from giving himself the opportunity, should it present itself even further, to make prosecutions under a Commonwealth Act to tackle any breaches of the law that Mr Burke may have engaged in. Quite apart from the proper reforms that have been recommended by the committee chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs, it helped the Attorney-General by drafting the legislation. I add that the amendments I put in were taken from drafts that Sir Harry Gibbs attached to his report, aware of the glacial or snail's pace at which this Government moves in the field of law reform. The drafts were part of the report. All those drafts, prepared by some of the greatest legal brains in the land and put into this report so that the Attorney-General could just pick them up, bring them into the Parliament and enact them, I put before him tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Were it any other Attorney but him, I would have said that he did it deliberately to protect Mr Burke. Knowing him, I will not say that. But the consequence-as far as the Attorney-General is concerned, perhaps the unintended consequence-is that, by not supporting these amendments, he has thrown aside the opportunity of pursuing, in the course and name of justice, those who may have engaged in activities that are certainly contrary to the proper execution of their duties. He could have done it by simply picking up my amendments. I regret that he did not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will reply very briefly to the matters raised by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). Firstly, it is unfortunate that, whilst he does not direct those comments at me personally, he should suggest that anyone on this side of the House-and I reject it entirely-has been concerned for any reason other than that which I stated tonight not to pick up what is basically the Crimes (Bribery and Corruption) Amendment Bill 1990, that is, the private member's Bill previously produced and basically contained in these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I stated earlier that those amendments contain basically the model Bill in the fourth interim report of the Gibbs Committee. I said that, in turn, that model is based on principles of criminal responsibility recommended in the third report. Those principles are not based on existing law. I have to repeat that because of the allegations made by the honourable member for Kooyong. Therefore, to pass a Bill which purports to implement parts of that fourth interim report, relying on criminal responsibility recommendations contained in the third report which may need refining as part of the development of a model code, may well result in entirely unintended consequences. I have to repeat that because of the allegations made. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I think the honourable member for Kooyong did not have in mind the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters when he introduced his Bill. He introduced his Bill with what one can only say was a genuine desire to do something in the area-I am not disputing that-of bribery and corruption, which is certainly not something that could ever be directed at the honourable member for Kooyong. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that once again in this House we are having things said about someone-in this case, the former Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See-based on evidence given before a royal commission. The honourable member for Kooyong and most honourable members of this House do have concerns-and if they do not, they should-about allegations that are made about various people in royal commissions. Someone from that side of politics may find themselves, not too far down the road, faced with the sort of publicity that Brian Burke has been faced with over the past few months. When the Royal Commission concludes, and when and if any charges are laid and prosecutions take place, is the time to talk about these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that I did respond to the proposal to write my name in the record book by somehow adopting his Bill. However, I want to write my name in the record book in another way, by saying that I am not prepared to be part of the vilification of anyone-be they from this side of politics or, I can assure the House, from that side of politics-by way of allegations made before royal commissions until they are fully tested, all the evidence has come out and the matter is concluded one way or the other, as it should be. </PARA>

There is one solitary Queenslander here who may find it of great interest; but there are a couple of Victorians who follow real football.

<PARA> As I have been sitting waiting for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill 1991 to be called on, I have been contemplating the fact that the Bill provides a good opportunity to demonstrate that, in many significant areas of environment policy, there is a bipartisan stance and no significant political dispute. Any sense of satisfaction I had about that was eased by the fact that I do not think that means very much to the very few members who are here for the debate and for the three people in the visitors gallery. It seems a rather small number of people to satisfy on this point. </PARA>
<PARA> However, on opening I make the point that the area of the environment has been one of considerable politicisation over recent years, and at times I think the substance of the debate has been lost in the politics of the debate. Tonight is an opportunity to note the strong bipartisan support that there has been over the past 15 years or more for the preservation of one of Australia's great natural assets, the Great Barrier Reef. This Bill, which adds another degree of protection to the reef, has the unqualified support of the Opposition. Whilst it is a fairly limited extension of the protection which has been given to the reef by a variety of means--</PARA>
<PARA> (Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, a large number of people seem to have come into the chamber who were interested in the football match, the result of which was recently announced. Let me say that I congratulate those honourable members who were supporting the winners and commiserate with those honourable members who were supporting the losers, whoever they may have been. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill, this Bill is intended to decrease the risk of oil and other toxic substances damaging the Great Barrier Reef by requiring all ships over a certain length and carrying specified cargoes to carry pilots while in reef waters. In fact, it is aimed at the 10 per cent of about 2,000 ships in the specified cargo and size categories which the Government says-and which the Opposition accepts-are not adhering to the current voluntary system of pilotage. </PARA>
<PARA> This law follows efforts made by the Australian Government to obtain international acceptance of the need to protect these particularly sensitive waters. Again, as I shall indicate later in my speech, those efforts certainly had the support of the Opposition. We behaved in a way which we believed would maximise the Government's chances of success in this regard. We are delighted that there was success. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, the Bill has a limited impact because it simply covers the 10 per cent of shipping that was not complying with the voluntary ban. When we look at the potential risk and at the risk of damage to the reef, the Opposition certainly accepts the move in this direction as worth while. The legislation has our unequivocal support. </PARA>
<PARA> The measure is but one in a series which has been undertaken over the past 15 years. I remind the House of the efforts of an ex-colleague of yours, Mr Deputy Speaker, my old friend David Thompson, who I think was famous in the coalition for his announcement when he was the Minister for Science and Technology that there would be no drilling on the Barrier Reef. Subsequently, under the coalition Government, the Great Barrier Reef was inscribed on the World Heritage List on 26 October 1981. Of course, in addition, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park had been established in 1975. There has been a history of cooperation in ensuring that this national treasure is preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of more recent efforts to support and defend the reef, the Government brought forward legislation in 1990 to close the loophole allowing boat operators to increase Green Island visitors. Again, that had the support of the Opposition. Earlier this year, we had legislation to deal with the surrender of exploration permits within the marine park. Subject to our concerns that any issues of compensation should properly be dealt with, that also had the support of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is instructive to note that it is not only at the political level that the additional restrictions which are being imposed by this legislation are being supported. I was pleased to find that the advice which the Opposition obtained from industry sources with respect to the legislation confirmed the universal view that this was a worthwhile measure. Indeed, the Australian Chamber of Shipping advised that it has been its policy since 1978 that ships using the sensitive waters should have the assistance of a pilot. It drew my attention to the fact that at a meeting of the managing committee of the Chamber on 13 November 1978 the following was provided:</PARA>
<PARA>The meeting strongly recommends that vessels with minimum under-keel clearance use the services of a pilot in Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA>The Chamber assures me that that has been its consistent policy since that time and it supports this measure. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same way, the Australian National Maritime Association advised the Opposition that it supports the requirement to carry licensed pilots on ships transiting those areas of the Great Barrier Reef which have been designated as particularly sensitive areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, it is perhaps a little out of line with the general perception of how the debate on environmental matters proceeds in this country that one of the issues which was raised by industry representatives was whether the legis- lation was sufficiently broad in its geographic application. We received representations which suggested that there were other areas which should be subject to the pilotage requirements. We made inquiries about those representations and we were advised-and it appears to be correct-that there are international law reasons why the restrictions cannot be broader than is provided by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is worth putting that on the record because the position is that we get a great deal of stress in the debate on environmental issues between those who are concerned with industry and economic matters and those who are concerned with environmental matters. This is one of the many examples of real cooperation and real community purpose between all of those who are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> Other elements will be brought into this debate by my colleague the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) who, with his responsibilities for shipping matters in the Opposition, will be examining what might be regarded as the micro-economic aspect of the provision of pilots. I want to make the point that the concerns which he will be raising on behalf of the Opposition in no way qualify our support for the principle that there should be pilotage in these sensitive waters. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues which are to be raised by the honourable member for Gilmore go to the question of whether the means of obtaining pilots, and the restrictions which are imposed in terms of the supply of pilots, in fact represent the most efficient means that could be adopted. I will not trespass on the ground that he intends to cover in what will be a short debate. I simply make the point that in the Opposition's consideration of these matters that has been looked at as a matter of economic efficiency which in no way impinges on our support for the principle that there certainly should be pilots in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the virtues and the value of the Great Barrier Reef are very well known in this chamber. It is, in fact, one of the world's most diverse marine ecosystems. It is an area which provides a home to some 1,500 species of fish and 350 types of hard coral. When one compares it with other areas which are highly regarded-for example, in the Caribbean there are only about 500 types of fish and 40 corals-after Greenland, the area of the Great Barrier Reef is the planet's biggest protected area. We have about 2,900 individual reefs spread over 344,000 square kilometres of ocean, an area larger than Britain. It is a matter of some satisfaction that there is at both State and Federal government levels, on all sides of politics and within the community a total commitment to seeing the preservation of this area. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to one of the truths about environmental protection that I think is too little debated in this country. It is one thing to set aside these very substantial areas, and over the last decade, both at sea and on land, very considerable areas have been set aside and labelled as areas of particular environmental significance. One of the things that follows from that sort of labelling or classification is that there is an ongoing and, indeed, permanent obligation to provide adequate plans of management, to provide adequate on the ground management, and to accept the responsibility for the very considerable expenditure that is involved. It is one thing to say that there is political acceptance of the need to protect these areas; it is another thing to say that there will be the political will to provide the resources required to ensure that the natural values are preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the Great Barrier Reef area is one of the less well off areas of natural value in that regard. Having visited the Daintree, for example, I would suggest that there is an area that is grossly undermanaged and grossly under-resourced. It will be interesting to see what the Authority that has been established by the State of Queensland and by the Commonwealth will be able to accomplish to remedy that. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me to be totally unsatisfactory to have an area that is so widely regarded and, in a legal sense, so strongly protected in such a poor state of administration and care. There is very little sign of the level of management and of resources that would be required to maintain it in the state that makes it a long term investment for Australia and for the world. The Daintree is an area I mention in contradistinction to the resources of the reef because it is, of course, relevant to the reef. Some of the concerns that are felt about the future of the Great Barrier Reef area relate to the problems of siltation and so on that flow from the undermanagement of the Daintree area. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a general point: it is one thing to make the political gesture of reserving an area; it is another thing to deliver on the long term management and preservation obligation that flows from that. I mention that in the context of the present Government's attempts to meet what is perceived to be an inadequate resource base for the management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park by the imposition of additional fees on those who use it. This is an area that attracts enormous tourist use. It is probably fair to say that one of the major threats to the reef is not just the threat of ships going aground and having oil spills but the rather more insidious and persistent threat of the feet and other parts of tourists who use the reef for their enjoyment and wonderment. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House of the recent attempts by the Government, which at first appeared to be successful, to obtain support from the State Government on the imposition of additional fees and the subsequent withdrawal of that view by the Premier of Queensland, Mr Goss-a withdrawal that was regarded with considerable sympathy by the Opposition because of the quite difficult situation of many of the tourist operators. It is probably fair to say that 1990-91 is not a particularly good time to be imposing additional cost burdens upon people in the tourist industry in Queensland or elsewhere. The economic situation of many individual operators is very difficult, in common with the difficulties that are being experienced by business throughout the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that those people are experiencing difficulties does not remove the reality that additional resources are required if the reef is to be protected. One is again reminded of the fact that if we are to have the levels of environmental protection that are demanded by the Government's rhetoric and, indeed, demanded by the Australian people, who are concerned to see the natural environment maintained and preserved, particularly those areas of high environmental significance such as the Barrier Reef, there is no escaping the need to find resources to meet the task. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had some very interesting conversations with people who have been long involved in the conservation movement. They have suggested to me that the push for World Heritage listing, for example, in some areas of Australia is a push that is at least in part, and some would say in large part, motivated by the desire to see better management plans in place and, even more importantly, additional resources attracted to enable proper management to be undertaken of areas so that they will not simply be degraded over time. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the chamber that, if we are to achieve our environmental objectives which are so easily tossed off by politicians, it is very important to match the rhetoric with reality including the provision of adequate resources. In the present economic circumstances in Australia where we are seeing governments, both State and Federal, suffering real budgetary difficulties, the reality is that authorities which are charged with the responsibility of the management of these sensitive areas are hard pressed financially as well. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very difficult environment in which to attract the additional resources that people might wish to see, whether it is for additional research into the crown of thorns starfish, to take an example which is relevant to the reef, or in the provision of the sort of manpower and I think public works which are required to see an area like the Daintree preserved if people are to continue using that area as they are at present. I simply wish to roll this thought up with the view that good environmental protection is in fact closely allied with economic success. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a truism to say that the poverty stricken countries of the Third World are those where we are most likely to find extremes of environmental degradation. We have just emerged from the period where the opening up of central Europe has reminded us that, even in long established industrial societies where the economies are badly run and resources are difficult to come by, environmental degradation is the norm. Even here, in fortunate Australia, a country which is not overcrowded and is blessed with a splendid environment in many respects, the truth is that very considerable resources are required if we are to meet the environmental challenges we have.</PARA>
<PARA> I say on behalf of the Opposition that we will always join with the Government in measures such as those which have been brought forward with respect to the Barrier Reef, and I have mentioned three tonight, because we wish to see appropriate laws in place. But I remind the chamber that, if we are to meet the really significant environmental challenges that we face not just on the reef but across the whole Australian land mass-and I pick for mention the question of soil conservation, the degradation of our soils, and the reduction of our water quality-the truth is that we need to have a very healthy economy if we are to produce the sort of surplus that is required to put resources to work. </PARA>
<PARA> In talking over recent months with people who are concerned with that, the premier environmental problem that Australia faces, I have been struck by the depth of their concern about the lack of resources to deal with those very broad problems. The point was made to me very tellingly that the sort of reconstructive work which is undertaken by, say, a mining operation such as Alcoa-work which received recognition at the United Nations level just a year or so ago-is possible because of the high value which is being achieved by the exploitation of that country. </PARA>
<PARA> A rather telling contrast was made to me about the problem of dealing with, say, an outback station which might be half a million acres or a million acres in area and which might be producing an income somewhat akin to that produced on a couple of thousand hectares or even less in a more settled and richer pastoral or agricultural area. The reality is that we face very, very substantial and high cost environmental problems which are not as glamorous as the Barrier Reef and which do not have the capacity to carry some of the costs because of tourist income that can be generated and so on. If we are over the next decade to have the capacity to divert resources to deal with those problems we will really need to have a more effective approach to economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> I make that point because too much of the environment debate in this country is isolated from the reality of economics and from the pressures which economic mismanagement and economic failure place upon environmental management. We had an example of it recently when dealing with the issue of recycling in the context of a report of the Industry Commission. The point was made in that report that one thing that inhibits the recycling of paper in Australia is the very high transport and port costs which make it too expensive to do things which would otherwise be environmentally friendly. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a relatively easy task for this Parliament to pass laws that will provide the very necessary physical protection for the reef, and again I express the wholehearted support that the Opposition has given to this process through to this point of legislating. If we are really concerned about our capacity in the long term to preserve the sort of thing that is being protected by this framework of legislation, we really do have to look to economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> I close by making the point that I have said often enough, both in this place and elsewhere, that the environment debate in this country has been somewhat debased and overpoliticised. It has been debased by its overpoliticisation. I use this as an example of the approach that the Opposition is seeking to adopt to ensure that matters are dealt with in substance and simply not treated as matters of short term politics. </PARA>
<PARA> I first became involved in this issue of ensuring compulsory pilotage in the Great Barrier Reef area when I received representations from the Australian Conservation Foundation. Those representations came from the Atherton Tablelands branch and seemed to be very sensible representations which certainly caused me concern. I took up the matter with the department and sought a briefing because it seemed to me that, whilst it would be perhaps of short term interest to me to issue a press release about what was drawn to my attention as a problem that had not been dealt with, it would be a good idea to get the facts straight before I actually ran out and played politics with it. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the very great readiness of Mr Kelleher to make himself available and to explain the position. He briefed me and made the point that both the department and the Authority were in fact engaged in a quite delicate international exercise to obtain international support for a measure of compulsory pilotage. The view was expressed that, given that the Chairman of the Marine Park Authority would shortly be presenting a paper to the meeting of the International Maritime Organisation in Sweden with the aim of getting that organisation to regard the reef world as a particularly sensitive area, we might withhold any action which might cause any outside concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern was expressed to me that there were a number of other countries rather adverse to Australia's approach in this matter and it was thought that it would not be helpful to make this matter a political controversy. So, I reported to the Australian Conservation Foundation in September last year on the outcome of those discussions and offered the assurance that the Federal Opposition would support strongly the need for pilotage. I said that the chances of a major catastrophe were simply too great and any controllable area of risk should be closed off. I said that, depending on how matters developed, whilst I would expect to have something to say publicly eventually, I was refraining from so doing at that stage to avoid arousing unnecessarily the concerns of some of the major nations whose sensitivities I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply offer that as some earnest of the Opposition's desire to cooperate with the Government and, indeed, with anyone else who is pursuing what we think are objectives which are genuinely aimed at achieving environmental protection in this country. I repeat the view that there has been excessive politicisation of many of these issues. They are often difficult issues. Fortunately, this is a straightforward one with which we are dealing tonight. Often there are difficult issues involving difficult trade-offs. I ask the Government to examine its own record in this regard and to adopt in future an approach which is more concerned with the substance of issues and less with the theatre. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill implements a scheme of compulsory pilotage for ships which constitute a potential threat to the environment of the Great Barrier Reef. The measures contained in this Bill will improve the protection of one of the world's greatest assets and Australia's most treasured natural attraction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Great Barrier Reef is the largest system of corals and associated life forms anywhere in the world. It commences just north of Fraser Island and extends 2,000 kilometres along the east coast of Queensland. It covers an area of 348,700 square kilometres on the continental shelf of Australia. The Great Barrier Reef is acknowledged as an area of unique biological diversity and as an area of great natural beauty and wonder. A greater part of the Great Barrier Reef has been placed on the World Heritage List. Most Australians believe strongly that the Great Barrier Reef is a region requiring the highest possible level of environmental protection. As the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) said in her second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has noted with concern the effects of spillages of oil and other toxic substances on the marine environment around the world and is of the view that such risks to the Great Barrier Reef should be minimised as much as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government has had a longstanding concern to improve the protection of the Great Barrier Reef against possible spillages of oil and other toxic substances. For many years the Federal Government has encouraged the users of passages through the Great Barrier Reef to avail themselves of pilotage when and if it is available. The Department of Transport and Communications took the view that there could be difficulties at law, for example, in requiring compulsory pilotage on the high seas and that a unilateral declaration of compulsory pilotage would probably have been rejected by the International Maritime Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding that, the Department pursues with the International Maritime Organisation a recommendation that pilots be carried on vessels carrying oil or noxious or hazardous substances in the Barrier Reef waters. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has been a strong supporter of compulsory pilotage for ships on reef waters. The Queensland Coast and Torres Strait Pilots Service has also been a strong supporter of compulsory pilotage. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works recommended in a report relating to the provision of navigational aids on Hydrographers Passage in the Great Barrier Reef that the Department of Transport pursue through the International Maritime Organisation an agreement to compulsory pilotage in Hydrographers Passage, which is just north of Mackay, with a system of exemptions, on examination, for suitably experienced masters. The Public Works Committee was conscious that pursuing this matter with the International Maritime Organisation would take considerable time and urged that Australia consider making a unilateral declaration for compulsory pilotage, subject to a favourable opinion from the Attorney-General's Department as to the legality of such a course of action. Furthermore, the Department of Transport and Communications stated in evidence that in its view the 1958 Convention on the High Seas provided a procedure by which special laws could be made for special areas. The Committee noted that `it would seem to the Committee that the Great Barrier Reef would qualify as a special area'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that, when the reference on Hydrographers Passage was referred to the Public Works Committee in October 1983, the then member for Darling Downs, the Hon. Tom McVeigh, urged the Government to proclaim compulsory pilotage in the area of Hydrographers Passage. His comments referred strongly to environmental protection of the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA> The subject of compulsory pilotage in reef waters has been discussed over a long period of time. In 1978, for example, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, in its report entitled Oil Spills, recommended, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Government at an international as well as national level encourage the acceptance of compulsory pilotage for all oil tankers and other types of vessels over 10,000 tonnes in areas where detailed local knowledge is required for safe navigation. </PARA>
<PARA>It was just three years ago that the Federal Government made recommendations to the International Maritime Organisation to introduce a system of voluntary pilotage-a system which was embodied in resolution A.619 (15). This resolution recommends that ships of 100 metres in length and over and all loaded oil tankers, chemical carriers or liquefied gas carriers, irrespective of size, use pilots when navigating the Torres Strait, the inner route of the Great Barrier Reef, the Great North East Channel and Hydrographers Passage. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time it was only the second place in the world where the International Maritime Organisation had adopted a similar resolution. When the resolution recommending a system of voluntary pilotage was adopted by the International Maritime Organisation, the Government hoped that this recommendation would induce all responsible shippers to carry pilots on their ships when transiting the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendation has succeeded in having 90 per cent of the relevant vessels voluntarily carry pilots. However, many vessels have ignored, or by virtue of length are not covered by, this recommendation. Approximately 10 per cent of the vessels covered by the recommendation continue to transit the defined area of the reef without a pilot. </PARA>
<PARA> There are approximately 200 unpiloted transits per year. One of the chief offenders has been the United Kingdom. Many people would have suspected that shippers using flags of convenience, for example, Liberia and Panama, would be likely offenders, but in fact the United Kingdom has been one of the worst offenders. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet luck has held with the Great Barrier Reef. Since the Torrey Canyon disaster in 1969, there has not been a serious spill of any kind on the reef. This good fortune can be attributed to the excellent work being performed by the Department of Transport and Communications in the provision of navigation aids and its insistence that the rules of navigation be adhered to. Nevertheless, an accident similar to that of the Torrey Canyon disaster could have happened at any time. Furthermore, although ships now possess satellite navigation systems and are able to identify their position within 100 metres on the earth's surface, the old navigation Admiralty charts have some reefs marked more than 10 kilometres from their true location. </PARA>
<PARA> Zoning plans produced by the Great Barrier Marine Park Authority using satellite imagery have standard errors of less than 100 metres. Therefore, the zone plans are far more accurate than the Admiralty charts. Whilst a ship could have an accurate identification as to its position, it could easily run up against a reef because of the simple fact that the reef was not where it was marked on the old Admiralty charts. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure of a number of shippers to comply with the voluntary scheme could not be allowed to continue. The Government then decided to introduce a scheme of compulsory pilotage. In addition, as there have been a number of groundings of ships in the 70 to 100 metres range in recent years-certainly at least one per year-the ship length requirement will be reduced to 70 metres. </PARA>
<PARA> This new scheme will not encompass the Torres Strait and the Great North East Channel. These straits are used for international navigation and therefore attract the right of transit passage. Nevertheless, the great majority of ships using the Torres Strait and the Great North East Channel would be covered by the requirement for compulsory pilotage as ships transiting the inner routes of the Great Barrier Reef normally pick up or set down pilots at the western extreme of Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA> As Australia is a nation which supports the responsible application of international law and international cooperation, the Government sought endorsement of its proposal for compulsory pilotage from the international maritime organisation.

<PARA> An editorial entitled `Justice at last' in the Brisbane Courier-Mail on 7 September last year said in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The view that the Commonwealth has behaved with despicable bureaucratic self-interest in the Voyager case would result in very little argument in the general community. The High Court ruling . . . paving the way for compensation claims by the survivors of that horrific 1964 naval accident is a signal victory for social justice. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth long denied liability for compensation. Mr Hawke's first government lifted the statute of limitations on the case in 1985, then slammed the door when it found there might be substantial compensation claims in the offing. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>About 80 survivors of the Voyager now are eligible to lodge claims to be compensated for the nightmare-</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The ruling means that the Commonwealth as the employer of people paid to defend the country cannot claim exemption from civil compensation if they come to harm in the course of normal duties. This is an important precedent. It is also elementary justice. </PARA>
<PARA>I regret to say that the path to justice once again has been obstructed. This is best illustrated in a recent letter I had from Jim Taylor, one of the claimants' counsel, which says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Is the Government aware that in the Victorian Supreme Court on Wednesday 8th May on the third day of the Voyager trial (Clark -v- Commonwealth) the legal representatives of the Government sought and succeeded in having a Jury discharged because of possible prejudice to the Commonwealth by Counsel's opening address? Portions of the address were widely publicised in newspapers. In Counsel's address to the Jury the Commonwealth's conduct in seeking to relitigate all the Verwayen issues which case the Commonwealth lost in Verwayen -v- The Commonwealth (High Court 5th September, 1990):</PARA>
<PARA> (i) ``were described as being ``scungy'' tactics . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) ``that the survivors had been engaged by the Commonwealth in a ``battle'' far more serious than any they were likely to have ``fought in their service in the Navy; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) ``that the Commonwealth was pertinacious-</PARA>
<PARA>which I understand means wrongly persistent-</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) in not accepting that the decision in Verwayen applied to all ``survivors of the collision. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . these comments were made in the light of known conduct of the Commonwealth and in the light of comments previously made by O'Bryan J. in the Supreme Court of Victoria in Verwayen's case . . . whereby His Honour stated . . . is most unfortunate and reflects poorly upon the conduct of the Defendant.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Clark issued his Writ in August, 1985 on the faith of the promises made by the Commonwealth and six years later the Commonwealth are fighting the whole issue over again in spite of their loss in Verwayen's case which was regarded by everyone as a test case. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, Jim Taylor finishes with two questions. Firstly:</PARA>
<PARA>Why will the Commonwealth not accept the verdict of the umpire i.e. the High Court decision that Verwayen and those like him were entitled to have their cases tried and to have the solemn promise made by the Commonwealth to them adhered to?</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly:</PARA>
<PARA>Is it the policy of the Government to continue to treat members of the defence forces in this shabby fashion? Is this really the Government's policy or is the nose of some bureaucrat being put out of joint in these matters?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to make a couple of remarks and observations about the New South Wales State election results in the Illawarra region last weekend. In what was an unprecedented swing back to the Australian Labor Party in the Illawarra, for the first time in quite some time we saw the Labor Party's first preference votes increase significantly in the five seats which are identified with the Illawarra. Most importantly, we saw the demise of an Independent who had held the position as the member for Wollongong, certainly for the last two terms of government. That in itself was an underlying trend which existed in most parts of New South Wales on Saturday, 25 May-that is, the demise of Independents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the case of the Illawarra we saw that the incumbent, the Lord Mayor, Alderman Frank Arkell, was finally seen for what he has been for quite a long period of time-a very shrewd politician and a very shrewd tactician, but somebody whom the people of Wollongong at long last recognised could not deliver the goods and someone who, in fact, took credit for a lot of initiatives and a lot of groundwork that were delivered either by Federal Labor governments or by State Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Illawarra we saw first preference votes of the order of 53.5 per cent-plus recorded in the seats of Bulli, Keira, Kiama and, indeed, Wollongong and 62.5 per cent in the seat of Illawarra. This demonstrates clearly the absolute abhorrence of the people of Illawarra for the attitude displayed towards our region by the Greiner Liberal Government during the last 3 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Without doubt, in my view, it is one of the most appalling records of any government's neglect and absolute wanton malaise inflicted upon a region such as our own, simply because in the 1988 change of government from Labor to the coalition in New South Wales the people of the Illawarra showed good sense and did not change their vote, unlike places like Newcastle and western Sydney. To the credit of the people in those other areas of New South Wales, they saw the folly of their ways on 25 May and, indeed, came back to the fold with a vengeance. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the Illawarra, I would like to commend the local Labor Party candidates for the excellent campaign that was run. Ian McManus in Bulli, Terry Rumble in Illawarra, Bob Harrison in Kiama, Gerry Sullivan in Wollongong and Colin Markham in Keira have certainly delivered to the people of our region and will continue to do so in what may yet be a new Labor government in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case, the fact has to be recognised that the sorts of claims that the incumbent, Frank Arkell, had made about the activities that he was able to institute, and the work and employment generation that he himself took full credit for in the State seat of Wollongong and, indeed, throughout the whole of the Illawarra, were exposed for what they were-simple, hollow rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> The grain handling facility, the State office block, the Commonwealth office block, the announcement of a new taxation office for the Illawarra, a range of employment initiatives, the construction of the Brandon Park sporting complex, the construction of the Croome Road sporting complex in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and so on were all initiatives of Federal Labor or State Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Greiner Government gave us the closure of the Tallawarra power station, the closure of hospitals and hospital wards, the closure of the Huntley coalmine, and massive increases in unemployment because of the policies it adopted. It continually turned its back on pleas for infrastructure developments such as the Maldon-Dombarton rail link, which would bring economic benefit to the region; it continually turned its back on the development of an alternative road access to the Illawarra via Caloola Pass; and it constantly turned its back, in the arrogant fashion for which it has become known, on all the pleadings of the people of the Illawarra. </PARA>
<PARA> On Saturday, 25 May, the people of the Illawarra returned to the Labor fold. They will be served well by the State Labor members who have been elected. It will be my pleasure and that of the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) and the honourable member for Throsby to work closely with them. We in government-and hopefully they too as State members in government-will work for the betterment of the people of the Illawarra. They will be rewarded for their continuing loyalty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to bring to the attention of the House the ridiculous way in which the Child Support Agency is being administered. Unfortunately, the administration of child support no longer bears any relationship to commonsense. I am particularly concerned about the decisions made by the Child Support Agency in relation to Mr Kym Dart of Cressy in Tasmania. Mr Dart is a non-custodial parent responsible for three children. He freely acknowledges his responsibilities to his children and has always done everything possible to provide for their proper care and upbringing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The children are in the care of their mother and, following the separation, both parents came to an amicable arrangement for the maintenance of the children that was quite adequate to care for the children. But that was before the advent of the Child Support Agency. The Agency now insists that Mr Dart pay 32 per cent of his gross earnings in child support, regardless of how much the actual cost of maintaining the children might be and regardless of whether their mother wants the money or not. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dart works 50 to 60 hours per week as a self-employed motor mechanic. He is working long hours in order to rebuild his life and, hopefully, to be able to remarry. However, as his earnings increase so too does the amount of money demanded by the Child Support Agency. Prior to July this year, Mr Dart has regularly paid $624.75 per month, but from August onwards the amount jumps to $967.17 per month. The increase means that the figure of $48 per week per child now jumps to $75 per week per child. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase has been determined without reference to Mr Dart and has been based on figures provided by him in his last tax return. The fact that his taxation figures can be used in this way, without his knowledge or his prior approval, is a blatant and, in my view, totally unacceptable abuse of the privacy and confidentiality that should normally be attached to taxation returns. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dart has been told by the Child Support Agency that the only way he can obtain relief from its decisions is to quit his business and go on the dole. It might sound totally warped and beyond the imagination of members of the House, but I assure the House that this is what is happening and that this is the advice being given by the Child Support Agency. Mr Dart is only one of many people who are being unfairly disadvantaged by the Child Support Agency, but those people who are disadvantaged have no recourse to proper appeal procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that the Child Support Agency regularly chooses to interfere in custody cases where the non-custodial parent is willingly honouring an obligation to the children and very often where an amicable arrangement has been arrived at between both parents and is working very well. However, the evidence that comes into my office suggests that the Agency will not provide assistance to locate and extract money from irresponsible parents who are not honouring their obligations and in a great many cases the custodial parent is left to cope as best he or she can without any help from the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly suggest to the Government that this most inappropriate body, the Child Support Agency, should be scrapped, because it is nothing more than a rort for arrogant and incompetent bureaucrats. The facilities of the Family Court of Australia should then be expanded so that all matters relating to child maintenance can be decided and administered by the court, where they would be more appropriately handled. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak of a very important event which took place on the weekend in Queensland, the inaugural conference of the Queensland Children's Activities Network Inc., which addressed the issue of child care. Nothing more starkly illustrates the difference between those of us on this side of the House and those opposite than when we hear opposition to parents paying for their children. It is part of the whole tax evasion process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fortuitously, we have many people in our community who care for children. The Queensland Children's Activities Network Inc. does just that. It is made up of people who provide outside school hours care for children in our community. As honourable members would be aware, many of the children in our schools are no longer latchkey children, because of the work of this Government and the provisions this Government has introduced. The network provides meaningful and quality child-care outside school hours and also during the vacation. </PARA>
<PARA> I was delighted that the chair of the conference was Rita McNamara, who is currently a director of the Jindalee outside hours school care program in my electorate but who unfortunately is moving to be director of another child-care program just outside my electorate. All the management committees for the child-care centres were there. Kris Mann was there from Our Lady of Lourdes After School Care at Sunnybank, which provides for anything from 80 to 100 families in after school hours care and also vacation care. People from Moorooka were also at the conference. </PARA>
<PARA> The network is very important because it provides support for these operations. At the conference, we had people from all over Queensland-from Mount Isa, the Gold Coast, Rockhampton, Townsville and other areas. The only area that was not represented was Toowoomba, and one can only ask why this might be so, particularly given the level of child abuse that operates in that town. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly important that we as a Government have acknowledged the very important role of outside hours care providers and recognise that, for them to deliver quality child-care, they must be provided with sufficient training and must have an operations policy for the way in which they conduct their centres. They provide very real use of one of the most underutilised resources in our community-our State schools and other non-government school centres. Through these providers, children find themselves in familiar surroundings after school, with caring people who give them an opportunity to participate in real play, who perhaps offer assistance with homework, who provide stimulation in play and who provide excursions and all sorts of trips and opportunities which normally the children would not be offered if they had to go home on their own and enter a house alone. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to that, people in the coalition talk about their opposition to the Child Support Agency, which suggests that they think non-custodial parents should not be made to pay for their children. Those opposite are the very same people who, in the next breath, berate this Government for providing support for families through the supporting parent's benefit. I suggest to the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) that he and many of the taxpayers in his electorate should be delighted to know that over 90 per cent of people comply with the requirements of the Child Support Agency. Indeed, close to half a million children in this country whose non-custodial parents previously did not provide support for them do so now. That is a very important turn-around in the community, but once again what we have from the Opposition is yet more tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted that I was able to be part of the Queensland Children's Activities Network conference last weekend at Griffith to provide support and real training opportunities for people through the provision of quality and affordable child-care to which this Government has been so committed and in which its record is unsurpassed. I think that it is very important that that is acknowledged, not just by the providers but by the families who use our outside hours care and indeed by the very schools that find that the provision of those facilities in fact stops vandalism and provides very real and valuable use of their facilities. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Mr Atkinson,</PARA>
<PARA>According to our local phone book (Chelsea Frankston area) you are our sitting member and it is in you that I have the beef with being the locally elected democratic member representing the Government in Canberra and Keating and Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA>In the past 10 months I have been made redundant twice. Both have affected me financially, but more so in the past 3 months as I have been forced to live on the superannuation I received from the first redundancy which in effect was for my future retirement in 16 years time, as I am now aged 49 years and the way things are going I'll have nothing because of Mr Keating's created recession. </PARA>
<PARA>No-one, but no-one wants to employ me because I am too old at 49, which effectively puts me on the scrap heap and, because my wife works, I cannot get any unemployment benefits. Our debt situation is such she cannot support me in anyway, which means I am continually using the superannuation money-which, in the not too distant future will run out. </PARA>
<PARA>And sir, what do I do then? Do I go out and beg on the Salvos? Also this situation has put great strain on the marriage as, being unemployed creates marital stress on one, and I am at times very hard to live with. As my wife is not well herself this could lead to a marriage break-down. </PARA>
<PARA>THANKS LABOR!</PARA>
<PARA>In time this leaves us with one alternative-sell our fully paid for house to take the strain off the marriage, pay off all the debts and go back to where we started first in marriage, that's renting a house, and, my whole life destroyed with no owned house and no job. What a mess you have created for me and others. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore it is regretfully that I have to advise that you are the personal representative for the Australian Labor Party Government-</PARA>
<PARA>I deny that-</PARA>
<PARA>in the area, and take responsibility for the members in your electorate, I shall, if I do not get a job soon (within a fortnight) intend to sue you as member for Isaacs for loss of income, loss of interest, and the possible forced sale of assets-house, car and shares in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA>The amount I'll be claiming from you depends on how long I am out of work and what the personal cost is to me, as it is to you so-called great government that has forced this issue on to me-I didn't ask for what I've got from the government that promised the world to everyone and what they have done is made a bigger mess than the previous federal government did and has put my life into utter chaos as it is no fun getting job refusal after job refusal then ringing up other places and asked age and when told advised that you are too old as we want someone younger. </PARA>

<PARA>Don't you people have a conscience-don't you care, do you enjoy putting people out to pasture with nothing after destroying all they had, and leave them stripped with no pride at all. </PARA>
<PARA>That is why, sir, you leave me no alternative but to sue you and the Federal Government for what I stated earlier and the loss of civil liberties that I'm entitled to in this so-called democratic country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened to the contribution of the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) with considerable sympathy for Mr Spalding. However, I am glad that Mr Spalding at least had a superannuation package to fall back on, because I wish to reveal to the House tonight that I have finally managed to solve the puzzle behind the behaviour of Jeff Kennett, the Leader of the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party of Australia, in his plan to penalise Australian Labor Party members of parliament in that State, were he to be elected to office, by taking away their superannuation after the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has become known to me that the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party has developed a plan to clean out public transport in Victoria by bringing about a massive transport dispute as soon as possible after assuming office in that State. On the premise of resolving the dispute, it plans to do an airline pilots job on that State's transport workers. At the moment many of these State transport workers are nearing retirement age and if they were to survive in their jobs until retirement, they would receive the normal superannuation payouts from the State's superannuation scheme. However, if the State Liberals can engineer a situation in which those workers are sacked as part of an industrial dispute, they would lose the government-funded part of their superannuation payouts. </PARA>
<PARA> The missing piece of the puzzle has come to my attention. For some time I have known of the plan to clean out Victoria's public transport system as a means of showing how macho the Liberals are in their first term of office when the Kennett government would have a greenfields public transport system. I have known of that plan-it has been around for a while-but I did not twig, because it took me a while to put two and two together, to the superannuation plan. This present farce of threatening to take away the superannuation rights of Labor members of parliament is only part of the real agenda behind Jeff Kennett's threat. In reality he wants to establish the right to withhold the government part of the superannuation payments to people who have not performed to his expectations. </PARA>
<PARA> The other part of the puzzle now starting to fall into place is that about six weeks ago the Opposition in Victoria started talking about the unfunded component of the superannuation scheme as some debt that the State Labor Government had imposed on Victoria. In the mid-1970s I was a member of Mr Hamer's superannuation review team that put to the then government the recommendation that it should make its contribution to superannuation payments at the same time as did the employees. But, no, for many years government practice has been to pay out only when the individual worker retires. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, many of these people are nearing retirement and are due to receive their government-funded component, and the Liberals are now claiming that in some way this is mismanagement-that is, that all this money is owed to the State superannuation scheme. Of course this is establishing the ground rules to not pay the government-funded component of the superannuation payments. That this is not just another crazy Kennett scheme designed to cause public wonderment at the antics of Jeff Kennett will not go unnoticed in Victoria. It is in fact a well developed strategy in order to produce a basis on which to deny these workers their superannuation entitlements. </PARA>

I understand the Australian Securities Commission, which has now replaced the NCSC, currently intends to maintain this arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA> The relevant Commonwealth agencies have power to obtain information from any person in relation to a possible contravention of Commonwealth laws. For example, the Commissioner of Taxation has, under ss.263 and 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the power to obtain information, including books and documents, for the purposes of performing his functions under the Act. In addition, the provisions of the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 require cash dealers, including building societies, to report suspect transactions and all cash transactions of not less than $10,000 to the Cash Transaction Reports Agency (CTRA).</PARA>
<PARA> I have arranged for the matters raised by the honourable member to be brought to the attention of these Commonwealth agencies.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Research by the CSIRO Division of Food Processing has resulted in a process for preparing a kiwifruit product having the colour and aroma of the fresh fruit, and which could be suitable for use by the dairy, confectionery and similar industries. Further work will be required to establish the commercial viability of the process and product.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian commercial partners have been widely sought. For instance:</PARA>
<PARA> - over 800 food industry companies and individuals were invited to a free seminar on the technology.</PARA>
<PARA> - articles in publicly circulated CSIRO newsletters and magazines, and the Sydney Morning Herald, have described the technology and invited interested parties to contact CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA> - the technology has featured in radio and TV programs.</PARA>
<PARA> - discussions have been held with 29 individual companies.</PARA>
<PARA>Additionally, the NSW Kiwifruit Growers Association (NSWKGA), which instigated and has supported the project, has contacted numerous potential processors in NSW, South Australia and Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>No Australian company has expressed willingness to commit funds to commercialisation of the technology.</PARA>
<PARA>Overseas interest has been shown by companies and institutions in New Zealand (including the NZ Kiwifruit Marketing Board, and NZ Apple and Pear Board, and the NZ Department of Scientific and Industrial Research) and in Israel, Japan, California, Italy, Chile and Germany.</PARA>
<PARA>With the approval of the NSWKGA negotiations are under way to collaborate in trials including the processing of 10,000 tonnes of kiwifruit in New Zealand. If successful, the trials could lead to an agreement for development and commercialisation. Agreement would be subject to the technology remaining available for use by the Australian industry, and it is further intended that there should be a flowback to Australia of technology arising from it.</PARA>
<PARA>Supplementary Information</PARA>
<PARA>The lack of interest of the Australian industry can probably be attributed to the following:</PARA>
<PARA> - the industry is small; it would have only about 2000 tonnes of processing grade fruit for treatment each year, compared with about 40,000 tonnes in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> - the industry is widely dispersed from Southern Queensland along the NSW coast and through Northern Victoria, with a small planting in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> - since a processed kiwifruit product retaining the natural colour and aroma has not previously been available it is difficult to assess the market potential.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The CSIRO Division of Animal Production has developed an integrated technology for wool harvesting based on the naturally occurring peptide known as epidermal growth factor (EGF). Current predictions are that the technology will be available for use by the wool industry by 1993.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Initial work, from the late 1970s until 1982 was carried out by CSIRO independently of any company, but with financial support (which has continued to the present day) from the Australian Wool Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In the early 80s EGF could only be obtained from natural sources, such as the salivary glands of mice. To expedite availability of the technology to the Australian sheep industry it was essential to encourage the development of means for producing EGF in commercial quantities. As CSIRO was unable to locate an Australian company having the necessary expertise an approach was made in May 1982 to Carlsberg Biotechnology Ltd, a subsidiary of the Danish company United Breweries Ltd, who were known to have produced peptides using enzymes. An agreement was negotiated whereby Carlsberg Biotechnology Ltd were to provide EGF in return for rights to market EGF when prepared by their patented process. The collaboration was unsuccessful and this agreement was terminated in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> In May 1984 CSIRO negotiated an agreement with Wellcome Australia Ltd, involving the genetically engineered production of EGF by the UK parent company, Wellcome Foundation Ltd. The agreement gave Wellcome Australia certain marketing rights, and required EGF for industrial use to be manufactured in Australia unless, for sound commercial reasons, that would be impractical; it also had provisions intended to ensure commercialisation if a safe, effective product was developed.</PARA>
<PARA> In October 1984 Wellcome Australia's interests were transferred to Coopers Animal Health Australia Ltd, a company in which Wellcome Australia and ICI Australia Ltd had joint interests.</PARA>
<PARA> Early in 1990 Coopers was acquired by the US group Pitman-Moore Inc. The rights and obligations of Pitman-Moore remain the same as those of Coopers.</PARA>
<PARA>Supplementary Information</PARA>
<PARA> Collaboration with Wellcome Australia, Coopers Animal Health and Pitman-Moore has proceeded to date on the basis of Heads of Agreement executed in 1984. A final agreement detailing, for instance, royalty rates and the precise limits of Pitman-Moore's rights is currently being negotiated.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Do the activities of the Division and the Bureau overlap.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is there scope for the Division and the Bureau sharing equipment and developing collaborative programs.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Is the Division considering such interaction with the Bureau; if not, why not.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4286" SPEAKER="Crean The Hon S.F." NAMEID="DT4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GIPPSLAND">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Substantial interaction takes place between the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research and the Bureau of Meteorology.</PARA>
<PARA> These interactions are formalised under a Co-ordinated Research Plan being developed by the two agencies and involving several CSIRO Divisions and several branches of the Bureau of Meteorology.</PARA>
<PARA> The plan encompasses atmospheric research including those aspects of oceanographic and terrestrial research which bear directly on weather and climate. Taking stock of current atmospheric research activities, CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology have identified 5 major research themes.</PARA>
<PARA> These are:</PARA>
<PARA> - observations</PARA>
<PARA> - processes</PARA>
<PARA> - regional pollution</PARA>
<PARA> - weather</PARA>
<PARA> - climate.</PARA>
<PARA>CSIRO and the Bureau will continue to meet annually to discuss their individual major research activities, and their five year plans, within a framework based on the overall long term national objectives defined in the Co-ordinated Research Plan and the major mission and discipline based groups in the two organisations. These meetings will also serve as the forum for the annual review of the Co-ordinated Research Plan. Informal interaction takes place frequently on a scientist to scientist basis, with a number of collaborative projects in progress.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The roles of CSIRO and the Bureau are complementary as agreed between the then Department of Science and Technology and CSIRO in 1981 and endorsed by the Fraser and subsequent Hawke Governments. Specifically the respective roles are:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The Bureau of Meteorology, as the National Meteorological Service for Australia, will have primary responsibility for research in support of its own operations and services, including research directed to the broad delineation of the characteristics of Australian weather and climate and for liaison with the World Meteorological Organisation in relation to relevant research in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO's primary role will be to carry out research into physical and chemical aspects of atmospheric processes and phenomena, especially basic aspects and those related to environmental and industrial problems, and to community needs, bearing in mind the role of the Bureau.''</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A prime example of the sharing of facilities is the joint operation of the Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station in Tasmania by the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research and the Bureau of Meteorology. This station plays a vital role in elucidating the impact of human activities on the global atmosphere. Activities, data and research results at Cape Grim represent Australia's main contribution to the United Nations World Meteorological Organisation Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network. A second example concerns the extensive use of National Climate Centre data by the scientists working in the Division's climate change impact research program.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The answers to questions 1 to 3 indicate clearly the extent of collaboration between the two agencies but there are two other aspects worth noting.</PARA>
<PARA> The first is that the Director and Deputy Director of the Bureau serve respectively on the Advisory Committees of the CSIRO Institute of Natural Resources and Environment, and the Division of Atmospheric Research.</PARA>
<PARA> The second fact worth noting is that the Division of Atmospheric Research, the Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre and Monash University are joint proponents in establishing a Cooperative Research Centre on Dynamical Atmospheric Modelling.</PARA>
