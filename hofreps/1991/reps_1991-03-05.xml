<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The result has been that we have the highest participation rate in the work force in memory; that is, people who have joined the work force and have found employment. When the Government came to office we had a labour market of around six million people in employment but there are now around 7 3/4 million people in employment. Certainly, we have had a rise in unemployment coming from the current cycle, the recession. But the fact of the matter is that what sits under the current structure of the economy is much stronger than anything which obtained in the recent past, particularly when the coalition was last in office. That goes to the profit and wage shares in the economy. Why is the honourable member for Flinders shaking his head? The profit share was smashed to pieces in 1982-83. It has taken us seven years to restore the profitability of Australian business which the Opposition always claimed to look after.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a very large decline in the call by the public sector on Australian savings, which is a structural improvement for Australia; and there is a floating exchange rate, which has given the nation a competitive mechanism on the exchange rate. These are things which now sit in the structure of the Australian economy so that as the economy picks up-as indeed it will-it has the capacity to do so and grow in the 1990s and, particularly, with low inflation. The other thing which we have done is that we are in the process now of breaking the back of the 20-year dismal legacy of inflation, mainly because of the coalition's incapacity as a government to deal with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These are the issues which make the Australian economy and its structure more fundamentally sound than it has been for a couple of decades. That is why any cyclical unemployment will be taken up as the economy grows. Because the participation rate is so high, all unemployed persons are revealed in the registered unemployed list; that is, registered unemployment has risen. Because of that high participation rate, registered unemployment will come down as the economy grows, whereas in the economy we inherited there were pathetically low levels of participation. For every visible person on the so-called unemployed list, there was one invisible person who did not even bother to look for a job because he or she knew it was hopeless under the Government of those opposite. For every job that we filled in the 1980s we had to fill one invisible job. Now, when the participation rate is very high, every unemployed person will be visible. However, those visible job seekers will come down as quickly as they have risen as the economy starts to grow. In other words, we will see a commensurate change over the course of growth in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA> But, above all else, the Government has done what it had to do. It had to face up to the fact that demand was running at twice product growth. We have pulled demand back within the capacity of the economy. The recession those opposite gave us was because they were out of control; the whole of the economy was out of control. They had a wage explosion, profitability was absolutely smashed to pieces and the place went into recession because they could not avoid it; it was driven there by the fact that the fundamentals fell apart.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1252" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I announced in the Budget last year as part of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme reforms that Medicare cards would become general health care cards. They will be used as evidence for eligibility for both the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and, of course, for Medicare. My colleague the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services and I are committed to giving the pharmaceutical benefits administration more integrity than it has had to date. There have been problems in the past of people claiming pharmaceuticals at a concessional price when they were no longer entitled to them, because we did not have a mechanism for accurate and timely eligibility checking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Medicare cards need to be replaced to ensure that lost and stolen cards are not inappropriately used; to set up a continuing basis for reissuing cards in order to minimise their misuse; to establish a regular checking system to identify people who have died or who have left Australia; to improve the efficiency of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and Medicare administration; and to protect doctors and pharmacists from providing free or concessional services or pharmaceuticals to those who are ineligible for them. People are often not aware that they need to inform the Health Insurance Commission of the death of spouses or relatives. Because the Health Insurance Commission has not had any systematic way of updating its records there are more people enrolled as eligible for Medicare benefits than there should be.</PARA>
<PARA> Reissuing Medicare cards will let the Health Insurance Commission update its records to account for people who have died or who have left Australia. We will gain significant administrative efficiencies by incorporating information on the face of the Medicare card or on a magnetic strip on the back of the card. That means that pharmacists and claims clerks in Medicare offices will not have to key in numbers. They will simply have to swipe the card; and the claimant's Medicare number, the card issue date and the expiry date will be recorded without mistakes. I have made a commitment that a computer terminal and swiping equipment will be publicly available in each capital city so that people can satisfy themselves about the information encoded on the magnetic strip at the back of the card.</PARA>
<PARA> The Health Insurance Commission has been working closely with the Privacy Commissioner to deal constructively with the privacy concerns which this change in the Medicare card raises. The Commissioner has approved the Health Insurance Commissioner's arrangements for reissuing Medicare cards and the Health Insurance Commission will be working closely with him to develop guidelines for the way they are used. The Government has no plans to link the Medicare database to either the Australian Taxation Office or to the Department of Social Security. Were it to have such plans they would need to be developed by way of policy and legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> We have given the Privacy Commissioner assurances that we will proceed in these areas in a way that does due deference to him in his role and gives him ample opportunity to consider any such changes. The intentions of the Government are about improving the integrity of health administration. The card has an important role in this regard.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a question one may well turn back to the Opposition. For years it has been telling us that it could stabilise our national debt without cutting government spending in the way in which we have and without an incomes policy.

<PARA> The Prime Minister has given me a statistic which he had in his file. It is that over the last five years up to 1989-90 manufacturing investment has grown at an average rate of 11.5 per cent a year, compared with an average annual decline of 1.6 per cent in the five years to 1983-84. Opposition members are asking me questions about investment! What hypocrites! It is only through production and investment that the current account will be brought back into balance. There are two identities that matter-firstly, savings and investment and, secondly, production and demand. If there is not enough production the demand spills into imports and if there are not enough savings the call will be on overseas savings and overseas debt. It is on both of those identities that the Government has been working in a way which the Opposition showed it was incapable of doing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly, if the Opposition had made the decision at that time, its communications system had broken down. But that does not surprise me, given the somewhat bizarre goings-on on the Opposition side in relation to this matter. The decision to go this speedily has been forced upon us by the fact that our latest information indicates that the proposal to lift the ceiling on the export enhancement program will go to the House of Representatives in the United States next week. It is of course important that we make our representations on this matter before those measures are debated in the US House of Representatives. This is why we have had to act with this speed and why I have encouraged the Opposition to respond with some signs of real activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regrettably, however, what we have had is a whole series of letters from the Leader of the Opposition to the Prime Minister-which I think we should publish in a little compendium-which show the amount of time devoted to this matter by the Leader of the Opposition. When I read his original press statement I found that the Leader of the Opposition indicated that he quite favoured my going with a member of the Opposition front bench. He now seems to advocate his and the Prime Minister's going, at a time which is, of course, after the time when the measure would have been discussed. It would seem to be pretty pointless to go at that time, and I am quite sure how the Americans would regard that. In addition, we had asked that there be a Minister and a backbencher from this side of the House and a shadow Minister and a backbencher from the other side.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to respond favourably to the first part of the question. In answer to the second part of the question, that really is a matter that the honourable member ought to take up with the Standing Committee on Privileges.

<PARA> It is probably reasonably well understood in this place, since a ruling given some years ago by Speaker Snedden was given currency, that the question of privilege in this place covers basically what we say here, which is absolutely privileged. The question of how it is subsequently reported is a more problematic matter. Speaker Snedden then enjoined us-and subsequent speakers have done the same-to be very careful about the way in which we use things that we say in this place outside this chamber, as we are not necessarily covered absolutely by privilege when we take it outside this place. The honourable member was not here when some of those rulings have from time to time been given, but underlying his question was an impression of privilege which in fact has not been sustained by Speakers ruling to this point.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the Leader of the National Party has confirmed the Opposition's policy to abolish company tax, because he has made that very clear by his interjection. Company tax brought in $12.9 billion of revenue in 1989-90. The removal of company tax will encourage the retention of company income and deferral of dividend payments to corporate shareholders as a means of deferring tax payments. Australia's ability to tax the income of foreign shareholders in Australian companies would be reduced substantially. Tax deferral for corporate income would introduce a major bias in favour of companies over the great bulk of businesses which are conducted as sole partnerships, proprietorships and trusts. Finally, company tax plays an important role in ensuring that income earned by companies is appropriately brought to tax, as is other income earned by taxpayers in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has raised this issue, as the Leader of the National Party did in his confirmation of it being Opposition policy-it was floated as another idea by the visiting professor, the Leader of the Opposition, who visits issues and again retreats from them-through the Leader of the Opposition in an article in the National Australia Bank monthly journal but who then retreated from it the moment it was published. As he retreated from his privatisation proposals for social security payments, the vouchers for health and education and the State income tax proposals, he has retreated as quickly as he made the remarks.</PARA>
<PARA> But he said in his press conference-a great voluminous transcript of which I have a copy in my hand:</PARA>

<PARA>Dr Hewson, do you accept that starting to talk about lower company tax, moving towards a system where you don't have company tax, is something that might create a lot of concern in the community, especially among people who don't understand?</PARA>
<PARA>He answered:</PARA>
<PARA>No, it shouldn't create any concern. As Opposition Leader I have an absolute responsibility to make sure that when we go into government, we have the best set of policies to solve the problems of the country.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he is saying, `We have the right to just raise these issues willy-nilly, to mention them in the context of an interview by a bank, and then when they are raised in the public debate, to run away from them, showing all the political cowardice that that technique brings,' but, he says, `I have a perfect right to raise these issues'.</PARA>
<PARA> Again, Mr Speaker, this is the visiting professor-visiting issues without the policy substance, without the policy context. Over the weekend one of the Tasmanian members, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr), when asked whether he had any idea about the views of the Leader of the Opposition, said, `No, he is not very accessible to anyone. We don't have any idea, really, what he thinks about major topics'. So in other words, here is the Leader of the Opposition raising the abolition of $12.9 billion worth of company tax, yet how does he believe that that could be collected with an expenditure tax if it was not a consumption tax at phenomenal rates of tax-at rates of tax well over 30 per cent-to try to collect from ordinary people income which he would then hand back to companies with tax relief of $12.9 billion?</PARA>
<PARA> That is what is implied here. That is how serious this issue is. But the Leader of the Opposition says, `I have a right to raise it-not to explain it, not to go to my motivations for raising it, not to flesh out the details now I have frightened people about the prospect'. We would be the only country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development not to have a company tax base. Even the countries which have a value added tax, even the countries which have a consumption tax, all have a company tax base. But no, what we are being served up here is basically rank, rancid ideology-unfleshed out by a person incapable of putting a policy construction together.</PARA>

The decline of the public sector borrowing requirement has been of the order of 7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), or about $28,000m a year. In other words, savings in this country have been bolstered by the fact that the public sector is not putting its hands into the savings jar in the rapacious way it was during the term of the government that the honourable member opposite belonged to. The result is, therefore, that the balance between Australia's savings and the calls on its savings by investment is a much better balance for reducing the current account deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>

It has added to private savings through occupational superannuation which will see roughly $1,000 billion coming into savings by the turn of the century. When I became Treasurer, there was $17 billion in superannuation funds. There is now about $150 billion, and we expect there to be a conservative $800 or $900 billion by the turn of the century.</PARA></TALK.START>

His question is entirely appropriate because it was in his electorate at the weekend that HMAS Success returned to Australia after a very long assignment in the Gulf. I congratulate him on the welcome which was given on that occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I saw the article and, indeed, I was very disappointed by it. The main burden of the article was a broad ranging diatribe on the economy, government processes and the reform of the Australian Labor Party. Mr Barnett, as we know, is a well known journalist and in the past he has commanded a certain amount of respect, particularly in conservative circles. We in the Australian Labor Party have become used to his attacks, both as a press secretary to the former Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, and as a columnist, and I dare say that we will be able to withstand them for some time to come. But I do take great exception when a throwaway line, an incidental literary device, is used by Mr Barnett to denigrate our Australian armed service men and women by implying that the Australian Active Service Medal has little value.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian tradition is that campaign medals are awarded in recognition of the risk and the arduous nature of service in a war zone. Conspicuous acts of heroism are honoured separately. For my part, I am profoundly grateful that, as things turned out, this conflict did not require our forces to close with and destroy an enemy and to take the casualties which would surely have been involved in that kind of operation. I am sure that everybody in this House would agree with that.</PARA>
<PARA> It is worth thinking about the role of our forces in the Gulf from the first days of the conflict. To begin with, there were the relentless fire and damage control drills which they undertook on the way to the operational area. Then when they got there, there were the long watches, the interrogating of the crews of merchant vessels to determine whether they were attempting to break the United Nations blockade-a job, I might add, in which they succeeded magnificently. During those operations they were forced on a number of occasions to fire across the bows of Iraqi ships, to undertake difficult boarding operations, both from small boats and from helicopters, always with the risk that the situation could escalate rapidly, unpredictably and at great risk to themselves.</PARA>
<PARA> If Mr Barnett does not think that those operations involve significant danger, he should bear in mind that the coalition forces sustained more casualties in the prehostilities period than they did after, and that is a tribute, I believe, to the discipline and the superb skills of our servicemen and women.</PARA>
<PARA> After hostilities commenced our ships performed escort duties for the Midway carrier battle group and resupply operations in waters where they faced the risk of missile attacks and the ever present danger from mines.</PARA>

That danger to our ships from mines has not yet been entirely eliminated, although it is decreasing. Let us not forget also that we have Australian Defence Force (ADF) members still engaged in extremely hazardous operations in the Gulf. I instance the 23 members of Australia's clearance diving team who are currently working to determine the extent of mine clearing operations which will be necessary in Kuwaiti ports, and which will, of course, be essential as part of the postwar reconstruction to restore safe navigation. That team, I mention, as the Prime Minister knows, will subsequently be undertaking disposal of explosive ordnance, and in plain terms that means defusing mines. Again, if Mr Barnett thinks that that sort of operation does not deserve a medal, I am sure there will be many honourable members on both sides of this House who would disagree. I do hope that Mr Barnett gives these matters some thought and will come to realise how thoroughly justified these medals are.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the program, the plan, of Tasrail to restructure the Tasrail operation in Tasmania. I thank the honourable member for Denison for the interest that he has shown in this matter and the way in which he has very effectively represented the interests of railway employees in Tasmania. I think Tasrail, both at the management and staff level right through to unskilled railway employees, should be congratulated for the way in which it has been able to bring about a very substantial improvement in the operational effectiveness of Tasrail, particularly since 1983. In fact, there has been an improvement of about 44 per cent in real terms in the revenue supplement that is made available out of Commonwealth taxation revenue. That supplement, of course, represents a subsidy to cover operation deficits during the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two particular developments which are relevant to the question of restructuring Tasrail, and I think we need to keep them in mind. Certainly there has been a very sensible response on the part of the railway unions in Tasmania to this plan. First of all, we have the proposed national rail freight corporation, wherein we hope to have at least some type of corporate structure in place and operating by 1 July. That will have some effect on the operational nature of Tasrail; the extent and the nature of that at this stage is still undetermined.</PARA>
<PARA> The other important thing is a study which is under way at the present time by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics into the operation of Tasrail. That will be particularly important as far as we are concerned, because that report will be available at the end of this month and will give us a better idea about the position and attitude we may adopt after June 1993-the date at which we have given a guarantee that the Commonwealth Government will support Tasrail. We need to determine, on the basis of the outcome of that inquiry by the Bureau, just what type of position we may adopt then, but we have certainly given a very clear undertaking that Tasrail will have our support up until the middle of calendar year 1993.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, one of the other important elements is the whole question of the financial effectiveness and operation of Tasrail. There is no doubt that the best way to lock railway operations into Tasmania is to ensure that they are financially viable. The restructuring package which has been offered to the railway unions by Tasrail is simply designed to do that-to make it possible for Tasrail to cut even. There is no reason at all why those negotiations should not continue; of course they will. The unions have responded to that restructuring package and AN or Tasrail in turn will respond to that within the next few days.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me assure the honourable member-and I know this is one of the essential elements of his concern-that there will be no forced retrenchments as far as Tasrail is concerned. There will be negotiations and there will be retrenchment or redundancy arrangements. Those negotiations will continue. There has been a good degree of goodwill on the part of both management and employees in Tasrail. I applaud the response that we have had from them. I expect it will continue and I am sure that we will be able to resolve any difficulties as far as Tasrail is concerned and put Tasrail into a position where we lock the operation of rail services into Tasmania very firmly.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. As he would be aware, Parliament passed a Bill which permits the Government to both privatise Aussat Pty Ltd and establish it as a competitor across-the-board in the network to Telecom OTC. That, basically, is the reform required to ensure that a second competitor can be established and operate effectively. There are features of that competition that would, however, be better handled by a subsequent clarification in legislation. The Government has now exposed draft legislation for public comment. We expect to receive a great deal of comment on that. The draft Bill outlines the Government's approach to key legislative aspects of telecommunications reform, including licensing of carriers, resale of carrier capacity and interconnection between carriers. It reflects the reforms that the Prime Minister announced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are four basic principles underlining the draft Bill. The Government's decision that there will be two carriers until 1997 has focused the drafting process on the need to develop a viable second network alternative to Telecom OTC. A secondary focus has been to ensure that there is no roll-back of current rights. The intention is to further free up the industry, not to restrict it. This means that no-one will be prevented from doing anything that he or she is currently legally able to do.</PARA>
<PARA> Particular effort has been spent on precise definitions to ensure clarity and certainty. However, not everything can be spelt out in legislation and mechanisms such as carrier licences will give necessary flexibility. In addition, attention has been paid to making the Bill as technology neutral as possible. The Bill will cover the things that the Government intends should take place as far as resale of telecommunications carrier capacity is concerned, the opportunity for additional mobile licences-indeed, the totality of the reforms announced by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> The document is, however, a draft, released to a substantial degree without prejudice. It is our intention that, when we receive the comment that comes in from those interested in the political process and also those more directly concerned with telecommunications matters, adjustments to that legislation will be made. We hope that anyone wishing to make those comments will make them prior to 15 March. After that period of time, those that we decide to incorporate in changes to the draft proposal for legislation will be incorporated. I should be in a position to introduce the Bill into Parliament in mid-April.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Has the Government delayed the release of the February unemployment benefit figures to coincide with the release of the labour force figures by the Australian Bureau of Statistics? If so, is this to achieve the political goal of having two bad announcements made on the same day? Can the Minister assure the House that the recession his Government engineered will not push unemployment over 9 per cent?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman for his question except that he has directed it to the wrong Minister. I am not the Minister responsible for the statistics on unemployment beneficiaries; that is, of course, a function of the Minister for Social Security. Thus, I cannot respond to what seemed to be the sharp end of his question. As far as I know, the issuing of statistics in relation to the labour market is all handled by the Bureau of Statistics, and the Australian Statistician publishes those statistics as they are prepared and according to a timetable which is well understood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the honourable member's invitation to me to speculate about the direction of the labour market in the future is concerned, of course I have declined to do that in the past. It is always difficult to make predictions about what is happening in the labour market. What we know is that the labour market tends to be the last to respond to a downturn and therefore the last to respond to any upturn. I have said in the past that we expect the labour market to continue to decline as measured in terms of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> But I think it is worth making the point that, as the Treasurer said in answer to a question earlier today, there has been a very significant growth in the labour market and in jobs generally during the course of the last few years. Although there has been some decline in employment, we are still sitting at a figure well in excess of 1 1/2 million additional jobs. That has not led to such a spectacular decline in the unemployment rate but the reason for that is, as the Treasurer said, that the participation rate went up as well. If we had the participation rate that existed when the honourable gentleman was the Treasurer, the unemployment rate would have in fact got down to something like 3 per cent rather than the 6 and a bit per cent that it got down to as a result of creating those jobs.</PARA>
<PARA> I think we need to keep these issues in some kind of balance. I am not trying to distort in any way what is happening to the labour market or speculate about what is going to happen in the future, but I think the honourable gentleman ought to be very cautious about overdramatising the circumstances or trying to talk Australia into a more depressed situation than it is already in.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a different issue from that raised by the honourable member for Pearce, I ask you, Mr Speaker, a question concerning the prerogatives of this House. I note from a press statement by Mr Brian Cox, the Australian Electoral Commissioner, that he has made a determination under the Commonwealth Electoral Act and, as a result, two States will each lose a seat. Both New South Wales and South Australia will lose one division while Queensland will gain one.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Gulf crisis has been the subject of great debate in this House and of profound interest across Australia. I therefore think it appropriate that I should report to the House and the nation on the outcome of the multinational effort to free Kuwait, on what that achievement means and on what remains to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members will know that allied military operations under resolution 678 have been outstandingly successful; they have achieved their objectives more quickly than expected, and with very few losses to allied forces. This is a cause for great relief. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's task force in the Gulf played a significant role in these operations, in cooperation with the forces of many other nations. We are proud of their contribution. Discussions are now under way to achieve a permanent ceasefire and a definitive end to the conflict under the conditions laid down by the United Nations Security Council last weekend. </PARA>
<PARA> Proud and relieved as we are, this is not a time solely for rejoicing. Kuwait and its people have suffered grievously in the months since 2 August last year and Iraq's people have suffered great devastation and loss. I have said throughout this crisis that we have no quarrel with the people of Iraq, but only with the brutal and dictatorial regime which has imposed on them, as on Kuwait, so much suffering. With our allies, we sought to avoid using armed force by all means possible. We only accepted the need to fight when it became clear that there was no other way to reverse the aggression of Saddam Hussein and to free Kuwait. But from the start of this crisis we have understood that the issues at stake were so grave that, if all else failed, the world would be justified in using armed force to resolve it. </PARA>
<PARA> We were concerned for the people of Kuwait and for the future of the Middle East, and we were concerned for the economic consequences of a world oil market dominated by Saddam Hussein. But above all, we were concerned for the challenge that Saddam Hussein's invasion and attempted elimination of Kuwait posed to the international community. </PARA>
<PARA> It challenged each of us, as nations and as individuals, to balance our repugnance for war against our commitment to peace. It has forced us to study again the lessons of 50 years ago: that peace is bought at too high a price if that price is the appeasement of aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> In these aspects the Gulf crisis has drawn significance not just from the specific circumstances of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but also from the great historical event of our time-the end of the Cold War. The Gulf crisis has been the crucial test of the world's hopes that, with the end of the Cold War, the United Nations (UN) would at last be allowed to fulfil the expectations of its founders. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, our hopes have been fulfilled by a great victory. I do not speak here of the military victory by the forces of the coalition-as significant as that was-for military victory, however sweeping, must always be shadowed with the tragedy of those who have fallen on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> The great victory in the Gulf has been won by the international community, and by the United Nations itself. </PARA>
<PARA> At every step since 2 August 1990, the Security Council has focused the international response to Iraq's invasion. The Security Council condemned Iraq's invasion, it imposed economic sanctions, it authorised the use of force and, finally, last weekend it stipulated the conditions for a cessation of hostilities. These actions by the Security Council reflect the overwhelming consensus of the international community about the nature of Iraq's actions, and about the means to address them. </PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Security Council-nations large and small, developed and developing, drawn from every region of the globe-have truly represented the world's opinion that Saddam Hussein must not prevail. Many nations joined in the military operations under the Security Council's authority. Pre-eminent among them has been the United States, which has used its power and influence with courage and generosity to serve interests which the United States shares with all the world. </PARA>
<PARA> But the coalition also included Arab nations such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria; European nations including France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Italy; and more distant nations like Canada, who understood, as we did, that the stakes in this crisis had no geographical boundaries. We owe thanks to all our allies in this endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA> This House has expressed its support for the United Nations position on the Gulf crisis in a series of debates and resolutions. The Government has been grateful for the support of the Opposition on this vital issue. A decision to deploy forces to combat is the hardest decision a government can take, and we are grateful for the intelligent, principled and conscientious support we have received from this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last resort, this Parliament and this nation were prepared to meet the aggressor's challenge; we were willing to go to war, but only to preserve peace. With the overwhelming support of their country behind them, ships and personnel of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) were sent to the Gulf to help enforce sanctions and, later, to participate in operations under resolution 678 to expel Iraq from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> The heart of our contribution to the multinational military effort in the Gulf has been a naval task group of three ships: initially HMAS Adelaide, Darwin and Success; now HMAS Sydney, Brisbane and Westralia. The task force has also included a clearance diving team to help deal with the threat from mines. </PARA>
<PARA> They have all acquitted themselves honourably. They have earned the respect of their coalition partners in the multinational force for their skills and capabilities. Make no mistake: although our ships have not been direct participants in offensive action, they have played critical and hazardous roles. They have played their part in turning back Saddam Hussein. They have been operating, and continue to operate, in a dangerous environment, and we are very fortunate, and very grateful, that they have taken no casualties. </PARA>
<PARA> Elsewhere in the Gulf we have had service personnel serving on exchange with allied forces, and up to 40 medical personnel serving on the US hospital ship Comfort. These people-including a number of reservists-have earned the respect of their colleagues and our gratitude for their service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to recognise the special service of those who have served in the Gulf since the commencement of allied military action on 17 January by authorising the award of the Australian Active Service Medal, bearing the clasp `Kuwait', to members of the ADF deployed in the Gulf on or after 17 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The award of the Active Service Medal provides due recognition of the service given by Australian Defence Force members during this conflict. It will be worn with pride by all who receive it-and rightly so. The Australians who have served in the Gulf, as I have said before and repeat now in this House, have done honour to themselves, their service and their country. We now may honour them in return and so permanently record our gratitude to and respect for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Our service men and women in the Gulf were supported in Australia by the work of many other members of the ADF, by contractors and by other Government agencies. The Government's response to the crisis has been assisted in demanding circumstances by the Office of National Assessments, the Defence Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Defence and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and by many other State and Federal agencies. They all have our sincere thanks. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me also pay tribute here to the staff of Australia's embassies in the region who have accepted serious risks in staying at their posts to help Australian citizens, protect Australian interests and represent Australian views. </PARA>
<PARA> We look forward to bringing home our forces in the Gulf as soon as possible. This will be done in accordance with the decisions and requirements of the UN Security Council. Although the war itself is we hope over, there clearly remains much to be done before peace can be restored to the Gulf region. First, we need to establish the short and long term security of Kuwait and other nations in the Gulf region, and also undertake the reconstruction of Kuwait and Iraq-including addressing the humanitarian needs of the innocent victims of Saddam's aggression, even among his own people. We are pleased to see that humanitarian considerations are being taken into account in the administration of the United Nations economic sanctions still in place against Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> How these tasks will be achieved depends largely on how things unfold in the Gulf in the coming weeks and months. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond these issues lies the fundamental need to address the longstanding problems of the Middle East. Since the start of the Gulf crisis, this Government has been concerned to see whether a solution to the invasion of Kuwait could not become a catalyst for solutions to the deep-seated tensions in the region; in particular, the future of the Palestinians, the security of Israel, and the struggle to implement a settlement in Lebanon. </PARA>
<PARA> There is cause to hope that the spirit of cooperation-which has seen the Arab members of the coalition and Israel acknowledge, even if only tacitly, their common interest in confronting Saddam Hussein-may pave the way for a broader understanding of the possibilities of cooperation. But there should be no illusions about the difficulty of finding solutions to these problems. The leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, by its support for Saddam Hussein, has gravely damaged its credibility internationally. But the voice of the Palestinians must still be heard. </PARA>
<PARA> And Israel, which during this war displayed such admirable restraint against unprovoked aggression, may in some ways be more receptive to the logic of a settlement, but in other respects less so. </PARA>
<PARA> We will do what we can to assist the resolution of these tragic problems, and to help reduce the chances of future conflicts by supporting effective regional and global arms control measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has important trade interests in the Middle East, including in the Gulf. A central element of our policy will be to facilitate the resumption and development of that trade. The Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Dr Blewett, will lead a trade delegation to the Gulf region next week, and we will appoint a senior officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at the rank of ambassador to coordinate the Government's Middle East trade strategy. We are also examining the establishment of a new diplomatic mission in the Gulf region. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to turn lastly to the new world order. The phrase has been much discussed in recent months. Most of what has been said has missed the fundamental point: that the end of the Cold War has in fact ushered in a new world order, whether we like it or not. </PARA>
<PARA> The question we face is not whether we want a new world order or not; it is what kind of world we want. In every field of international relations-strategic, economic, ecological-the challenge of the 1990s is to define how the nations of the world will cooperate in the years ahead. The special importance of the Gulf crisis has been the chance it has given us to define the shape of this new order in the field of international security. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one believes that the world will be totally free of war and suffering. But because the world responded as it did to the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein, the new order will be one in which would-be aggressors will think twice before invading smaller neighbours; in which smaller nations feel more secure because they know that they will not stand alone if they are threatened; and in which all nations should know that the rule of law must prevail over the rule of force in international relations. </PARA>
<PARA> That does not make the new world order any kind of utopia; but it does make the world a much safer place than it would have been had Saddam Hussein's aggression been rewarded by his being allowed to keep Kuwait as the nineteenth province of Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> That is in itself a great achievement. This Government, this Parliament and this nation can be proud of the part we have played in bringing it about. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, and perhaps even more, this conflict, brought as it has been so immediately and dramatically into our homes by television, may demonstrate the ultimate horror of war-its necessity as a last resort against perverse and evil leaders, not masking the human degradation that war involves. If nations, if men and women who can influence the decisions of their leaders, have learned this lesson, then we will not just have made the world a safer place but we will have made it a better place-a place where the resources of mankind may, with security, be directed less to the means of their destruction, but rather to the uplifting of those in need around the globe. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Wentworth-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the Opposition)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This is the fourth major parliamentary statement on the Gulf crisis since Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait on 2 August last year. As with the three previous statements, I am pleased to indicate the Opposition's strong support for the role of the United States (US) and the United Nations, and for the basic unity of purpose we have shared with the Government. Yet this statement is obviously different from those that have preceded it. It comes at a time of vindication for all men and women who value common decency, the rule of law and the right of all countries, large and small, to live in peace and security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we have seen in the Gulf over the past seven weeks under the leadership of the American military planners is a stunning and complete military victory. It was a victory built on international diplomatic solidarity and a military strategy involving bold tactics, the swift movement of massive forces and relentlessly effective air power. It was a triumph in controlled use of high technology armed force by trained and motivated personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast, Iraq miscalculated disastrously. It showed little comprehension of the resolve of the international community to rid Kuwait of its invader. It showed little comprehension of the firepower and the mobility of modern, well-equipped forces. Saddam Hussein lived in a dream world of his own delusions of grandeur-and a real element of the tragedy lies in the extent of the death and damage he wreaked on his fellow Iraqis. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq's only real `successes'-and I use that word advisedly and in quotation marks-were in attacking the environment of the Gulf, brutalising the defenceless citizens of Kuwait and exposing its own people to hardship and danger. It seems odd, to say the least, that these gross abuses of the environment and human rights failed to elicit the condemnation of those who were protesting so vehemently recently about the so-called American aggression against Iraq. Today's news of civil unrest within Iraq aimed against Saddam Hussein's dictatorship should come therefore as no surprise to anyone. </PARA>
<PARA> The view is now emerging that the allied military victory in the Gulf was always inevitable. Such a view is fundamentally mistaken. Saddam Hussein's challenge to world order came at a time when Western countries were debating how to spend the peace dividend and when Western resolve to meet force with force in the Middle East was highly questionable. It came at a time when the political risks in using force against Saddam Hussein were great and when the margin for error in his application was slight. </PARA>
<PARA> Meeting Saddam's challenge demanded one of the greatest logistical operations in history. It called for statesmanship and it called for determination of the highest order. The international community, under American leadership, drew its line in the sand. That line today is marked more clearly than ever before.</PARA>
<PARA> The statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today is therefore qualitatively different from the three statements that preceded it. It comes at a time when the attention of the international community has moved from managing the uncertainties of sanctions and war to maximising the chances of an enduring regional peace. It is a time for justifiable pride in the achievement of our Defence Force throughout the crisis, but it is also a time for a realistic appraisal of the scale of our contribution to the final outcome. It is a time for optimism and confidence in the role of the United Nations, but it is also a time for honesty in recognising that without America's political and military leadership, the outcome which we are celebrating would not have been possible. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a time for Australians to be proud that with bipartisan support we stood our ground in this vitally important test of will for the international community, but it is also a time when politicians must be very careful not to bathe in reflected glory for their own purposes. It is a time to give thanks that the damage which Saddam Hussein threatened to let loose on the Middle East has been minimised and now neutralised, but it is not a time to rest on our laurels or to fail to learn from our diplomatic and military experience of the past seven months. </PARA>
<PARA> In the responding to the Prime Minister's statement today, I wish at the outset to indicate the pride I take as an Australian in the role played by our Defence Force in the Gulf. Throughout the sanctions phase and throughout the period of open conflict, our Defence Force displayed a professionalism and a quiet courage that are in the finest traditions of our services. It has the admiration and respect of a grateful nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is delighted with the Government's decision to award an Australian Active Service Medal to all who have served in the Gulf since 17 January. It is a very fitting recognition of their important role. I also take pride in the strength of the political bipartisanship which has supported our Defence Force in the Gulf. The Opposition knew full well that political divisions would make it harder for any government to act decisively and confidently in times of crisis and particularly in times of war, but it also knew the only right and proper course of action in response to Saddam Hussein's aggression. As a result, the Opposition was pleased to pledge bipartisan support for the Government's response at the very outset of the crisis, and I am proud that throughout the various phases of the sanctions and the conflict it has lived up to the spirit and to the letter of that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> Without seeking to exaggerate, I believe that the rock solid support which Opposition members have given to the Government throughout this crisis has been very important in developing the right Australian policy in response and in helping to build a sense of national unity. At the special sitting of Parliament on 21 and 22 January to discuss the war in the Gulf, every member of the Opposition in both this House and the Senate voted in favour of the parliamentary resolution, an achievement which even the Government itself could not match. </PARA>
<PARA> Where we have expressed concerns about the Government's handling of particular aspects, we have done so constructively and without grandstanding. I should add that we also did so successfully on a number of occasions and on a number of issues, such as in clarifying the precise role of our Defence Force in the Gulf and in ensuring that the Parliament was kept properly informed and offered appropriate opportunities for debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In focusing on the Prime Minister's statement today, I wish to address my remarks very briefly to three specific aspects of the current situation, namely, the implications internationally, regionally and for Australia. Let me begin with the international implications. The main challenge in the period immediately ahead is to guard against misguided optimism. The United Nations organisation has been made significantly more relevant to issues of war and peace. The United States has reasserted its global leadership in a constructive and cooperative way and, as I said in my speech during the special parliamentary sitting on the Gulf crisis on 21 January, President Bush has acted bravely and wisely throughout this crisis. His administration has provided consistency and strength of purpose which have infused other members of the international community. </PARA>
<PARA> All these facts have led to much speculation about the imminence of a new world order, one that is based on collective security under the auspices of the United Nations, one that protects the rights of small States and one that upholds the rule of law and the accepted norms of international conduct. A good deal of speculation about a new era in relations between states has unfortunately been premature. The new international order remains an objective to be pursued rather than a sure means of achieving security in the Middle East or elsewhere in the immediate future. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible, for example, that the international response to Iraq's aggression was a special case rather than some kind of historical watershed. There has been an unusual set of circumstances over the past seven months working in favour of an international consensus on the issue of Iraq's aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and its subsequent hostage taking, looting and brutalisation were unambiguous and deliberate violations of international law and basic human rights. It was a clear case of right and wrong, good and bad, and the United Nations Security Council responded accordingly. Moreover, there is no guarantee that Soviet or French or Chinese or any other national objectives in the Middle East in the period ahead will necessarily be identical or even compatible with those of the United States. Nor should we assume that the United States will assume the global policeman role, which many seem to be keen to assign to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Across the political spectrum in the United States from the Democrat left to the neo-conservative right, there is a widespread sentiment emerging that Americans should come home. That sentiment is a very pronounced one, and I believe that with the successful conclusion of the Gulf war this mood of introspection in the United States may well increase. </PARA>
<PARA> More generally, a new international disorder is at least as likely as a new international order. The end of the Cold War and the rising tide of political and economic liberalism have unleashed nationalist rivalries of an economic and political kind not seen since the post-World War I period. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it clear, therefore, that current optimism about international security issues is well placed but there are many uncertainties. It is wrong to be unduly cynical about the prospects of a new international order. Such an order is based on principles as old as the United Nations charter. The fact that we are closer today to realising those principles than we have been for over 40 years should be a source of encouragement, not scepticism, but it is right to be measured about the relevance of a new international order in securing a lasting peace over coming months in the Middle East or elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not delude ourselves that national rivalries and competition are going to suddenly be consumed by an international consensus built on a grand coalition of interests. It is also right to continue to value strong security relationships with allies, to be prepared to bear the costs and burdens involved and to pursue national security interests within that framework. The capacity of the international coalition forged in the Gulf to endure in the postwar period will be tested by economic as well as security issues. </PARA>
<PARA> New trade and reconstruction opportunities are opening up in the Gulf. Competition over them will be intense as nations seek to regain their market share and others attempt to undercut them. These processes seem likely to cause particular tensions between Australia and the United States-an issue to which I will return later. But more broadly, there is the potential for economic competition to combine with a rapidly changing security situation to create less and not more stability in the region. The test of international statesmanship in the years ahead will be to manage these potential difficulties with the same sense of wider common purpose which has characterised the resistance to Saddam Hussein's attempts at regional destabilisation over recent months. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, let me dwell briefly on regional implications. The end of the Gulf war has highlighted the unfinished agenda of Middle East security issues. They include security arrangements for the weaker oil rich states of the Gulf; relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours, including the Palestinians; controls over the regional arms trade; and the future of the Lebanon. The events of recent weeks may well prove a catalyst for positive change in the region, but the uncertainties are great and the situation is fluid. </PARA>
<PARA> What is clear is that while non-regional countries will have an important role to play in underpinning the arrangements that the Gulf states and other regional powers may devise, the proposals for a workable security framework must come from within the Middle East region itself. Within the region the Gulf war may have settled the issue of Saddam Hussein's aggression but on the issue of broader security arrangements it has created a gap between global expectations and regional realities. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that regional realities create as many obstacles as opportunities. There are many competing regional ambitions, rivalries and national interests which will complicate postwar planning. But they do not obscure the basic elements that will be fundamental to any enduring stability in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> It is highly unlikely that Australia will ever be a principal player in resolving the Middle East situation. Our main challenge is to avoid gratuitous advice and to explore ways in which we can support the evolving peace process and security situation. It is on that basis that we should support the following requirements for postwar stability and security. First, regional organisations, such as the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Arab League, will need considerable transformation but have a potentially vital role to play in developing a regional security consensus. Secondly, the United States and other non-regional countries will be important in underpinning an agreed regional plan for the Gulf and wider Middle East security. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the United Nations should fulfil the expectation of playing some part in building an improved regional security environment, in ensuring some kind of Iraqi reparations and in pursuing Saddam Hussein and others in Iraq responsible for the systematic use of brutality and torture in Kuwait. Fourthly, a program of reconstruction in the region should begin promptly, particularly in Kuwait but not excluding Jordan and other countries seriously affected by the trade sanctions and war. Fifthly, a commitment to avoid a regional arms build-up should be emphasised and an arms embargo on Iraq should continue for the immediate future. Sixthly, the sovereignty of Lebanon and all other regional states must be respected. Seventhly, Israel's Arab neighbours which have not recognised Israel's right to exist in peace and within secure, recognised boundaries should do so. Finally, that process should be reciprocated by Israel's preparedness to negotiate on the Palestinian issue with neighbouring states and with moderate representatives of the Palestinian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude my remarks by drawing some implications for Australia. In addition to our pride in the achievements of our Defence Force, Australians need to face up realistically to the diplomatic and military lessons of the past seven months. First, we must bring the same sense of urgency and single-mindedness which was brought to the Gulf crisis to the issue of addressing the increasingly serious social and economic problems brought about by recession. Secondly, it is time for a realistic reappraisal of our national defence strategy and the state of our defence resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, it is a time for realism about the outlook for US-Australia relations. Our bilateral defence relationship is strong, but concerns about our trade relationship are running deep. We must put those concerns directly to the highest levels of the US Administration and the US Congress. Australia's strong support for the United States in the Gulf crisis warrants American sensitivity to our trade concerns. US trade policy should not do anything to undermine the objective of Australia restoring its level of market share in the Middle East to at least that which existed before the Gulf war. Finally, it is also time for a realistic reappraisal by the Government of its internal constraints which have operated on its decision-making processes over the past seven months on issues ranging from the level of Australia's involvement in the Gulf to relations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the events of the past seven months have shown that Australians at a political and popular level have a very clear idea of when basic standards of decency and law are flouted and when Australia's national interests are engaged. In my speech in the House on 21 January, during the special sitting on the Gulf, I said the following:</PARA>
<PARA>Throughout our history we have been a genuinely peaceful people, but we have never been a pacifist people. We have been a proudly independent country, but never a neutral one. We have always been a nation prepared to stand up for our principles and to stand by our friends . . . We are a nation that believes in a fair go, but not a free ride. </PARA>
<PARA>Australians and, in particular, our Defence Force have once again epitomised these aspects of our national character. Our Defence personnel in the Gulf have performed magnificently. We look forward to their safe return and to assuring them of the high regard in which we hold them. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my statement to the House on 21 January, I said that if there was any practical substance to the notion of a just war it was to be found in the coalition action to liberate Kuwait. By 15 January we had reached the situation where there was no effective way of liberating Kuwait without recourse to war. Negotiations had continued for five months without any suggestion that Iraqi troops would be withdrawn from Kuwait. Persistence in sanctions offered us no guarantee that they would succeed in liberating Kuwait.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those who argued for appeasement, that is, to accept as a fait accompli the conquest of Kuwait by Iraq, were wrong. The evidence was in on Saddam Hussein. He had built a First World army in a Third World country. There was the evidence of his suppression of the Kurds, there was the evidence of the 10-year war with Iran, and then there was the invasion of Kuwait. The lesson should have been clear to all: he would not stop unless he was stopped. That compelled us to the actions of 15 January. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not, of course, just a Western action to liberate Kuwait. President Bush and the United States provided distinguished diplomatic and military leadership. They were supported by governments and military forces from all parts of the world. This use of military force to repel aggression enjoyed a wider international support than for any multinational intervention in our time. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members are aware, several of those Arab countries most threatened by Saddam Hussein were in the forefront of the fight to force the removal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. These countries knew all too well that to appease the unappeasable might bring a short respite, but in the end it would inevitably bring a longer, bloodier and more devastating war. </PARA>
<PARA> The international response to aggression was made strictly in accordance with the collective security provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. When the Charter was signed in San Francisco it was hoped that the threat of the use of international military force contained in the collective security provisions would be sufficient of itself to deter aggression or compel aggressors to give up their conquests. But the United Nations Charter clearly envisages that, if aggressors are not deterred or do not give up their conquests, then military force by the international community would be the appropriate response. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in my earlier statement, the multinational force that was assembled in the Gulf more approached this ideal than any other intervention we have seen in our lifetimes. Now that the war has been concluded, I do not accept that it could or should have been ended earlier or that the coalition forces exceeded the mandate set out in the United Nations resolutions. Until he was defeated, Saddam Hussein treated the world community with contempt. He ignored every opportunity and appeal to withdraw from Kuwait. He ignored the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Until he lost the war he refused to accept the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, despite the intensive efforts of the Soviet Union and other mediators to persuade him to do so. President Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Bessmertnyk deserve our thanks for working so hard to try to bring Saddam Hussein to his senses. It was Saddam Hussein's intransigence that stood in the way of success. </PARA>
<PARA> It is as well to recall that Security Council resolution 678 authorised member states to use all necessary means to force Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait, to implement the other resolutions and to restore international peace and security to the area. To force Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait entailed confronting the military capability which Iraq amassed over the last decade-an army of nearly a million soldiers and a huge arsenal of conventional and other weapons. It required a full scale military assault which had to include not only direct military targets but also the supply lines and infrastructure which underpinned Iraq's military capability and its occupation of Kuwait. It required the coalition to insist that defeated or retreating Iraqi soldiers laid down their arms before being allowed to go home. Let me repeat that it did not include targeting civilians. The fight was not with the Iraqi people. Every death or injury on whatever side is cause for grief. When the truth is known, I am confident that it will reveal how few the civilian casualties were in Iraq, in stark contrast to the deliberate brutalities suffered by the Kuwaiti people at the hands of the occupying forces. </PARA>
<PARA> What have we achieved in the Gulf over the days since 15 January? First, we have liberated Kuwait from the tyranny imposed upon it. That is no small achievement. Amidst the arguments about the rights and wrongs of our military strategy, the people of Kuwait were often forgotten. It was they who bore the primary and awful burden of Iraq's invasion. We must remember the men and women of Kuwait who were shot, tortured and raped. It was the Kuwaitis who had their homes invaded, their property confiscated, their public facilities destroyed and looted. The sovereign people of Kuwait were the first to cheer the allied forces into their cities. They made it very obvious and very clear that they did not wish to be the nineteenth province of Iraq. The military action of which our naval ships were a part was central in enabling the Kuwaiti people to determine their own future. </PARA>
<PARA> A second achievement was to demonstrate the potential of the United Nations in addressing and resolving serious and brutal infringements of national sovereignty. Those who would pursue wealth, territory and power merely by conquering their neighbours will in future have to reappraise and reject such strategies. In essence, we have witnessed one of the most united and powerful examples of collective security this century. As a medium sized nation, Australians must recognise the value of collective security. Few small nations could hope to last for long against aggression by a larger national power without the umbrella of collective security. </PARA>
<PARA> A third related achievement was to demonstrate the supremacy of a united military action. Never this century has victory been so swift and devastating. The military instruments of the doctrine of collective security were simply awesome. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I turn to the future, I want to join the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in paying tribute to the outstanding performance of our Navy in the Gulf. Our ships and crews did everything to enhance their reputation for courage and professionalism and every Australian is right to be very proud of them. I add my congratulations and thanks to the 40 medical personnel serving on the United States Navy vessel Comfort. I would also like to congratulate and thank those dedicated public servants, both abroad in our embassies and here in Australia, who worked so hard to protect Australians and Australian interests. I know honourable members would want to join me in conveying particular thanks to staff and families in our Middle East embassies who carried on working so effectively in difficult and often hazardous circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are unsung heroes and heroines, as my colleague points out. I now turn to the future. The war has been won. It is now vital to win the peace. The coalition victory, a determining event of the post-Cold War era, has reinforced the authority of the United Nations to maintain or restore peace. We must recognise, however, that many of the circumstances of the Gulf crisis were, and are, unique and that the international response to other crises may not follow the same course. Nevertheless, the central role accorded to the United Nations Security Council should provide a foundation on which we can build should other cases occur in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To win the peace it will be essential to revitalise efforts to find solutions for the underlying and longstanding causes of tension in the Middle East. The international community rightly rejected Saddam Hussein's spurious attempt to link the invasion of Kuwait somehow to other quite unrelated issues. But now the war is over we must seriously address those issues: secure and recognised borders for Israel, the future of the Palestinians, the peace and security of Lebanon, and a fairer distribution of the oil wealth of the Middle East. The history of the region shows that, if hopes of progress cannot be fulfilled, the resulting frustration and despair will inevitably lead to a renewed cycle of war and devastation. </PARA>
<PARA> To win the peace it will also be essential to give fresh impetus to attempts to reduce the proliferation of conventional and non-conventional weapons. The experiences of this war should impart a new sense of urgency to the need to strengthen the international disarmament mechanisms. There must be strong and universally supported conventions banning chemical and biological weapons. Saddam Hussein's drive to acquire nuclear weapons surely demonstrates beyond dispute the need to redouble international efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weaponry by reinforcing observance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and by all other possible means. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also do what we can to participate in the postwar economic reconstruction of the region, in particular of Kuwait. Of course, self-interest is involved. But as any television viewer will know, Kuwait has been devastated by the Iraqi occupation. It wants to rebuild, and it is actively seeking good companies to do the work. While rightly concerned to see early progress in the resolution of the major political and security issues of the region, the Australian Government cannot neglect Australia's substantial economic interests in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The region has long been a major market for Australian grains and other primary products and has been clearly identified for some time as an area with considerable potential for a more diverse range of exports. We are now particularly conscious that in the post-crisis environment there will be new opportunities, as well as new challenges, for Australian trade and commerce in the region. Our quick, resolute and unwavering response to the invasion of Kuwait has clearly registered at the highest levels in Kuwait and in Saudi Arabia and we have reason to hope that it will contribute to an atmosphere in which Australian business houses will be more than ever welcome in the region.</PARA>
<PARA> Kuwait itself will have to be restocked and rebuilt. Our embassies overseas and our Austrade representatives have kept in close touch with developments in preparation for this restocking and reconstruction. While it is evident that United States and United Kingdom contractors will be given a substantial share of the business, we are confident that Australian companies which demonstrate their competitiveness and their capabilities can also win rewarding roles in the reconstruction process. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the energetic pursuit of new business opportunities, there is also a challenge at this time to redouble our efforts to preserve and redevelop existing areas of trade within the Middle East, especially in commodities such as grains, meat and dairy products. It is too early yet, with the sanctions still in place, to talk of resuming our trade with Iraq, but that clearly is an objective which will remain high on our agenda as the commercial doors are reopened. </PARA>
<PARA> With these objectives in mind, the Government has developed a clear strategy for the pursuit of our commercial interests in the region. In the first instance, as the Prime Minister has announced, I propose to visit the United States and Saudi Arabia myself, accompanied by a delegation of officials and business advisers. The objectives of the visit will be to ensure that we are fully briefed on plans for the reconstruction of Kuwait, to ensure that the Kuwaiti authorities in turn are aware of what Australia has to offer in this process and to develop advice for the Government and Australian business on the opportunities for Australian involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> I will also be taking the opportunity of my visit to Washington later this week to make known our concern that existing Australian commodities trade with the region should not be undercut by subsidised food exports from any of the coalition partners with whom we have worked during the past seven months. I will at the same time seek such briefings as are appropriate on the role of US companies and agencies in the process of Kuwait's reconstruction in the expectation that there will be opportunities for Australian subcontracting. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist further in focusing and facilitating Australia's trade with the region, I have asked Mr Paul Barratt, the special adviser to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to assume responsibility for energising and consolidating the Government's assistance to industry in the region. In this task, with the rank of Ambassador, Mr Barratt will work closely with Austrade, with other key government departments and with the private sector, both directly and through industry groups. He will accompany me on my visit to the region and will be introduced in this role. Also accompanying me will be Mr Charles Jamieson, the senior trade commissioner from Austrade, who has extensive experience in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. </PARA>

Austrade, of course, has already had substantial contact with Australian companies interested in pursuing new opportunities in the Gulf. This process will be taken a major step further through the business advisers who will accompany me on my visit and, on my return, through briefings of interested companies and industry groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister has said, we will also be reviewing our diplomatic and trade representation in the region, with the aim of deciding where it would be most appropriate to locate a new embassy. This is a prospect which has been under consideration for some time and in the post-war environment its time has come. All this said, it remains self-evident that however active the Government may be in this area private companies should not stand back and wait for opportunities to come to them. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the Gulf war is the first major event of the post-Cold War era. By resisting aggression, the international community has shown that it has learned one of the vital lessons of history. To consolidate a new, peaceful world order, the international community must now build on the lessons of the Gulf war-that aggression must be resisted and the underlying causes of tension addressed and removed, and that the security of small and medium sized states depends on a strong United Nations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the parliamentary National Party, I formally welcome on the floor of this Parliament the cease-fire in the Gulf and support the points raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) with regard to the contribution made by the Australian contingent in the Middle East.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before turning to more specific matters, I welcome the fact that the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) has confirmed that not only will he be going to Washington as part of the bipartisan mission which I and the Leader of the Opposition proposed to the Government, but also he will now be going on to the Middle East, and Saudi Arabia in particular, for a number of consultations, briefings and meetings not only with the Government of Saudi Arabia but also with Kuwaiti Government representatives and others. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the Gulf war the Australian Government closed down a number of trade offices throughout the Middle East, including the trade office at Bahrain. I know the Minister would recognise Bahrain as one of the commercial and transport hubs of the Middle East, a barometer of the Middle East and a gateway into the Middle East. Yet we have closed down a number of trade offices through that area, for one reason or another, and at a critical time. </PARA>
<PARA> We are left, for example in Bahrain, with just one office of the Meat Research Corporation, with two very capable officers. I take the opportunity to point this out to the Minister and ask that he might, as part of his visit, not only rethink the question of the additional new embassy which may yet be placed in the Middle East, but also review again the large number of trade offices we have closed down in that region in recent years. Now is the time to rethink whether in fact we should go back the other way and reopen some, if not all, of those trade offices as part of a positive drive into the Middle East in the aftermath of the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> That clearly is a responsibility for the Minister. I wish him well with the bipartisan mission to Washington. I am glad the Government has climbed down and acceded to our request for the Minister to take with him two representatives from the coalition-namely, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), who is the shadow Minister for primary industry, and also the Liberal shadow Minister for trade negotiations, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). I believe both of those gentlemen will work capably and constructively with the Minister and with the other representatives, including John Allwright, National President of the National Farmers Federation, as they go about their congressional and Administration liaison over the next few days. I am quite sure that the Australian congressional liaison officer, Mr Chris Lamb, will greatly facilitate those arrangements. It was as a consequence of a previous bipartisan mission that the Government accepted a recommendation to establish a congressional liaison officer and I think that has borne some fruit already in relation to the arrangements for this forthcoming bipartisan mission. </PARA>
<PARA> In focusing especially on the Gulf, I first want to draw a general lesson-and I do so as a veteran myself. More detailed lessons will emerge as there is a careful analysis of all that took place in the Gulf war. There is still a great deal of information to come out of the Middle East about detailed aspects of the military conflict and what went on during the long period when Kuwait was largely closed off to the rest of the world under the occupation of the Iraqi army, with its horrific record of conduct, destruction, human destruction and devastation of the landscape of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I must say as a Vietnam veteran that one set of facts strikes a chord very close to my heart. One key lesson should be remembered. During the Vietnam war some 501 Australians and approximately 50,000 Americans were killed in action over a period of a decade. During the war against Iraq, the Gulf war, whilst official confirmation of figures is not yet available, it would seem that approximately 97 members of the coalition forces were killed in action, while accidental deaths totalled about the same- certainly a total figure a great deal less than 500. Any loss of life is a tragedy. However, the contrast is very clear-namely, that bold and decisive action, helped greatly by terrain and the technology of the 1990s on the military front, can and does pay handsome dividends when compared with hesitancy and indecision in a military circumstance. The cold, bare statistical facts are there for all to see. </PARA>
<PARA> For all parliamentarians a clear message which should come out of this most recent war is that it is our duty to determine whether a particular situation justifies the outbreak of war or an Australian commitment to war. Once that fundamental decision has been taken, it is in everyone's interest to leave the military as unhindered as possible in the operational aspects of that war. We are fortunate in this country to have a highly professional military force-Navy, Army and Air Force-whose judgment by and large can be trusted. One lesson that clearly came out of Vietnam was that constant political interference and the continual qualifying of objectives can have and did have disastrous consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to note that General Schwarzkopf made it very clear that he was not in any way interfered with by instructions from the White House or by telephone calls from President Bush as he went about his duties. I think there was just one conversation through the whole period-from 2 August until the cease-fire-between the President of the United States and the General Officer Commanding, Allied Forces. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again that once the objectives and parameters are defined and war is declared it is best to leave the military to prosecute the war in the most efficient and direct manner possible. On a strategic level, deterrence relies not just on the ability and capability of nations to wage war but, importantly, on the willpower of political leadership to take action. In this regard I commend in the strongest terms, on behalf of the National Party of Australia and my colleagues generally, the leadership of the President of the United States, George Bush. It was outstanding leadership of the free world for which he deserves the highest commendation and which has led to the correct result and the correct activity-the reversal of the horrific invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. I also commend his key officers, including the Secretary of State, Mr Baker, and the Secretary of Defense, Mr Cheney, for their related roles. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I would like to focus on the peace movement and one adjunct of that peace movement, namely, the Australian Democrats. I wish to make some observations on the emptiness of so much of their rhetoric which has passed for so-called debate by this peace movement. Firstly, let me ask where members of the peace movement are today. They were not out the front of Parliament House for the arrival of 35,000 letters from hard pressed farmers. Today I noticed that they had gone from the front forecourt of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I look around the galleries and recall standing in this place in January on the occasion of the special sitting of Parliament to consider the matters in the Gulf. The galleries were packed and members of the peace movement were interjecting. There may well be members of the peace movement amongst those present in the gallery today. Let me say to them that they are welcome; and they are better behaved than those who were here a month ago. I do accept that there are genuine pacifists in the peace movement. My only criticism of them would be their naivety. However, it seems to me that the vast majority of those in the peace movement, and particularly those who disrupted this House during the debate in January, have been addicted to doctrine as opposed to any process of rational thought and debate. It seems to me that they are addicted to the drug of anti-American rhetoric and peace at any cost myopia and that should be spelt out at every opportunity. They have gone strangely silent since the cease-fire, since the restoration of freedom to Kuwait and since we have started to read more and more about the atrocities committed by the Iraqi Army in Kuwait. </PARA>

One just locks into the groove of anti-American pacifism without one ounce of thought about the international ramifications of condoning an invasion. In this regard the Democrats have proved themselves unquestionably to be the political prostitutes of Australian politics. What started off as a party which was designed to keep parliamentarians honest has become a party of simple-minded opportunism. First the Democrats said that the frigates should not go to the Middle East. Then they said that the frigates had to come home from the Middle East. Then they said that we should rely on economic sanctions but they would not provide any basis by which those economic sanctions could be policed-that is, by sending our ships to the Middle East. It is about time they were fully exposed for their total nonsense with regard to the Gulf.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And stupidity, indeed. Topping it all off was the chilling comment of the former leader of the Democrats, Janine Haines, who said in very clear-cut terms before leaving Australia to go to Iraq, against the expressed wishes of the Government of the day-but I accept she has a right to travel-that of course she would go to Baghdad to do the required amount of grovelling to one Saddam Hussein. Worse still, at no stage did I hear Senator Powell, current leader of the Democrats, or Senator McLean, the Democrat from New South Wales, who is an ex-Army officer as well, in any way rebut, deny or step away from that statement by Janine Haines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats will rue the day that they took their cheap opportunistic attitude with regard to the Gulf war and they will pay a price. I add for good measure that the sight of Senator Jo Vallentine screeching from this public gallery is something that I will not forget for a long time. It is something that I hope she might regret for the rest of her days. </PARA>
<PARA> I am convinced that had we followed the course of action recommended by the peace groups and the Democrats, Kuwait would still be in the hands of Iraq today. It would still be in Iraqi hands next year and for a period beyond. I think the Democrats have much to answer for and it is high time people on both sides of this lower House challenged many of the comments and statements which they get away with, week after week. I might also remind the House on behalf of my own constituency particularly, and the National Party, that if the Democrats had their way not only would we have the reintroduction of an inheritance tax but we would also have a statutory ban on the live sheep trade with the very countries to which the Minister is going next week in order to try to re-establish the right protocols to allow the resumption of that trade. Let us see the Democrats for what they are; they are the political prostitutes of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, I refer to the Australian contingent in direct terms. Having visited the ships in the Gulf over Christmas, I would say that their commanders and their families have a right to be proud- as indeed have all Australians-of the contribution made by our contingent. It ill behoves anyone to suggest that there was no element of danger associated with the activity of our contingent, be it the Army officers in the desert, the clearance diving team, those serving on HMAS Brisbane, HMAS Sydney and HMAS Supply or the medical team on USNS Comfort. </PARA>
<PARA> I know what fear is about, sadly, for reasons of some 20 years ago. When a convoluted message came through that the ambassadors were being withdrawn by Saddam Hussein on the day before Christmas Eve-the other part of that message did not come through but subsequently emerged; it was a routine recall and they were going to be returned-we were sailing out of Bahrain towards Iraq. I can tell honourable members that there was a chill in the air, a degree of tension and a full alert status in case of a potential exocet missile attack or the like. The morale and professionalism of the Australian service personnel were apparent in all their activities. I saw that attitude then and I have read about it, before and since. We have a right to be proud; they served in the best traditions of Anzac. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I have to say that the Gulf war period has given the Government somewhat of a Gulf honeymoon. That is over and we now have a duty to focus on the horrific economic downturn. We must always remember that the challenge ahead is to work toward stability in the volatile region of the Middle East. I hope that will occur and we will resume our trading operations with those countries on a large scale. That is essential. We must also remember that our war was not against the Iraqi people but rather against the despotic, corrupt, incorrigible leadership of one Saddam Hussein, who should be consigned to the dustbin of history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pleasure to follow the leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in this debate because in the spirit of great genuineness, may I say, there is no person who so clearly, through his own actions in visiting our forces in the Middle East, gave more enthusiastic support-and indeed more discerning support as a former military man himself-to the effort which we undertook. I have very much appreciated the support he has given and I endorse the remarks he has made-not least the magnanimous remarks he made about the Australian Democrats and the peace movement, the shallowness of whose thinking about this conflict needed to be seen to be believed. I am left in some distress as to the lack of analysis which some of those people in the peace movement gave to what my colleague the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) said was one of the most defensibly just wars in which Australia has been involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last Saturday it was a great honour for me to go out to HMAS Success to join the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and more than 5,000 enthusiastic South Australians in welcoming Success home from what was in fact the longest tour of duty of any of our ships in the Persian Gulf. As has been mentioned already in this debate, unlike what occurred during another conflict which ended nearly 20 years ago, the warmth of the welcome which the citizens of Adelaide and a large number of next of kin who flew in from elsewhere gave to Success told the ship's company that they had the support of the overwhelming majority of Australians as well as the gratitude of Australians for the task that they had undertaken. I think that gratitude was symbolised by the Prime Minister's announcement that the company of that ship and those who had served in the Gulf after hostilities broke out on 17 January would receive the Australian Active Service Medal with Kuwait clasp. That provided appropriate official recognition of the very difficult job that they had done and the entirely professional manner in which they had done it. I might add that whilst the Australian Active Service Medal will go to those who served in the Gulf after 17 January, the Australian Service Medal will go to those who served for the requisite period in the Gulf before the conflict broke out. </PARA>
<PARA> The job performed by our servicemen was never complicated by any issue concerning conditions of service. The conditions of service package, which was announced in this House in August and which applied to the service men and service women when they went away-and I am not implying that one can put a money value on these things-removed monetary hardship as an issue for the families of those sailors and members of the armed services and I believe contributed materially to the excellent job that they did. The families, a large number of whom I met, were very glad to have the crew back and I am sure that there will be similar welcomes for the crews of HMAS Westralia, HMAS Brisbane and HMAS Sydney, as well as for the medical and clearance diving teams who are still there, the logistics support team, which is distributed in various places around the Persian Gulf, and the officers who served on exchange with allied units in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> I make particular mention of the medical teams. The 40 people who are there now and the 20 people who were there earlier and who came home, I think, just before Christmas have been rather the forgotten people of this deployment, partly for a reason for which we should all be very grateful-that is, that they did not have to treat the very large numbers of casualties which at one time were promised. I think we all recall Saddam Hussein saying that the coalition forces would drown in a river of their own blood. There were also threats concerning various other weapons of mass destruction. These did not eventuate, but we could not have known beforehand that they would not. I want to pay particular tribute to those men and women of the medical teams, partly because some of them were not just volunteers-as all of our service men and service women are-but they were doubly volunteers in that they were reservists who had to abandon their civilian jobs in order to go to the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a while since HMAS Darwin and HMAS Adelaide came back to Australia, and we should not forget the job that they did in enforcing the United Nations sanctions-sometimes in very testing circumstances. Amidst the drama of the hot conflict on land we have perhaps forgotten that in the earlier days situations required our ships to fire shots across the bows of merchant ships and to land boarding parties from helicopters and small boats. Some of those situations were pretty tense and carried with them some serious risks of escalation in ways which were quite unpredictable-both in the situations themselves and in their consequences. For a certain time after Christmas but before 15 January I was acting as Minister for Defence. I was sitting on the other end of a secure telephone when we were getting real time reports of what our ships were doing, and I was thinking, `Will the button that one pushes start a conflict in the Middle East?'. It made one very fully aware of the difficult and dangerous task that our ships were performing. But in all of these cases the performance of our crews was nothing short of outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention the performance of those people who backed them up-the role of the Maritime Commander, Rear Admiral Ken Doolan; the Assistant Chief of Operations, Rear Admiral Taylor-whose brother, as some honourable members will know, is a member of this House; the Assistant Chief of Logistics, Major-General Grey, whose units were the sinews in keeping our forces supplied; and the members of their staffs who ensured that our part of the operations ran so smoothly. I should also say that the briefings which were conducted by Major-General Baker, the head of the Defence Intelligence Organisation, and other senior officers from the Office of National Assessments, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Australian Navy kept the Prime Minister and Ministers here very well informed of what was happening. Those officers also displayed great prescience and great knowledge of what the next steps might be. Although this was based partly on inside information, it was also based on their military skill and professionalism. They would say, `If I were there I would be doing this' and nine times out of ten that is what would follow as this conflict unfolded. It is a tribute to the professionalism of our forces at the very highest level that we had access to that kind of expertise and advice upon which one could rely. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Navy, the conflict presented an opportunity to put its logistics, its doctrine, its ships and its men and women to the test of actual operations. I believe its performance exceeded all expectations in the most magnificent way. The Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice-Admiral Hudson, who retires this week, goes out on a very high note. In recognition of his 44 years of service in the Navy, he will be promoted, on the eve of his retirement, to a full admiral-which I know pleased him greatly. I know that in the coming years he will be able to reflect with great pride on the contribution which the Navy has made under his leadership. Indeed, for some of the time that I was the acting Defence Minister he was the Acting Chief of the Defence Force and, even though we were a couple of people who were not supposed to be doing those jobs, I was very pleased to be able to rely on such an experienced and capable officer. </PARA>
<PARA> I also pay tribute to my former colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. As I interjected when another member was speaking earlier in the debate, they were in some ways the unsung heroes and heroines in all this. I thought their reporting was first rate. They did not run away and hide when the problems really began; they stuck to their posts and kept the Government very well informed of what was happening. </PARA>
<PARA> For myself and all Australians it was a great relief that when hostilities ceased Australia had taken no casualties. Indeed, that the casualties taken by all the coalition forces were so small, considering the dimensions of the conflict and the size of the military objective, is a tribute to the thoroughness of the planning and the preparation of our coalition partners. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen an astonishingly large military force applied not against a nation or a nation's people but to achieve a clear military objective-the liberation of Kuwait. There will be many lessons to be learnt from this conflict-military, political and diplomatic lessons. I noticed that someone called this the most cerebral of wars that had been conducted. It was reminiscent of the way in which plans were so meticulously followed in those old World War II movies where grim-faced women moved tanks around on tables and said, `This is what is happening next and this is the division that is going there', and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA> The war does provide a number of lessons of a military kind. One of the most encouraging of those lessons is that coalitions comprising forces from many diverse countries with different levels of training, diverse cultures and political systems can be put together to oppose aggression. One has to pay tribute to President Bush for the part that he personally played in that. </PARA>
<PARA> For our own part, one of the great lessons was the operational readiness of which we are capable. The orders for our ships to leave for the Middle East were given some four days before they went through the Sydney heads, which was an astonishingly quick response. I believe that that tells us something about the willingness not just of the military but also of those civilians who had to take part in ammunitioning the ships and in providing the stores and getting them onto the ships on a ready basis. It was really a wonderful effort and I pay tribute to them as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Another lesson was that Australia's strategy in recent years of relying on the technological edge in our military purchases and military strategy-on keeping an edge in the equipment we have over anyone who could be expected to oppose us-is the right strategy to be followed. In large part, this was a war which was won by high technology. Although that technology can be very expensive and very demanding in the kind of training we need to undertake, I believe that it has shown the worth of the equipment purchased by not just this Government, I should say, but by previous governments. While the FA18s, the submarines and the smart weapons that we have acquired are expensive, one can now see that that was the right track to have gone down. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking of defence policy more widely, it is an endorsement of the self-reliance strategy that we have followed within an alliance relationship. We are not just a country which can give a pretty good account of itself when it comes to defending our territory but, as we have seen, our forces can cooperate readily, naturally, comfortably and to great effect with those of our alliance partners-and they certainly did so. </PARA>
<PARA> As many people have said, it is now a task of winning the peace, and that may be an even more difficult task than winning this war. That will involve a settlement of the Israel-Palestine question; secure and recognised borders for Israel but with a proper future for Palestinians; peace and sovereignty in Lebanon; a real effort to abolish and control weapons of mass destruction-chemical and nuclear-and to control the trade in conventional arms. We start out on these tasks with a hope and a high note for the future that the conclusion of this war will hold more lessons of a cautionary kind for dictators than perhaps we could have dared hope for in the beginning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to join with other honourable members of the House in congratulating the men and women of our defence forces and, I might add, in support of the Minister for Defence, Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), my former colleagues from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who served in such difficult posts as Baghdad, Amman and Riyadh over recent months. Their actions, both in the diplomatic arena and in our defence services, set a standard of excellence to which future generations can look forward with very real satisfaction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The addresses given today by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) put in very clear terms the reality of Australia's involvement in what undoubtedly will be seen in the future as one of the most important and successful international peacekeeping initiatives conducted since the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard much in recent months about peace dividends and the need to achieve a new world order, which Saddam Hussein was the first person to challenge. This is worth serious consideration, because throughout history the world has normally been in a state of disorder, not in a state of order. When we talk about a new world order, one has to determine precisely what that means and what can really be achieved. The fundamental lesson which we must learn from the Gulf war-and if we fail to do so it will be at a cost to future generations-is simply this: peace can be maintained provided enough nations, albeit very disparate ones, are prepared to serve together within the context of the United Nations, in this case under the leadership of the United States. This House and all Australians, in fact all men and women of goodwill, should congratulate President Bush for his steadfast leadership and capacity, which many people doubted he had. Before this war many people saw George Bush as a political wimp, a has-been, a one-timer. Now, his popularity is in the high 80s, if not 90s, in public opinion polls in the United States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ninety-one per cent. George Bush and those he has around him brought together and kept together what is indisputably one of the most truly remarkable and disparate groups of nations ever seen, certainly since the Second World War. Some 30 nations were involved in the Kuwait action in the Gulf and elsewhere, and many others were on the periphery also offering their support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is incredible in that context that Saddam Hussein was capable of such an extraordinary demonstration of bad judgment that he was prepared to take on not just the United Nations, as he ultimately did, but also the might of the United States and its allies. The military outcome now appears so clear. But it is interesting now, with the benefit of hindsight, to read through the articles written by pundits who claimed to know so much during the last six months. They emphasised that the outcome was not guaranteed. The realities of diplomatic and military power in the shifting sands of the desert were such that nobody could be certain of the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I come back to the extraordinary success of President Bush. At one stage there was a very real risk that the coalition would split, Israel would retaliate, the Syrians would go home, the Egyptians would perhaps prove to be unreliable and the Saudis would make life difficult for the American forces. Hundreds of thousands of Americans and Europeans of an alien culture were living in the very centre of Islam. Just think of the implications of that for a very conservative people like the Saudis. Yet everybody was prepared to sink their differences and give this endeavour a chance to succeed. When the air war started and the military ground action commenced on the seventeenth of last month, we saw the mighty war machine's inexorable movement forward, in a sustained and controlled way under the leadership of General Schwarzkopf. It was one of the most outstanding military endeavours at any time in modern history. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister made the point that in the midst of success in the Middle East war we must not stand back and gloat. It is indeed true that thousands died, and many more thousands will have their lives forever affected by the events of the last six months. But looking at the Middle East in its totality, the world asks for one thing: essentially, it asks for peace. It asks that all those people who have never known peace in the Middle East for most of this century have their chance. </PARA>
<PARA> Having lived in the Middle East for some time, I can appreciate the difficulties and the emotional stress and strain that is passed on generation after generation. Whether they be Palestinians living in refugee camps, minorities in places such as Syria or Iraq, Kurdish tribesmen or Lebanese Christians, constantly they live in an environment in which they cannot be sure that their lives and those of their families will be safe, and where the rule of law, as we understand it, is often observed more in the breach than in the observance. One of the fundamental objectives must surely be to try to bring to the Middle East a conception of the rule of law within the context of the United Nations conventions and resolutions. Those resolutions are now in place. The question now is: how successful will the world be in maintaining that peace? There is a fundamental question: who will maintain the peace? Are we seriously expecting the United States to continue to be the world's policeman? To be frank, there are probably people in Washington-no doubt there are people in the military establishment in the United States-who would regard some continuing world role as something they personally would see as attractive. The inexorable reality is that the United States economy can no longer support a major military presence over the five continents of the world and over all its oceans. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the fundamental question has to be asked once again. When we speak of a new world order-a world of peace-will the moral and, to a large degree, the military leadership of the world still vest in the United States? If so, it is for one fundamental reason: since the breakdown of the bipolar world balance, there is simply no alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great losers, of course, of the recent Middle East war has been the Soviet Union. With all its vaunted technology in every field-in the sea, on land, and in the air-the United States was able to prove that its technology was of a world standard with which there was simply no comparison. Already we have seen suggestions in the Kremlin, from those in the militarist establishment, that they want more arms money because theirs have been found lacking. If that is the outcome in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), indeed it is unfortunate, because what we now must be striving for is disarmament in the Middle East, which will automatically mean that the USSR and its surrogates, such as Iraq, will be disarmed. They must start with the obvious things. They must remove any capacity for biological war and for chemical war, and of course we must also remove any capacity for nuclear war. At some stage Israel must be introduced into this most important negotiation, because although the Israelis may not have stated publicly they have the atomic weapon, most people presume that they have. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately the region must look at something more than that. We are talking about peace for the people of this most disparate and ancient region-a region which has been given enormous political import for two fundamental reasons. Firstly, the reality that 75 per cent of the world's oil reserves are in the Middle East is an inescapable fact. This will always mean that the Middle East, especially in the Gulf area, is of particular geopolitical significance to the entire world. Secondly, we have the fundamental problem of trying to achieve a settlement between states which have been, at least since 1948, in a state of war. </PARA>
<PARA> The list is interesting. We have Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. Every one of those states must now be involved in the settlement of the Middle East. Kuwait must be rebuilt. It will cost at least $100 billion, and Australian companies naturally want to be involved. The costs of rebuilding Iraq-and I repeat the words of previous speakers that our war essentially was against that despot Saddam Hussein, not against the Iraqi people-will be at least $100 billion, if not more. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have the question of Iran, that complex nation, sitting on the sidelines, but which suffered grievously for eight years in a war brought upon it by Iraq and, I regret to say, supported at that time by the United States, which had not forgotten the embarrassment caused by Iran. But the role of Iran will be critical, because the Iranians are rebuilding. They are one of the most powerful nations in the region, and they are potentially immensely rich because of their oil reserves. There is also the influence they have over the Shi'ites, which is one of the major sects of Islam. Shi'ites also form the majority of the population of southern Iraq. We have heard reports in the last few days of Saddam Hussein's administration being deposed in Basra and some of the other larger towns in Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to see political instability now further complicated by religious instability, there will be major problems in this part of the world. I want no-one to be under any illusion when we speak of Islamic fundamentalism. We are not just speaking of something like capitalism versus communism-quite the contrary. We are talking about the belief of many people who follow the religion of Islam: that in a cultural as well as in a religious sense, western values have undermined traditional Islamic values. When they speak of fundamentalism, they are trying to look back, to find in the Koran the very basic principles of life upon which they believe their concept of order should be based. Whether it can be married to a more democratic system of government remains to be seen, but we must encourage it because the one thing the Middle East has never had is a well-established, democratic tradition, or even a quasi-democratic tradition, in this century. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to the question of Australia's involvement in the region. Principally, we want to win back our trade. It will not be easy, especially if the United States supports some Marshall Plan type operations in relation to Kuwait or Iraq. The important thing is that Iraq owes us over $600m for wheat for which we have not yet been paid. Iraq was Australia's largest importer of wheat, and therefore, naturally, the Opposition supports and is now a party to the delegation which will be leaving soon for the United States to try to make representations to the Congress on this most critical issue. Again there is the risk that Australia will be more or less caught in a vice between the European Community on the one side and the United States on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all, in the re-establishment of our position in the Middle East, we must take cognisance of the fact that the Trucial states-Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia-offer us potentially enormous economic opportunities in the future. Saudi Arabia, for example, whilst it has only a small population of about 12 million, has gone well beyond the stage of self-sustained growth. It is now reaching a position where it wants to have large secondary industries, which in turn will create significant markets for our raw materials. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us never forget that the distance between the Gulf states and Australia is less than the distance to most of Europe, and certainly North America. For those who claim we do not have certain geographical advantages, make sure of this: in the context of much of the Middle East, Australia does have advantages. The important thing is-unlike in recent years when this Government withdrew our trade posts from most of the Trucial states and the Gulf-we must go in there with a clear direction, a clear intention to give good service, to maintain our market position, and to ensure that Australia's status in the Middle East is preserved. We have helped to fight for its freedom; it is only appropriate that we should also be involved in rebuilding the peace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the cease-fire and am relieved that there have been no Australian casualties. I believe it is now incumbent upon the Government to bring the ships home as soon as it is operationally possible. Now that we have achieved, to all intents and purposes, a cease-fire, I think that it is now time for very careful analysis and consideration of what has occurred. Problems existed before 2 August last year, and many of those still exist and new problems have been created. We need to consider what action is required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the prime causes of the war were, firstly, aggression and, secondly, inflexibility. Saddam Hussein acted with aggression, brutality and finally incompetence during the invasion and annexation of Kuwait. He should never have invaded Kuwait and, when he did, he should have got out by 15 January. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, I think that the strategy of the United Nations (UN) forces-including the major force, the United States (US)-was inflexible. I refer to President Bush's statements on several occasions, in various forms, that there would never be any negotiations, never any compromises, never any concessions. Every plan and every initiative leading up to 17 January foundered, in my view, on intransigence on the one hand and inflexibility on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that even as late as just over a week ago President Gorbachev's six-point plan should have been accepted. It was very similar to the plan put forward by the two Foreign Ministers on 29 January. The US rejected that plan, but equally the final ultimatum of the US should have been accepted by Saddam Hussein and the Iraqis. Always, the allied battle plan was to destroy the Iraqi military and civilian infrastructure, then to bombard Iraqi communications, then to bombard the Iraqi army and, finally, to launch a ground offensive which, in the words of General Colin Powell, would encircle and then kill the Iraqi forces. </PARA>
<PARA> After the bombing war started, there was always going to be massive damage up until 24 February, as I will outline in a moment. But that was certainly exacerbated by the ground offensive which commenced on 24 February. I refer to the additional damage that Kuwait needlessly suffered-that is, the brutalisation of its citizens, the undoubted loss of life that occurred after 24 February in Kuwait and the firing of literally hundreds of oilwells by the Iraqis. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer to the apparent expansion of the allied war aims, which has been commented upon in great detail on many television programs and in many articles by journalists in the region. The allies sought to go beyond enforcing the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait and returning its former regime, to the destruction of Iraqi military forces and the consequent destruction of the administration, if possible, as a result of that increased destruction of the military. I think that most people-whether or not they agree with the details of what I am saying-would agree that the result of this action was evident in the sickening slaughter on the exit roads from Kuwait after the withdrawal was announced, which was referred to by many of the forces participating as a sort of turkey shoot against, basically, a fleeing army. I cannot hail that development, as I cannot hail the actions of the Iraqis in Kuwait, particularly in the final week, which were needless and unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the most important issue-the problems that we have been left with. One point that I heard made on Cable News Network television related to the alleged differences between Secretary of Defense Cheney and Secretary of State Baker. One commentator was saying that after the war is over, James Baker and the Department of State have to get the US out of all this, have to mop up all the problems. Those problems are numerous. </PARA>
<PARA> The first problem is the huge damage and loss of life. Although the allied losses thankfully were very light-something like 100 lives lost-there was a much greater loss of life on the part of the Iraqis and the Kuwaitis. The total loss of life is still not confirmed but there will probably have been, depending on which press report one reads, somewhere between 50,000 to 80,000 Iraqi troops killed. An unknown number of Kuwaitis have been killed, tortured or injured. The second problem is the damage to the infrastructure of the two nations. Current estimates indicate a $50 billion loss to Kuwait and up to $250 billion worth of damage to Iraqi infrastructure. Another problem which has to be addressed is the obvious residual well of despair and bitterness which will remain within the Arab masses- particularly in the north African states, in Jordan, to an extent in Syria, and certainly amongst the Palestinians and the Iraqis. </PARA>
<PARA> A further problem, which is a relatively new development, is the anarchy which is developing in Kuwait and southern Iraq. The Kuwaiti resistance fighters are still not under the confines and restraints of the legitimate returning government. They seem to be seeking revenge against the Palestinians who were guest workers in Kuwait. Not all of them have been collaborators, and even the collaborators should not be subjected to revenge tactics. Anarchy can also be found in southern Iraq, particularly in cities such as Basra where the Shi'ite Islamic fundamentalists are seeking control of the city. Even though we might all like to see the end of Saddam and his regime, people who want to exchange one undesirable government for another-the Islamic fundamentalists-should think again. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem is the future instability in Kuwait and the Gulf states themselves as oppositions legitimately press for overdue progress towards democracy. The most enduring problem is the Palestinian issue -the need to achieve a solution and the increased Israeli determination as a result of the war and the Scud missiles to resist withdrawal from occupied territories. Prime Minister Shamir has made it very clear that withdrawal from the occupied territories is not a topic on his peacetime agenda, and it ought to be. Solutions to all these issues I have just enunciated are imperative. </PARA>
<PARA> President Mitterrand has called for another special meeting of the Security Council and James Baker is about to undertake `regional consultations', in inverted commas. All I can say is that given the rigorous action which the allies have undertaken in order to liberate Kuwait, James Baker must do more this time around than simply leave Shamir his telephone number. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is what is to be done to address all of those post-war problems which, in the end, can be seen to be even more daunting than the pre-war problems. I will briefly suggest what would be on my agenda and what I think ought to be on this Government's agenda. A UN peacekeeping force must be established immediately in Kuwait because of the problems that I have pointed to-the delays in restoring order and in restoring the previous government to power and the possible attacks on the Palestinian guest workers. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is a need to reconstruct Iraq and Kuwait quickly. Both are oil rich states, and both can underwrite a lot of their own reconstruction. Given the damage to Iraq, costing something like $250 billion, it is hard to see how any substantial reparations can be achieved if we are going to be part of bringing Iraq back quickly into the civilised world from the Stone Age into which it has been bombed. Why full sanctions continue to be necessary against a background of virtual non-existence of power, water and sewage treatment plants is basically puzzling to me. Certainly the sanctions should be continued with regard to military hardware, but what good purpose is the United States achieving by insisting on the continuance of sanctions in this situation, which would obviously constrain the importing of various components and goods which would be necessary to resupply power, water, sewage treatment plants and basic human services. Mr Speaker, I agree with President Mitterrand, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>The United Nations have a duty to organise the return to peace . . . Israel must really set out safe and recognised borders and the means of ensuring its security, and Palestinians, as a people, must have their own identity, homeland and state. </PARA>
<PARA>I support what President Mitterrand has said. I understand that he said that for the first time-in other words, he has changed his position and is now saying that the Israelis must withdraw from the occupied territories and that an international peace conference must be put in place which would underpin that withdrawal from the occupied territories and the move towards the establishment of a Palestinian homeland. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject the call by General Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Minister who called for Palestinians to be driven out of the occupied territories into Jordan and for that to be made their homeland. I believe that the proposals of Israeli Prime Minister Shamir for local government fall well short of Palestinian expectations and cannot be seen as a solution to their aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I must take issue with the outline in the Prime Minister's statement regarding the concept of the new world order. Frankly I am sceptical about that. I do not deny that a new post Cold War situation exists-that is a new world situation. Nor do I deny that the massive firepower used in Kuwait and southern Iraq will have a deterrent effect upon possible future aggression. But I am sceptical of a world view which envisages United Nations collective decisions being enforced by a single major superpower with that superpower having power of veto over the initial UN vote which authorises the action. There is an inexorable law that nations always act in their own best interest, especially superpowers. Therefore it is hard to imagine altruistic action in every circumstance. I note in this regard that my opinion is shared by no less than Henry Kissinger. </PARA>
<PARA> However, while our Government truly believes in this new world order concept, it is our responsibility in Government and in this Parliament to articulate our position at every opportunity-that is, during United Nations deliberations, during any resulting military action, and particularly postwar as we seek to instigate postwar peace arrangements. With respect to the Middle East and the Persian Gulf, it is this last requirement which should now dominate the Government's thinking. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pleasure to follow the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) in this debate and to note what I consider to be a significantly different tone in the remarks he is making today compared with those that he made when he spoke in this debate in January. I suppose it just goes to prove the truth of the old adage that winners are grinners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The threatened `mother of all battles' was over in 100 hours. Victory for the allies, as has been noted here today on a number of occasions, was comprehensive and resulted in a total rout of the Iraqi forces. This was a victory of right over wrong; it was a victory of good over evil. Saddam Hussein is an evil man. By any measure, he must rank in history with other evil men who have sought to promote themselves at the expense of others. On this occasion Saddam's self-promotion has been at the expense not only of the people of Kuwait but also of his own people. Once again, as he did with the Kurds, he has shown scant regard for the well-being of his own people. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam Hussein has prosecuted a war which has resulted in tens of thousands of casualties on his own side, and it was a war which clearly the people of Iraq did not want or support-that has already been noted today. In fact, so many of them who were thrust into the front line of this battle were caught in the cross-fire between the allies on one side and their own forces on the other. If they attempted to retreat, they were often fired upon by their own forces. Consequently huge numbers-and we do not even know the extent of the final numbers-surrendered, and they were shown to be very pleased to have surrendered to the allied forces. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition victory was remarkable in every respect. In many ways it proved that Winston Churchill was wrong when he once said that war was mainly a catalogue of blunders. There were a few blunders, but very few. We could lament the fact that deaths were caused by friendly fire. That is extremely regrettable, but in any war deaths in that way are almost inevitable. With the enormous intensity of the firepower in the Gulf, it may well be that in a final assessment of the war accidents that resulted in deaths by friendly fire might be judged to be within reasonable limits. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike Churchill, however, Dwight Eisenhower was correct when he said, `Every war is going to astonish you'. This war astonished the world. Saddam's army was ranked as the fourth largest in the world, with almost a million men under arms. The coalition forces were apparently faced with an enormous war machine, consisting of 5,500 tanks, including 1,000 Russian T62s, 500 T72s and 300 modern British tanks, most of which were seized from the Kuwaiti army when the Iraqi army invaded. It also had a considerable air force consisting of two bomber squadrons with Soviet equipment, 17 fighter ground attack squadrons and 16 fighter squadrons, which included 18 MIG29s. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately, as we look back now with the value of short hindsight, we see that this war has proved to be a victory for the vastly superior technology of the allied forces and the motivation of the personnel who knew that they were fighting with right on their side. But if we talk for a moment about the technology, largely developed by the British and the Americans, we notice that they were equipped with a land attack cruise missile, a missile which was stocked with a conventional warhead that could be launched from 1,000 miles away and yet still hit its target within 10 metres. They were equipped with the airborne warning and command system, which is basically a flying air traffic control and radar centre which keeps track of allied planes and warns of any Iraqi missiles or aircraft in the vicinity. </PARA>
<PARA> The allies were shown to have a vastly superior intelligence gathering capability. The allied forces had many advantages over the Iraqis in this particular area. Satellite surveillance played a key role. Through electronic and infra-red photographic intelligence, the allied forces were able to keep fully informed on every move the Iraqi forces made, and of course the Iraqis had no such surveillance. </PARA>
<PARA> The allies were equipped with precision guided weapons-a whole family of guided bombs and missiles which could pinpoint their target with a laser and then land precisely where the laser was pointed. The allies were equipped with the M1A1 Abrams tank. This tank was used in battles with Iraq's elite Republican Guard, which used modern Soviet tanks. The Guard was totally destroyed by the Abrams tanks, and the allied forces sustained almost no losses themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The allies enjoyed complete air superiority. Not one Iraqi aircraft left the ground during the last two weeks of the Gulf war. Allied aircraft, which included the Jaguar, the F18, the F16, the A10 and helicopters such as the Black Hawk, proved absolutely decisive and vastly superior to anything that was pitted against them. In the area of naval power the allied forces had equipment, vessels and fire power which vastly surpassed that of Iraq. The allies had everything from refitted, modernised World War II battleships to modern nuclear equipped air launchers. </PARA>
<PARA> When I spoke in the debate on the Middle East on 22 January, I said that we did not know really where we were heading-we were heading into a great unknown at that time. However, I made the point then, and I make it again in this debate, as other speakers have done, that the world owes a great debt to the United States as a result of the activities of the coalition forces in the Gulf. We should not equivocate in our praise of George Bush as the President of the United States and as a great leader. Nor should we equivocate in our praise of his lieutenants, particularly the United States Secretary of Defense, Richard Cheney, and his generals, particularly Colin Powell and General Norman Schwarzkopf. </PARA>
<PARA> President Bush gave his commanders unfettered powers to conduct the war and, in doing so, ensured there would be no repetition of Vietnam, which in many respects was a catalogue of political and military errors. Vietnam has now finally been put behind us and, in many respects, put to rest. We do not in any way diminish the ultimate sacrifice made there by 50,000 Americans and 500 Australians and many others. However, the Gulf war has most graphically demonstrated what can be achieved by superior weapons, superior motivation and superior training. </PARA>
<PARA> As one of the 28 nations which constituted the coalition in the Gulf war, Australia may be very proud to have done so. Once again we have as a nation demonstrated to the world our commitment to the preservation of peace. It has been said that every generation may need to defend the peace. Ironically, this means being prepared to fight for it. </PARA>
<PARA> We owe a great debt of gratitude to the Australians who served in the Gulf, including army personnel, sailors, divers, doctors and nurses. They deserve a medal and they will receive a medal. Any suggestion that they do not deserve such recognition is rubbish. All who served a full tour of duty in Vietnam received medals, regardless of where they served in Vietnam, and some served in much safer parts of the country than others did. </PARA>
<PARA> Much thought has been given in the debate to where the world goes from here. In many respects it is early days and in the months ahead hopefully we will observe a move towards a lasting peace and a settlement of the many problems that have existed in the Middle East for many years. One aspect of this which has become apparent is that the need for arms control within the world has become all the more urgent. Undoubtedly the supply of arms is a lucrative business. It may be rationalised in some respects by nations wanting to maintain a capacity to produce armaments for their own use, but the economies of scale of production mean in practice that arms become attractive and profitable exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of weapons used by Australian forces are imported. The danger, however, is that arms are sold to countries such as Iraq, which use them irresponsibly. Surely the United Nations, with its new-found status and effectiveness, as demonstrated by its handling of the Gulf crisis, now has a role to play in the rationalisation of the world trade in armaments. It is perhaps trite to observe that weapons are manufactured to kill and that they do kill. </PARA>
<PARA> Hopefully this war has advanced the cause of nuclear disarmament. In many respects this war has, to some extent, made nuclear weapons obsolete. Dare we be so hopeful that this war has been a victory for a new level of technology where strategic targets are concentrated upon and the avoidance of innocent casualties has become a distinct possibility and indeed a desirable outcome for both sides in any war. There has been much speculation about why Saddam chose not to use chemical weapons, given that he obviously had the potential to do so. Perhaps the deterrent was a nuclear response from Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been lessons for Australia in this war. Despite Government assurances to the contrary, we were not well prepared for the challenge presented to us. The Australian Defence Force remains under-equipped and underprepared. It is interesting to note that the United States defence budget in 1989 was 5.6 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP). During the Reagan years defence spending increased by 32.6 per cent between 1982 and 1986. The world ought to be thankful for the contribution that President Reagan made in turning that situation around. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's defence budget in 1990 was only 2.3 per cent of GDP, and that was decreasing from a peak of 3 per cent of GDP in 1986. The 1987 White Paper on Defence at page 99, paragraph 8.5 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Generally speaking, a share of GDP in the order of 2.6-2.9% is needed if future Governments are to achieve the level of defence capability outlined in the 1987 White Paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet when this target is compared with what the Government has done-and I repeat: the goal is 2.6 to 2.9 per cent-we find that in 1990 this Government spent only 2.3 per cent of GDP on defence, and that was coming down from a peak of 3 per cent in 1986. The Government has fallen a long way short of the defence expenditure target it set itself in that White Paper, and in that respect, the Government has failed the Australian people. The Opposition, in contrast, is totally committed to ensuring Australia maintains an adequately equipped and properly prepared Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been talk in the debate about the business opportunities which may arise for Australia during the reconstruction phase in Kuwait and during the peace which will come in the area. No specific mention has been made of the potential gains for the Australian tourism industry. My electorate relies heavily on tourism, and I never fail to take the opportunity to point out to the Parliament the importance that tourism plays within the national economy. During the Gulf war international tourism declined significantly, particularly in respect of the number of visitors from Japan and the United States. It was a period of great uncertainty for the industry. A prolonged war would have had a serious and detrimental effect on the industry. We can now look forward to a new era of peace-not only to promote Australia as the world's safest tourist destination but also to go full steam ahead with the international promotion of Australia as the world's most beautiful tourist destination. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome and endorse the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on this very important matter. I wish to highlight and expand on some of the points which the Prime Minister has made, in particular on the two key issues: firstly, the need for a comprehensive settlement of all the major issues in the Middle East including the future of Iraq, Kuwait, Israel and the Palestinian people; and, secondly, the role of the United Nations (UN) in dealing with these problems and other issues around the world in the light of the development of what has been called the new world order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But before taking up these issues, let me make an important point about the enormous damage which Saddam Hussein has done not only to his own people and to the people of Kuwait and the Kurdish people but also of course to the general cause of peace and security in the Middle East. By his continuing intransigence and refusal to negotiate under the terms set down by the United Nations, he has brought onto the whole region a disaster of enormous proportions. </PARA>
<PARA> In previous speeches on this topic in this Parliament, I have pointed out the illogical and, frankly, crazy refusal of Saddam Hussein to accept proposals put not by the United States but by countries such as the Soviet Union, France and other Arab nations, as well as the UN Secretary-General. On a number of key occasions, Saddam Hussein could have resolved this conflict peacefully by agreeing to these diplomatic efforts which were being feverishly pursued. By his failure to do so, even on the eve of the UN deadline in his meeting with the UN Secretary-General, he left the international community with no alternative but to use force to ensure the liberation of Kuwait. Even when he could see his forces being destroyed in Kuwait and his military infrastructure being shattered in Iraq by the air war, for weeks he continued to hold out against the demands of the United Nations. He arrogantly rejected advice, even from nations which were not involved in the allied effort, that he should move to fulfil the UN resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The crimes which Saddam had committed against the Kurdish people and his own people were well known before the war began. The brutalities committed after the invasion of Kuwait are now being discovered and attested to. These are some of the direct crimes, but he was guilty of much more. Throughout the world-and in most cases falsely-Arab people were identified with him and his actions. Many people around the world unfortunately forgot that some of the key nations fighting Saddam Hussein were themselves Arabic nations. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the main tasks of the world community, including the Australian community, is to restore the standing and reputation of genuine Arab and Islamic culture after the terrible damage done to it by Saddam Hussein and his collaborators. We must show understanding and compassion for the ordeals of the millions of innocent Arabic peoples who have been tarnished by his actions. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads to the consideration of the major question: what of the future of the Middle East? Clearly, in the first instance, there is the immediate future of Iraq and Kuwait. Of course, in normal circumstances, the United Nations does not intervene in the shape and form of governments of various nations. But this is not an ordinary situation. Under the present circumstances, I believe that the most crucial element in ensuring a just peace is for the UN to press for and organise free and democratic elections in both Iraq and Kuwait. Only by ensuring that the will of the peoples of these two nations is fully expressed can the UN ensure the basis of a comprehensive settlement of the various issues of the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Australia ought to display initiative in this matter and, through Dr Peter Wilenski, our Ambassador to the United Nations, we should be pressing for the question of democratic elections to be a major issue in the discussions within the Security Council on the future of the region. In my view, in Iraq, the supervision of an election by the UN is crucial, otherwise Saddam Hussein or one of his collaborators may re-emerge under repressive circumstances as leader. At a free democratic election, in my view, he would be lucky to achieve much more than 10 per cent support of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not wish to proceed with economic sanctions, tougher arms controls or a vigilant military presence but, rather, take advantage of the damage done to Hussein's prestige and have, at our initiative, a United Nations sanctioned free and democratic election conducted in Iraq. While it is understandable that the Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and his family have been reinstalled as leaders of that country, the UN should also insist on, as soon as possible, an act of democratic legitimisation in that country-and this should occur relatively speedily. It should be remembered that Kuwait's 1962 Constitution allows for elections and a parliament. While the Emir has indicated that this may be a possibility, no assurances have been given to this point. The UN should insist on such assurances and a definitive timetable, in my view. I believe that Australia can pursue these goals as part of a constructive contribution to dealing with the problems of the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has mentioned the other major issue in the region, which of course is the question of the future of the Palestinian people within the context of a guaranteed security of Israel. Australia has previously outlined principles for such a settlement of the Middle East issue in regard to Israel and the Palestinian people. Such a settlement cannot be achieved without a settlement of the problems in relation to the West Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government and people of Israel have shown commendable restraint when under attack from Scud missiles launched from Iraq. In showing this restraint, Israel has gained considerable international respect and goodwill. The focus of the United Nations will shift onto Israel and the Palestinian question. The people and Government of Israel can extend this goodwill if they seize the current opportunity and show flexibility and compassion towards the Palestinian people. It may be possible in the ruins of the current war to achieve a breakthrough in terms of Arabic-Israeli relations, as the Prime Minister himself mentioned, whereby we can finally resolve the Palestinian issue. </PARA>
<PARA> If Israel is genuine on this point, then one immediate action-and one which I am sure would be appreciated by the international community-is the immediate lifting of the curfew on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This curfew has been the source of much resentment within the international Arab community, and I believe that the gesture of lifting the curfew would help achieve a situation in which, with goodwill, a solution can be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I call on the Government of Israel to think again about the possibility of a comprehensive Middle East conference, especially one organised through the auspices of the United Nations, because the United Nations has now gained substantially in stature and prestige and its whole orientation has been changed-as the Prime Minister has mentioned and as I have referred to in previous speeches in this Parliament-as a result of the ending of the Cold War. The kinds of fears which Israel might in the past have had about its own security in relation to a comprehensive Middle East conference are no longer as relevant. Indeed, they are not relevant because we now have what has been called the new world order, the new world situation, the new respect for international law which has arisen as a consequence of the way in which this crisis has been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is to be continuing respect for international law, there must be continuing respect for the resolutions of the United Nations. In this context, Israel can play a very positive part. For their part, the Palestinian people need also to ask some questions and re-examine some of their attitudes. In particular, as the Prime Minister has mentioned, the situation is not at all helped by the fact that the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), including Yasser Arafat, has been strongly supportive of Saddam Hussein in this current crisis. Notwithstanding the fact that other Arab nations took a different view-Arab nations that had previously supported the Palestinian people-we had a situation where Arafat and the other leaders of the PLO took a position which was, to say the least, unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA> The question arises as to whether it is time to consider the whole issue of the leadership of the Palestinian people. Perhaps that would provide a way forward. Perhaps there ought to be consideration of some form of expression of the popular will of the Palestinian people, wherever they may be in the Middle East, in terms of what leadership they want and whether they wish to continue with the leadership of Yasser Arafat. If they do not want to continue with that leadership, that may make the possibility of a resolution easier. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, whatever leadership such a popular expression of will may bring about, as the Prime Minister has said, we must confront the question. It is important that that question be confronted by the whole international community under the auspices of the United Nations and within the context of the resolutions of the United Nations. If this is not done, of course, the United Nations will be accused of double standards and hypocrisy. As the Prime Minister said, it is not a question of whether there is a new world order; it is a question of what kind of new world order there will be. In terms of that question, it is important that the United Nations be seen to be independent of any one particular nation, to be acting as a collective and to be capable of solving problems around the world. The most important and urgent problem, besides the question of Kuwait and Iraq, is the problem of what is to be done in relation to Israel and the Palestinian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the United Nations should consider this matter urgently. As I said, Israel should rethink the whole question of a comprehensive international conference in the light of the new world order. Israel has little to fear about the guarantees for its security in this context. Given the changed attitudes, for example, of Syria and given the fact that Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt supported the allies in this situation, circumstances are such that it may be possible to achieve a breakthrough and to achieve a just situation in respect of both Israel and the Palestinian people. I repeat that I believe that one of the first gestures should be the lifting of the curfew. It is an important gesture that would make a lot of sense in the current international climate. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the question of the new world order and the United Nations. Many people have expressed great cynicism about this. Of course, there are two types of people in the world: there are idealists and there are pessimists. The pessimists have said that this new world order will not last, that it will not have any substance to it, that the United Nations will become merely a creature of the United States, and many other such statements. They are entitled to their views. But the answers to the questions I have posed will determine, I believe-and I am an optimist on this matter-that we are on the threshold of a new world order in this situation, that we can deal with the other problems such as the problems of Palestine and Israel. There are other problems confronting the United Nations, such as Cambodia and the UN resolutions on Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA> In this new atmosphere it is possible to be cautiously optimistic. Of course, there will always be the propensity towards war. There will always be individual leaders or dictators in various countries who think that they can break international law and break out of a system of international law. Let us hope that many lessons have been learnt from the current crisis, that this kind of exercise will not occur again and that the world community will move to a new, positive phase as a consequence of the terrible ordeal which has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I believe that we should immediately have peacekeeping forces in place so that the situation in Kuwait can be restored. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed with a large measure of pleasure that I rise to support the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and many other honourable members who have spoken before me this afternoon. I do so because it is a pleasure to see the end of what many would refer to as the six-week war, referring to the operative date of 17 January, or, indeed, the 100 hour war, when General Schwarzkopf moved to enforce United Nations (UN) resolution 678. I rise with a measure of pride in a number of aspects. I have pride in this Parliament-in the bipartisanship that has been shown across the floor of this House and, indeed, in the other place. I have pride in the leadership shown by the Prime Minister and by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in coming to such a bipartisan approach on this critical issue. I think both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition should be congratulated on this bipartisanship because, as I see it, and as many in the community see it, it was a key ingredient in engendering the large measure of community support that resulted. I think we should also be proud of the Australian people. The Australian people showed, very stoically, over the last six months or so a very large measure of support for what this Government and, indeed, other governments, were doing to enforce the UN resolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also agree with what the honourable member for Farrer, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), said earlier in this debate: we find a number of lessons coming out of this conflict, a conflict which was dominated by bold and decisive action in terms of both the military and the political machines. High technology played a very large part in the ultimate success of that operation. There was a minimal amount of political meddling and there was the opportunity for the defence machines to get on and do what they were best equipped to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the honourable member for Farrer, I also ask the question: where is the peace movement and, in many cases, many of the mindless anti-United States supporters who seemed to dominate that movement? I refer the House to something that I said in this place on 22 January during the Gulf debate:</PARA>
<PARA>A number of writers and speakers in recent weeks have, in my view, conveniently forgotten that and have attempted to mobilise mindlessly an anti-United States sentiment, come what may. I refer specifically to an article in the Australian Financial Review on 14 January last by Andrew Mack, the head of the Peace Research Centre at the Australian National University. He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> A US-instigated war would also inflame the pervasive anti-Americanism throughout the region and risk destabilising proWestern regimes such as Egypt and Jordan. </PARA>
<PARA> For Australia to send ships to help enforce the naval blockade of Iraq at the beginning of the crisis made sense both strategically and morally. </PARA>
<PARA> Collaborating with the US in prosecuting a war which, at this time, is quite unnecessary-and therefore immoral-makes no sense at all. </PARA>
<PARA>In a letter I wrote to the Financial Review, which was published two days later, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> Andrew Mack and his Peace Research Centre continue to suffer from myopia when it comes to the Gulf crisis. His latest opinion `Justifying an end only the Hawks desire' once again degenerates into selective Uncle Sam bashing. We are not dealing with, as Andrew suggests, `A precipitate US-instigated war' but with an act of premeditated aggression by one sovereign nation (Iraq) on another (Kuwait) and the total rejection by the international community of such unconscionable conduct. Sanctions are not working as he suggests. The conflict is no more of infidel against believer than it is one of Uncle Sam and the Israel connection; international justice and states' sovereignty are at issue. </PARA>
<PARA>I also have to ask a second question in relation to the Australian people and the pride that we justifiably have in them. Where is Senator Vallentine? On 21 January in this place, she came in and made a mockery of parliamentary procedures. I repeat what on 22 January I put on the public record:</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, many of the publicity hungry demonstrators in this place have taken a similar, misguided, ungrateful tack. No-one should shy away from reasoned criticism, but we should all draw the line when it comes to a total disregard for objective thinking and a blatant rejection of our parliamentary traditions and practices. </PARA>
<PARA> I found the conduct of Senator Vallentine in this place yesterday both unnecessary and unacceptable. She is a member of a privileged few able to speak publicly at this terrible time. Her gratuitous words and actions in this gallery do her and her peace activists a disservice. I would hope that at the very least she will apologise to you and to this House. Anything less will be seen as an indictment of everything she supposedly stands for and of those who support her. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not resile from those comments and I only wish that Senator Vallentine would act accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point in relation to the Australian people, a question again posed by the honourable member for Farrer, is: where are the Australian Democrats? The honourable member for Farrer used a very strong term when he referred to them as political prostitutes. I am not going to comment on the relative merits of that statement other than to say that in yesterday's Toowoomba Chronicle, a local paper in my electorate, I said about the Democrats and their policies:</PARA>
<PARA>Demonstrably, this is no centre-of-the-road party. </PARA>
<PARA> What Australia desperately needs right now is some policy backbone, not the grab bag of snake oil solutions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>One thing is quite clear with the Australia Democrats: while one may not be able to buy their vote, at the very least they can be hired by the half-hour. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that was indeed reflected in what they did and what they had to say in relation to the Gulf conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also be very proud indeed of the Australian Defence Force personnel, whose professionalism is unparalleled. I think all of us in this House-indeed, all across the nation-should be very proud of what they did, whether they were in the ships, logistics teams, medical teams, on exchange service or whatever. I was delighted when the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) clarified at least one point for me when he referred to the award of the Australian Active Service Medal and the Australian Service Medal, differentiating between prior to and after 17 January. I find a slight anomaly in that, particularly in relation to the first two FFGs, Darwin and Adelaide;, nevertheless I accept the logic of what the Minister is saying. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree that we should have pride in the Australian Defence Force leadership-another point made by the Minister and a number of other speakers. In particular, once again I pay tribute to the Chief of the Naval Staff, who retires later this week, Vice-Admiral, soon to be full Admiral, Mike Hudson, whose 44 years of service and dedication to the Royal Australian Navy is unparalleled. </PARA>
<PARA> I also agree with what the Minister had to say about a number of other officers-and not only officers-who worked behind the scenes. I thank him particularly for a comment that he made about my brother, who acted in the capacity of Assistant Chief of Operations. He works in the headquarters of the Australian Defence Force and, like many others, has worked very hard over the last six months or so. I add my personal `Well done', and I know that his family supports me in that. </PARA>
<PARA> One person has not been mentioned by anybody. I suppose it goes without saying, but I shall mention him anyhow: the Chief of the Defence Force himself, General Peter Gration. He has been over the years that he has held the office of Chief of the Defence Force what one might call the quiet achiever. He has managed to keep the Australian Defence Force at its highest level of performance and readiness, and that was shown during this conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I think we should have pride in the supporting elements, whether they be other government departments or anybody else behind the scenes, who ensured the successful resolution of this conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition referred in his statement to the need for a time for honesty. This is where I disagree with the comments of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel on self-reliance. He said that the terms `self-reliance' and `defence in depth' were very deeply ingrained in the White Paper of 1987. I think that self-reliance, and similar concepts drawn from the 1976 and 1987 White Papers, at best could be seen as being at variance with the term's literal meaning-in particular, its central dependence on alliances and regional associations. At worst it is an academic deception, strong on rhetoric but light on substance. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, the Gulf crisis has for many reaffirmed that view and the head in the sand syndrome of undue dependence on warning time as an important dictate of national security strategy. For example, had naval operations in the Gulf been escalated or become protracted, the operational longevity of our force and the paper thin veneer of the Government's self-reliant posture would have become increasingly strained. Similar constraints would have emerged in any Army or Royal Australian Air Force involvement. As I have said before in this place, demonstrably we have a Defence Force that is suffering from resource stretch-in other words, arguably, it is too widely tasked and therefore too thinly spread. </PARA>
<PARA> I wholeheartedly support what this Opposition is attempting to do. Let the Government be in no doubt-defence is back on the political agenda, and back in a strong way via the Opposition's review which the Leader of the Opposition instituted recently. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) when he referred to the 2.3 per cent of gross domestic product spent on defence, which of course is the lowest percentage of GDP-if that is the appropriate measure-for 40 years. Also ingrained in the White Paper is the 2.6 to 3 per cent GDP figure. Whichever way we look at it, this Government has not done well when we compare its actions to what it said in the White Paper it was going to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish by reiterating what the shadow Minister for defence, Senator Durack, had to say in a press release a couple of months ago:</PARA>
<PARA>In the absence of a defence debate sponsored by the Government, the Opposition's review of defence policy will provide a public forum where fundamental matters of national security can be openly discussed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Gulf War is over but the Gulf crisis, as suggested in the parliamentary statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), may be only beginning and will be of long duration. Contrary to the views of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), the issue at stake is not the future of the Australian Democrats but the future stability of the Middle East. The war ended with a striking military victory for the United States and its coalition allies, a victory determined from the outset by overwhelming allied superiority in the air. Winning military battles may prove to have been relatively easy. Establishing the basis of adjustment during peace may prove to be impossible, especially if the war has simply exacerbated long-festering hatreds in the Middle East.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The specific war aims, as set out in 12 resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, simply provided for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, a return to the status quo ante 2 August 1990 and the restoration of the ruling dynasty of Kuwait. The unity of the allies, strange partners though they were, may have established the principle that no nation may use force to invade another nation, and that is valuable in itself. But the war aims were always lacking in vision and idealism. The restoration of the al-Sabah regime in Kuwait will not rank high in the annals of human liberty. Few greedier and more self-serving dynasties have ever operated outside of Dallas. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that since the war there has been a commitment to giving Kuwaiti women the vote-a privilege enjoyed in Iraq, but not in its neighbours. However, Kuwaiti officials have declined to promise that the Parliament, suspended since 1986, will be restored. So a war aim, limited to returning the Emir, Sheikh Jaber, to his throne of gold will do nothing to relieve the chronic problems of the region. We tended to forget that Kuwait has been a major source of funds for the Palestine Liberation Organisation and that it bank-rolled Iraq in the hideous eight-year war against Iran, a war which the West applauded in the days when Saddam Hussein was regarded with favour in the White House. </PARA>
<PARA> Saudi Arabia, the forward base for Operation Desert Storm, was no model for political development in the new world order we are now hearing about. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy with no parliament, no civil rights for women and no religious freedom. United States forces were forbidden by Saudi law to engage in the celebration of Christmas. Women are prohibited from driving cars and from taking part in social and business activities outside the home. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister said, Iraq was ruled by a brutal and dictatorial regime-but so are many of the other states of the area, some of them our allies. Oddly, the Ba'athist regimes in Iraq and Syria have come to terms with the challenge of the twentieth century more than any others in Islam. Women had the vote, as I mentioned earlier, and there was, until Saddam Hussein invoked, uncharacteristically, the jihad or holy war, a formal separation of church and state. It was possible to exercise the Christian religion. A number of Saddam Hussein's ministers were practising Christians. April Glaspie, the last United States Ambassador to Iraq-not one of its most successful-was a woman. One only has to make the point that it would be quite impossible to conceive of the United States having appointed a woman as an ambassador in virtually any other state in the Middle East, except for Israel and possibly Syria. </PARA>
<PARA> When we are talking about the new world order we have to be sure what that new world order is. Is it the new world order Saudi Arabian style, the new world order Kuwaiti style or are there other models to be taken into account? It seems to me that there are at least 10 elements that ought to have been included in a statement of postwar aims in the Middle East. Given the increasing role of the United Nations-the recognition of how important the United Nations was in holding together the allied coalition-now is the time to ask whether the moral authority established by the United Nations will lead to any significant changes in the region. Do we see the war in its operation, as having been purely military, purely economic? What was it all about?</PARA>
<PARA> The following points might have been included in the postwar aims in the Middle East. I hope that the Australian Government will push for them through its diplomatic channels. The first aim has to be coming to grips with the problem of the international arms trade, an extraordinarily despicable operation. In a sense it is a triumph of free market forces and the idea that one ought not to interfere with the capacity of manufacturers to make money any way they like. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed an interesting advertisement, headed `Where East meets West', put out by the East West Engineering Company Ltd. I would think that this is a good example of even-handedness in that it supplies main battle tanks, armoured personnel carriers and command vehicles, self-propelled artillery and anti-aircraft weapons to any nation which will pay, then, on the other hand, it supplies precisely the kind of weapons that will shoot them down. The other day I was talking to a friend who had been to an armaments factory in Brazil a couple of years ago. The Brazilians were extraordinarily even-handed, making tanks for both the Iraqis and the Iranians and doing extraordinarily well out of both. One would have thought that an adroit accountant might have worked out some sort of system where they simply cut their losses. They could say, `We won't produce 100 tanks for the Iraqis and we won't produce another 100 tanks for the Iranians', to even out the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The international arms trade has to be acted on. It is a despicable trade; nobody comes out of it well. I commend to honourable members a book which ought to be read very closely, The Arms Race, by Philip Noel-Baker, former British Labour member of parliament and a Nobel peace prize winner in 1958. In this book he argued for qualitative disarmament, saying that it ought to be possible to buy defensive weapons but not essentially offensive ones. Bombers are essentially offensive weapons and fighter planes essentially defensive ones, although clearly offensive features can be added to them. We need to talk very seriously about the international arms trade and how to stop it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aim virtually never mentioned is what can be done for the Kurds. Their numbers are quite uncertain. Somewhere between 8 million and 10 million Kurds have been treated despicably for generations, even for centuries. It was not an issue that the allies could raise because the Turks, for example, are very sensitive because they have many Kurds within their boundaries. An independent Kurdistan would threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. Naturally if we want the Turks on side-their role was critical in the Middle East war-then we cannot raise the question of the Kurds. The Kurds, like the Armenians, have been professional victims whose numbers have been cut, and have been despicably treated. In the West we have done nothing for them. The question of the Kurds has to be raised as a very important issue in postwar aims in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of Palestine remains a very contentious one, not just in Israel but also in surrounding countries, particularly Jordan. Two-thirds of the population of Amman, the capital of Jordan, are Palestinian rather than Jordanian-that is, Bedouin. The distinction in a sense is rather arbitrary. King Hussein obviously is in an extraordinarily difficult position. If we are to see the creation of a Palestinian state and if the long and bitter conflict between Israel and the Palestinians is to be resolved, then the whole question of Jordan's future has to be examined very seriously. Except for `back to business as usual', I do not see that any issues have been discussed very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth issue concerns Israel-the one democratic state in the Middle East. But even the friends of Israel-among whom my friend the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and I would include ourselves-are all very conscious that increasing external pressure makes Israel act in an increasingly authoritarian way. The very things that make Israel attractive-its liberal tradition and its regard for the highest elements in human culture-are threatened. After a while, being surrounded by enemies and facing dangerous challenges as they have so many times the Israelis feel that they can only respond by being armed to the teeth. On occasion, they are prepared to use violence domestically in a way which we would find unacceptable and which we deplore when employed by our Israeli friends. It is easy for us to carp and try to form judgments here. In the long term the values that Israel stands for can be secured only by some kind of rectification of the boundaries which provides for recognition of the Palestinian cause but which makes Israel's boundaries absolutely secure. It is no use creating that Palestinian state if the Israelis are still subject to the risk of being overrun. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of terrorism has to be dealt with once and for all. Terrorism is one of the most appalling abuses of the human spirit. We have seen recent outbursts of terrorism throughout Europe, Ireland and the Middle East. There seems to be no end to it. We have now reached an agreement through the United Nations, not as significant as the 1945 settlement when World War II came to an end, but it gives an opportunity for us to look at new issues in a new way. But I do not see that we are actually doing that. We have to push for a democratic political system in the region. It is true that democracy has never been very successful in Mohammedan countries. Perhaps the most successful Mohammedan country to carry out the practice of democratic pluralism would be Malaysia. In most of the other countries there have been democratic forms, but, essentially, there has been a one party state of some sort. We also have to encourage, if we can, the development of political and religious pluralism in the area. It will be an extraordinary situation and a horrible outcome if the result of the elimination of Saddam Hussein-somebody who in his own very ruthless way, which I am not attempting to defend, was committed to a more modern view, coming to grips with the problems of the twentieth century-is the revival of Moslem fundamentalism in Iraq. This could perhaps spread into Syria. If we want to have the whole crescent from Egypt to Iran, dominated by Moslem fundamentalism, we may be well on the way. </PARA>
<PARA> As time is running out I want to quote briefly from an excellent article which appeared in the New Yorker on 28 January 1991. It is headed `Islam and the West' and is written by William Pfaff. I will read the last paragraph which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Saddam Hussein can be removed by force from the international scene and his regime overturned if the American people are prepared to pay the price, which could prove a considerable one before this affair is over. International order could, in principle, be served by a demonstration that aggression may be punished, and that the United Nations, now that Soviet obstructionism has ended, is capable of acting on such matters. That this would prove true in practice is a more doubtful proposition, given the chains of unforeseeable consequence any war produces. The proposition that a victory of Iraq will constructively change the relations between the Islamic states and the West ignores the sources and the nature of their differences, which will endure long after Saddam Hussein-and George Bush-have quit the mortal scene. </PARA>
<PARA>We have gone through a period of change which may actually exacerbate the situation. If the United States has generated a legacy of hatred which means that it can never be looked at-or at least cannot be looked at for a generation-as a power for peace in that region, that is a tragedy for the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In opening, I would like to follow on from some of the points mentioned by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) partly because I am concerned that in the euphoria over the result of the Gulf conflict there is a feeling that the United Nations will suddenly be able to resolve the future problems of the world. I share much of the concern that the honourable gentleman has expressed about the difficulties in the progress of democracy in the Middle East, the problems of minority groups in the region and the inevitable difficulty of trying to establish land borders which might be permanent and secured and which might be recognised universally. I make two points about this world order about which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) spoke and about which many honourable members have expressed their views during this debate. The first is that the United Nations would have been powerless but for the intervention of the United States and the second is that the United States' will to participate depends so much on the preparedness of the United States public to give the endorsement to the administration-on whatever side it might be-to allow the commitment of forces.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I accept the honourable gentleman's interjection. What we in this place need to know has several dimensions. The combat in the Middle East was certainly played out differently from that in Vietnam. Although I know that many honourable members on the other side do not accept the parallels, I think many elements of the good intent of the United States and the Western forces in Vietnam were echoed in a different way and in different measure in the response in the Gulf. What concerns me is that the procedures and processes of the United Nations are still so defective. The Americans, certainly, handled the media better. The military command-General Schwarzkopf and all of those in the allied command-I think behaved in an admirable fashion. But, more importantly, I believe the relationship with the media was handled in such a way that deception was possible and the military campaign was fought as a military campaign, instead of being fought before the television cameras and broadcast into the lounge rooms of Middle America and, indeed, Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the United Nations is concerned, there are several lessons we need to remember. For example, were the United Nations to wish to discipline China over Tibet or were it to decide to discipline the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics over Afghanistan, or, indeed, discipline any of those other countries of significance over whatever issue, I doubt whether the United Nations-the Permanent Five who are members of the United Nations Security Council-would be any more effective today than it has been in the past. On other occasions in this place I have referred to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). My concern is not just that there should be some body which applies some sort of a sanction, but that that body should be applicable to all. It worries me that the ICJ seems to me to be so powerless-except in the circumstances where the participating parties are prepared to accept the decision of the ICJ. So, too, I suggest that that is part of the problem with the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the concerns I have with the Prime Minister's statement today is that, while all of us accept much of the rhetoric that it contained, it did not really express for Australia the aspirations of what I- like the honourable member for Lalor-suspect will be a protracted period when peace will not quite be secured but war, one would hope, will not be continued. I think Australia should have a number of aspirations, and I commend the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) for his expression of the different roles of the different countries, as indeed I commend the honourable member for Lalor and others who have participated in this debate. I would have liked to have seen the Prime Minister set down, in his reference to this new world order, some details of how he sees Australia's role. One of my worries about the United Nations-having referred to the Permanent Five-is: what role does a nation like Australia play? Are we always to be participants only because of our external alliances, or will we be able to play some direct participatory role? We all want to try to ensure peace, goodwill, democracy, progress and those other sentiments in which we all believe and which I believe now need to be pursued in the Middle East in a definitive way, and which will be better pursued because of the outcome of the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to see the Prime Minister prescribe a series of objectives for Australia in this coming difficult negotiation. I do not think it is sufficient to just refer to a new world order. I would like to see Australia's role defined not only because of our participation within the United Nations but also in a way in which we can adopt a direct and interventionist role where we set down our objectives in the Middle East and for the political redefinition of power. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, before I finish on the politics of it, I think all of us well remember the euphoric reception of the fall of the Berlin wall. The pendulum has swung from that time to a time when we now see the Soviet Union, if not dismembering, at least heading in that direction. This weekend's final results of the referendum within the Baltic states shows something of the enormous pressures there. It concerns me, as I know it does many honourable members of this place, that President Gorbachev seems increasingly to be subject to the influence of the generals and the hardliners. While we all listen to Boris Yeltsin and recognise the manner of his election, I suspect his power base is not as great as it might be. </PARA>
<PARA> In any future definition of the new structure in the Middle East, we need to remember that not only the United States but also the Soviet Union will have a role. I am most concerned at the situation that exists there and with the degree to which the Soviet Union will continue to open its doors and become a more participatory and, as we would see it in the West, reasonable member of the world scene. We should remember that it will not be possible to achieve a permanent resolution of those boundaries nor the maintenance of peace in the post-Saddam period unless the Soviet Union is a full participant. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned, as are other honourable members, about the rise of Muslim fundamentalism and the future role of Syria. I am as concerned about the way in which a definition could be established for the future of the Lebanon as I am about the future of Israel. I can see in the circumstances that now prevail that there will be great dispute and no certainty unless there is a total preparedness by the Soviet Union and the United States to enjoin in any conferences that might ensue from this point on. </PARA>
<PARA> In the outcome of the campaign, I refer to several aspects relating to the Australian Defence Force. I have heard several of my colleagues refer, with quite appropriate sincerity, to the tremendous contribution of the servicemen both within the joint service command and within the Australian Defence Force and for the role they played. Indeed, I commend the Prime Minister for his preparedness to award the Australian Active Service Medal to those who served after 17 January. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one aspect of that to which no mention was made. I urge the Government to invite the Governor-General to make a presentation of that medal to each of those service men and women who have earned it because of their service in the Gulf. For example, I know that the sailors of HMAS Success are shortly to receive the Gloucester award for being the most effective vessel within the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) over the past year. I would have thought that at that ceremony when the Governor-General is to make the presentation it would have been appropriate for him also to present these medallions to the individual servicemen. It is a tremendous recognition of what they have done and no Australian serviceman values anything more than being conferred with a recognition of his contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> As others have said, of course it is not just the servicemen and those members of the RAN who have made a contribution-the clearance diving team, the 40 medical personnel on the US hospital ship Comfort and those exchange people of the allied forces-but a lot of other people, who will not receive recognition. For example, the diplomats, who have been mentioned in this debate, certainly deserve to be commended. There are also members of the merchant navy who have been sailing in tankers that have been going through the Persian Gulf, past our vessels, to the Saudi port during the course of this action. We should remember that the mines are as likely to strike a merchant vessel as they are any other. </PARA>
<PARA> The second and more fundamental point about the Australian Defence Force is the task we now have to restructure and reassess our strategic basis. Over the course of the years a series of recommendations have been made to governments of either persuasion that there was no imminent threat. I do not pretend that there is an imminent threat, but I suggest that the product of our commitment in the Gulf, and certainly the Prime Minister's assessment of this new world order, as he calls it, is that Australia needs to reappraise the capability of our Defence Force to participate in an international peacekeeping force in whatever role it may be. We have done it on a number of occasions. We have done it very effectively in Namibia. We have done it very successfully in a range of commitments outside this country. For example, we still maintain, as many forget, a police element in Cyprus as part of our United Nations commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> What worries me is that if we participate in that role we cannot accept the assessment of the 1987 White Paper that it will only be an incidental role. I am very concerned that there are rumours regarding the maintenance of the status and level of activity in the Defence Force. For example, I am told that there are threats to the maintenance of the F111 squadrons. I would be horrified if that were to happen or if there was any delay in the installation of their avionics. Secondly, I am told that a number of air force bases might be closing-even, it is reputed, Fairbairn. I hope that the Minister will ensure that those rumours are rebutted, because that is the last thing that we need in the aftermath of the military campaign in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> What we do need, however, is to reassess the capability of the Australian Defence Force. There are three elements. The first, without doubt, is our strategic capacity to launch an offensive where and when necessary and the degree to which we are able to deter an attack upon us. As Admiral Synnot, a former chief of the Defence Force, said on many occasions, the prime role of a defence force is to ensure that a country has a sufficient deterrent capability that it will never need to use that defence force in anger. I commend that sentiment to the Government, for that is another area where I would have liked to have seen the Prime Minister come into this House on this third debate on the Gulf and say to us that we not only play an enhanced role in participation in international affairs but we also need to reassess our defence role and capability. It is essential that we do so. Once this country has worked out its new strategic basis, has determined where and to what degree to provide excess capability beyond that needed to defend Australia in order to participate in that wider international role, then it can take decisions about the allocation of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a critical need for us to look at our strategic basis and our capacity to perform a defence role not just in association with the United States. I felt the role we played in relation to Fiji was seriously circumscribed by inadequacies then within our force. I believe that HMAS Westralia, for example, whose sailors served with such distinction in the Gulf, was a wrong choice. Another ship similar to HMAS Success should have been acquired. I am greatly concerned at the price we paid for HMAS Westralia. I suspect that one lesson to be learnt out of the Gulf war is that we would be better to pay off HMAS Westralia in due course and build a vessel similar to the Success so that we have a two-ocean capability. Above all, we need to be sure that, if war breaks out in the Pacific or another theatre where we cannot depend on having the United States and other allied forces by our side, we have some capacity for self-sufficiency. The Government has made a great deal of its claim for self-sufficiency, but on the ground I suspect that it is not adequate. The first task is to look at our equipment, its strategic suitability to the task and the way in which we need to relate our purchases to the future. In that respect, I have some worries about the five-year defence plan and the equipment we are now purchasing. </PARA>
<PARA> The second task, of course, concerns personnel. It is important that we recognise that once women are admitted to the force there are different pressures and stresses within the force, about which there has been no recognition. That does not mean I am against recruiting women; it means that we have not had a proper analysis of the impact on defence efficiency by having larger numbers of women in the force. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to determine the extent to which we provide an adequate level of remuneration and the general package of service conditions. Of course, in a time of high unemployment, it is not hard to recruit and retain people in a defence force, but we do not want to only operate on that basis. We should ensure that our Defence personnel are treated with the recognition they deserve. They lay their lives on the wire when they are committed by an Australian Government to whatever task they might be given, and we should give them due and proper recognition for that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> The third topic I briefly want to mention is the economic area. I was delighted to hear the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development say this afternoon that after his mission to the United States he will lead a group into the Middle East. I certainly endorse his view that there should be no withdrawal from a requirement that we retain at least the level of trade that we enjoyed in the Gulf states before the Gulf campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been long critical of the inadequacy of our effort with Saudi Arabia over live sheep. We need to realise that farmers in Australia today are in a critical state. Wheat growers are abjectly treated as a result of the fall in world prices, the American export enhancement program and the European Community's common agricultural policy. Wool and its impact is still to affect growers incomes. But it will be cataclysmic for them in the next little while with a minimum reduction of 30 or 40 per cent, and some up to 60 and 70 per cent, in their incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Middle East is a market for Australian agricultural produce. I commend the Government that we do our maximum to not only restore the trade that was there but also develop new markets for the future. I join all honourable members of this House in commending the members of the Australian Defence Force for the outstanding contribution that they made to achieving peace through their efforts in the Middle East. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The defeat of the armed forces of Saddam Hussein, the retreat and withdrawal of his army of occupation from Kuwait, and Iraq's unconditional acceptance of the United Nations (UN) resolutions undoubtedly represent victory for the United Nations and for those 40-odd nations, including Australia, which, under the leadership of the United States, implemented and carried through the UN resolutions. This Parliament, after a lengthy and soul-searching debate, overwhelmingly endorsed Australia's role in the conflict. I join other speakers in adding my personal commendations on the efforts which were made by Australian service people in that conflict.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having won the war, we now have to address our minds to winning the peace. I have always believed that peace is not the negative absence of war, but the positive presence of justice. If we are to win the peace, we must show a commitment as a parliament and as a nation-a commitment and a resolve no less than that which was produced by this Parliament at the very outset of this conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just a question of talking in general terms about a new world order, and having an international conference of major nations which will seek to impose resolutions upon the nations of the Middle East. Any resolutions of the longstanding tensions and problems within that area in the first instance have to be addressed by the individual nation states of the Middle East themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the causes of the continual instability in the Middle East is the perpetuation of autocratic, undemocratic regimes, dictatorial in nature, which are more than capable, as they have shown on many occasions, of brutalising their own people, and which have little regard for the territorial integrity of neighbouring states. The West, including Australia, stood to one side during that brutal and destructive war between Iraq and Iran. The United States and many of the nations of Europe not only did not involve themselves in that conflict, but were only too happy, in terms of their perception of that awful war, to supply the arms and the means by which it could be conducted. There is no point in waxing loudly about the armed capacity of Saddam Hussein. If we are to do that, at least let us say forthrightly and frankly that most of those arms were not produced in Iraq, and that the technical capacity of Saddam Hussein was supplied by many nation states which, instead of looking at the complexities of the Middle East situation, were only too concerned to profit from it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time that we, as a parliament, not only examine the results of this conflict but look at the plight-the cry for justice, which has been mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones)-of the Kurdish people, and I would add to that the plight of the Armenian people, whose tragedy has not really impinged upon the collective conscience of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> In today's press reports there are suggestions that young Palestinians in Kuwait are now being subjected to kidnapping and the denial of human rights in the same way as their Iraqi oppressors applied those standards to Kuwaiti people. We should be saying forthrightly, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), that we did not involve ourselves in this conflict to support the oppression of any minority group, in this case the Palestinians who happen to live in Kuwait. I can understand a people who believe that people living within their community have not acted as they should have. But if we are talking about a new order, the new order should be starting on the streets of Kuwait now. There is a military presence on behalf of the United Nations, and they should have some regard to the commitment of the United Nations to its resolutions on human rights. </PARA>
<PARA> We should, as a nation, be prepared to express our concern where there is that abuse of human rights. The life of a Palestinian is no less worthy than the life of a Kuwaiti or the life of any other citizen. If this be true, then we also have to concern ourselves-we all seem to have forgotten this-that there was once a nation called Lebanon, which was in fact run by the Lebanese people. It has been subject to an army of occupation for far too long. My colleague the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), indicated his legitimate concern for the future of the Palestinian people. I wish to address many of my remarks to that aspect of the current Middle Eastern problem, because in approaching the needs and aspirations of the Palestinians, I am bound to remind my colleagues that the plight of the Palestinians is the result-not the cause-of the refusal by the Arab states to recognise Israel's right to exist. That recognition is a condition precedent to the creation of any lasting resolution or peaceful solution in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> In refusing to recognise the state of Israel, Arab states are also refusing to recognise the very large amount of support that exists within Israel for those Israelis and Palestinians seeking a peaceful solution. The failure to recognise the state of Israel is to say `No' to Palestinian leadership within Israel and in other parts of the world that want a peaceful and negotiated resolution of their problems. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the unfortunate aspects of the recent discussions in the broader Australian community about our decision to participate in the Gulf war was the somewhat simplistic view that, `Well, if you are going to protest about Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait, why have you not protested and taken direct action in respect of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza?' The answer to that is simply this: Israel came to occupy the West Bank and Gaza not as the result of any armed aggression on its part, a determination to acquire those lands by armed force; it came about as a result of Israel's defending itself against yet another attack aimed at destroying Israel and its people. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the 1967 war Israel offered to negotiate peace with the Arab states. This offer was met with the famous three noes-no peace, no negotiations, and no recognition. That position has continued to be maintained, irrespective of any proposal that has emanated from any Israeli government in respect of peace plans. By resolution 242 the United Nations recognised that the occupation of the territories was the result of a war forced upon Israel by hostile neighbouring states, and it legitimised Israel's presence there until the Arab states made peace. Israel still occupies the territories because only one of the 21 states which waged war has agreed to a peace which recognises the right of the state of Israel to exist, and the right of its people to live free and secure within its recognised borders. Do we now expect the state of Israel and its people, who commendably refused to be drawn into the war with Iraq, and who suffered Scud attacks, to just simply sit at a table, at the behest of European nations, and let any Arab state continue to promulgate and financially support the continuation of armed conflict and terrorism against Israel and its people? Fortunately, it would seem from some press reports that at least Syria may be looking at the possibility of recognising the state of Israel. I hope that is so. </PARA>
<PARA> Now is not the time to canvass the range of issues that exist within the Middle East. But the end of the war with Iraq leaves us with old problems and some very new ones. We have to rebuild Kuwait; we have to rebuild Iraq. In my view, in endeavouring to rebuild Kuwait there is no point in not giving legitimate expression to whatever hopes the Kuwaiti people may have for a democratic representative structure in whatever mode they want. But do we really want to do this if it reimposes a feudal and authoritarian regime, the leaders of which, even now as I speak, have not found it safe to go back to Kuwait?</PARA>
<PARA> If there is to be a new world order, the West cannot afford to be too unctuous or overassertive in terms of its moral position. The capacity of Saddam Hussein to wage war and to occupy Kuwait rested very heavily upon nations which were only too happy to provide him with a very updated and modern capacity to wage that war. If there is to be a new world order, there is a need for this Parliament to confront the challenges that lie ahead. Decisions need to be made which are no less serious and in many ways far more complex than the decision taken through the resolution of this Parliament for Australia to participate in the Gulf conflict. For too long, the world has tended to accept human misery, degradation, the destruction of human life and the destruction of human rights as matters to be determined at the whim of autocratic governments. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to hear of our commitment to involve ourselves in trade. I suppose that is part of the new order and I suppose we are entitled to expect some of the Arab states which we have stood by to trade with us. But I hope that in our anxiety to establish trade relations we do not overlook the far more serious political and moral questions involved in seeing that justice comes to the Middle East and its people and that the longstanding hopes and aspirations of many peoples and a number of races are not overlooked. Having won the war, we now have to address ourselves to the problems of winning the peace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to participate in this debate and to support many of the remarks which the previous three speakers have made relating to the situation the world finds itself in at the conclusion of the war phase and with the problems of Kuwait and associated countries, particularly Iraq. We hear a lot about the `new world order'. I have not yet seen that phrase properly defined. The only people I hear talking about the new world order are the new age movement, and I am quite sure that President Bush and others who talk about a new world order are not new-agers in any sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A sense of euphoria has arisen due to the complete victory of the allied forces against the forces of Iraq. But, as other members of this House have said, this is only the end of one phase and the beginning of a much more difficult phase. In my view, there was never any doubt about the outcome of the war. Once the line had been drawn in the sand, once the allied cause had come together, once the arms had been assembled in the Middle East, there was no doubt which side was going to win the subsequent war. That war has been won. </PARA>
<PARA> The technology displayed in the prosecution of the war has been of a nature which has surprised people right around the world who have not before had access to the degree of technical sophistication that has been achieved, particularly by the United States. The prosecution of the war would not have been possible had it not been for the relationship between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The allied response came about only because of the cooperation between the United States and the USSR. Unfortunately, some signs are beginning to emerge that that degree of cooperation may be more difficult to achieve in the future than it has been in the recent past. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have the situation, as other members have mentioned, of dealing with the peace. Too often we have tried to impose Western solutions on what are essentially non-Western nations. We hear a lot of criticism of the individual states and the methods of government of those individual states. From our viewpoint, it is understandable that we should make those criticisms. But Australia is not part of the Middle East. I have a very firm view that the nations of the Middle East will continue to be focuses of unrest if solutions continue to be imposed upon them from outside. </PARA>
<PARA> Any lasting peace in the area can come about only as a result of discussions and decisions made by the nations of the area. There is hope for that and one of the signs that this can happen is exemplified by the Camp David accord, which has been in place for quite a number of years and which has held. This demonstrates that two nations of the area, with the encouragement of the United States, were able to work out an agreement which has brought peace to those nations which hitherto had been at daggers drawn. </PARA>
<PARA> As other speakers have mentioned, we do have enormous problems within the other states of the Middle East. The war has changed forever the situation which will obtain in this area. Obviously, Iraq and Kuwait are the two nations where the immediacy of that change will be most apparent. I have no doubt that the ruling party and family in Kuwait will be facing problems to an extent that they did not face before and that there will be a major call for a democratisation of the Government of Kuwait. I think that will occur in Iraq as well. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that concerns me about the immediate future of Iraq is that advantage could be taken of the unrest by neighbouring countries, particularly Iran, to foment a situation which would be in Iran's long term interests but which may not be in the long term interests of stability within the Middle East. We have to remember that there are very serious divisions, particularly within the Muslim world. The fundamentalists and those adhering to the fundamentalist cause have laid down a very real challenge to those whom they consider their opponents within the Muslim world. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems of the Kurds have been mentioned by other speakers during the debate. If there is one minority which has had a most dreadful situation forced upon it over a number of years, it is the Kurdish people. They are not the only ones within the Middle East; previous speakers have mentioned other situations, particularly in the Lebanon, and of course we must not forget the Palestinians. </PARA>
<PARA> When one mentions the Palestinian people and the proposition that Israel must respond to the calls for a Palestinian settlement, then, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) mentioned, the response of Israel to continuing attacks ever since its establishment as a nation and its forbearance in the most recent situation makes one realise that that settlement is not going to be an easy one, nor quickly achieved. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the evening break I was speaking about the difficulties of dealing with the situation now that the war in the Middle East and the Gulf has come to an end, but I would like to move on from that to speak about the contribution of the Australian forces during the time leading up to the war and during the war itself. Other members have spoken about the way in which Australian forces comported themselves during this time. They brought, as we would have expected, very great credit to themselves and to the great history and tradition of the Australian armed services. I am particularly pleased that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has decided to recognise them in the way that he has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) mentioned in his speech earlier this afternoon, the problems which came to the surface in relation to Australia's contribution to the effort by the allied forces require very detailed examination. I think we can learn a great deal from them. As others have mentioned, we really do need to reassess the basis of Australia's strategic thinking because there is no doubt that the present situation leaves a very great deal to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another aspect of the situation in the Gulf at the moment which causes me very great concern; that is, the environmental damage and degradation which has taken place and which continues to take place at the present time. I think that Australia and Australians have expertise in a number of areas which could be of very great assistance in dealing with the environmental problems that confront the Gulf area. I would hope that the Government takes every opportunity to mobilise the forces which could be of use in dealing with those environmental situations, which are having a very far-reaching effect and which will continue to have that effect not only in the short to medium term but also, if one can believe the reports, well into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that there is expertise in Australia which would be of significant assistance in dealing with these problems, and I believe that the Government should make every effort not only to mobilise those resources but also to bring those resources to the attention of the international community and to assist in organising an international response to what is a major environmental disaster area. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt, in my mind anyhow, that the aggression exhibited by Saddam Hussein, not just in the recent situation but in fact ever since he became the leader of Iraq, has cost many lives. We know of course of the Iraq-Iran war and of the hundreds of thousands of lives that that cost, which after its finish was followed very shortly by his excursion into Kuwait. We do not know the loss of life at this stage which that excursion brought about, but again it must run to very considerable numbers indeed. Not only that, but as I have mentioned, he has disrupted the environmental situation in a very sensitive part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam Hussein has an extraordinary amount to answer for. If one can believe the reports that have come out of Kuwait as to the actions of Iraqi soldiers and military personnel in that state during their occupation, it is horrifying in the extreme. There is no doubt in my mind that the people who have perpetrated a number of those atrocities should be bought to justice as soon as it is possible to do so. But the essential responsibility lies with Saddam Hussein himself. What is to become of him is very problematical at this stage. Whether he will be dealt with by his own people and what result will occur as a consequence of his leadership of the Iraqi people is something about which we can only speculate. </PARA>
<PARA> But the practical results of Iraq's invasion and short-lived annexation of Kuwait will be with us from now into the foreseeable future. The situation in the Middle East will not be the same. No country in that area has been untouched by the events that have occurred since August of last year. Politically, socially and environmentally the area will never be the same again. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has played its proper role in the solution of the problems so far. My view is that we now are facing even greater difficulties as we endeavour to deal with the peace. Again Australia, in my view, can play a responsible part in the necessary meetings and actions that need to be taken in the future. But essentially I would like to see Australia and the Australian Government exploring very rapidly the role that Australian companies and Australian expertise can play in dealing with the massive environmental problems that have occurred following the rape of Kuwait and the quite irresponsible actions of the Iraqi forces during their annexation of and just before their fleeing that state prior to the victory of the allied forces. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a most important era in world history. As I have said, the situation in the Gulf and in the Middle East will not be the same again. Australia has played its role. I would like to add my congratulations to those men and women who served in the area and risked their lives in so doing. I congratulate them on their performance. But in looking to the future I hope that the Government not only recognises the opportunities that are there for us to play a meaningful role, but also does something tangible about mobilising Australian expertise and Australian companies in contributing to the solution of those problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also draw to the attention of the House the question that was raised by the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin). On 19 February he informed the House of matters involving Mr J. McLennan, a person who had made a submission to the Committee. The honourable member raised the legal question of orders being sought in the New South Wales Supreme Court, and the House has been informed of developments of this aspect. The honourable member also raised the question of the possible intimidation of Mr McLennan by the actions taken on 17 February and asked me to consider whether a question of contempt arose. I have now had the opportunity to consider this aspect more thoroughly than was possible after it was mentioned in the House on 19 February.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the House knows, I take the issue of protection of witnesses very seriously, and as well as recognising the importance of the protection of witnesses for all committee inquiries, in this particular case I am cognisant of the position in which Mr McLennan finds himself. On the information that has been provided, however, I have been unable to see anything other than the coincidence of timing, if that is what it is, which would support the view that a contempt may have been committed. Although my opinion is that a prima facie case such as would cause me to accord precedence to a motion on this matter has not been made out at present, I have informed the Committee that I would wish to be advised if any additional material evidence comes to light, and if it does I would be pleased to give it immediate consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr McLennan and any other witness involved with a parliamentary committee inquiry should be able to be confident that they will be protected by the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the past, prior to the changes in the Privileges Act, one would have proceeded on matters such as this under an area of privilege. After the changes to the Privileges Act, some of the protection afforded under that Act was removed. It was then up to a person to pursue it as a matter of order. My recollection is that that has not been done all that often, but maybe now that we have changed the Privileges Act, that might be a more appropriate method of doing it. Maybe to clarify this whole area these matters should be referred to the Procedure Committee, which can bring forward some definitive suggestions for consideration by the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point that I raised tonight is that, without the protection of the Privileges Act, the appropriate way to pursue these matters now would be by order. It is difficult to deal with matters of order that do not occur in the House. It is easier to deal with matters of order as they occur in the House because we are all here and participating in the process. We might take ourselves down a difficult track if we start applying issues of order to matters where we are going to get second- or third-hand responses from people. The best mechanism is if we all talk favourably of each other so that these things will not occur. </PARA>

That recourse was no longer there. It then became a possibility for people to pursue them as a matter of order, but of course in the particular circumstances that may occur it would be in many instances very difficult to pursue matters that none of us, either of us or all of us may have been involved with that occurred outside the chamber. That makes it a difficult process to deal with. As I said earlier, I think it is better if we do not have to deal with the process but, after the changes to the Privileges Act, as I outlined then and I did to the honourable member for Hume today, that recourse was no longer available-and I think the Privileges Act was changed in 1987.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a matter of greater importance, I would think, than the matter that honourable members of the Opposition have undertaken to discuss tonight-and that is of course to support the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the Parliament this afternoon on the Gulf crisis. I rise to support the Prime Minister's statement with a feeling of relief and of sadness-of relief that the hostilities in the Gulf have ended and of sadness at the tragic loss of life and the atrocities that have gone on in that conflict.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also acknowledge very much the bipartisan approach that has been taken by honourable members across the board throughout our involvement since August last year to this very tragic experience for the world. I think it is very important that when these sorts of tragedies face us we all come together and work in a very unified fashion, as has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> From speaking to colleagues from both sides of the Parliament on this issue from time to time, I do not really think that any of us entered into this debate with any sort of gung ho ideas. I think many of us were very concerned about the situation, as was reflected in the speeches that were made by honourable members of this House both on 4 December 1990 and, of course, particularly on 21 January 1991, when we really did see a mammoth debate in which so many honourable members of this place participated. I understand that some 112 or 113 members out of 148 of us in this chamber actually took the opportunity to speak on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I think that the termination of hostilities in the Gulf at the end of last week did bring good news for Australia and, indeed, the world. It was a very difficult decision initially to commit Australian ships and Defence personnel to participation in the Gulf. That decision was not taken lightly by any of us here in this place. I thank all the people in my own electorate who expressed support for the decision we had to make on that occasion. I felt it was a very difficult decision to make to commit our troops to a conflict where we could have seen loss of life- and we have seen loss of life-on both sides of the conflict; there are no real winners in war. </PARA>
<PARA> I sincerely thank those people in my electorate who expressed their support to me; it was a very difficult time for us all. There were the critics out there, too, even though they were in the minority. They were entitled to their views and I respect those views. I have heard some criticism here today of members of the peace movement. I do not criticise them; I simply ask them to think more strongly about what the conflict was all about and what we had to embark on to stop an aggressor. I think that is important, and I think those people need to really consider those aspects, because I know that many honourable members in this place were very concerned about the issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure our leaders, both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), had many sleepless nights in their concern for the atrocities that the war could have brought. Fortunately, from our side, things have been resolved reasonably peacefully. But for the Iraqis, of course, there has been a tremendous loss of life. That is something we all should consider with much sadness because, no matter what happens in a war, we always have difficulty in dealing with loss of life. </PARA>
<PARA> When I had the great opportunity to visit Gallipoli last year with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and other members of this place, it certainly highlighted for me-and it is something I will never forget-the great tragedies of war. We saw so many gravestones throughout that area. Of course, that is not the only conflict in which we and the rest of the world have been involved. They are issues that we always need to consider. As I said before, I do not see how there can be any winners in a war. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gulf war ceasefire certainly brings to an end a battle which most people had hoped would not be necessary in the first place, but through the actions of Saddam Hussein it was inevitable. That was why I, at the time, was prepared to support the resolution put before us. His determination to take on the world by refusing to accept the decision of the United Nations has now cost his nation and his people dearly. I was certainly saddened by that. </PARA>
<PARA> Although any loss of life is disturbing, it was good to see that the coalition casualties were fewer than 500 all told from combat causes, with no Australian loss of life due to combat activities. The Iraqi casualties are unknown at this point, but are very heavy. Tens of thousands apparently deserted and tens of thousands more have been taken prisoner. Since the ceasefire it is good to see that we are beginning to reconcile those difficulties with the exchange of prisoners of war. I hope, for the sake of the families of those prisoners of war, that all of the prisoners of war are released as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad and unnecessary loss of life has the promise of providing a lasting peace in the world through an enhanced role and respect for the United Nations. It has proven to be the mother of all defeats for Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi forces. But let us hope that the people of Iraq can pick up the pieces and get their country back together again with the help of the international community, which, of course, must happen in Kuwait as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Kuwait has been liberated. The bulk of the elite Iraqi Republican Guard has been destroyed, as has Iraq's navy and much of its air force. Although Kuwait City is free, there are disturbing reports of Iraqi atrocities and of the kidnapping by Iraqi forces of thousands of young male Kuwaitis. As I said before, I hope those people can be returned to their homeland as soon as possible. I congratulate the coalition forces on the ceasefire that they have initiated, which will hopefully bring about such a return speedily. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition victory-and I always wonder what victories there are in war-has been crushing in its extent. The Iraqis' military power has been curtailed for years to come. It brings us to the issue of the sale of military arms. The world needs to look seriously at how it trades in arms-and this matter has been highlighted here again today. To trade in arms only brings conflicts that are unnecessary. The world can do without trading in such commodities. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout this conflict the United Nations has been an active participant in the resolution of the Gulf crisis. Its prestige and the importance of its role in world affairs have been greatly enhanced as a result of this. I hope that the role of the United Nations will be seen as being strongly enhanced by its participation. It has shown that it has the determination, through its member states, and the capacity to deter and, if necessary, repel an aggressor. Of course, that is what this particular conflict was all about. </PARA>
<PARA> We talk about the new order. Perhaps that is not the correct term to use. Some people in my electorate have misconstrued that particular term. It has almost been seen as meaning a new world superpower. I do not think that is the meaning of it at all. I believe the meaning of a `new world order' is more that of a new responsibility for the member states of the United Nations and, particularly, an enhanced role for the United Nations in maintaining world peace. It is important that we see behind this so that never again shall we see an aggressor take over a smaller country, or any country for that matter, and try to dominate it. Every nation on this earth has the right to its own determination. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that this conflict has ceased, the real work in bringing peace-a lasting peace-to all parts of the world, particularly to the Middle East, will start. The issues in the Middle East have been mentioned today by other members of the House and they need to be addressed. I refer to Israel, the Palestinians, Lebanon and the Kurds. They need to be assisted in their right to their own determination. </PARA>
<PARA> We have an important time ahead for world peace because it is only with world peace that we achieve our ambitions and goals in life. If we try to work together, the human race will only be better for it. Australia has played a very important role. Although we are only a very small nation, we have always been prepared to stand up and be counted as a nation. It is important that we have concern for our neighbours. We are a proud nation. I am sure that all members of this place and all other Australians are very proud of those members of the Australian defence forces who had to face going into that conflict without knowing what the consequences would be. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a very sad time and a time of concern for families. A lady in my electorate who has been in contact with me has a son on HMAS Brisbane. She is over the moon that the conflict has come to an end and that he will be home soon. I say to all of those members of the defence forces-and I am sure that their families throughout Australia express the same view-that Australians are proud that our people have been able to participate. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt the United Nations' role in the Middle East will be enhanced because there will be a need for peacekeeping forces in other parts of the world from time to time. We will no doubt play our part, as we always have, in places like Namibia, Cyprus and various other parts of the world. We as a nation will stand proudly and be counted when it is necessary to play our part in the international arena. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I put on record my appreciation to all Australians who have played a part in standing up for Australia, in being seen as being there and in doing their bit. That is what we are all about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I spoke in the earlier debate on the Gulf war, when the Parliament was called back, quite properly, to discuss the whole subject, I commented that it was absolutely wrong and stupid for people to think that any member of this House was a warmonger. I made comment then that most of us had a conscience which had to be overcome to support the war. I am very pleased to say that in this debate I support very strongly the remarks today of both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and my own leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I was particularly taken by two passages from the Prime Minister's speech. First of all, I agreed with him when, in both debates, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I have said throughout this crisis that we have no quarrel with the people of Iraq . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That stands. For those of us who have visited the Middle East countries, and particularly Iraq, as has been my experience, it should be noted that the criticism laid against Iraq related to the manifestations of power by the person who is still its President, Saddam Hussein, and not against the ordinary people who walk around the streets and who have been massacred in huge numbers by the actions of their own leader. The second part of the Prime Minister's speech that took my fancy was where he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there was no other way to reverse the aggression of Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to military involvement. This is something which has been endorsed by a lot of people. For example, most members who attended the parliamentary service at St Andrew's Church a few weeks ago, at the start of the session, will remember the heir apparent to the throne of Canterbury Cathedral, the Archbishop of Canterbury elect, when he said it was his strong belief that peace at any price was a very wrong philosophy and was morally unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat what I said two weeks ago: none of us came into this House wanting war, demanding war or expecting and thinking that war was the only solution. Yet I suppose there is no Australian-I know of no Australian-who is not delighted with the fact that the land war was over in an unbelievable 100 hours. Evil has not won the day. I am pleased to say that in military terms the casualty list among the coalition members was low. But on an occasion like this one's thoughts still go to the families of service men and women and especially to the families and friends of those who paid the supreme sacrifice. </PARA>
<PARA> It is equally stupid of us in this time of euphoria to think that we are living in a gentle, kind, noble world. One merely has to mention Libya, Central America, the Baltic countries, and Romania particularly, to realise that there is still tremendous oppression in political terms around this world. I hope that as a result of this war we do not fall into some stupid situation where we think no military action will ever happen again. I believe tough attitudes have to be taken in seeing that people in the Baltic, for example, are not kept oppressed as they have been for the last 40 years. I am not suggesting that we do what happened in Kuwait. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3G4">Mr DOBIE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought the honourable member for Kalgoorlie might be. The allied countries have to bear in mind that they have to take into account those parts of the world which are still suffering political oppression, if not being devastated to the extent that Kuwait was. I hope that the honourable member who interjected will admit and acknowledge that there are places like this around the world. He stays silent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Getting back to the people of Iraq, I have the advantage of having been, both officially and privately, to Iraq and most of the Gulf countries. We are hearing a lot about the new order, or the new world order. No doubt there will have to be substantial changes in political systems and political attitudes in many parts of the world. I listened to the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) with great interest, and I hope most people in the House have done so. I found his speech stimulating and one that should be given much more consideration in Parliament than speeches in this sort of debate normally get.</PARA>
<PARA> But when I hear about the new order-some refer to the new world order and some stay with the simple idea that things will change-I remember that there is one old order that Gulf countries, including the sheikhdoms, the emirates and the kingdoms, will not change. These countries are the original merchant traders. Whatever changes may take place, I think that they will always be traders. This is very apposite to the debate in Australia about how the Gulf countries will react to Australia. When I went through the Gulf on one occasion, the Australians had just agreed to put troops into the Sinai Desert as a peacekeeping force. Great concern was expressed in this House and elsewhere that, because of our involvement with Israel and Egypt, we would lose trade all over the Middle East. This was not proved to be the case. When I spoke to senior people in all these countries, they said their attraction to Australia as the major food supplier for the Gulf-and a lot of people have forgotten that-was because the Australian people with whom they negotiated were straight, kept their word and were honest. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my very firm belief that this will happen again. The fact that we went with our ships into the Gulf will cause certain reaction, but I believe very firmly that the countries of the Middle East will continue to trade with Australia in grains, meat and other commodities, as they have done for a very long time. I am quite hopeful-in fact, I am very hopeful-that things will go well for us, and not because of our serving in the Gulf but because of our reputation as a fair and honest country trading with that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Another interesting fact which has not been mentioned in either debate is that Egypt and Iraq are the only two of the 28 Arab countries in the world that are truly liberated sexually. Iraqi women head departments-and not just through politics; they have worked their way up. They have had full education rights for about three generations. Within Iraq there is a great potential in people which, if we can get rid of Saddam Hussein in whatever way, will come to the fore again and make Iraq a decent trading country. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that Saddam Hussein has caused hundreds of thousands of Iraq's young men and schoolboys to go to war and be slaughtered as martyrs is not overlooked by a lot of Iraqi citizens. I have several Iraqi friends in Australia who have reached pre-eminence within their activities. The same sorts of people in Iraq will bring that country back to a world involvement under the proper terms. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not my intention to repeat what has already been said by the speakers in this debate and will, no doubt, be said again later. I just want to say that I do not think we should be regarding the Iraqis altogether as evil and as wrongdoers. By the same token, they have a great debt to pay to the world and they must be made to pay for it. I hope that we will not trade there again on the basis that we were in the war. I hope we will go there again as we have always done, saying that we are fair and honest traders ourselves and we want to trade with them. </PARA>
<PARA> In my first speech I mentioned certain horrendous situations that had developed in Iraq and I do not resile from those comments at all. However, I see that they will want to trade with us in the usual way in the near future and I hope we will go there and continue that. </PARA>
<PARA> My thoughts also go out tonight to the families and friends of more than one million Iraqis who have been killed as martyrs in the wars that have been waged by Saddam Hussein for many years now-first with Iran and now with Kuwait. I just hope that the good people of Iraq are able to win the day and once more take that country back to reality as a member of the international community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think I can recall in this House any instances which have brought forth such a plethora of pious platitudes uttered in stained glass attitudes. The war has been most unfortunate. I do not resile from my belief in the need to fight the war and anyone who reads my earlier speech will see that. In the speech I made when the war commenced I alluded to the need to ensure that we won the victory. We have won the war magnificently-in great style one might say. However, we are in really grave danger of losing the peace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think it is inconceivable that we could see Iraq splintered and attacked on all sides by its neighbours. I do not think this is in the long term interests of stability in the world or of Iraq. Already we have seen the fundamentalists in Iran moving to support the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. This is their short term agenda; the long term agenda of Iran is to Lebanise southern Iraq. I see that as a great danger. I also see an area of ongoing instability in Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> The Kurds have been abused over centuries. I think now is a time when the world should look at doing something about a Kurdish homeland, because this too would lead to stability. The world would have to be in a position to take a fairly strong line with Turkey. While in recent times the Turks have taken a more enlightened attitude to the Kurds, one cannot help but take the view that this is for some short term political gain; once in control they will revert to the persecutions that they have practised in the past. It seems to me that a Kurdish homeland is the only answer. I think we can also expect to see Syria making some inroads into Iraq, particularly making grabs for oil rich areas. The whole thing is fraught with potential instability. </PARA>
<PARA> I said in my earlier speech that there would be problems with victory, but that in my view those problems would be less than those we had at the time. Given the way events are shaping up, I am now not sure that that will be true. I think it is inconceivable that the Americans will have the will to stay in the area and fight internecine warfare or fundamentalist people from Iran and Iraq. It is a situation which should be totally untenable for the Americans or, indeed, for any of the allies. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me a great pity that a little more planning was not given to the victory. One might say that it was because victory was so unexpected. I do believe, with the benefit of hindsight-I realise that is something the Americans did not have at the time-that it would have been a good idea if we could have occupied Kuwait very quickly with Egyptian forces, to restore order to the streets in those crucial first 48 hours and facilitate the immediate return of the Emir. It is now a much more difficult situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at our own position. The Middle East is very important to Australia. It is a very large trading partner and Iraq was a particularly good customer. It paid top prices for our products. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) said, it was a very good trading partner. I believe that position could be restored because Iraq will be seeking the best value for money and Australia supplies that. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we have in Australia in terms of a real understanding of the Middle East? I would suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there is very little. I recall that at the Australian Labor Party conference in 1982 a motion was passed to set up a centre for Middle East studies. It was widely applauded at the time, but nothing has happened. Middle East studies is a subject that is taught in about 12 institutions around Australia. In the past decade about 8,000 lousy dollars has been put into this area-just $8,000. There has been virtually no government funding of an area which is of vital importance to us.</PARA>
<PARA> Up until 1985 the Australian National Library used to receive all the Arab language literature from the United States Library of Congress based in Cairo. Because it was purchased in soft currency, that was supplied to Australia on a very discounted basis. In 1985 the Australian National Library discontinued its subscription because it said it could not afford to catalogue the literature. That is almost laughable when we think about it. Here we are, doing a lot of trade with the Middle East, and we have a clear need to know what is going on in the Middle East-and our own National Library stops subscribing because it does not have the capacity to catalogue the material. The truth was that the material came to the Library already catalogued, albeit with the United States Congress catalogue numbers, but I am absolutely sure those numbers could have been incorporated into the Australian National Library without any problems whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> One has to question whether there is any genuine long term concern for events in the Middle East. On the face of it, I would suggest that there is not. This is something that Australia is going to have to ask itself. We have an obligation to ourselves to know what is going on in these countries that surround us. We have an obligation to know what the thinking is of the people in the countries with which we trade. Clearly, if we are informed in this area it puts us in a much better position. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to see a situation in which we put down Saddam Hussein-a man who was responsible for inflicting enormous atrocities on his people and on the people of Kuwait-only to see him replaced with a regime such as that which existed in Iran, which demonstrated its capacity to inflict those same atrocities on its people. There is nothing to choose between them in terms of abuse of human rights, and we should not forget that. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe Iran has a very large part to play in bringing stability to that whole area, but to play that part Iran itself must be a stable country. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to this Parliament that Iran today is not that. Iran is a country which still supports terrorism; Iran is a country which still supports the schisms and the enormous devastation that has occurred in Lebanon. We have to be aware of these problems. It is no good sweeping them under the table. In fighting this war we should have been prepared to look at the future of the whole region. We cannot ignore the plight of the Palestinians. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Palestinians were very unwise to throw their lot in with Saddam Hussein, but one can understand the desperation of these people who have been driven from pillar to post out of their own homes and who see no future and no help anywhere. It was very easy for them to attach themselves to a man like Saddam Hussein, who appeared to be a winner; a man who appeared to be prepared to fight a fight for what the Palestinians clearly see as a just cause. Of course, one of the ironies is that Saddam Hussein never cared about the Palestinians at all; it just suited his purpose to add them to his reasons for committing the crimes that he did. I believe that Saddam Hussein was about crude power and I am sure that, like people who live by the sword, he will eventually die by the sword. </PARA>
<PARA> We are in a situation where we have to make decisions. If the Americans were simply to pull out now it is possible that Hussein, with the remnants of his army, can maintain power and control in the major proportion of Iraq. I think it will be much harder for him to do that in the south and we have already seen laid down there the groundwork for that Lebanisation. I think it would be a great pity if we allowed that to occur, and if this is allowed to occur in southern Iraq there can be no long term stability for Kuwait. I urge the Emir of Kuwait to move towards democracy in that country and to involve all of his people in the process of government. There are something like 300 Palestinians in Kuwait, many of whom were born there and have been there for generations. I believe they have a genuine right to be heard in the government of that country and I believe they have the capacity, because of their generally better levels of education, to bring some stability to that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly think Kuwait, as a democracy, will be much easier for Western countries to defend in the future, for it may well be that we will have to go to Kuwait's aid again if this peace is not established properly and if we do not have a just peace. There is no justice for the people of Iraq or the people of Kuwait if we allow Iraq to be torn apart by its enemies in the various schisms in order to control areas in the name of the excesses of fundamentalist Islam, as has clearly occurred in Iran. </PARA>
<PARA> One has a sense of `How can all this be?'. I think the power of self-deception is important in this matter because we were led to believe in the prowess of the Iraqi army. When one looks at the record, one wonders why. Here was the Iraqi army, armed with some of the latest military equipment, but it was virtually fought to a standstill by an Iranian army which is largely a rag-tag collection. The revolutionary guards of Iran were thrown like a human wave at the weapons of the Iraqis and they were destroyed in great numbers, but they were certainly able to contain the Iraqi advances. It is interesting to note that in the first 12 hours of the campaign the allies advanced further into Iraq than either side had been able to advance in all the years of the Iran-Iraq war. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also quite clear that Iraq had never, at any stage, had an answer to air power. It did not have to confront it in the war with Iran. But no matter how good one's tanks are, in today's battlefield they cannot operate unless they have air cover. And of course Iraq had none. So it is not surprising that the battle lasted 100 hours. I do not think this is in any way a condemnation of the courage or the ability of the individual Iraqi soldiers; I think it was a situation where they had no hope. Had I been an Iraqi, I would certainly have looked for the very first opportunity to surrender. It would certainly have been the option that looked the best to me and it would have given me the chance perhaps to do something about restoring some order to my country at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA> This outcome is not something in which we can rejoice, but having made the effort and spent the millions of dollars and having lost the lives we did-in this case I think the lives of Iraqis are important-it is incumbent upon us to make sure that we do get a just and honourable peace, for without a just and honourable peace I fear that our great technical effort and the sacrifices we have made will all have been in vain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard three speeches tonight-firstly, the speech of the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) followed by the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) and now the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). If I did not have the impression beforehand, I certainly have the impression now that they do not have hearts of stone, as I may have thought perhaps in one case, but rather hearts of flesh. We have heard three compassionate speeches, and I think that has certainly been the hallmark of the majority of speeches we have heard today, as honourable members have spoken in support of the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) concerning the outcome of the terrible Gulf crisis which has been of grave concern to all of us over the past few months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are all very grateful in this House and as a nation, and I am sure that the world is grateful-indeed, the Iraqi people are grateful, as we have seen depicted so many times on the television-that this dreadful conflict has come to an end; a conflict which always had the tremendous danger of escalation with the provocation by the Iraqis of the Israeli people. Iraq fired in excess of 35 or 40 Scud missiles in Israel's direction, killing some of the Israeli people and injuring many hundreds of them. I would like to compliment the patience shown by the Israeli people and their leaders in not becoming involved in this conflict. Had there been a different turn of events, the story of the end of the war may not have been the same as the one we are thankful to relate today. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am making commendations, I also want to commend the United States for the tremendous leadership role that it took. The United States is a country which, over the years, could hardly ever be accused of having had territorial ambitions of any kind throughout the world-particularly in the last 100 years or more. It has always been a particularly generous country in being ready to defend the weak. It has not always been perfect in that regard but in many instances it has been ready to defend the weak and take up the cause of justice on behalf of those who have been severely offended. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be very grateful for the fact that President Bush was so controlled and careful and for the way in which his advisers-James Baker, Dick Cheney and others, and particularly General Schwarzkopf-conducted this war. I am not suggesting for a moment that it has been perfect-mistakes have been made-but by and large we have a great deal to be thankful for. I think we can say without any fear of contradiction that the prayers of many people throughout this Parliament, and indeed throughout this land and throughout the world, have been answered in a speedy way over these past months as we have seen this war finally come to an end. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend all those Christian and religious leaders in this country and in other countries who took up the call to engage in days of prayer and so on. I believe that we need to be very practical. Faith without words is dead; it is all right to pray but the powder has to be kept dry. Nevertheless, there has been this general call to prayer. I do not think I have ever heard so many speeches in this House-and we have had well over 100-that included requests to pray that this war would not escalate. I believe that the ingredients of a just war, as I spelt out to the House in December when an opportunity was given to comment on this matter, have been fulfilled almost to the letter. I quote some of the comments that I made in December with regard to the seven conditions for a just war:</PARA>
<PARA>It has been stated in various forms, although usually seven conditions with regard to a just war have been specified, namely: formal declaration-</PARA>
<PARA>and we indeed saw that in resolution 678 of the United Nations which spelt out very clearly what was required of the Iraqi leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a matter of last resort. Many people are very critical that we did not leave the sanctions in place long enough. But what people are forgetting is that Saddam Hussein-and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie pointed this out-did not really have much interest in the Palestinian question or Islam; he was only interested in his own personal ambitions to become the leader of that whole area. Indeed, Saddam Hussein shows all the qualities of a psychopath. A psychopath is a person who manipulates the system, who can lie, who has no conscience, who can betray at the drop of a hat without any feelings of remorse whatsoever. I do not believe-and many others were guided along the same lines-that if the sanctions had been in place for 10 years we would have seen any softening on the part of Saddam Hussein in this regard. It certainly was a matter of last resort and there was no point in waiting any longer before Operation Desert Storm was commenced. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a just cause, as we know. A powerful nation suddenly invaded a smaller, less powerful nation: it was a most just cause. The President of the United States and, indeed, the Security Council made their intentions very clear, and that was to evict the Iraqi army from Kuwait. That is indeed what they have done and are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> It needed to be proportionate, which means non-combat immunity and a reasonable expectation of the outcome. In other words, the targeting of areas within Iraq and Kuwait was to be military and, as far as possible, although it could not always be guaranteed, the targeting of civilians was to be avoided. No war can be fought in this day and age, even with the modern technology we have, that avoids injuring the civilians in any particular country-particularly when a leader deliberately puts strategic military command units in shelters, schools and hospitals so that they become immune to attack by those seeking to right the wrong. I believe that we have seen all these criteria for a just war adhered to, although not perfectly. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to pay a great compliment to the United States general, the four star general, General Schwarzkopf, who always retained an air of sensible attitude in all his press conferences and in all that he said. Indeed, I was very impressed yesterday when he arrived to meet with the Iraqi generals. He was overheard saying-it was not for public hearing but the television camera picked it up-that he did not want any humiliation whatsoever of the Iraqi generals; he wanted it to be a professional meeting of soldiers and leaders without any humiliating effects, behaviour or indications to those who had been well and truly defeated. That says a lot for him. I put on record my praise for his efforts and his restraint and the very fact that he seems to have had in front of him those seven points with regard to engaging in a just war. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention and commend our Australian forces-the naval forces and others engaged in different activities in the Gulf-who, as many speakers today from the Prime Minister down have indicated, have acquitted themselves in a wonderful way illustrating a great characteristic of Australian fighting persons. I just pass on my warm congratulations to them and my thanks to their families for the support that they gave them and to the majority of the community who rallied around and extended a great deal of support to our forces as, indeed, did the communities behind the other members of the allied forces in that war. </PARA>
<PARA> I received a number of very eloquent, well written letters from people who were opposed to the war. I respect those people for the views that they espoused to me. I hope that the response that I have been able to give them will have been at least a little satisfying, however inadequate that they may feel that that was from their own point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I could end on the accusation that has been made by many that we were fighting a country that we ourselves armed. When looking back through history, as many people seem unable to do, to the period when the arming of Iraq took place, there was a great deal of disquiet in that area. The Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran was extremely provocative to the United States, other allies and people in the Middle East. There was the taking of hostages and the claim that terrorist activities were engaged in and banned by that country; the invasion by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of Afghanistan; and the existence of the treaty between the USSR and the Iranians made in February 1921 which allows the Russians to come into Iran if they feel that there is instability in the area. The treaty has never been repealed. </PARA>
<PARA> All kinds of threats existed in those years when the Iraqi army was built up, the Iraqi nation being an ally at the time. People need to go back in history to find out why these things occurred, rather than get engaged in petty criticisms that do not really have a great deal of foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> There has never been, as somebody once said, a good war or a bad peace. Maybe that is overstating the situation a little, but it is very pleasing to stand here after such a short period and to be able to give thanks that this war has come to an end. I rejoice at that fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First, I compliment the previous speaker, my colleague the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), on his comments tonight. Very few of us in this House would have expected to be giving these speeches at this time, in this month, with the land war beginning such a short time ago. I suppose the reason it is hard for us to believe that that conflict appears to have come to an end so quickly is that we all know that in the Middle East conflict seems to be the order of the day all of the time. This is not just in recent times. Australian troops not only fought at Gallipoli during the First World War, but were involved in other conflicts in the Middle East. I am sure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be aware that the Australian Light Horse was involved in the last use of a cavalry charge during the First World War, and that was in the famous charge on Beersheba, which of course is now part of Israel. That particular charge has gone down in history as an occasion when Australian troops showed great valour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the Second World War Australian troops were involved in the North African campaign. They were often given leave and rest and recreation in Haifa and other parts of Israel. Whilst they were not directly involved in conflict in that part of the Middle East, we know that Australian troops during the Second World War spent time in the Middle East. So it is not unusual to find Australians in past conflicts being dragged into this part of the world. It is not unusual for soldiers from many parts of the world to be dragged into this whirlpool of conflict known as the Middle East. Until we can come up with a lasting solution for this part of the world, then I fear that more people will be dragged into conflicts in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why it is so important, with the cease-fire that now appears to be the close of this conflict, that we try to make sure that every effort is made to use this opportunity to obtain a lasting peace for the Middle East. That means not only seeking to ensure that the conflict is resolved in Iraq; it means not only ensuring that Iraq has secure borders, and that Iraq's neighbours are secure; but it also means that Israel must be secure in its borders, and of course the whole problem of the Palestinian refugees has to be addressed. It is only if all nations in this part of the world are prepared to meet with each other and discuss the problems which have been there for generations, and can sit down together, that we can hope to try to obtain a lasting peace. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons the world has cause for greater confidence at this time is that, for the first time since the United Nations was formed, we can see the Security Council working without the excessive use of veto powers. There is great potential for the United Nations to make a real contribution towards obtaining this lasting peace in the Middle East. It is probably a pity it has taken the world so long to reach this stage where the superpowers are working together. At the back of our minds perhaps we are concerned about the economic turmoils in the Soviet Union, and whether Gorbachev will survive, what the future is for the Baltic states, whether some irrational and hasty move on the part of the Soviet Union in the Baltic states could place this renewed friendship between the superpowers at risk. These are things we have to be concerned about. Nevertheless, for the moment the Security Council and the United Nations are working better than at any time since formation. If it were not for the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council working together, I do not think we would have this cease-fire today. We would have perhaps had an even greater loss of life than has occurred to date. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that we should forget that a massive number of people have lost their lives during this conflict-by all accounts, most of them Iraqis. Of course, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will have seen the television footage which has now been beamed around the world showing the massive numbers of trucks and tanks and other pieces of armoured equipment that were destroyed in the retreat. All of us are disturbed by the great loss of life which has resulted.</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure some people would say that the person to blame for this is George Bush, the President of the United States, for ultimately letting his country go to war. I think that is wrong, and I would like to explain why I think that argument is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not George Bush who invaded a neighbour. It was, of course, Saddam Hussein who took the decision to occupy a neighbouring state after he had made a series of threats. A previous American president might have been tempted to respond immediately, and I think it is to George Bush's great credit that he allowed Saddam Hussein as much time as possible to change his mind and to withdraw from Kuwait with no loss of life. He was given not one month or two months, but 5 1/2 months before the deadline in the middle of January to withdraw from Kuwait, and throughout those 5 1/2 months Saddam Hussein refused to even consider a withdrawal from Kuwait. He declared that it was a new province of his country. His troops were carrying out executions within Kuwait. His troops were stripping all of the valuable goods from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> There are people in my electorate who argue that at that stage the 33 allied nations which were working together should not have used force, on 15 Jan- uary, but should have continued the sanctions and the embargo. The problem I have with that argument is this: what does one tell the people of Kuwait who would have had to continue living for an even greater period under the Iraqi occupation? People who argued that the sanctions should have been given more time to work, to give peace a chance to work, were saying that more Kuwaitis had to die, that Kuwait had to be stripped for a longer period- and that was asking the people of Kuwait to accept more than they should have been asked to accept. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that television cameras are allowed into Kuwait we can see the footage of parents totally distressed by the fact that their children have been taken from them, that members of their family have disappeared, and it is very clear there was a very organised campaign by the Iraqis to totally destroy the state of Kuwait. If sanctions had been given longer to take effect, that would have asked the Kuwaitis to accept more than should ever have been asked of them. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have to remember that once the air campaign started in the middle of January, it was conducted quite dramatically. We have seen the footage of the smart bombs and missiles with cameras on them showing how terrifyingly accurate modern weapons of war can be. At the same time, I think that President Bush and the leaders of the 33 other allied nations have to be complimented on the fact that by all accounts the air campaign was directed at military targets. Yes, we all know about the mistaken attack on the bunker in Baghdad which resulted in several hundred Iraqi civilians being killed, and we all regret that deeply. Yet I do not think anyone could deny that the Americans and the allies went to great lengths to minimise the number of civilian casualties-so much so that it has been acknowledged that they were placing their own pilots at greater risk of being shot down. That is something which I think would be pretty rare in any campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the time that was allowed for the air campaign, everyone knew that if a land campaign started there would be a massive loss of life. People thought there would be a massive loss of life on both sides, on the allied side and on the side of the Iraqis. We were all hoping that perhaps Saddam Hussein would change his mind before the land campaign started. He was given week after week to consider his position, to consider the massive damage done to his country, to consider that he really had no chance of winning. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not George Bush but Saddam Hussein who made the decision that he still would not take up the opportunity to withdraw from Kuwait. He was the one who refused to withdraw from Kuwait before the land war started, and ultimately he is the one who is responsible for the terrifying and horrific loss of life on that highway to hell, or whatever name people care to give it, involving the massive numbers of retreating Iraqi soldiers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one point which I wish to stress when we consider the impact of this war on Iraq. Yes, there has been a great loss of life. Yes, there will be a massive bill to rebuild Iraq and its services. But one good thing has happened as a result of this campaign: Iraq no longer has chemical weapons, biological weapons, or the capacity to develop nuclear weapons. None of us should shy away from the fact that Iraq was working as hard as it could to develop those weapons of mass destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> In previous speeches in this House I have said that the Swiss authorities had impounded special lathes that the Iraqis were purchasing through third parties for the simple reason that they wanted to build centrifuges to concentrate plutonium to build nuclear weapons. The customs officials in Europe have previously impounded nuclear triggers which the Iraqis were seeking to smuggle to their country to detonate those weapons of mass destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> If any people think that Saddam Hussein was building up these weapons of mass destruction for his own entertainment, we know they are wrong. I am sure that if Saddam Hussein had been allowed to continue to refine and improve these weapons, to make them small enough to fit on top of a Scud missile, ultimately he would have used those weapons of mass destruction with those missiles, probably in an attack against Israel. But who knows, they could have been used in an attack against Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, or the Soviet Union. Who knows who would have been his next target had he succeeded in Kuwait?</PARA>
<PARA> To those people who, probably with the greatest of honesty and enthusiasm and commitment, believe that the allied nations were wrong to go to war against Saddam Hussein, I ask them to think about what would have happened if Saddam Hussein had successfully taken over Kuwait and had been able to retain his chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and had he been able to continue to threaten other nations in his region. That was not a recipe for a lasting peace in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> A lasting peace in the Middle East, as I said at the beginning, is something which may come out of this conflict. It will only come out of this conflict if the Arab nations of the region are prepared to sit down at the table with Israel and negotiate a peace which results in both sides allowing all nations in the region to live at peace within secure and defensible borders and without seeking to use terrorism or other means of conflict to resolve disputes. When that happens, I am sure that all members of this House will agree that the Australian sailors, medical teams and others who have served in the Gulf can rightly claim that they have made a small but relevant contribution on behalf of Australia towards achieving peace in the Middle East. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of pleasure that I join other members of this House in supporting the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) earlier this afternoon. We are pleased to be here today discussing the tremendous victory of the allied forces in Kuwait in the past few days. We are pleased because of that victory; we are pleased because the routing of Iraqi forces was so successful and so strong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The routing of Iraq's forces showed us a number of things. It is worth considering how easily the land war was won by the allied forces and how easily the Iraqi army gave in to the rapidly moving allied forces as they came into Kuwait and ultimately into Iraq. That shows that conscripts in a totalitarian State are never the soldiers that professional men and women who voluntarily join up with armed services are. Those who are prepared voluntarily to go into a theatre of war are much better soldiers, much better military people, than any conscripts that have been forced into that position as a result of the rule of a dictator. There is a great lesson in that for the future. If Australia and other countries throughout the world are to have successful fighting forces, they must realise that the best, most successful forces are made up not of conscripts but of volunteers. </PARA>
<PARA> The other extraordinary thing about this conflict was the very low loss of life on behalf of the allied forces. I think about 97 people from the allied forces were killed in action. There is a great disparity between the numbers killed on the allied side and those killed on the Iraqi side. But to all those who lost a family member in this war, I speak on behalf of everybody in this country in extending to them our sympathies. It is a tragic loss for them and we should not forget that, even though the loss of life was very low, for those who have lost a loved one it is a tremendous loss and we should think of them at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people have done a tremendous job towards achieving the successful result in Kuwait. President George Bush, as so many other members have mentioned, has placed himself in the annals of history as one of the great American Presidents, one of the great leaders of this world. He has certainly put the United States on top as leader of the free world and he has reinstated the prestige and status of the United States, a prestige which has been in question since the end of the Vietnam war days. His Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, and Secretary of State, James Baker, equally deserve commendation for what they have done. </PARA>
<PARA> As many members have also pointed out, General Schwarzkopf, the officer commanding the allied forces in the Gulf, will be long remembered as one of the most successful military commanders the world has ever seen. He deserves great congratulations. From what one reads in the paper, when he returns to his home state of Florida his life is going to be one of great excitement, prestige and power. Good on him for receiving that. </PARA>
<PARA> I think congratulations should also be given to all the members of the coalition forces who participated in this Gulf war. Australia is one of the nations that participated in the coalition, and the Government, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) as well as the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) all deserve their share of the credit for their participation and role in the Gulf crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally so, honourable members of this Australian Parliament deserve congratulations. Those of us who sat through most of the debate in the special sitting of this Parliament on the Gulf crisis on 21 and 22 January would have been very proud of the quality of the speeches and the nature of the Parliament. In my six-odd years in this place, I felt that it was one of the rare moments when the Parliament was really serving the role that it was created to serve-that is, to give vent to individuals' views in a bipartisan fashion best representing the personal feelings of honourable members of this House and indeed in the process representing the majority view held throughout Australia at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> A bipartisan position was taken by this Parliament, which stands in stark contrast to the position that this Parliament held in the last conflict that Australia was involved in-the Vietnam war. One side of the Parliament supported it; the other side opposed it. That split in the Parliament was reflected throughout the community. Because of that the community was divided, and when our servicemen came back from Vietnam they came home to a community that looked upon them with low esteem and that took out its frustration and anger about Australia's involvement in Vietnam upon those returning servicemen. Indeed, I think those people suffered a great deal of psychological harm as a result of having a divided Parliament and a divided nation. </PARA>
<PARA> This was an occasion when fortunately we could avoid that division in the Parliament and in the nation, and our returning service men and women will come back from the Gulf to a country that looks upon them with great respect, great admiration and great thanks. </PARA>
<PARA> Last but by no means least in this list of congratulations, indeed probably most importantly, are our military personnel who have been serving under the Australian flag in the Gulf from the outset of this crisis. Kuwait was invaded by Iraq on 2 August. Australia committed itself to a coalition force on 10 August, and our forces were very quickly on their way to the Gulf. Australia has been in there from the outset; it has performed its duty admirably; and I think we have brought a great deal of credit on ourselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Leader of the National Party points out, it was at great personal risk to our military personnel serving under the Australian flag in the Gulf. He visited those personnel at Christmas time and went on board the various ships flying the Australian flag. He told me over dinner tonight how there was great tension on board those vessels whilst he was there because they were within Exocet missile range, they were within attacking distance from Iraq and at any moment something could have gone off which could have seen those vessels explode and many lives lost. They were placed under extreme stress and danger and, as the Leader of the National Party has informed this House and others outside this place, they performed their duties very professionally, very calmly and with great credit to themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of those forces, some 40-odd people came from my own electorate, mainly from HMAS Albatross which is based at Nowra. Another two people, not necessarily based at HMAS Albatross, came from the city of Goulburn. I have been very keen to ensure that my constituents serving in the Gulf have had their families properly looked after while they have been away. I am very pleased to say that, judging by the regular contact I have had with the naval base, it seems to me that their families have been well looked after. I have not had one single example of a major problem occurring with any of those families while their husbands have been away in the Gulf serving Australia. It has been very pleasing. </PARA>
<PARA> But the other pleasing aspect has been the tremendous community support that has been given to those families while their husbands and fathers have been away in the Gulf. It would take 10 or 15 minutes to read through a list of the groups that have offered either material or moral comfort to such families. It is a great show of the nature of Australians as to how the supporters rallied around those people. I am sure that the same applies not just at HMAS Albatross but right across the naval community of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of people who have left the Gulf war situation with egg on their faces. As other honourable members have mentioned, the peace protesters who were outside this building for most of the last few months really have not brought great credit upon themselves. They showed themselves to be total hypocrites. Whenever George Bush's name or America was mentioned during the debate here in January, hisses and jeers came from the peace protesters; but not one single hiss or jeer came from those people when Saddam Hussein's name or Iraq was mentioned. Nor were they protesting outside the Iraqi embassy expressing their concerns to the perpetrators of this crime in the Gulf. Indeed, right from the outset the peace protesters proved themselves to be both naive and hypocritical. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jo Vallentine also proved herself to be a great donkey. She came into this place during the debate when the Prime Minister was speaking and started to shout from the gallery. She took a privileged position, which she holds at the express wishes of the people of Western Australia, and abused it; she put our attendants in a dilemma; and she brought disgrace upon herself and the Australian Parliament. She has proved herself to be a donkey, and I hope that at some stage in the future she will have the decency to apologise to the Speaker of the House and to the members of the Australian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats also did themselves a great disservice. If we had listened and taken heed of the advice of the peace protesters, Jo Vallentine and the Democrats, we would have ended up with more deaths in Kuwait, because every day that we delayed liberating Kuwait was another day that Saddam Hussein's forces could perpetrate more atrocities and kill more innocent civilians, including more children and women in Kuwait. For every day that we delayed, more innocent men, women and children in Kuwait died. For every day that we delayed, we gave Saddam Hussein's forces in Kuwait time to stabilise themselves and to strengthen their position. To get them out at some later stage would have required more allied forces' lives to be lost in the process of uprooting a stronger Iraqi force that had had more time to dig itself in in Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> If we had appeased the Iraqis and said, `Oh well, Kuwait is only a small piece on the map. We will let them have it', the power and the wealth that they would have acquired from Kuwait would have ensured that the Iraqis would have gone on ultimately to attack Saudi Arabia, giving them access to 42 per cent of the world's oil resources. The tremendous wealth that that would have given Iraq would have made it the most powerful nation in the Middle East, threatening places such as Israel and possibly ultimately being the cause of a third world war. That is something that we all want to avoid, but we would have had a third world war had we appeased Iraq and had we taken notice of the peace protesters and the Democrats. I think we were very wise to ignore their advice, as we do so often in other matters relating to the running of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The job ahead is to rebuild Kuwait and Iraq. We must repair the tremendous environmental damage that has been done in Kuwait and in Iraq over the last few months. We must stabilise the Gulf region so that we can return it to peace. We must avoid the United States going into a kind of reinvigorated Marshall Plan, offering cheap subsidised foodstuffs to Iraq or Kuwait at the expense of trading nations such as Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt whatsoever that the initiative of the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), to send a bipartisan trade delegation to the United States is a very good one. It is one which will ensure that we remind those decision makers in the United States that Australia will be disadvantaged seriously if the United States hands out free foodstuffs to Iraq or Kuwait in order to try to rebuild those two countries. It will do tremendous damage to the relations with Australia if the United States does that. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States must remember that Australia was alongside it in this dispute. Australia was one of the few countries that supported it during the Vietnam and Korean wars. We fought alongside it in the First and Second World Wars. So the United States has a debt to repay to Australia, and I hope that as a consequence of its realisation of that debt it takes heed of the advice that will be given to it by the bipartisan delegation that will leave Australia tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the day, we have learnt a lot. We have learnt that war is the ultimate folly and that all that we achieve out of war is tremendous damage and loss of life, as has been the case with Iraq. Tonight on the television we saw footage of 79 unknown Iraqi soldiers being buried in a mass grave. One wonders what the families of those unknown soldiers are going through at this time, wondering what on earth has happened to their loved ones. War is the ultimate folly. Saddam Hussein is to blame for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak in the debate, and I acknowledge your earlier strong contribution to it. Frankly, this is the first opportunity I have had to speak on the Gulf crisis. I well recall events in December when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), having dispatched our ships to the Gulf, warned that unless there was a satisfactory resolution the crisis could escalate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I freely confess to the Parliament that I was one of those who really never believed that Saddam Hussein would not withdraw from Kuwait. It seemed inconceivable that with the coalition forces arraigned against him, he would maintain his unlawful occupation of Kuwait. I was surprised and shocked when the 15 January deadline passed and Saddam Hussein had not withdrawn the Iraqi forces from Kuwait, and not long after that Operation Desert Storm commenced. In the long term it should teach us a very salutary lesson. </PARA>
<PARA> As a Government member I am pleased that we can debate this issue in the Australian Parliament and demonstrate to Australians that on such critical matters political parties can adopt a bipartisan approach. This approach has been of most importance to those people serving in the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes I have been associated with debate on matters affecting Telecom. I want to draw to the attention of the House and the shadow Minister for transport and telecommunications, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), who I am sure will agree with me, the role played by the 115 Telecom Australia workers and their 167 dependants who have been in Saudi Arabia since the crisis commenced. Having won a contract against international competition, Telecom is responsible for providing some hefty advice to the Saudis. The Gulf war highlighted how critical telecommunications were in Saudi Arabia. The smooth functioning of the telecommunications system can in some way-some might say a major way-be attributed to the dedication and determination of the Telecom workers to stay at their posts. </PARA>
<PARA> These comments are relevant because there was some criticism that Telecom was failing to accept full responsibility for its workers by not withdrawing them from the region. I can assure the House that at all stages throughout the Gulf crisis Telecom was assessing on a regular basis the risks to its workers and their families. The example set by them has probably enhanced Australia's reputation. I hope that Telecom, OTC and indeed Australian industry obtain full measure from the reputation that had previously been established and is now established in the Middle East region. </PARA>
<PARA> I should now like to dwell on a rather unpleasant aspect of the Gulf crisis as it affects Australians. Unfortunately, an Islamic centre in my electorate at Rooty Hill was bombed. It is a sad reflection on our country that, in times of crisis, some in our community take the opportunity to single out minority groups. I want to place on record the fact that there are many members of the Muslim community in my electorate. Unfortunately, the fire bombers did not understand that not all Muslims either come from the Gulf area or are Arabs. </PARA>
<PARA> I have good dealings and relations with a number of Arab societies and communities in my electorate, as I do with the other communities. The great irony of this bombing was that it was a predominantly Pakistani Islamic centre open to all Muslims. We had the irony of someone trying to make a statement against Arab Australians and picking on an entirely inappropriate facility. I am not trying to suggest that the people who carried out the bombing should try to better focus their attacks. Rather, I am saying how sad and pathetic it really is. </PARA>
<PARA> The most heartening aspect of the exercise was that the ministers of religion surrounding the Islamic centre took it upon themselves to visit the Imam and offer their solidarity and support. Whilst it could not be said that many good things come out of such actions, that visit really was very heartening. </PARA>
<PARA> In multicultural Australia we sometimes have to dwell on the fact that we are not only multicultural but we are also multi-religious. I want to report to the House that all the Arab Australians I represent-all those who follow the Islamic faith in my electorate-are excellent citizens and make a fine contribution not only to my part of the world but also to Australia. We ought to resist the temptation to single out minorities. Times like the Gulf crisis test the tolerance of our country, and there is a lesson in that. </PARA>
<PARA> Also on the local level, I have been very pleased by the messages I have received in my office. I have sent letters to my constituents firstly expressing a wish for the quick, safe return of those servicemen and women in the Gulf. While it appears that the worst of the hazards are over, as the Prime Minister quite rightly points out they still exist but to a lesser degree. I hope that those servicemen and women return quickly to the grateful thanks of the nation and of this Parliament in particular. I am pleased that so many of my constituents responded warmly to my wish. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect of my letter concerned the tremendous loss of life. Any loss of life on the side of the coalition in the Gulf crisis is sad and regrettable, as it has such a great impact on the families concerned. We should be grateful that the numbers were so small, particularly as we anticipated that they would be so much greater. However, on the Iraqi side the loss of life has been absolutely horrendous. We owe it to those who lost their lives to secure what these days is called a new order. We should secure a lasting peace in a region of the world that traditionally has been bedevilled by conflicts and hatreds. If we do not seize that opportunity, so much effort and money will have been spent for an important but very, very small dividend.</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the community discussions on our Gulf involvement, a suggestion was put that in fact the coalitionists were premature in not allowing sanctions to continue. I do not suppose that we will ever know the full story, and I certainly do not believe that we should base all our beliefs on the earliest reports, but we can see that the price that Iraq extracted from the Kuwaiti population has been horrendous. I do not like making easy comparisons, but as to the disregard for and sanctity of human life I think we need to go back to parallels of the Second World War. So what I am suggesting to the House and to those people who were earnestly urging the Prime Minister and others to buckle under and extend sanctions is that Kuwait and the Kuwaitis could not have paid the price. I think in the months and years to come we will get a very full accounting of the horrors that the Kuwaiti people put up with.</PARA>
<PARA> The other element is that it was clear that Saddam Hussein, given extra time, would have been even better prepared and that the challenges faced by the coalition forces would have been even greater. I think the recurring nightmare throughout the Gulf crisis was the possibility that there would be a chemical attack or even, indeed, a nuclear attack. I do not think that we could suggest that the only countries which may have been victims would have been Saudi Arabia and Israel. It is quite clear-in my mind, at least-that Saddam Hussein would have stooped to anything and, whilst others may have felt some reluctance about using chemical weapons or nuclear weapons, that Saddam Hussein would not have felt such a reluctance. So I think there is the argument that we were able to forswear the use of chemical weapons and nuclear weapons. Perhaps the other thing that ought to be mentioned is that the capacity to use chemical weapons has now been eradicated and, in fact, Saddam's power or the power of the Iraqi people for the time being has been severely circumscribed as a regional military power. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had men and women serving in the Gulf, initially on HMAS Adelaide, Darwin and Success and now on HMAS Sydney, Brisbane and Westralia; we have had our servicemen on exchange with allied forces serving in the Gulf and very much directly involved in the activity there; we have had up to 40 medical personnel serving on a hospital ship; and more recently, and to a degree controversially, we have had the frogmen and the divers involved. Their role is going to be more intensive now as we try to clear the mines away from the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I have welcomed the bipartisan approach that this Parliament has adopted to the crisis. I think that the Prime Minister throughout has exerted full leadership as far as this nation is concerned. As a nation and as a Parliament, I think we can take great pride in the role that our serving men and women have played. We certainly pray for their speedy return to this country and to their families. I have supported the Government's role in the Gulf and I particularly welcome the award of an active service medal that provides recognition for the contribution that these brave Australians have made on behalf of the nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the last occasion the question of Iraq was before the House-on 22 January-we were asked to support a war that had been commenced a week before by the United States. In my view, the question was: what would be the best method to remove Saddam Hussein from Kuwait and from power? Was it to take, on 15 January, the war option or was it to continue a military siege, sanctions and diplomatic pressure for some further period of time? We will never know the merits or otherwise of the latter option. What we can now begin to do is to assess the war option and our part in it. Certainly the primary objective has been achieved-that is, the removal of Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. It has been achieved in a very speedy manner and with an incredibly small number of allied casualties. We are all obviously very grateful for that. I certainly join the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in congratulating all concerned with the Australian effort in doing that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On balance, the role of the United Nations (UN) has been strengthened. However, that has to be tempered by the fact that the veto can always be used in the future. It just so happens that on this occasion all members of the Security Council, for reasons of their own, did not exercise the veto. While the UN is the only hope for world peace, I think we must not get carried away, because the Security Council is not a particularly democratic representation of the General Assembly and, in turn, the General Assembly is not a particularly democratic representation of the world's people. After all, only about 35 of the 158 members can be called a democracy in any sense of the word. Nevertheless, the United Nations is all we have, and I think Australia has to do all it can to reinforce that organisation and to seek to make it a more democratic institution in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Any real assessment of the war is fairly difficult at this point. I suppose Ronald Zieglar, President Nixon's press secretary, would be very proud of the way the news has been managed in this particular war. As far as I am aware, no honourable member of the House has raised this issue. We were told at the start that this was going to be a television war. We have really seen nothing of the war, except a lot of talking heads and a lot of file footage. For some weeks, we have had the most intensive bombing campaign probably in history and there has been almost no mention of casualties. We have just heard a lot of obscene euphemisms about collateral damage. </PARA>
<PARA> The obvious media manipulation built up quite a false picture of Saddam Hussein. We were told about the enormous might of the Iraqi military machine and that it was on a par with the Germany of the late 1930s. The truth really was that this war was totally one-sided. As some of the American commentators said, it was virtually a turkey shoot. There was no resistance in the air, virtually no resistance at sea and very little resistance on land. Of course, what else could we expect when we had the bulk of the world's industrialised countries attacking a Third World country with a population equivalent to that of Australia? That Third World country had been sold an enormous amount of military hardware, but it fortunately had no infrastructure and no capability of really utilising it. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence of the much vaunted menace of the nuclear and chemical capability of Iraq has not materialised. But I guess all of that was totally predictable, as was the massive damage that Kuwait and Iraq have received as they have been bombed back to the Stone Age. The results of that will be with us for at least a decade to come. We know that the cost of repairs for the immediate result is in the vicinity of $100 billion. We also know that we have enormous casualties. No-one is saying what the casualty rate is, but if we look at the 106,000 air sorties over Iraq and Kuwait and look at the massive naval bombardment with the thousands of missiles, even if one person was killed in each action, we have a casualty rate of around 200,000. We know we have an ecological disaster-possibly the largest in the world's history-in the Gulf itself on the land with the oil fires. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly it is of some satisfaction, I suppose, that the Government of Kuwait has been reinstated, but personally I find very little joy in reinstating an obscenely wealthy, feudal, despotic regime. We should make no mistake: the seeds of the future fall of that regime and others in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf emirates have well and truly been laid. There is no way that family concentrations of enormous wealth can survive in the Arab world for very long, particularly when most of that world is in poverty and has an illiteracy rate of around 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that another cost of the war is well over one million refugees, which will destabilise a number of other countries in the Middle East. Again, the problems of that will flow for many years. Australia must bear some responsibility and must do something about that. </PARA>
<PARA> But probably the most damaging result of the war is the reinforcement of war and the war option as the effective way of solving disputes. In spite of some of the hypocrisy that I have heard in this chamber and all the hypocrisy that will be heard in many other forums around the world, every nation is quietly looking now to reinforce its military capability, especially its nuclear capability. We have set the stage for the next time around. We should make no mistake; the message that has reverberated around the world is, `You need a better air force'. An increase in defence budgets will occur in virtually every country, and the war has precipitated an arms push, particularly in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, in China and possibly even in Germany and Japan. Shares in arms manufacturers are rocketing around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> From the Australian point of view, not much has been overtly said by our South East Asian neighbours, but the fact is that we broke faith with them. We failed to consult them as we were treaty bound to do; the trade ramifications will haunt us for many years, particularly in the Middle East and South East Asia; and, on the other side of the coin, our token role-and it was only a token role-has not passed unnoticed among our great and powerful friends. Certainly the United States of America shows little sign of reversing its present policy of crushing our rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The war has set the scene for the destabilisation of a number of regimes in the Middle East, particularly Jordan, and the cause of Moslem fundamentalism has been helped quite considerably. The hatred and antipathy to the West in much of the Moslem world has been reinforced from Mauritania to North Africa, the Middle East, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia. We will need a great deal of damage control if we are not going to pay for this economically and militarily in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> But I suppose our really glaring problem, having taken the war option, is what happens about enforcing United Nations resolutions on Turkey, Israel and Indonesia, in respect of Cyprus, the West Bank and Timor. Before the war we could quietly consign them away, but now I do not think we can treat them as ancient history; we have to address them in some form unless we are prepared to let the new world order collapse in a welter of double standards and hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA> These are some of the results, and they were all clearly predictable, of the war option taken on 16 January. We have not addressed any of the real causes of the war or the Middle East problems; they all remain: the artificial colonial borders of 1922; the impossible borders of Israel set up in 1948; and the poverty and illiteracy of most of the Arab world. We have not addressed the world's armament manufacturers selling to dictatorial regimes; we have not even looked at the question of the growth of religious fundamentalism-and that fundamentalism is not only Islamic; it is also Hebrew and Christian. We have seen some of the results of that in Lebanon. We have not addressed the problem of the undemocratic feudal regimes-we have reinforced them, temporarily-or the unequal distribution of wealth throughout the Middle East. Lastly, and probably most of all for the stability of the Middle East, we have not even talked about the problem of the Jewish and Palestinian homelands. </PARA>
<PARA> The course of peace in the Middle East will be obviously far more difficult than the war. I can only urge the Government to take a much greater role in the United Nations. We have to pursue through the United Nations and through other diplomatic means the removal of Saddam Hussein from any position of power in the future; we have to support a greater role for the United Nations and seek more democratic reforms of its structures; we have to support increased aid, particularly to countries without massive oil reserves; we have to support the establishment of democratic regimes-not only in Iraq, as the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) called for, but throughout the Middle East; and, most of all, we have to commence extensive damage control programs, particularly with our South East Asian neighbours and Moslem countries throughout the world. We must forgo the future temptation to export arms to some of these countries, and we have to consign the Mirage fiasco to history. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot shirk our responsibilities. We have to raise in the UN the question of Cyprus, the West Bank and Timor, and we have to find permanent solutions. If we simply ignore these areas, we will only be accused of double standards and hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to support the Prime Minister in his view of the new world order if it means no military invasions of any country without approval of the Security Council, but I do not want to support it if it means unquestioning support for US intervention as a world policeman. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hopefully, this will be the last time the chamber debates the issue of the Gulf war. When we began these debates some months ago, I do not think any of us believed that at this point of time we would be having a concluding debate on the war or one when the outcome of the conflict was so clear-cut. We are now in a position to wrap up the issue and look at the aftermath in a systematic way from an advantageous position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had very lengthy debates on the subject, and rightly so. As Leader of the House, I have been most reluctant to gag these debates and have adopted the view that they should be talked out until everybody has had an opportunity to express their views. Today has been an opportunity for reflection and for positive proposals about future action to ensure that these circumstances do not arise, either internationally or regionally, in the political conditions which exist in the Middle East. I think all honourable members have made constructive suggestions about that. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding the debate, it is right that I do so the way many people have entered it, and that is to express gratitude to those of Australia's serving personnel who found themselves involved in the conflict directly-those on the naval ships, those on shore, those in the mining team and also those on the ships which left early but nevertheless found themselves in a position where they were highly active in enforcing what was an increasingly successful blockade. They have served this country very well in the tasks they have performed. </PARA>
<PARA> They also performed those tasks in considerable danger. It is relatively easy for people to note that, in the actual conflict itself as opposed to the period of the blockade, they did not fire a shot in anger, and easy to note the fact that we have had no casualties-touch wood-to this point of time. But, as somebody who sits in the Cabinet security committee and was regularly privy to our intelligence briefings on the progress of the conflict, I know that story was far from true in terms of the tension levels that existed in the ships and the way in which they were positioned. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot go into much detail on these matters, but there was quite evidently a very high level of confidence by the United States Navy, with whom the Australian force operated for the bulk of the conflict, in the capacity of our ships to perform air defence tasks. Associated with the Midway carrier battle group, they were given primary air defence tasks against what were thought to be threats that might emerge at very short notice indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought not to forget the fact that the Iraqis did get some aircraft into the air with the purpose of attacking those ships. They were shot down before they were able to get into a position to successfully launch an attack. It also bears remembering that two significant American warships were effectively taken out of this conflict by mining operations. Those mines placed our ships every bit as much in danger as the ships which eventually were damaged by coming into conflict with mines that were laid and not very easy to detect. </PARA>
<PARA> Our personnel have been engaged at the sharp end of the process. It was really only well into the air battle that the extent of one of those threats appeared to diminish. Again, as the ground offensive got under way, there was always the possibility that the air threat might escalate again were an attempt to be made by elements of the Iraqi air force to score a major counterpunch before effectively being removed altogether from the scene. That attack was not mounted, but it was always assessed as a high level possibility. So we ought to thank our personnel for the task they have performed. </PARA>
<PARA> Wearing my new hat of communications Minister, I might say that I very much appreciated the remarks of the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) with regard to the Telecom workers. They and their dependants stayed in Saudi Arabia throughout the conflict. They stayed in cities that were within range of Scud missile assault and they were prepared to face that danger in order to ensure that their contracts were fulfilled. They were not service personnel; they were civilian technicians but they were prepared to do that. For that I believe all honour ought to be extended to them and I am very glad that the honourable member for Chifley found time to remember them. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that there has been a stress in remarks that have been uttered here-and rightly so-on the skilful nature of the diplomacy pursued by the allies in the United Nations and the United Nations Security Council. I think particular praise should go to the diplomats, and particularly to the President, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense of the United States. Contrary to assertions that are made, manipulation was not taking place. What was taking place was an appropriate use of international forums placed at the disposal of countries which believed that aggression had been committed and had to be resisted. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States, in circumstances in which it was committing a sizeable amount of force and placing at risk the lives of a large number of its serving personnel, was nevertheless diplomatically prepared to place itself hostage to the United Nations Security Council. In hindsight that strategy appears to have worked remarkably well. It could have been derailed very easily at any point in time. Those troops found themselves in a very different political situation in very difficult circumstances. That that derailing did not occur was a tribute both to the resolution of the senior political figures of the United States and also to the will of the substantial majority of nations that are members of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> It should never be forgotten that that United Nations Security Council, which repeatedly approved strategy, which was repeatedly called upon to adopt attitudes to where the conflict ought to go and what positions the Iraqis ought to be obliged to conform with, included nations that in no way could be said to have been longstanding traditional supporters of the United States in world affairs. Yet they stood very firmly for Security Council resolutions and for their enforcement. If we do not want to take a jaundiced anti-American view of what has preceded and see the worst possible conspiracy applied to the Americans in regard to this exercise, what we really should learn from this is that, where there is that will and that will is systematically applied, then the United Nations is an institution worth supporting. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to a speech that I saw last night recorded by the Cable News Network of the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. It was not a gloating exercise of victimisation, but a genuinely humble tribute to the process in which he had found himself as a diplomat to the United Nations and how he believed the processes gone through in this conflict were processes which would be important for the long-haul peace and security of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> All that needs to be borne in mind when we contemplate the lessons that have been learnt from this war. That is one of the very positive lessons. The United Nations, with an appropriate diplomacy associated with its activities, is potentially at least a force for peace and stability in the world and a protector of small nation states. It really has not been that until very recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> I think too that there is another thing that we can learn from this process in relation to the United States, and that is that our relationship with that country in defence terms is very important. In the rather lengthy period that I have now enjoyed office, I have never been one to take the view that trade issues and defence issues are played out on the same chessboard; they are not. The benefits we obtain from our association with the United States can be traded-if we want to put it in horse trading terms-in the defence area. Whilst again we cannot go into a great deal of detail about the operations of the joint facilities in this country, suffice it to say that the steady progress that has been made over the years of ensuring that those facilities, important as they have always been to the peace and stability of the world, are now increasingly important to Australian defence capabilities. Their presence reduces very substantial financial obligations on this country which, were they not there, would oblige us to levels of defence expenditure which many people in this House would not find acceptable and probably not achievable. I think that that is another lesson from this particular conflict on which Australian defence personnel, as they plan their recommendations to the Government on the future of our Defence Force structure, can place a great deal of reliance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in that area of maximising the value of our alliances as we pursue an independent foreign and defence policy-in this particular case an alliance with the United States-that this war has contained a substantial number of lessons. It is in that area that the substantial trade-off in benefits accrue to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some other lessons that our defence forces can learn as well from this conflict. I have by no means covered all of them. One of them is that mining and mining countermeasures are significant in the defence of the country and also in terms of what we need in order to be able to effectively defend ourselves. We have always argued that it is important to us to maintain a technological edge in our defence capability in regional terms. A technological edge has frequently focused on the quality of our air and naval assets. That remains, as demonstrated by the war, an important emphasis in our policies and it will be something that we will always have to look to. There is clearly a value in a technological edge in overcoming an opponent which has manpower superiority. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to what has been suggested here, the war does not provoke a requirement for broad-sweeping general reviews of Australian defence policy. I do not accept some of the points that were made, quite mildly, by members of the Opposition in that regard. The conflict provoked from us a response, which was well anticipated by ourselves in the defence strategy that we laid down-an almost uncanny direct reference to precisely what we did in the Defence White Paper of 1987. I think that our policy stands well; it has been emphasised. </PARA>
<PARA> While not at all depreciating the fact that the Opposition has solidly supported us throughout this crisis, I must say that we did not really need any lessons from the Opposition on how we ought to explain this policy to the Australian people. I do not agree with the statement of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) when he suggested in his remarks that the Opposition in that area had made some substantial contribution to the development or portrayal of government policy. The contribution the Opposition did make undoubtedly, and very effectively and very usefully, was to add to the emphasis of the strong impression that reflected the reality of great solidarity in this community behind the efforts of the United Nations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In conclusion, as I have said, we have learned a number of lessons from this, but those lessons do not require broad, sweeping changes in our defence policy. One of the lessons we have to learn is that we have to develop strategies for dealing with the regional development of weapons of mass destruction. By the singular process of disarmament that problem has been temporarily cured in that area of the Middle East. But it is not permanently cured and it will never be until there can be effective diplomacy which encourages nations to take those weapons of mass destruction out of their order of battle. We at least now have the opportunity of demonstrating that these weapons are not so overweeningly powerful that they can give a country an overwhelming edge when world opinion is directed against that country. But it is very important to translate that practical lesson into meaningful agreements amongst the nations of the region.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a very important issue which is facing country residents within Australia, that is, the high cost of fuel in country areas, particularly in Victoria. As from 1 January this year the deregulation of the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) industry occurred in this country. It is now not unusual to pay 12c per litre more for liquefied petroleum gas in country areas than one would pay in capital cities, such as Melbourne, which is a vast difference in the price of LPG. Before the Middle East conflict the price of dieseline was always 3c to 4c a litre cheaper than super grade unleaded petrol; now it is selling at the same price in country areas or at maybe 1c a litre less than unleaded petrol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We need to bear in mind that within Victoria the State Government has imposed a levy of 3c per litre on petrol in order to pay for that Government's mishandling of the debacle involving the Pyramid-Farrow Building Society, and now the taxpayers of that State are footing the bill for the cost of petrol. The difference between the prices of petrol and of diesel fuel throughout country areas in the State of Victoria should therefore be quite substantial because of the 3c imposed on the price of petrol by the State Government. Many motorists in country Australia have moved to LPG or diesel fuel in order to meet the costs of travelling long distances. As you know, Mr Speaker, public transport throughout country areas of Australia is notable by its absence. The movement by country residents to LPG or diesel fuel in order to look after their transportation needs has now meant that they are caught up in the price escalation of both of those fuels. Perhaps the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) could address the question of the rapid escalation in the price of LPG and diesel fuel in country areas and could provide some explanation for the price hikes that have occurred on these two products. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to express my support for government and non-government projects which are aimed at filling the awful void in the presentation of Aboriginal history which has deprived decades, into centuries, of Australian children from benefiting from the knowledge of the rich Aboriginal culture and from knowing the facts, as they happened, about European invasion. The Aboriginal education policy of this Government has set long term goals for improving Aboriginal participation and success in education. Major new agreements have now been reached with most State and Territory governments as well as other education providers which are aimed at increasing Aboriginal opportunities in, and outcomes from, education. Last week the Pemulwuy Koori College at Newtown-Australia's first Aboriginal high school-opened its doors to 50 Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal students. In Brisbane the Queensland Murris are promoting and developing a program of education known as the cultural heritage education program-CHEP-which is a program of education designed to teach the culture and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia by instruction in various areas of Aboriginal culture and history for the purpose of providing for all people in the Queensland community an understanding of the culture and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It is one of a number of groups which are doing excellent work in this context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been a real tragedy that not only history texts aimed at popular or scholastic readership but also those provided for students in the white education system-histories which could have discouraged the disease of prejudice by providing an informed attitude-have instead provided a major means of recycling prejudice in our country. For instance, my reading of Queensland texts published as late as the 1960s indicates that Queensland students could well have grown up believing that, while in the Battle of Hastings or the American Civil War people were killed defending their territory or their beliefs, in colonial Australia Aborigines just vanished when confronted. Aboriginal skills and compatibility with the environment are omitted or diminished by such patronising observations as that which was made about the tribal diet-`It seems hard for us to imagine that people would like to eat some of these things, but I suppose we too could become used to them if there was nothing else to eat'. Not only are such descriptions part of a network of stereotyped misrepresentations which attack the dignity and self-esteem of Aboriginal people, but also they demonstrate a missed opportunity by white educators to encourage any imaginative quest by students to partake in the richness of the Aboriginal culture. </PARA>
<PARA> Even in 1950 John Pilger tells the same story of his school days in New South Wales. He says that when he entered high school a standard history textbook, which sold more than 200,000 copies, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Boys and girls often ask, `What is the use of history?'</PARA>
<PARA> Answer: There are still living today in Arnhem Land people who know almost no history. They are Aboriginal tribesmen who live in practically the same way as their forefathers and ours did . . . We are civilised today and they are not. History helps us to understand why this is so. </PARA>
<PARA>Pilger and others outline the sophisticated and successful Aboriginal legal and welfare systems. Our kids should have been taught this. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Far from being `primitive', the first Australians demonstrated skills and mores in contrast with the rigid ways of the first Europeans. They learned languages better than whites. They displayed an intimacy with their environment that produced knowledge and skills of which the whites had no concept. They used fire to manage agriculture without threatening the environment, allowing them not only to increase food production but to create a mosaic, with each section at a different stage of regeneration. </PARA>
<PARA>In our white and multicultural society, we could well learn from the earlier civilisation of Aboriginal people in Australia. Our children in schools, both white and Aboriginal, should have the advantage of histories which tell Australian early history as it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of this House concerns expressed to me by bank managers and constituents regarding the Cash Transaction Reports Act, which came into effect on 1 February 1991. This Act requires people opening a new bank account to produce a variety of identification to earn 100 points before a new account can be opened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The stated purpose of the Act was to assist in the detection of criminal activities, tax evasion and the laundering of money. I do not disagree with this, but let us look at the practicalities of this regulation. Take, for example, the pensioner who has to comply with new deeming regulations. A number of banks have now responded by launching deeming accounts with a minimum deposit of $2,000. This means that pensioners have to open new accounts and it runs them up against the new identification regulations now required before a new account can be established. </PARA>
<PARA> Can you, Mr Speaker, imagine the confusion faced by pensioners who have been customers with a bank for many years? In many cases, they know the bank's staff and their families have probably watched many of them grow up, especially in small towns. But suddenly this is insufficient identification. In fact, on the identification point score checklist, this often lifelong association is only worth a mere 40 points. Of course, this is resulting in great confusion. People simply cannot understand why, when they have banked at the same bank for up to 30 years or sometimes longer, they suddenly have to produce a birth certificate, Medicare card, passport or driver's licence to prove their identity. </PARA>
<PARA> Many pensioners in particular do not have credit cards or a driver's licence; their birth certificates are of a different style to current ones, so bank staff are sometimes hesitant to accept them. In fact, this whole exercise is fraught with difficulties. The brochure prepared by the Australian Bankers Association entitled `Identification Requirements Information for Bank Customers' does not give details of the points system. Under the heading, `Some helpful advice', the brochure says:</PARA>
<PARA>If you are opening an account or becoming a signatory on an account it will assist if you bring as much identification as you conveniently can. Ask at your branch for advice as to what would be best in your case. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, what happens is that pensioners, who often have to rely on others for transport, make a trip to their bank to open their new deeming account-an action forced on them by this Government-only to find that they are unable to complete their transaction because they do not carry the necessary identification requirements with them, and therefore they have to make subsequent visits, even though, as I mentioned earlier, the pensioner could be well known to many staff at the bank. </PARA>
<PARA> I just do not believe that this regulation has been properly thought through. It is very easy for someone to steal a wallet containing identification cards and to obtain a birth certificate in another's name. The irony of the Cash Transaction Reports Act is that it relies on simple bureaucratic measures to eliminate tax evasion and the laundering of money. This must surely be underestimating the intelligence of the white collar criminal mind. What this poorly constructed legislation has achieved is confusion and frustration of the regular banking customers and has increased paperwork, time and embarrassment for banking staff. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated previously, I totally support the purpose for which these regulations were introduced, but this is not the method to eliminate criminal activities. Rather, it disadvantages the innocent and, particularly, the aged.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At a time when the world is being completely occupied with the Gulf crisis and its resolution, other issues of concern to the international community have found it quite difficult to remain on the agenda. One such issue is that of the tragically divided country of Cyprus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ever since I visited the beautiful island in 1976 and held discussions with Archbishop Makarios, I felt an affinity for the unfortunate plight of its people. To this day, despite a number of United Nations (UN) resolutions calling for a settlement, it remains the artificially divided and occupied country it was then. The situation in Cyprus is a poignant reminder of the need to tackle aggression quickly and decisively, when the sovereignty and the self-determination of a small country is denied by a larger, occupying power. Recent experience in Kuwait has only served to underline this point. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the overwhelming majority of this Parliament, I supported the United Nations resolutions authorising the use of sanctions, and later of force, to restore the sovereignty of Kuwait. I did so because I share the longing for a new world order in which all nations will live under a UN guaranteed peace. If the cherished new world order is to be credible, we must deal with all the lingering disputes which have yet to be solved by the UN. </PARA>
<PARA> One such dispute relates to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. To its great credit, the Turkish Government joined the international efforts to remove Iraq from Kuwait. While we should be grateful for that support, one would hope that the reward for Turkish participation is not allied disregard of the legitimate interests of the people of Cyprus. In the same way, I would hope that the price of Syria's involvement is not an abandonment of the freedom of Lebanon. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not forget that the Cypriot Government of President Vassiliou also endorsed the UN action against Iraq. I am certain that he recognised that in the wake of a settlement of the Gulf crisis there would never be a better opportunity for the UN to deal with other regional problems. I need only quote from a speech by Mr Vassiliou delivered on 17 January this year to emphasise this point. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>With the implementation of these principles the turns of the Cyprus problem will come. Cyprus will no longer be a victim of invasion and occupation and our island will be reunited peacefully. </PARA>
<PARA>It is pleasing to see that he stressed a peaceful solution, for there can be no question of resorting to force in this case. Rather, meaningful negotiations between the leaders of the Greek and Turkish parts of Cyprus are required. Naturally, such negotiations would involve the United Nations and the governments of Turkey and Greece and would have as their eventual aim a new constitution allowing for an end to the partition of Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA> If such negotiations are to be fruitful, Turkey must abide by UN Security Council resolution 649 of 1990 and remove the 40,000 troops that it has on the island. At the same time, I would like to see some action taken to account for the 1,619 people who are still missing as a result of the invasion, and indeed the 200,000 people who are left homeless as a result of the partition. </PARA>
<PARA> If the new world order is to become a reality, these and other issues must be addressed. In the days ahead the question of justice for the Palestinians will inevitably arise. So too must Lebanon and Cyprus. We saw the reunification of Germany in 1990. Let us hope that 1991 sees the reunification of Cyprus. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in the Senate we got an inkling of what might be in store for Australia in the next quarter when the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, indicated that he felt that there might be a negative situation economically for the third quarter in a row here in Australia. That reminds many of us of the dire straits with which this country is faced in regard to its overseas debt crisis, largely created and largely brought about by the present Treasurer (Mr Keating). Of course, it is the wanton activity of the Treasurer of late, when he comes into the House, particularly during Question Time when answering questions put by the Opposition about the plight of many Australians, that he refers back to the Fraser years and likes to quote certain statistics. I thought it would be useful to go back and look at some of those statistics, in particular those on unemployment, because the Government-and particularly the Treasurer-continually quote how much better they are in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we went back and checked the statistics we found that on average the unemployment rate under the last coalition government was 6.2 per cent, and under the present Government it is 7.8 per cent and rising. That is a difference, over a period of seven or eight years-comparing the Fraser years with the Hawke years-of a 25 per cent average per year better record under the coalition Government. In today's terms that means about 150,000 people each year had jobs under the previous coalition Government who would not have jobs under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Referring to the foreign debt, it is interesting to note the percentage increase of 740 per cent that has occurred since 1983. It is this foreign debt that will cause Australia a tremendous amount of heartache in the future unless drastic actions are taken. Yet this blow-out in debt has occurred under the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at something which is pretty close to most people's hearts. For interest rates for bank housing loans, which people take out on a new home or if they want to build a second home or whatever, the average under the coalition Government was 10.2 per cent; and under this present Government it is 14.2 per cent, an increase of 39 per cent on average. That stacks up to hundreds and thousands of dollars for many families over that period, for people actually carrying an average 14.2 per cent interest rate for the last seven years as compared with 10.2 per cent, which was the case under the previous coalition Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Small businesses are going down like ninepins under this recession which we had to have, which was created by this Government; it was brought on deliberately by this Government as a matter of policy, so the Treasurer states. On the trading bank overdraft rate for less than $100,000, the maximum rate on average under the previous coalition Government was 11.4 per cent, and under this Government it is 18.2 per cent-60 per cent higher interest rates on average for small business people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of having beautiful figures, as the Treasurer would suggest to us, in regard to the economics of this country at this stage, they are disastrous figures for many people-for families, for ordinary workers, for businesses, for farmers. And now we are looking down the barrel of a third quarter in which there has been negative growth in this economy. That is absolutely disastrous, and it is this Treasurer who is responsible for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was with great disappointment that I read last week about the most recent military coup in Thailand. I deplore this forced military takeover of a democratically elected government, which is indeed a major setback to Thailand's recent advances towards becoming a democratic society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1932 Thailand's political system has shifted away from an absolute monarchy, has gone through a democracy characterised by clientelism-a system of patronage between bureaucrats and their clients-and fraught with military coups, and it has moved recently towards a more democratic and institutionalised party-political system. The King, of course, has maintained ultimate authority and, it seems, the reverence of his people. </PARA>
<PARA> Chatichai Choonavan was the first democratically elected member of parliament to become the Prime Minister of Thailand, and he became leader of a five-party coalition government after the 1986 elections. He headed a government oriented towards economic development. Chatichai oversaw a rapid growth of Thailand's economy. The economy has recently been growing at about 10 per cent a year, with exports to Japan, Singapore and the United States increasing at about 25 per cent annually, many of them industrially produced goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Manufacturing industry and tourism are the biggest growth sectors, and they have earned Thailand billions of US dollars a year. It is estimated that in 1989 over five million tourists visited the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the military has diminished in the recent past as Thailand has focused on economic rather than military goals. Thailand has forged new trading relations, rather than exclusively military relations, with Cambodia and Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> I have visited Thailand many times since my first visit there in 1966. There is no question but that it has undergone rapid economic change and social dynamic change, unlike its Burmese and Indo-Chinese neighbours who have been isolated or otherwise engaged, and these have largely stagnated. Last November I spent a week there, mostly in Bangkok, and even then military coup rumours were rampant, alongside the boisterous and noisy democratic local elections, which were taking place with all the fanfare of elections that we enjoy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The growth of the manufacturing sector, based heavily on foreign investment-particularly Japanese recently-is very evident in the Bangkok metropolitan area, and it is associated with a very heavy level of pollution. Similarly, the huge tourism industry, which is the country's biggest export earner, has matched very rich visitors with low paid Thai workers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the growth in the economy has not always greatly benefited many of the country's poor people, particularly in rural areas. The inequality between rich and poor has often grown as the manufacturing sector booms, and the economy's dependence on rice farming in particular has declined. </PARA>
<PARA> Environmental damage, particularly in tourism development areas and rain forest logging, has been considerable. These may threaten the long term future of Thai exports. There are also concerns about the development of the infrastructure to match the growing population. In other words, as with rapid economic change, dynamic change and economic growth anywhere in the world, the effects have been mixed, but on balance could be estimated to be beneficial to the great majority of the Thai nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The coup leader, General Sunthorn Kongsompong, has seized on the deficiencies of the Thai economic growth model to criticise the weaknesses of Chatichai's government, and he made ongoing accusations of corruption in the Government and in the bureaucracy, accusations which were probably well founded. It may surprise Westerners that this coup has apparently been well received by the King, and has met with minimal civil unrest. This in no way can justify a military takeover of an elected government, particularly at a time when the United Nations is engaged in the maintenance of self-determination and democratic rights elsewhere. But it is further evidence that the road to democracy and development in Third World countries is one which involves considerable problems. I do not believe we should preach firmly at this new government, but some moral suasion from neighbours and trading partners like Australia may help the ultimate goal of democracy to be realised in Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA> The new military government has promised democratic elections in the near future, and we should at least urge it to carry out and comply with that promise. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1342" SPEAKER="Crean The Hon S.F." NAMEID="DT4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GIPPSLAND">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1),(2) The Government has a strong record in the promotion and funding of research projects which will not only contribute to Australia's economic well-being but also help to reduce environmental impacts associated with energy supply and use. The promotion of renewable energy research has been a feature of this program.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia has a considerable record of research development in the field of solar energy. In the 1970s, for example, CSIRO made a series of advances in solar energy and this technology has been successfully transferred to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA>The National Energy Research Development and Demonstration Program (NERD&amp; Program) was developed by the Government and over the life of the program some $33 million has been allocated for renewable energy research. The majority of these funds have been applied to solar energy research.</PARA>
<PARA>For example Government funding has been provided to Professor Green and his team from the University of NSW to assist in the development of the photovoltaic cells used by the winning entry in the 1990 World Solar Challenge. Since 1978 Professor Green has received grants totalling in excess of $2 million from the National Energy Research Development &amp;Demonstration Program to help develop high efficiency solar cells.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1990 the Government established the Energy Research &amp;Development Corporation to carry forward the work of the NERD&amp; Program. In October 1990 the Corporation announced 55 new energy research grants amounting to $9 million. Of this total more than $2.3 million was allocated for research on renewable energy. These grants include funding for the CSIRO Division of Applied Physics to develop techniques for the development of thin film solar cells based on copper indium diselenide, a new compound semiconductor promising greater efficiency solar cells at lower cost. Research will be directed towards finding new ways of depositing the new semiconductor on large glass panels with all interconnections built in.</PARA>
<PARA>The establishment of the Energy Research and Development Corporation will provide a more flexible and commercially oriented method of funding high priority energy research and promoting research excellence in non-coal energy research. This initiative in conjunction with the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development introduced by the Government provides a package of measures which provide considerable scope for renewable energy research in both the public and private sectors.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The major use for solar power now, and in the near term, appears to be in areas where grid supplied electricity is not available and where electricity generation costs are high by urban standards. Solar photovoltaic power supply systems are being used increasingly to meet the electricity requirements of remote telecommunication repeater stations, navigational aids, water pumps and households. Telecom Australia has in excess of 2 megawatts of photovoltaic systems distributed throughout thousands of telecommunication installations in remote inland regions of the country.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) In Australia conventional coal fired power plants produce base load electricity at a cost of 3 to 5 cents/kWh. Luz claim that their solar thermal/gas hybrid power plants presently produce electricity at a cost of some 10 cents/kWh. The company claims that, by 1994, the cost of electricity produced by updated versions of their power plants could be as low as 8 cents/kWh.</PARA>
<PARA>Solar photovoltaic power plants presently produce electricity at a cost of in excess of 30 cents/kWh. In 1987 the US Department of Energy set a planning target of 8 cents/kWh for photovoltaic plants installed in the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The electricity costs referred to in (4) include capital costs, operating and maintenance costs and fuel costs (where applicable).</PARA>
<PARA> (6),(7),(8) The Department of Primary Industries and Energy have assessed the economics of the Luz Solar power plants as used in southern California. As can be seen from the answer to question (4), the Luz plants are clearly not cost competitive with base load coal fired power plants and appear unlikely to be so in the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA>In California, Luz plants are used to meet peak loads and, as a result, their value to the utility is somewhat higher than as a source of base load electricity. Although the plants appear to be commercially viable, the overall economics of the solar component are not clear because of a complex series of pricing and taxation arrangements and the use of gas to provide up to 25% of the total output.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) Chart A (below) provides details of the numbers and locations of ABC staff.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) (a) There are 589 ABC staff involved in administrative and management roles (10.7% of total staff).</PARA>

<PARA> The answer to each and every part of the question is `No'.</PARA>
<PARA> Allegations of interference were made in an article in the Australian on 7 November 1990, in relation to the establishment of a Centre for Education and Training on Addictions as part of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse.</PARA>
<PARA> Following that newspaper report, the Australian Research Council at its November meeting agreed to write to the editor refuting the allegations. The letter, published on 21 November 1990 stated, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council would like to reiterate that the decision to establish a Centre for Education and Training on Addictions to be funded from within the special research assistance program of the Employment, Education and Training portfolio was made by Cabinet, and followed a recommendation of the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy. Indeed, the decision by Cabinet to support a program of training in this field well pre-dated the establishment of the Council.</PARA>
<PARA> The Council would further wish to emphasise that it is unaware of having been given any directions from the Minister outside those provided under the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988, that is by way of formal references. Indeed, the reality is the reverse of the impression conveyed by your article.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) now has responsibility for marine examinations which were formerly the responsibility of the Department of Transport and Communications.</PARA>
<PARA>I am advised by the Authority that marine examiners are cognisant of the latest advances in their field. Existing procedures for ensuring that marine examiners are cognisant with the latest advances in their field include research into modern developments abroad, participation in seminars, workshops and formal training programs. Marine examiners maintain regular contact with operational aspects of the industry through inspections of relevant ships, survey work on Australian vessels and membership of professional organisations. Examiner conferences are held regularly.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) The oral examination of seafarers is a responsibility of AMSA. Written examinations are the responsibility of tertiary educational institutions which conduct courses approved and audited by the Authority as meeting the formal requirements for particular marine qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA>I am advised by the Authority that oral examinations, the final stage in the assessment of a candidate's competency, are conducted on a one-to-one basis within a broad format based on the various aspects of knowledge and skill set out in the detailed requirements for each grade of certificate. Head Office examiners regularly audit the conduct of oral examinations at each examination centre. As Australian seafarers must serve on ships with a wide range of technologies, examinations necessarily include questions covering such material. Courses and their assessment (including oral examinations) are amongst the topics regularly discussed with the industry in standing consultative bodies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I have caused the earlier search to be extended to include the most recently published volume of the Australian Law Reports, namely Volume 96. The Australian Law Reports contain reports of cases not only in the High Court and Federal Court but also in State Supreme Courts exercising federal jurisdiction. They do not contain reports of all decisions of State Supreme Courts, but cases in which the Commonwealth is a party are in federal jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA>The search did not identify any case meeting the description in the honourable member's question additional to those referred to in my answer to the previous question. I can, however, add a reference to a case argued but not yet decided, namely, Re Commonwealth and Nolan; Ex parte Young (High Court, heard 4 December 1990, judgment reserved; Queensland and South Australian Attorneys-General intervening). I cannot, however, give any assurance that the search conducted has resulted in information that is exhaustive of the class of cases specified in the question.</PARA>
