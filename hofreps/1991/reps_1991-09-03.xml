<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There were two things in my mind about responding to the data coming forward connected with the whole question of interest rates. The first was that I was not going to overreact to one month's figures and that what I would take into account was accumulated evidence. The second was that I was intent on making sure that due process occurred. So let me talk first of all about the timing of this cut. It is 3 1/2 months since the last cut in interest rates and it is at the time when we have had the first meeting of the Reserve Bank since the release of the June quarter CPI and national accounts, and since the Budget. As honourable members know, the bank does not meet in August. The decision was announced quickly after the meeting, because of a bond tender to close today at 12.30, a bond tender worth $1.5 billion. So it would have been unfair if we had not taken the decision as soon as the board had met.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Interest rates will be set by this Government with an eye to both inflation and economic activity in a medium term framework. Looking at the figures, particularly in respect of inflation: the June quarter CPI underlying rate and surveys of inflationary expectations since the last cut in May all show significant improvement. I have attached to my press release today a graph showing this. Australia is now in the low inflation league and the Government remains committed to holding that position.</PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, if I can talk about activity and recovery, there are signs that a recovery in lending and activity in the housing sector is under way, but real interest rates remain relatively high and confidence remains subdued in many areas of the business sector, and investment plans are weak. This decision will give a clear boost to business confidence.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="476" SPEAKER="Kerin The Hon J.C." NAMEID="QH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WERRIWA" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. As I said in answer to a previous question, the Government remains committed to low inflation. What we have now in prospect through 1991-92, due to many decisions of the Government, is a consumer price index figure estimated to be of the order of 3 per cent. The estimated CPI figure for the two years to June 1992 will be the lowest for any two-year period since the late 1960s. In terms of other estimates, going back from June 1991, we have a performance certainly going back to the early 1970s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Since the interest rates cut in May, the CPI and the surveys of business and consumer confidence have shown significant decline in the underlying rate of inflation and inflationary expectations. The economy is set for recovery in 1991-92 but, as I have said on many occasions, it is an appropriately modest recovery. Fiscal policy is firm. Business confidence is improving, but subdued. Real interest rates remain relatively high. The interest rate cut will not threaten the inflation outlook by overheating the economy. The outlook for 1992-93 is also safeguarded by the agreement with the ACTU to achieve wage outcomes consistent with the inflation rates of our major trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA>  To reiterate, the Government remains committed to low inflation because it means fewer inequities for lower income groups, reduced distortions to investment decisions, less uncertainty for business and, hence, better prospects for employment and a fairer Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have responsibility for setting interest rates. As is customary, I have consulted the Prime Minister on my decision and he has supported it. I will reiterate what I just said a moment ago. Decisions will be taken not on the basis of one month's figures, but on the basis of accumulated and relevant evidence. I took the advice of the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose Board met today. It recommended a one percentage point fall in cash rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  A month ago, many expected a fall in cash rates. It did not occur--again because I took the advice of the Reserve Bank. As honourable members are well aware, I receive advice from the Treasury as well as from the Reserve Bank and, on the basis of all that advice, the decision was quite clear. The Governor advised me this morning that the Reserve Bank Board was very firmly in favour of a one per cent drop in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>  In terms of the first part of the honourable gentleman's question, the answer to that is quite clearly no. The Reserve Bank quite clearly agrees with me. The inflationary expectations have declined since mid-May and, as I said in response to an earlier question, the recovery in prospect will be moderate. There is no concern about inflation getting out of hand. This is all on track.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="477" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Let me say firstly of the Government's budgetary strategy that, as the honourable member understands, I believe, it is designed to underpin economic recovery. The task of Government at the present, which I think is understood by most analysts and commentators, is to shape the economic recovery to ensure that it is a sustainable recovery. We have to do that by absolutely locking into our system the historic breakthrough against inflation that we have secured. I believe that the honourable gentleman who has asked me the question will share with me an understanding of the historic nature of that inflationary achievement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We really now have, for the first time in a very long period, a position where our rate of inflation in this country is lower than that of our major trading partners, and we have to conduct our policy in a way which locks that in. I think the honourable gentleman understands that we also want to make sure that we get further gains in Australia's balance of payments situation. Quite clearly, the strategy of the Government meets those two objectives in a way that we believe will provide for the resumption of sustainable job growth in this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>  At the same time as we have set those objectives and put in place the policies to achieve them in the economic sphere, as we always have, we have in the Budget sought to advance the Government's social justice strategy through the measures which I know that the honourable gentleman who has asked the question is aware of: the families package to assist low to moderate income families, which will directly benefit some 109,000 families around the country; the introduction--and I know the honourable gentleman has a particular interest in this area through his previous portfolio commitments--of legislated superannuation, which is another very important part of locking in the social justice strategy of this Government; and also the measures that we are taking to improve the places where Australians live and work.</PARA>
<PARA>  By way of contrast, the Opposition's Budget strategy is, as we have seen in this place, merely empty rhetoric, with no details provided, no substance whatsoever. That is what the Leader of the Opposition indulged in during the Budget week:  total rhetoric, no substance, no details whatsoever. The Leader of the Opposition claims that we should have made further expenditure cuts. The Opposition has been talking of expenditure cuts of the order of $3 billion, and then has the temerity to suggest that in the context of further substantial expenditure cuts more jobs would be created. The Leader of the Opposition knows that that is an absolute nonsense. It is about time he accepted the challenge which has been put to him--not just the challenge by myself and by the Government, but the challenge which is being increasingly heard around this country--to explain where he will make the cuts. Where will those $3 billion worth of cuts be made?  It is time that the Leader of the Opposition and those behind him were heard.</PARA>

Increasingly, around the country, calls are being heard for the Leader of the Opposition to explain how he will eradicate inflation. How is he going to eradicate inflation with a wages free-for-all and a consumption tax?  It is an impossibility, and he knows it. The only way that can happen, if he does those things, is with a massive increase in unemployment. He should explain, in this context, why in January 1990 he argued against a reduction in interest rates. In January 1990, when we made the decision to reduce interest rates, we were attacked by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition should also explain the Opposition's policy in regard to superannuation. How is he going to provide a satisfactory retirement income policy for the people of this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is directed to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. What are the trends for building approvals, and what is the likely impact of approvals and construction on employment?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="479" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; HEALTH, HOUSING AND COMMUNITY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Dwelling approvals for July 1991 show that the housing industry is certainly moving into a recovery phase. That view is supported by trend estimates which show a continuing steady growth in approvals beginning in January this year. The July dwelling approval figures are consistent with the Indicative Planning Council's April 1991 short term prospects report which forecast a gradual turnaround in building activity in the September quarter of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The building industry is a leading indicator of economic activity. Increased activity in the building industry is an indication of increased activity in the rest of the economy. Increased employment in the building industry has a substantial multiplier effect on employment in other sectors. It is accepted that every job in the construction industry has a spin-off of 1 1/2 jobs in related areas. The IPC has forecast that housing commencements in 1991-92 will increase by 13 per cent over last year, to 135,000. The further reduction of one per cent in interest rates announced by my colleague the Treasurer will reinforce this gradual pick-up of activity in the housing sector and across the economy this year. Australia will then see economic growth this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>  I remind honourable members of the fact that the Government, in March of this year, brought forward $840m of Commonwealth funding under the Commonwealth-State housing agreement so that activity could be increased in that sector within the first half of the financial year. For every dollar the public sector invests in housing we gain more than a dollar in tax and unemployment benefit savings. The Government's approach, as we see the beginnings, particularly around the housing industry, of sustainable recovery in line with the forecasts of the Indicative Planning Council, is to ensure that that recovery is effectively shaped. This Budget demonstrates our commitment this year to achieve micro-economic reform and investment that will pay off in increased efficiency and increased employment.</PARA>
<PARA>  For example, as part of the Budget we announced the National Rail Corporation, which will operate commercially at a standard consistent with best international practice. Over the decade the National Rail Corporation will develop an investment program of $1.7 billion to improve the operational efficiency of track and rolling stock. The Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victorian and Western Australian governments will contribute over $400m in equity for the Corporation. This is a national partnership. It will be completely self-supporting after five years.</PARA>
<PARA>  I go to these issues because the question of micro-economic reform is more than simply sloganeering; it is more than coming into the House and talking about privatisation; it is more than reciting the way that we would cut a Budget deficit and at the same time miraculously, against all economic logic, increase employment. It is about thinking for the longer term, it is about investment and it is about working with the States, of which we hear so much from the honourable member opposite, and so little of substance.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for Phillip for her important question. I believe that it is essential that heads of government take a leading role in examining what more can be done to reduce violence in our society, including within that examination a common and a comprehensive approach to gun ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Obviously, yet another terrible tragedy, this time in Sydney, has highlighted, not just I believe in Sydney and New South Wales but around this country, the issue of guns and violence. While the issue of gun control is, as the honourable member understands, one which is primarily a matter for the States and the Territories, the Commonwealth, as I think she will know, has played an active role in encouraging them to take a uniform and a tougher approach to the possession of firearms in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>  I think the honourable member will recall that following the Hoddle Street and Queen Street shootings in Victoria, the Commonwealth convened a national gun summit which led to the establishment of a national committee on violence. The recommendations of the committee, which were tabled in Parliament on 20 December last, were, as I think the honourable member knows, wide ranging and they included a number of proposals for gun control.</PARA>
<PARA>  To assist in controlling possession of firearms, the Commonwealth amended the customs import regulations in December of last year making military-style weapons a prohibited import. Clearly though, having said that, I emphasise that there is a need to examine what more can be done. I have therefore written, I am pleased to tell the honourable member, to all Premiers and Chief Ministers suggesting that the opportunity be taken at the Special Premiers Conference in November of this year to discuss the wider issue of government action to address violence in the Australian community, as well as, within that context, focusing on the particular issue of national gun control.</PARA>
<PARA>  I have asked the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) to examine a wide range of issues dealing with the question of violence in Australia and to report to me on the scope for any further Commonwealth action, including any matters which the Commonwealth may seek to raise with the other governments--that is, the governments of the States and the Territories--at that Special Premiers Conference in November.</PARA>
<PARA>  I would also inform the honourable member that I have sought from relevant Commonwealth Ministers a report on the scope for effective community education initiatives in relation to violence, drugs, domestic violence and child abuse. I say to the honourable member that I expect that through those initiatives the November Special Premiers Conference will provide indeed a major focus for substantive discussion and decision making in an area which I know is of genuine concern to all Australians and I am sure to all honourable members in this place.</PARA>
<PARA>  I think we have to face up to the fact--and I am not involved in allocating any blame on any side of politics--that considerations of electoral repercussions and so on have been intruded into this issue. I think people on all sides of politics perhaps have been reluctant to face up to what I believe are the undoubted responsibilities that we all have as legislators to deal with what, unfortunately, is becoming an increasing phenomenon in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>  I think the honourable member will appreciate that I have put this particular question of gun control within the wider context of increasing violence within our community. It has many manifestations. We should not delude ourselves by believing that the dramatic manifestation in terms of shootings of the sort that we have seen recently is the only problem. It is, unfortunately, a very dramatic and tragic manifestation of a wider problem. I think we all have a responsibility to face up to it. I am very confident that the Premiers across the political spectrum will join with us in that initiative that they have undertaken for the November conference to deal with what is truly a major national concern.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Australia's language is important to the development of Australia as a nation. Australia's language is also important to the citizens of Australia in terms of their access to jobs, education and training opportunities and their participation in the broader life of the nation. It was with these issues in mind that last year the Government released a Green Paper--which was not intended to be, nor was it, a prescriptive document, but, rather, a document which was full of options and possibilities--which was then reviewed in the context of the responses which were forthcoming from a broad range of interests and individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I am delighted to say that, as a result of the Government's consideration of those responses, the Government was able to finalise a White Paper--a policy paper--which has now been released, announced and supported with significant additional funding in the context of this Budget. It will see an increase of $100m over the next three years, lifting the amount spent in this area from about $230m to about $330m. It will concentrate on trying to improve English language skills amongst Australians, particularly those adults--perhaps a million adults--who do not, at the moment, have effective reading and writing skills in English.</PARA>
<PARA>  The increase will see a near trebling of funds for adult literacy. It will also, in the portfolio of my colleague the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, see a significant increase in the funding for the adult migrant education program to ensure that new arrivals to this country who do not speak, read or write English will have an opportunity to do so.</PARA>
<PARA>  It also concentrates on the school system. I am indebted for the cooperation we have received from the State Ministers to ensure that there is a better assessment of literacy skills amongst kids in primary school-- particularly as they reach the end of primary school--so that we cannot only measure the skills of kids at the end of primary school, but also identify those kids who have difficulties and take remedial action with them.</PARA>
<PARA>  This policy also makes the point that for Australia's participation in the world community--both as a major trading nation and as a major participant in the Asia-Pacific region--we need to do much more about second language learning in Australia. It is for that reason that we have set about policies which have seen the writing of a curriculum for foreign language learning in Australian schools and now a new incentive scheme to encourage the learning of second languages up to year 12. This will mean that, between now and the turn of the century, there should be an additional 150,000 young people studying a second language at secondary school.</PARA>
<PARA>  I have been encouraged by the initial responses to the policy paper, except those from two areas. One of those was from the Opposition and one was from Mr Heinrich Stefanik, who has been persisting in his particular view that this policy does not represent a balanced approach to language policy. Mr Stefanik has pursued this particular objective, notwithstanding the fact that the Government has taken account of what he and some other members of the ethnic communities have said. The Government has not only expanded funding of the ethnic schools program, but also given quite specific encouragement to second language learning.</PARA>
<PARA>  In relation to the Opposition's comments, there are about 10 separate criticisms that the honourable member for Goldstein has made of the policy. All I can say is that for someone who rather prides himself on his skills as a former academic--especially bearing in mind that this was a policy on literacy and language--he only rates about a two out of 10 in terms of his comprehension skills in relation to his ability to read and understand this policy paper. Each of his criticisms is either wrong or is a total misrepresentation of what is included in this paper.</PARA>
<PARA>  If the honourable member for Goldstein wants to appreciate what the Government is saying, then he ought to read not just the policy paper of 25 pages--which may in itself be a major task for him--but also the additional 125 pages that went with the companion document. There lie most of the answers to his criticisms and there lies a very splendid justification for the policies which the Government has now embraced.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As I was saying, had we taken the approach that the Opposition wants to take, that is, to have a discretionary tightening of fiscal policy there would have been a further contraction of demand--indeed, on the Opposition's basis, a contraction of demand of about one per cent of GDP--which would have reduced the level of economic activity even further, pushed us deeper into recession, caused more unemployment and delayed recovery even longer. We rejected that approach for that reason. In doing so, we were supported by the OECD, which, when talking about this specific issue in its economic outlook for July of this year, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>As a general rule, discretionary spending and tax measures aimed at offsetting the influences of automatic stabilisers during a period of low growth would be undesirable for several reasons. First, discretionary tightening during a recession could substantially raise the costs of the economic downturn by further contracting aggregate demand.</PARA>
<PARA>That was precisely the reason why we did not do it. If we had followed the Opposition's advice, we would have got the outcome that the OECD is pointing to.</PARA>
<PARA>  The first point I make about the Opposition's approach is that it is an approach which would push us into higher levels of unemployment and deeper recession. Any benefits we got through a loosening of monetary policy, following the tightening of fiscal policy, would--we have seen various examples of this in recent years--have their effect down the track at least a year away because of the delays that are occurring in the impact on economic activity of monetary policy. Secondly, it is an absurdity to say that the fiscal depression would be offset by stimulus coming from a further loosening of monetary policy. That would have its effect--if it had that effect--eventually somewhere down the track, not now.</PARA>
<PARA>  Thirdly, what flows from the Opposition's approach to this Budget is that it is saying that it is against any new expenditure at all. It opposes anything that is in the Budget, anything in the way of new policy expenditure. So it opposes any increased assistance through the family allowance supplement scheme, for instance, for 200,000 low income families. It is against any increase in labour market programs for the unemployed. It is against any expansion of higher education places, improvements in Austudy or funds for literacy and language programs that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training was just discussing. It is against additional funds for science and funds for the National Rail Corporation. It is simply against any new policy approach. It is essentially saying that it does not want to do anything to improve our infrastructure, to enhance our status as a clever country or to improve social justice. It does not want to do anything of that kind; it has no new policy.</PARA>
<PARA>  In respect of the revenue side of the Budget, the Opposition is saying that it is against the tax cuts which are already in place. It wants us to legislate to remove them and also not to go ahead with those that were announced in the March economic statement. That $2 billion, which the Leader of the Opposition derided as revenue give-aways, included $1,100m of income tax cuts that have been in place since January. Their full year effect was $1,100m this financial year. It says that we should repeal that legislation and repeal those tax cuts. In all sorts of other debates it says that it is in favour of lowering income tax. It is simply in a state of total confusion on that issue.</PARA>
<PARA>  In relation to the $200m removal of sales tax on business inputs, which was announced in the March economic statement, which is part of that $2 billion, the Opposition says that that should go. It does not support that because it is a revenue give-away and we should not have gone ahead with it. The Leader of the Opposition said it in his press release and in his statement in the House. He is sitting there trying to laugh but he is totally confused. Another $100m of this $2 billion of revenue give-aways comes from tariff cuts. Is the Opposition against the tariff cuts?  It usually says to us that we should go even further on tariff cuts. Now it is saying that we should not lose the $100m on tariff cuts and we should not have any revenue give-aways.</PARA>
<PARA>  The real lulu of them all--the Leader of the National Party should be really interested in this one--is that $450m of the $2 billion represents a reduction in the wool tax. The Leader of the Opposition is saying to the nation that this $450m reduction in the wool tax from 25 per cent to 12 per cent should not have happened, and we should have kept that tax at 25 per cent on the farmers.</PARA>
<PARA>  Is that the position of the National Party? Is that the position of the Opposition? Those opposite are absolutely in total confusion about their Budget response. `We have no idea', is what they are saying. They are totally negative.

<PARA>  Mr Fife--Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I refer to a question that was put to you just a few moments ago by the honourable member for Gilmore. In an offhanded way you said that we should not believe all that we read in the newspapers. The question was whether you would confirm or otherwise that report. I submit to you that, if you confirm that the report is accurate, there was a breach of the Standing Orders. You will recall that I raised a matter of a similar nature in March this year, and after due consideration you came back into the House and withdrew what you had said--in other words, a reflection on a member of this House by you outside of the House. I think that in the interests of Standing Orders and in the interests of the position that you hold you should indicate clearly whether or not the report is correct.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On 22 August 1991, the House agreed to the appointment of a select committee to inquire into certain matters relating to the print media. Later that day nominations of Government and Opposition members were received by me from the Government and the Opposition Whips, and I understand that the Committee then met, elected a chairman and transacted other business. The nominations were reported to the House that evening. Subsequent to the meeting of the Committee and the announcement of nominations to the House, I received a letter from the honourable member for North Sydney nominating himself to serve on the Committee. The honourable member later withdrew his nomination in the interests of not holding up the work of the Committee. However, this experience has demonstrated uncertainty in sessional order 28B relating to the nomination of members to serve on a committee. The Clerk has drafted an amendment designed to remove the uncertainty and I have no doubt that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) will be looking at the matter and the desirability of amending the sessional order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There would be no doubt in the minds of people who care about the state of Australia in 1991 that the most serious social, political and economic challenge which faces this country is in fact the problem of the growing number of long term unemployed people. I want to start the debate by asserting something that I hope those on the Government benches would accept as absolutely self-evidently true, that is, that no side of politics in this country has anything approaching a monopoly of concern or compassion about people in the Australian community who are less fortunate than the 90 per cent of us who happen to have jobs at present. If we are ever to have an intelligent debate about the long term unemployed in this country, it is beholden on both sides of politics to put aside the cant and hypocrisy, which is so often found in debates on this subject, that in some way there is no care at all on one side and on the other side there is a total monopoly of concern and compassion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I have to say--echoing the words of the Leader of the Opposition in his reply to the Budget two weeks ago--that the crown prince of hypocrisy on the subject of unemployment is none other than the current temporary Prime Minister of this country. Let me illustrate, by reference to the history of politics in the 1980s and the 1990s, the very point that I make. There is something strangely ironic about the fact that the last time when there was high unemployment in Australia was in the early 1980s, and on that occasion the preoccupation of the honourable member for Wills, who is the present Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Hawke), was not with finding a solution to the problem; his preoccupation on that occasion was with conspiring with some of his colleagues to get the job that he now has. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is ironic that eight or nine years later, in the face of a worse long term unemployment situation, he is not worried about finding a solution to the problem; he is conspiring with different colleagues to desperately hang onto the job he got 8 1/2 years ago. That is the measure of this man who parades, with emotion laden hysteria, his concern and his compassion about the unemployed in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The truth is that there is a deep-seated problem with the long term unemployed in Australia. It is not totally an economic phenomenon; it is as much a product of the disintegration of the strength of family life and the strength of the stabilisers of our society that existed in earlier years as it is the product of a temporary economic phenomenon. Anybody who wants to find out why might look at a graph that illustrates what has happened with the long term unemployed in this country. If we go back to the middle of the 1950s, we had virtually no unemployed at all. Those were the dreadful Rip Van Winkle years, the years in which Menzies and McEwen laid waste the future of this country, if we listen to the absurd rantings of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), the former Treasurer, and of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), who is at the table. We had virtually no unemployment at that particular time, and since then we have had a very disturbing process. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the early 1970s, after the oil shock and the inappropriate domestic policies of the Whitlam Government, we had our first postwar experience of significant unemployment in this country, and we have never been able to return to the pre-1970 days. If we are honest about the future we would have to acknowledge that the prospects of returning to the days of 2 per cent or 3 per cent unemployment are not within our grasp at present, and they are unlikely to be within our grasp within the parliamentary experience of probably anybody now sitting on either side of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  The problem we now face is that there is, within our community, a group of people born into unemployment, who will live their lives in unemployment and who will mother and father children who will pass through the same cycle and the same pattern. It challenges policy makers on both sides of the Parliament with an enormous dilemma. </PARA>
<PARA>  In all the time I have been in politics I have never encountered a period in which there is more deep-seated, fundamental worry about job security than I find at present as I move around Australia. I do not gainsay the fact that there was unemployment in the early 1980s, the fact that there was unemployment during the time that I was Treasurer of Australia or the fact that some of the policies that were applied at that particular time were not appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>  But I do assert to this Parliament that we will never come to grips with the problem of long term unemployment unless we understand that the forces that have produced it are as much social as they are economic. One of the things we have to learn from the experience of the last 20 or 30 years is that the disintegration of some of the stabilisers of our society have played a very significant role in bringing about that very high level of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important to remember the respective attitudes that have been taken on different sides of the Parliament on the issue of unemployment. I can remember the days when the Labor Party accused those of us on this side of the House of pursuing a policy of fighting inflation first. I can remember Neville Wran going to the economic summit and saying that there were three challenges facing Australia--jobs, jobs and jobs. The very policies that back in the 1970s and early 1980s were derided by those who now sit on the Government benches are now embraced to excuse the fact that a party that all its political life has professed its concern for the working men and women of Australia has presided over the most dismal job scene since the end of World War II. </PARA>
<PARA>  Is it not ironic that the former Treasurer should seek to parade his credentials as the alternative Prime Minister of Australia under the cover of alleging to the Australian community that in some way he has a superior remedy for the problem than the current occupant of the position? I find that very strange indeed. Both of them stand guilty as the co-conspirators of the almost one million unemployed that we now have in this country. The former Treasurer should remember his passionate attack on George Campbell of the Metal Workers Union at the 1986 ALP Conference when he said, `George, you have 100,000 dead men hanging around your neck'. They were the 100,000 people who lost their jobs in the metal industry in the early 1980s.  The former Treasurer of this country has done much better than George; he has a million dead men hanging around his neck. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that the judgment of the Australian people will be as harsh on that man if he ever achieves the position of Prime Minister of this country as it deservedly is on the current Prime Minister. Their crime is all the greater because they paraded their unique compassion and concern for the unemployed. They alone, we were told year after year, had a place in their political hearts for the unemployed that could not be found in the hearts of those on this side of the House. They alone, because of what has happened, have been revealed for being monumental political and social hypocrites. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no simple solution to the problems of either short or long term unemployment in this country. We do not create jobs by throwing money at training schemes. We do not create jobs by throwing money at artificial job creation schemes. The only sure way that jobs in this country can be created is through the adoption and pursuit of economic policies that bring about renewed levels of economic growth and hence the generation of jobs in the private sector of our community. There is no other way to create jobs. If all those people gathering in the left wing of the Labor Party imagine that they can create jobs by some revival of some of the schemes that were tried in the 1970s, then they are badly mistaken. </PARA>
<PARA>  The problem is even greater now because of the disappearance of an enormous number of unskilled jobs in our community during the 1980s. Many of those jobs have disappeared forever. The only real solution to the unemployment problem in Australia is to adopt those policies which are more likely than those now in place to bring about a fundamental restructuring of the Australian economy and a fundamental regeneration of growth in our community. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members opposite may sneer and deride us for talking about the challenge of micro-economic reform. When they do that, why do they not reflect for a moment on the wasted years of the 1980s in the area of micro-economic reform? Just imagine where we might now be if we had seriously started to reform the waterfront back in 1984 or 1985. Just imagine where we might now be if, when we in the Liberal and National parties embraced privatisation, we had privatised some of the great national commercial undertakings of this country. Instead of having to sell into a nightmare of a market we would have been selling into a more buoyant and optimistic market in the middle 1980s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Government members alone carry the political responsibility for having, out of sheer political expediency and opportunism, taken a cheap political point--for having scored a fast political point against the Opposition. In the process, of course, they wasted valuable years of economic reconstruction for this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  By way of interjection, my colleague the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) quite properly asked where we might have been if we had picked up the decision, announced by the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) when he was the Minister for Aviation in the Fraser Government, to construct a third runway back in 1982. Here we are almost nine years later and we still do not have the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford- Smith) Airport. We are still witnessing the most unholy factional row inside the Labor Party. The thugs of the New South Wales Right, the Sussex Street thugs, are falling out with each other as to whether or not the third runway should be constructed; it is another example of the wasted opportunities and the wasted years of the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA>  What makes what this Government has done so criminally irresponsible, in a political sense, is that all along it has known the right thing to do. It is one thing to be invincibly ignorant about the correct economic prescription; it is an infinitely more culpable thing to know what the right thing is and to consciously eschew that course of action in the name of political expediency and political opportunism. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is what this Government has done through the 1980s, and one of the reasons we now face such a bleak outlook for unemployment is that the fundamental infrastructure of the Australian economy is so uncompetitive and so unproductive that the job generation opportunities that might otherwise have been made available if the Government had not chosen political expediency over economic responsibility do not exist. That is why as we go into the 1990s, and while the problem of the long term unemployed of this country remains with us, we might remind ourselves again and again of that political expediency and of those failed economic opportunities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) attempted once again to beguile us with a mixture of fair-minded reason and political vitriol. He flip-flopped from one to the other as he tried to suck his audience in by his apparently reasonable approach, but then, just when one was least expecting it, he whipped in a censorious accusation, totally fallacious, about the political conduct of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I will refer to his first point by way of an example. He mentioned the alleged hypocrisy of the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), on the question of employment. I remind the honourable member that the reason why he is so sensitive to the observations of the Prime Minister is that it was the Prime Minister who revealed the holes in his Budget in relation to the estimation of expenditure on unemployment benefit. It was the honourable member for Wills, as he then was, an Opposition spokesman on employment, who revealed one of the large holes in one of the Howard Budgets which meant that the figures simply did not add up. The then Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong, was trying to mislead the Australian people on the extent of the forthcoming amount of unemployment and the expenditure necessary to meet the cost of that unemployment. That is why the honourable member for Bennelong is so sensitive and remembers so vividly what the Prime Minister said back in the early 1980s. He has a memory of the damage which the honourable member for Wills then did to him in relation to the shortcomings of his own Budgets. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Bennelong then invited us to make a facile, puerile comparison between unemployment rates in the 1950s and unemployment rates in the 1970s, 1980s and possibly the 1990s. What he suggested, although he did not say it because he knows that it would be totally ludicrous to do so, is that if only the Government was pursuing the policies of Menzies then Australia would have unemployment rates of around 2 per cent and 3 per cent. The honourable member for Bennelong knows that that is wrong, but he cannot resist the temptation to hark back to those days of the early 1950s, those days that he considers to be the golden age, those days that now are recalled through those sepia coloured photographs in their old leather frames, which all Liberals think hold the real answer not only to Australia's past but also to its future. </PARA>
<PARA>  How hypocritical--to use the honourable member for Bennelong's terms--can he be when he says that those are the policies which we require today? The point frequently made by the former Treasurer, by me, and by anyone else with an inkling of insight, is that the policies that were pursued for so long and so stupidly in the 1950s and 1960s are exactly the same as the policies which have prolonged Australia's difficulties now and have prevented us from rapidly turning this economy into one which is competitive and able to stand up with the rest of the modern economies. In other words, through the 1950s and 1960s we stayed still, and finally the rest of the world caught up with us. By the time the Liberal Party woke up, of course, the rest of the world had streaked past us and had records of economic performance far better than ours. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government has been trying to make up for the deficiencies of those long Liberal years in which the Liberal Party would not take any sensible or hard decisions. Well might the honourable member for Bennelong say, `What a crime it is to know what is the right thing to do but then not to do it'. He sat there for years in a Liberal-Country Party Cabinet, arguing for the right policies in some cases but always being overruled by the bucolic majority of farmers in either the Liberal Party or the Country Party. He frequently knew what was the right thing to do, yet he could never persuade a majority of that Cabinet to do it. He is the one who stands condemned for policy lethargy and policy indolence in relation to this matter. In the short eight years that this Government has been in office it has been like greased lightning compared with any Liberal-Country Party government in a comparable period. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member invites us to stick with facts and to stick with some reasonable approach. He invites an absence of hysteria in this matter. I invite the honourable member for Bennelong, if he can extract himself from his hyperbole and his censorious lecturing, to consider for a moment a couple of important changes which have occurred in the last eight years, and to consider for a moment the change in the participation rate and what now would be the level of unemployment if the participation rate remained as it was when he was in office. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am not looking to the participation rate as an alibi for the high levels of unemployment at the moment. What I am asking the honourable member for Bennelong to acknowledge is that, because the participation rate has gone up, there are far more people actually in work than there would have been in any comparable situation back in the early 1980s. In other words, we have created about 1.3 million jobs. Earlier we had created over 1 1/2 million jobs. Some of that advance has been lost; nevertheless, he cannot deny that there has been a very significant change in relation to the labour market at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA>  I ask the honourable member for Bennelong to consider for a moment the participation rate in education and training and the enormous contribution that that is making to improving the skills of the future work force in this country. I ask him to consider the fact that there are an additional 150,000 young people in years 11 and 12, that there are an additional 200,000 people in our universities, that there are increased numbers in our TAFE colleges and so on. All these are monumental changes in past practice in Australia and in educational and training participation rates. Surely the honourable member could at least give an acknowledgment to those kinds of changes. But all he can do is say that this Government has been a failure, that it has been a failure because it has not adopted the policies necessary to achieve higher levels of employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Bennelong says that we are now embracing his policies of fighting inflation first. I invite the honourable member to consider just for a moment that, although he thinks his policies were fighting inflation first, he was able to produce an historic quinella in Australia--not only was he able to achieve 10 per cent unemployment; he was able to achieve simultaneously 10 per cent inflation. So, if he will excuse members of the Government, we will not own up to pursuing the honourable member's policies if they are the consequences of those policies. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, it is sensible for us to pursue a policy of low inflation, especially when we have been able to reduce it to 3 1/2 per cent and maybe have in prospect lower levels. These are inflation rates which the honourable member for Bennelong could only dream about when he was Treasurer during those long and barren seven years. So there has been a sea change in terms of Government policies and attitude in relation to unemployment, employment policy and inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will relate one of the honourable member's more ridiculous `if only this, if only that' observations. He said, `If only we had adopted the policy of the former Minister for Aviation, Mr Fife, when he proposed that there should be a third runway at Sydney Airport'. The honourable member for Bennelong knows that that proposal and the current proposal are light years apart. That earlier close-coupled parallel runway was going to achieve a minuscule increase in the capacity of Sydney Airport, whereas the proposal which we are now trying to pursue will lead to a great increase. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is a problem with the honourable member in relation to micro-economic change. He thinks that any sort of micro- economic change will be good enough, whereas we are trying to achieve real change. What is the point of having a third runway at Sydney unless the fundamental objective of allowing more planes to land and take off is achieved and, therefore, there is a greater throughput of passengers? This is the kind of flippant, frequently unchallenged nonsense that the honourable member for Bennelong goes on with. It is about time a few people woke up to what he is really about. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Bennelong is essentially a vacuous man; he is essentially a man who is trying passionately to rewrite history based on his own manifest failures when he was Treasurer of this country. He says the Government is engaging in hypocrisy and that members of the Government are the ones with no compassion for the unemployed. I will make a couple of points in that regard. It was the Opposition and not the Government which last week decided to unveil a political campaign about trying to take advantage of the unemployment situation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition talks about one million Australians not working. Let me remind Australians where this saying comes from. It is a direct pinch from Mrs Thatcher's 1978 campaign when she used exactly the same slogan to attack the then British Labour Government. She said that one million Britons were not working. I will tell the House what happened five years later. After Britain had had a few years of Tory Thatcher conservative government, Mrs Thatcher had managed the amazing feat of trebling the unemployment figure. She had gone from one million people to three million people unemployed. So I think that at the root of this simplistic campaign--which is quite hypocritical and, in a sense, a scandalous campaign of the Opposition--there is a grain of truth. The Opposition has proposed to follow, as religiously as it can, the footsteps of its icon--Mrs Thatcher. </PARA>
<PARA>  What the Opposition wants to achieve, and is likely to achieve, is three million people unemployed--just as Mrs Thatcher did in probably fewer years. If we look through the rhetoric and what we know of the policy of the Opposition, we can see that it has tried to mirror the policies of the Thatcher Government. We know that the result here will be as it was in Britain--not only a devastation of the employment situation, but also a massive devastation of the social fabric of Britain. The same thing will happen in Australia, if ever the Opposition gets the chance. </PARA>
<PARA>  How appalling it is to have the honourable member for Bennelong bemoaning the loss of the social stabilisers in Australia, these stabilisers which somehow kept the fabric of Australian society together, when he knows that the policies that he is pursuing will have the same wrecking influence in Australia and the same consequences in terms of social division and social disruption, and the creation of absolute poverty and desperation for millions of Australians. It is about time somebody realised the humbug of this honourable gentleman. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is another piece of hypocrisy in what the Opposition has to say. It is fair enough for the honourable member for Bennelong to say that jobs are not created by spending money on training programs. No-one on this side has ever claimed that they are. We have claimed that, if we are going to have a modern Australia with world-class industries and with a capacity for building jobs on the basis of the traded goods and services sector, we need more skills. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the honourable member for Bennelong said, many of the unskilled jobs which have disappeared in Australia will never return. The corollary of that, I inform my friend, is that we will need better and more skills available to people of all ages if they are going to get themselves back into the work force and stay there. We need more skills if we are going to have the kinds of sustainable jobs that I am sure he and I both wish to see in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is extraordinary that the honourable member for Bennelong could have put his name to a document which would propose a reduction of $288m in expenditure on training programs, as he did prior to the last Budget. In his Economic Action Plan, he wanted to rip $288m out of training programs, which would have denied training assistance to 150,000 Australians. This is the man who says that we have to do something about creating jobs. The honourable member ought to know that, whatever else we do, we must improve the skill level in the Australian work force. One way of doing that is for governments to provide assistance responsibly through training programs. At least the honourable member, unlike some others on his side, is not pretending that he can turn around this situation, even if he were in office. I suggest that it would be better if he could extend that degree of honesty to other areas of his discussion. (Time expired)</PARA>

How dare he criticise the honourable member for Bennelong for his contribution to this country when his own Budget lasted for 24 hours before it fell in the mud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I am here today to speak on behalf of the one million unemployed Australians and especially those 9,000 people who are encompassed in my electorate of Corinella. I say that they are encompassed in my electorate because I have been unable to obtain specific data. In a phone call this morning to the CES office, I asked for specific data. I was told, `Yes, Mr Broadbent. That is available. We just have to clear it with the Minister's office before we can give it to you'. I got the same information that anybody can get anywhere, that is, `There are 9,000 people unemployed in your area'. It has the figures for Wonthaggi, Phillip Island and Dandenong, but it will not give them to us. What is it hiding? It is hiding the true figures on unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to speak specifically today about the 150 per cent increase in unemployment in my area. I was elected to this Parliament because people in Victoria realised that this Government had to move; that this Government had to go. They elected me to what was a nominal Labor seat. They moved in Victoria as they will move in the next election. Not only does my area have 9,000 unemployed, but also the Frankston area has 8,206 long term unemployed, as my good friend, the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford), would be well aware. In the Dandenong area, 3,956 people are long term unemployed. These statistics are not from the Department of Employment, Education and Training, but from a report that was presented in my office by a concerned citizen. Can honourable members believe that today this country's Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that the Government is locking in its social justice strategy? What is social justice to the people in my area? I am going to name a few of those people. Behind every one of the figures is a face. I know that honourable members on this side of the House know those faces and have met some of those people through their offices in recent weeks. </PARA>
<PARA>  The first person I draw to the attention of honourable members is John Anton. John Anton is married with a wife and one child, Glen. I happen to know this man because he has done service work on my motor vehicles. He is a mechanic. He was retrenched recently because of this `recession we had to have'. John has applied for 60 positions. The people he used to phone four years ago to get himself a new position, if he needed a new position, are now saying, `John, we can't help you any more; we're putting off people ourselves'. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to stick with John for a moment because John Anton wants a job; he is desperately seeking a job. He is very well qualified. He has great experience. Some of the 60 people who interviewed him said, `You're too experienced for what we need'. They also said, `You're too old'. He is 41 and they said that he is too old. What happens to someone in this community who loses his or her job at 59? What happens in the family situation?</PARA>
<PARA>  As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) mentioned, the social infrastructure is being rocked by the Prime Minister and the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). Joan Kirner is part of the whole exercise. Now the current Treasurer (Mr Kerin) is involved. What happens to the family in this situation? Glen is disabled. He has sight disabilities. He has had a number of operations. Therefore, the cash in the household has not been great. This family is on unemployment benefits. Honourable members know what unemployment benefits are. Under this Government each week this family is living on less than it costs me for my health insurance each month. How would any of us in this House like to be living on those sorts of funds?</PARA>
<PARA>  When I spoke to John's wife I found out how genuinely Australian she is. I spoke to this woman today and got permission to use the family as an instance. She said, `Russell, we've got the family together, we've got love and we're getting there and we'll survive. But, Russell, there's lots of other people worse off than I am'. The Antons live in a farmhouse in the rural part of my electorate because that is all they can afford at this time. The sad situation is that they have now dropped their health insurance because they can no longer afford it. They have been in Medibank Private since it started. Under this Government they can no longer afford to keep their cover. Is this social justice for the Australian people--for `my  fellow Australians', as the Prime Minister calls them?</PARA>
<PARA>  I have a number of examples exactly like the Antons. I cannot name one person because I have not spoken to him, but I know of him. What about the 45 year-old accountant who is nearly suicidal and has been unable to get a job since September last year? His marriage has suffered dramatically and he feels that he has totally failed. He is just one of thousands across Australia who feel inadequate when they go into their households and look at their children and say, `I haven't got a job'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Derek Linsall, Captain of the local Salvation Army at Cranbourne, said, `Russell, how many people do you want me to tell you about who have lost their houses'. These are people who have lost the homes that they have had for 20 years because of the `recession that we had to have', the mismanagement we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA>  What about my good friend Bob Borland who was just retrenched from his job as a sales representative at Repco? Bob knows that he was over-qualified for the job he was doing. He has a great background in business, but he was doing a job as a sales representative for Repco. Because of his background, he knew that things were crook so he put in lots of extra hours in this last 12 months to make sure that his position was there. He was retrenched. He is only one of many. He is one man who I know will turn around and get a job. He is from Cowes, Phillip Island. Bob is the sort of guy who will sell ice to Eskimos and do it very well. </PARA>
<PARA>  Trevor Stone is a resident of the electorate of McMillan, a seat held by my good friend the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Riggall). Trevor Stone was a resident of Warragul for many years. After he lost his job he looked for another job for five months. Eventually he had to leave the beautiful area of Latrobe Valley and move with his family right across Australia to Queensland, where he found a job in the industry where he could get one. That is a positive note. If he is listening today, I congratulate him. But there are thousands who, for many reasons, cannot move away from Victoria to find that one job that may be somewhere in Australia for them. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recently I was at the fiftieth wedding anniversary of my mum and dad. Not one person at our family table had a good story to tell about the unemployment situation. My uncle said, `Russell, I have had seven women in my store asking me to put their lay-bys back on the shelf because either they have been retrenched or their husbands have been retrenched'. These are not rich people. These are ordinary people who have to go to their local shopkeeper and say, `I can no longer afford what I thought I could afford a few weeks ago; I have to put the lay-by back on the shelf'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Keith Hinks from Rhyll was retrenched after eight years in the fibreglass industry. He has been looking for work for 11 weeks. He has tried 20 places. He is 52. There are lots of other things that people have told me about themselves that I cannot go into today. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Labor Government has not looked at the fact that 831,900 people do not have a job. They are the official figures. We have not heard about the people on the unofficial lists who are out there looking for a job. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said today that there may be one million people, 1 1/2 million people or two million people who want to improve their standard of living and do not have the opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will tell honourable members about a young engineer, a professional who had honours at university. He has been unemployed for eight months. He is just about suicidal. He said, `All this training--for what? To get a job as a cleaner, if there was a job as a cleaner?'. He is shattered. I will tell honourable members about a father who lost his job. He handled it fairly well for a while until his son lost his job. He has fallen into a hole. That is what this recession has done. We now have more long term unemployed than we have ever had before. There are no policies or suggestions from this Government that will change where we go in Australia. I say to honourable members, `Bring on John Hewson, bring on change, bring on incentive, bring on opportunity, because the time has come for Australia to make a change'. Hawke should get out before Christmas. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) are somewhat able parliamentarians in terms of voice and presence. It is a pity that their speeches today lacked substance and detail. The honourable member for Bennelong called for the removal of hypocrisy and cant and then he proceeded straight down the hypocrisy and cant line; he danced at the margin, as did the honourable member for Corinella, in mentioning leadership and family life, as if those opposite have a pre-eminent hold on those things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Bennelong said, `We don't need crazy job creation schemes'. On that, I certainly agree. He totally failed to acknowledge, as did the honourable member for Corinella, the importance of training programs. Then came the key point of the honourable member for Bennelong's address: words and phrases without rationale and without any acknowledgment of process or the specifics of outcomes. He mentioned restructuring, regeneration and micro-economic reform. That was it--words. He concluded by asking what was the one right thing to do. In relation to answering that question, he said zilch--blank, nadir, nothing. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no doubt that every thinking, rational Australian is concerned about the current unemployment levels in this country. There is no doubt that for the same thinking rational Australians there still exists a vast gulf between the thinking of the Government and that of the Opposition. It is an informative exercise to put the track record of the Opposition up to scrutiny. It was not the Labor Party which in 1968 ignored the OECD recommendations that Australian governments should considerably lift their game in relation to school retention, vocational training and places of higher education, so it could take its rightful place in a more developed world. It was not the Labor Party that increased the retention rates in our schools from a miserly 25 per cent to 36 per cent over the 15 years from 1968 to 1983. It was not the Labor Party that virtually ignored vocational training and ignored increased places in higher education. It was not the Labor Party which had a resource policy of total reliance on agriculture and mining and forgot about the most important resource of all, that between one's ears. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was not the Labor Party which, in Malcolm Fraser's days when unemployment and inflation were over 10 per cent, referred to people unfortunate enough to be unemployed as dole bludgers. It was not the Labor Party which called, as some Opposition members are doing, for the abolition of training programs such as Skillshare. It is not the Labor Party calling for the abolition of student income support in the form of Austudy. It is not the Labor Party calling for the abolition of unemployment benefits after nine months. It is not the Labor Party calling for $3 billion in expenditure cuts, which will affect people in the health, education and welfare services areas. I point out to the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) that it was not the Opposition that had the courage to begin the tortuous process of restructuring Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  `Restructuring' is an interesting term, one that is often mentioned by honourable members opposite. What is the Opposition's record on that? It has ducked and weaved when talking about restructuring. Honourable members opposite mentioned the word `restructuring', as the honourable member for Bennelong did, and things like regeneration and micro-economic reform. But zilch--nothing--followed. As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) pointed out, it was not even the Opposition that thought up the line: Labor isn't working, neither are one million Australians. It got that from Margaret Thatcher. That is where it came from. The infamy of that line! The Minister said that Margaret Thatcher's policies created three million unemployed; but I suspect that Australians will not be deluded. The policies of members opposite would create two million unemployed and still not address the structural problems of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The irony of the 1983 election, I suppose, is not lost on some members of the Opposition. Maggie Thatcher unfortunately won. However, before the next election members opposite will probably shoot off the rest of the toes on their feet. Ross Gittins in the Sunday Age summed up members opposite with a very accurate and cutting remark: so the Liberal Party bleeds for the jobless? I think not. With the policies that members opposite wish to adopt, over four to five years Margaret Thatcher increased unemployment by 154 per cent. That is what Australians would look forward to under the Hewson dynamism of concern for the unemployed. Under the Liberal Party that is bleeding with concern and compassion for the long term unemployed, there would be some two million unemployed. As Ross Gittins says, I think not. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government is concerned about the number of long term unemployed and, unlike the Opposition, it can point to positive initiatives. Despite the rise over the past year, there has been a reduction in long term unemployment in recent years. In June this year the number of people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more stood at 183,644. That represents a rise, and a worrying rise, to June 1991 of some 62,000, or 51 per cent. There was a rise also of some 18 per cent in the number of people who had been unemployed for two years or more. I wonder whether this matter of public importance could have been on the Opposition's agenda in 1983, 1984 or 1985. For the information of the honourable</PARA>
<PARA>member of Corinella, since June 1984 the number of persons unemployed for 12 months or more has in fact fallen. It has fallen by 14,000, or 7 per cent. That does not make the current situation acceptable, but that is the truth of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has a number of initiatives--other than just empty words--directed towards the long term unemployed. This includes Skillshare, a community based skills training program. There is Jobtrain, a vocational training program. The vocational training area, the TAFE area that honourable members opposite dismiss so easily and about which they have done nothing for a long period, is important. There is the Jobstart program, which is a wage subsidy program for the long term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government does recognise the human costs of the current economic downturn and the structural adjustment pressures being faced by Australian industry and, consequently, by everyday Australians. However, we are not prepared as a government to buy our way out by pump-priming the economy or hiding the unemployed in temporary job creation projects with high costs and few benefits. We all remember--and I am sure the honourable member for Bennelong remembers--the Viner job creation schemes; of course, we are all embarrassed to think back to those programs. There is general agreement about where we need to be. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3J4">Mr SAWFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I agree. We need better productivity. We must have the ability to compete with the best in the world and to increase exports. This Government has consistently supported the achievement of these goals through its industry, labour market and education and training policies. Manufacturing exports are up by 124 per cent since 1983. Could honourable members opposite achieve that in the same period of time? I doubt it. Initiatives to encourage workplace reform, to increase the level and quality of training, to restructure awards and to support the development of a clever country by boosting the number of young Australians staying for longer at schools and going on to TAFE and higher education underpin the economic and employment gains.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Over the next two years Australia must make a recovery from its current problems if it is to have any chance of enduring. Throughout this process we have been conscious of the need to ensure that the cost of our adjustment to the realities of the world is not borne disproportionately by those already disadvantaged in our society. Newstart is a more active approach to assisting the long term unemployed to gain the skills that they need to obtain and retain real jobs. Assistance is available for workers who have been recently retrenched in the textile and car industries. We want to improve the relevance of Skillshare to the employment needs of the long term unemployed. There are five successful Skillshare programs operating in my electorate. These are all examples of bringing together equity, efficiency and goals, rather than seeing them as competing priorities. This Budget reinforces the direction and expands the range and quantity of assistance available. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I have only one minute remaining, I say quickly on the matter of long term unemployment that the lack of planning, substance and detail on the part of honourable members opposite during the Fraser years locked people out and prevented them from being able to participate in the growth of the economy from 1984 onwards. They would do it again. That is their track record in relation to the long term unemployed. It has not changed, and that is a great pity. The long term unemployed people in this country need support. They do not want delusion through one-liners that acknowledge no rationale, no process and no specific outcomes. What would the Opposition do in government? Inevitably, it would repeat the outcomes achieved by the Thatcher Government, it would create two million unemployed in this country. That is what it is on about.  (Time expired)</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Throsby)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the sixth, seventh and eighth reports of the Committee for 1991 relating to the following proposed works:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Construction of Australian High Commission Complex, Islamabad, Islamic Republic of Pakistan</PARA>
<PARA>  Development of HMAS Albatross, Nowra, NSW, Stage 2</PARA>
<PARA>  Redevelopment by the Defence Housing Authority of Seaward Village, Perth</PARA>
<PARA>  Ordered that the reports be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--The first report that I have just tabled is for the construction of a new two storey chancery building and a new two storey head of mission residence and for the provision of associated infrastructure, such as services, parking and landscaping, for the Australian High Commission in Islamabad, Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The estimated cost of this work is $7.992m, at March 1991 prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Committee has recommended that the work should proceed.  The Committee's public hearing into the proposal was held here in Canberra and officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Australian Construction Services as well as representatives of the Public Sector Union, Austrade and the Foreign Affairs and Trade Association presented evidence to the Committee. I mention this because, as has been the case with previous inquiries into embassy-type overseas work, the Committee was precluded from carrying out site inspections and taking evidence from Australian representatives in Pakistan by virtue of subsection 12(1) of the Public Works Committee Act. The report once again draws attention to the continuing difficulty the Committee faces in assessing overseas projects because of the restrictions placed upon it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report mentions that Australian's relations with Pakistan are significant. The South East Asian region is of general strategic concern to Australia, and Australia and Pakistan have longstanding trade links. At present, the High Commission is housed in a building constructed in 1976 to accommodate the mission's workshops, garages and stores. Similarly, the official residence consists of an inappropriate and poorly maintained leased house which required major maintenance and repairs before it was occupied. The government of Pakistan allocated a 1.45- hectare site in 1965 for the chancery and head of mission residence. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee concluded on the basis of written and oral evidence that there is a need for a functional High Commission complex which will project Australia's presence and reflect the importance that Australia places upon its relationship with Pakistan. The report also recommends that a permanent building services officer be located at the new High Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second report which I have presented relates to the second stage of development of HMAS Albatross at Nowra, New South Wales. The first stage of the development of the base was the subject of an inquiry by the Committee in 1986. This second stage is for the construction of a new building to house command operations, communications and administrative functions; a new building to provide offices for technical and administrative staff of two squadrons, plus the upgrading of associated hangar annexes; and the upgrading of high voltage reticulation and emergency power supply. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $9.9m at December 1990 prices. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee concluded that there is a need to construct buildings and associated engineering works to provide facilities to accommodate support functions and for the high voltage electrical services to be upgraded. The Committee also concluded that the proposed work will be adequate in meeting the need. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee gave some attention to energy issues during its inquiry. The House will be aware that the subject of energy conservation has been highlighted in a number of recent reports by the Committee. The Committee is mindful of the Government's objective to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2005. This objective was highlighted by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in a foreword to the Energy Guide which was recently circulated to every Australian household. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that, as part of stage 2 development, an energy audit should be undertaken to identify methods by which the use of electricity can be reduced. Furthermore, those buildings in this proposal requiring the provision of hot water should be provided with adequate solar hot water heaters. </PARA>
<PARA>  The proposal as put to the Committee stipulated the use of electric hot water heating. The choice of electricity was the result of an analysis of life cycle costing which indicated that solar hot water heating would cost 70 per cent more than an electric system. The Committee understands that the technique of life cycle costing is one of a number of techniques available for use in analysing capital and recurrent costs associated with investment decisions. It is limited in its focus in this instance because it does not take account of other factors such as investment in power stations nor greenhouse gas emissions. Accordingly, the Committee believes that, if the citizens of Australia are asked to contribute towards the achievement of the Government's objectives, it follows that government departments and agencies should provide leadership in the achievement of the objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third report I have presented relates to redevelopment of Seaward Village by the Defence Housing Authority. Seaward Village is adjacent to Campbell Barracks, Swanbourne, Perth, the home base of the Special Air Service Regiment. The proposal examined by the Committee is for the replacement of 77 substandard houses with 123 new houses on 115 lots, new roads and the provision of new utility services. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $12.814m. The Committee has recommended that the work should proceed. In doing so, the Committee has recommended that a number of matters relating to asbestos removal, the non-excavation of dune formations, access roads and energy targets and efficiency be carried out as part of the proposed work. </PARA>
<PARA>  As with the previous report, the Committee has recommended that the Defence Housing Authority use the concept of energy targets as a criterion by which it selects the suitability or otherwise of project homes submitted to it by builders. This recommendation is consistent with earlier reports by the Committee and reinforces the spirit of the Government's target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2005. The Committee has also recommended that the houses be provided with solar hot water heaters for the same reasons as I mentioned in relation to the previous report. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--I would like to commend the members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for their input and the amount of time they spend in looking at these various projects. I would also like to make a couple of quick comments about the specific projects. The first one, which I think the Chairman pointed out, is that there is always some difficulty for the Committee in trying to properly assess a site overseas because obviously the Committee does not have resources to inspect that--and I am sure that there would be some questions raised if they did ask for resources to make that inspection. Nonetheless, it means that the Committee does have some difficulty in reaching a proper assessment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  On the second project, the stage 2 development of HMAS Albatross at Nowra, I believe that my colleague the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) would like to make some comments as that is in his electorate. But I will just make a comment about this and also about the redevelopment in Perth on the question of solar hot water heating. I think what the Committee has discovered is what many residents or many householders find: that, while solar hot water heating is an admirable aim and one that I think would have a lot of support from people as a means of trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the fact is that it is expensive. As was pointed out, it is probably going to cost 70 per cent more to install those hot water heaters and to operate them over their life. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think this does point to a very real difficulty that the community is facing right now where, on the one hand, it is being asked to meet the greenhouse gas emission targets of the year 2005 but, on the other hand, the cost to individuals within the community is going to be significantly more than using existing forms of, in this case, hot water heating. I think this is a matter which the Government and the Parliament is going to have to look at very carefully if we are going to quite reasonably ask the community to share the burden in meeting that target. So I think it has raised an issue. It certainly has not given an answer. While the Government in this case can say that it is giving a lead, also of course under present considerations it does mean that, if this proceeds, it will add to the cost of the project. I think that highlights the difficulties that people in the community are going to face. I would therefore just like to flag that point and hope that it is one that will be given some further consideration. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Gilmore)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--As the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) has pointed out, a part of the Committee's report relates to an area in my electorate, HMAS Albatross, down at Nowra, which of course is the Royal Australian Navy's fleet air arm and a very important part of the Navy's overall operations and, I might also add, an extremely important part of the local economy of Shoalhaven.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Committee's report is one that is welcomed not only by me but also, I am sure, by all people in the Shoalhaven area, because in recent months that area has looked down the barrel of several thousands of people being unemployed. Some 5,700 people have been seeking employment in the district over the last few months, and that figure is a dramatic increase over the unemployment levels of the previous 12 months. However, it is worth making the point that the Government has a great deal of work to do, in addition to the stage 2 proposals, which the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has outlined to the House this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA>  HMAS Albatross suffered a very savage blow in 1984 when it lost the fixed wing component of the Navy air arm, the Tracker aircraft, which were pensioned off and are still sitting there on the tarmac some seven years later looking for a buyer as they slowly rot away in the sun. Secondly, of course, it lost the Skyhawks, the A4s, which were one of the mainstays of the Navy's ability to defend itself. They were sold off at a fire sale price to the New Zealand Air Force and, incidentally, most of them have been leased back from the New Zealanders at great expense to the taxpayer to cover the task that they were performing years ago prior to the Government's decision to axe them. One can see from this example, where those aircraft were sold at a fire sale price and then a few years later leased back from the people they were sold to, at an annual lease that is not far off the total sale price, that the Government has a long way to go before it is going to overcome some of the decisions that it made in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>  The result of those decisions in 1984 saw the local Shoalhaven community lose about $20m a year in annual income as a result of the closure of the fixed wing component of the Navy's air arm and the many hundreds of jobs which went with it. </PARA>
<PARA>  This development is a welcome innovation. The local community will look forward to it, as it will look forward to further developments of the Navy's activities in Shoalhaven. Of course, when speaking of that, one cannot go past making comment on the proposed munitions depot that is proposed to be built in Jervis Bay. I hope the Government does proceed with that proposal, even though there are some detractors who argue that it will harm the environment. I point out that this can be done without long term harm to the local environment, and I think it will also do a great deal of good simply by creating many hundreds of jobs in the construction phase and in the follow-up maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA>  So we look forward to these types of developments coming from the Public Works Committee in the future. I thank the Chairman, the honourable member for Throsby, for his presentation this afternoon and the work put in by members of the Committee. I know it is an odious task at times to have to travel around Australia, going outside one's own electorate and doing work that does not bring any gain back to one's electorate, but it is certainly very much appreciated by all members of Parliament. I also take the opportunity to thank the staff who work for the Committee, two of whom I think are in the chamber today. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Crimes (Aviation) Bill 1991 consolidates the provisions of the four Acts forming the current aviation crimes legislative package. Three of these Acts, that is, the Crimes (Hijacking of Aircraft) Act 1972, the Civil Aviation (Offenders on International Aircraft) Act 1970, and the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973 implement international conventions to which the Commonwealth is a party. Those conventions are incorporated in four schedules to the Bill. The fourth Act, the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963, is domestic oriented legislation governing the law applying on board certain aircraft and prescribing offences in relation to aircraft. All four of these Acts are repealed by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  With the exception of the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963, the Acts have been enacted on a convention by convention basis so that four specialised Acts cover different aspects of crimes, all involving aircraft. This consolidation has allowed the provisions of all four Acts to be reviewed. As a result the jurisdictional and procedural requirements have been rationalised and law applying in relation to crimes involving aircraft has been vastly simplified. All aircraft over which the Commonwealth has jurisdiction are covered by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill contains no new offences, but simply re-enacts offences in the existing Acts. These offences, created in part 2 of the Bill, relate to aircraft, aerodromes, airports and air navigation facilities. In the light of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 the requirements in the existing Acts that the Attorney-General, or a person authorised by the Attorney-General, consent to each prosecution has not been re-enacted. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conjunction with the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, the Bill ensures that a person who commits an act before its commencement may be prosecuted under the current aviation crimes legislative package to which I have referred. While preserving the effect of State and Territory laws, the Bill ensures that no person may be punished under separate legal regimes for the same conduct; that is, double jeopardy is prohibited. </PARA>
<PARA>  The traditional, and necessary, authority of the aircraft commander in relation to acts done on board an aircraft is preserved. Where the commander of an aircraft suspects a person of committing an offence, or believes it is necessary in order to prevent the commission of an offence, the commander may disembark that person and have him or her dealt with under provisions of the Bill. I mention also that the Bill as introduced into the Senate was amended to include a power under which an aircraft commander or a person authorised by the Minister may search an aircraft and any person, luggage or freight on board the aircraft or about to board the aircraft if he or she suspects that an offence is being or may be committed. This search power, which is an important part of the security network ensuring aviation safety, was overlooked in the development of the Bill and was hence the subject of a Government amendment in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>  A further minor amendment was made to the Bill in the Senate. That amendment was made in response to comments made on the Bill by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The amendment was made to the definition of `prescribed period' contained in clause 40 so as to make it clear that, in any case where more than one order for the remand of a person is made by a magistrate under clause 39, the period at the end of which that person may apply to be released from custody will be calculated from the date of the first order. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a consolidation, the Bill involves no additional direct costs to the Commonwealth. Rather, the Bill should reduce costs by simplifying the administration of this area of the Commonwealth's criminal law. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Freedom of Information Amendment Bill 1991 will make a large number of amendments to improve the operation and administration of the Freedom of Information Act. Honourable members will be aware that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs carried out a review of the operation of the FOI Act. In December 1987 the Committee published a report recommending a large number of legislative amendments and changes in administrative practice. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee reported that there is widespread support for the objectives of the FOI Act which are to make available to the public information in the possession of the Commonwealth Government, to increase Government accountability and to increase public participation in the process of government. It found that the FOI Act has brought benefits to individuals, government agencies and the Australian community. However, the Committee also leaned to the view that it is appropriate to pay greater attention to the costs of FOI, particularly in tight economic and budgetary circumstances. Many of the Committee's recommendations focused on ways of improving the operation and administration of the Act. The Government's response to that report was tabled in June 1989. Although some recommendations could not be accepted because of the cost of their implementation, the Government agreed to the implementation of a majority of the Committee's proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Freedom of Information Amendment Bill 1991 will introduce the necessary amendments to implement the legislative changes agreed to by the Government. The Bill will also make a small number of technical changes to the Act in areas which have, subsequent to the Committee's report, come to notice as requiring correction. The majority of provisions in the Bill are aimed at simplifying the processing of requests by government agencies. The procedure for making a request for access to the documents of an agency is being streamlined. The steps which agencies must follow in imposing charges for access are being simplified. Improvements are being made to the procedures for consultation with business, State and Territory governments and private individuals about the disclosure of documents which affect their interests. Provisions relating to review of agency decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are being clarified. </PARA>
<PARA>  In accordance with the Senate Committee's recommendations, section 24 of the Act is being amended to allow agencies greater scope to refuse to deal with requests which substantially and unreasonably divert the resources of an agency from its other responsibilities. At the same time the Bill strengthens the provision in section 24 requiring agencies to consult with applicants before refusing requests on workload grounds. Section 24 will place the onus on agencies to give applicants practical help to narrow the terms of their requests to manageable proportions. </PARA>
<PARA>  With one exception the Bill is not making significant changes to the provisions of the FOI Act which allow government agencies to exempt documents or parts of documents from public disclosure. The one exception is in relation to secrecy provisions in Commonwealth legislation. At present the FOI Act provides that a document is exempt from public disclosure if there is a secrecy provision in a Commonwealth Act prohibiting the disclosure of information of the kind contained in the document. Federal Court interpretation has limited the exemption to specific secrecy provisions but the exemption remains uncertain in its operation. The Senate Committee recommended that a list of relevant secrecy provisions be included in a schedule to the FOI Act but did not suggest any criteria upon which the schedule should be drawn up. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill introduces a schedule of secrecy provisions into the Act. In general three criteria have been used in determining whether a secrecy provision should be included in the schedule. First, the provision must be specific in identifying a category of information which the Parliament has determined should be subject to a blanket prohibition on public disclosure. If too many broad secrecy provisions are included in the schedule, the general right of public access to documents created by the FOI Act would be undermined. </PARA>
<PARA>  Second, it will generally be inappropriate to include a secrecy provision in the schedule if the specific exemption provisions in part IV of the FOI Act already provide adequate protection to the information covered by the secrecy provision. Most secrecy provisions are drafted without regard to the sort of precise tests in part IV which determine whether disclosure should be refused on grounds such as unreasonable disclosure of business or personal affairs information. The use of the exemption provisions of the FOI Act also has the advantage that a person who disagrees with an agency's decision to grant or refuse access to a document is entitled to a statement of reasons for the decision and can appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the decision. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third criterion relates to the question of the resources required by an agency to make decisions on exemptions. Some agencies that process large numbers of requests have come to rely on the blanket exemption given by secrecy provisions for categories of information they possess. These agencies would need significant additional resources if they had to undertake consultation and make decisions on disclosure based on the reasonableness tests in the part IV exemptions of the FOI Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  The schedule to the Bill deals only with the narrow question of the role of secrecy provisions in limiting authorised public disclosure of documents under the FOI Act. But secrecy provisions also raise wider questions about the prevention of unauthorised public disclosure and regulation of the flow of personal information between government agencies. These wider issues are under review elsewhere. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recently published its report on unauthorised procurement and disclosure of information. The Gibbs Committee Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law is preparing a report on provisions of the Crimes Act dealing with disclosure of official information. The Attorney- General's Department is also conducting a review of certain aspects of Commonwealth secrecy provisions and will be circulating a discussion paper for comment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill does not implement all the Senate Committee's recommendations. Provisions in the FOI Act relating to the right of an individual to seek the amendment of incorrect or out of date material in personal records of government agencies are to be transferred to the Privacy Act. This will be done in a later Bill when the implications of the transfer for the different review systems in the FOI and Privacy Acts have been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA>  The changes to the FOI charges system recommended by the Senate Committee and agreed to by the Government will be implemented by amendments to the FOI charges regulations. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991 amends the principal Act, the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989. The principal Act provides a legislative basis for a consolidated program and funding approach that is supplementary to mainstream Commonwealth education funding. The Act underpins the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. This policy, commonly known as the AEP, has been endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory governments. It is truly a national policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The AEP is a significant reform initiative in Aboriginal education developed when my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) was the Minister responsible for Aboriginal education. The AEP is a cooperative effort to address the education needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by focusing on the educational strategies of the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories, non-government education authorities and educational institutions, in achieving agreed national goals. </PARA>
<PARA>  The AEP has a number of program elements including the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program (AESIP), which incorporates the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness Program (ASSPA); the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme (ATAS); and the Vocational and Educational Guidance for Aboriginals Scheme (VEGAS). </PARA>
<PARA>  The AEP arose from the findings of several major reports that identified Aboriginal people as the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. It has four main long term objectives: to increase the involvement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in educational decision making; to ensure equality of access to educational services; to ensure equity of educational participation; and to achieve equitable and appropriate educational outcomes.  All governments of Australia have agreed on 21 specific goals which cover all sectors of education. It should be noted that these amendments to the principal Act are administrative in nature. They will not affect the national policy nor the long term commitment of the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments, the non-government educational authorities and the educational institutions to achieve the goals. </PARA>
<PARA>  The administrative amendments reflect the transfer of the higher education funding component within the principal Act to the Higher Education Funding Act and minor changes to the administration of the Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program, the program which gives effect to the principal Act. The Bill will not appropriate any additional funds. The amendments to the amounts appropriated under the principal Act also reflect budget neutral transfers between the special appropriation and the annual appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>  The central features of the AEP will remain the same. Firstly, as in other areas of Aboriginal affairs such as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, or ATSIC, the policy emphasises the necessity for Aboriginal involvement in decision making. As an example, at the school level there are now over 2,000 ASSPA committees. These are committees made up of Aboriginal parents and teachers that meet and discuss program priorities in schools. The ASSPA program is recognised by State and Territory education authorities as being a successful means of increasing Aboriginal involvement in educational decision making at the local level. Such involvement occurs at all levels of the AEP. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, the policy emphasises a cooperative approach at every level and operates with cross-party support. It links the work of education providers and State and Territory governments of all kinds through an agreed national approach. </PARA>
<PARA>  The AEP is strategic. It is based on agreed operational and strategic plans intended to improve the poor national report card in Aboriginal education. The AEP is working. We already have early indications that Aboriginal school retention rates, increasing steadily throughout the duration of the Hawke Government, have increased further. More Aboriginal people are becoming employed in education and more schooling opportunities are becoming available.</PARA>
<PARA>  The AEP also has a relationship with two other areas of my responsibilities as Minister. It is an essential part of both the process of reconciliation and the Government's response to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The reconciliation process emphasises education as a central and essential concern. As the Bill, supported unanimously in both Houses of Parliament, stresses, there is a need to educate all Australians about Aboriginal history and culture and about the reasons for Aboriginal social and economic disadvantage. The AEP does that through the nationally agreed goal 21, and through the role the policy plays as a framework for the national reconciliation and schooling strategy, which I announced last April. </PARA>
<PARA>  Initiatives are now under way to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies have a valued place in the curriculum of Australian schooling and in the professional development of teachers. The reconciliation process also emphasises a strategic effort throughout this decade to  address Aboriginal disadvantage. Aboriginal people are clearly of the view that any attempt to respond to these issues that does not start to meet the education needs of their community will not be able to succeed. I share that view and I am pleased that the AEP provides a national policy framework for addressing that concern. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody called for responses from government to address the underlying causes of the Aboriginal imprisonment rates. Education was one area that it emphasised and the AEP provides a model for the cooperative arrangements that it had in mind. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commission also emphasised the central importance of Aboriginal peoples involvement in decision making especially to ensure that their priorities and concerns are reflected in the education of their children. It cited the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness Program (ASSPA) as a positive example in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA>  Education is central to social change for both  Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. The national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy recognises this and, linked with other key areas of national commitment such as the reconciliation process, is a clear indication of the priority that this Government places on ongoing change and development in the area of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Although the changes to this legislation are minor and administrative, the passage of these amendments provides an opportunity for the Parliament to give a commitment of support to the principles and practices of the AEP as a means of addressing the educational needs of Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Loan Bill (No. 2) 1991 is a standard financing measure which allows funds to be transferred from the loan account to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This Bill has been introduced in the expectation that the Consolidated Revenue Fund will be in deficit at the end of the 1991-92 financial year. The Government already anticipates that the Consolidated Revenue Fund will be in deficit at the end of the current financial year by around $10.2billion. This $10.2 billion is composed of the projected Budget deficit of $4.7 billion and various off-Budget capital transactions. It is thus likely that some $5.5 billion will be required from the loan fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This is the second loan Bill that we have debated this year. It reflects the collapse of the Government's fiscal policy over the past 12 months. The Loan Bill 1991, debated in March this year, was the first such financing mechanism to have been passed by the Parliament since 1987. It might be appropriate at this stage to move the following amendment, and so I move:</PARA>
<PARA>  That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>  ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:</PARA>
<PARA>  (1)  engineering the worst economic recession for 60 years;</PARA>
<PARA>  (2)  knowingly putting over one million people out of work;</PARA>
<PARA>  (3)  its economic mismanagement and fiscal</PARA>
<PARA>      irresponsibility revealed in the Budget;</PARA>
<PARA>  (4)  failing to create a climate for increased national savings, investment, growth and jobs;</PARA>
<PARA>  (5)  not curtailing its own purpose spending, running a reckless deficit and plundering the savings of households and firms; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (6)  providing no leadership, no example and no hope to the people of Australia''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's much vaunted Budget surpluses of the intervening years since 1987 have now become a thing of the past, thanks to the recession and a discretionary spending binge contained in this year's Budget. In the past 12 months, the Government has presided over the largest single deterioration in the Commonwealth's finances since the early 1950s. From a projected Budget surplus for 1990-91 of $8.1 billion, we have moved to an actual Budget surplus of $1.9 billion and a projected Budget deficit for 1991-92 of $4.7 billion. The swing from the projected Budget outcome for 1990-91 to the projected outcome for 1991-92 thus amounts to nearly $13 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>  By the end of this financial year, the Commonwealth Budget sector's total debt to GDP ratio is expected to have increased to 13.75 per cent, compared to 12.8 per cent at</PARA>
<PARA>the end of 1990-91. This is a reversal of what had been a highly desirable downward trend since 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>  More significant than the Commonwealth Budget outcome, however, is the contribution that the deficit will make to the total net public sector borrowing requirement. The net PSBR takes into account the Commonwealth Budget and non-Budget sectors, as well as the fiscal positions of the other levels of government, giving us a far more comprehensive picture of the state of fiscal policy in Australia. The net public sector borrowing requirement has moved from minus 1.6 per cent of GDP in 1988-89 to 2.2 per cent of GDP in 1990-91. The estimated net PSBR for 1991-92 is 4.3 per cent of GDP. This massive deterioration in public sector finances reflects both the recession-induced collapse in tax receipts and a significant increase in discretionary spending by the Commonwealth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Commonwealth tax receipts for 1991-92 are expected to fall by 2.1 per cent in nominal terms. Total revenue is expected to fall by 1.2 per cent in nominal terms and 4.1 per cent in real terms. This collapse in the revenue side of the Budget would have been more severe were it not for an anticipated increase in non-tax revenue of some 15.5 per cent this financial year. These lower tax collections would have been welcomed if they had been the result of cuts in tax rates. Unfortunately, however, they reflect severely depressed economic activity rather than a lower tax burden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  While revenue collections have fallen, Commonwealth outlays have increased significantly. As with revenue, much of this is attributable to the effects of the recession. Total outlays for 1991-92 are expected to increase 5.7 per cent in nominal terms or 2.6 per cent in real terms. However, these figures subsume Commonwealth own account spending, an examination of which reveals a significant increase in discretionary spending by the Federal Government. In 1991-92, Commonwealth own account spending will increase by 4.9 per cent in real terms. This brings this category of spending up to 18.2 per cent of GDP. Significantly, this is up around the levels of 1983. The Government is back where it was eight years ago in terms of Commonwealth own account spending as a percentage of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA>  The new policy measures contained in the Budget account for nearly $2 billion. These new spending arrangements and measures are offset by Budget savings of roughly the same amount. However, the new spending measures have prevented what good the cuts in Government outlays might have achieved in terms of reducing the projected Budget deficit and maintaining a reasonably tight fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is the Opposition's view, based on these figures, that the Federal Budget could have been balanced if the Government had the necessary determination. This would have required further cuts in Commonwealth outlays of some $2 billion, in addition to forgoing the new spending measures contained in the Budget. In this regard, former Department of Finance head, Sir William Cole, recently identified $6 billion of possible cuts in Commonwealth expenditures in an analysis for the Institute of Public Affairs, which I would commend to all honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA>  It can also be argued that the States went away from the last Premiers Conference with too much. The absence of the usual grumbling from the Premiers alone would indicate that there was scope to cut more from the grants to the States. The Treasurer (Mr Kerin) claims that he has `maintained the underlying integrity of the Budget'. `Underlying integrity' is a weasel term which is designed to avoid the reality that the structural integrity of the Budget has been shot to pieces. The underlying integrity claim stretches credulity in any case. </PARA>
<PARA>  As my previous remarks about the net public sector borrowing requirement suggest, we would need a Budget surplus of around $2 billion in order for the public sector to make a positive contribution to net savings similar to that of only 12 months ago. Instead, the Commonwealth will become, for the first time since 1986-87, a substantial gross and net issuer of debt this financial year. The Budget deficit, along with scheduled bond maturities, maturing foreign currency debt and net payments to government business enterprise superannuation, establish a total finance task for the Government of $11 billion in 1991-92. The new debt represents a serious drain on our national savings effort and will serve to crowd out private sector investment. The looseness of Government fiscal policy, as set out in its recent Budget, places a large burden on monetary policy if we are to keep growth in total national spending at sustainable levels. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is continuing to keep private demand depressed through high real interest rates while at the same time allowing public expenditure to grow. Public sector final demand is forecast to grow by 1.75 per cent in 1991-92 compared to negative growth in the private sector final demand of minus 0.25 per cent on a year average basis. The lack of restraint being exercised on the public sector is indicated by the increase in public sector running costs revealed in the Public Service budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  According to a report in Monday's Australian, the running costs of 13 of the 16 Federal Government departments will grow by more than the inflation forecast this financial year. This will be the fifth year in a row that there has been a real increase in the running costs of the Public Service. Needless to say, the burden of restraint should be the reverse of this if we are to lay the basis for future economic growth. The public sector is notoriously underproductive and should not be allowed to expand at the expense of more productive private sector investment, as is happening under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The priorities of this Budget thus provide no basis for any sustainable easing of monetary policy settings. Monetary policy will continue to be used to compensate for a loose fiscal policy and an ad hoc wages policy in order to keep national spending at levels consistent with internal and external balance. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is the very same strategy developed and devastatingly implemented by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), which so manifestly failed in achieving either of those objectives. The real side of the economy has been flattened, without any substantial improvement in our external accounts. The forecast for 1991-92 contained in Budget Statement No. 2 suggests that this situation will continue into the foreseeable future. While gross national expenditure is expected to increase this year by a miserable 0.25 per cent, we will still face a current account deficit of around 3.5 per cent of GDP. A tighter fiscal policy and a decentralised wages policy would have made sustainable reductions in interest rates possible. Of course, any such fall in rates would need to follow rather than lead the fall in inflationary expectations necessary for the fall in rates to be sustainable. We should not push short term rates too far below long term rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government this very day having succumbed to pressure from various quarters to lower interest rates before these conditions are met, we can expect the loose fiscal policy regime contained in the Budget to contribute to another round of stop-go monetary and fiscal policies. It is difficult to overstate the importance of the public sector's making a positive contribution to national savings at present. Such a contribution is needed to repay the debt financing of the public sector in years gone by, and to compensate for undersaving in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  We know we have a tax system which discriminates heavily against personal savings on the part of wage and salary earners. The top marginal income tax rate now cuts in at only 1 1/2 times average weekly earnings. In contrast, in 1954-55 the top marginal rate cut in at 18 times average weekly earnings. The marginal income tax rate for people on average weekly earnings has increased from 32c in the dollar in 1981-82 to 39c in the dollar in 1989-90. The average income tax rate on all individuals, perhaps the best indicator of the overall income tax burden on the community, has increased from 21.1 per cent in 1980-81 to 24.1 per cent in 1988-89. Under these conditions, it is hardly surprising that wage and salary earners have few incentives to save. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under the current tax regime, personal savings simply become a source of additional tax liability rather than a stream of income on the basis of which households can build for the future. One of the objectives of the coalition's proposed tax reforms is to reduce this discrimination against household savings. </PARA>
<PARA>  A broad based consumer tax will provide the basis for lowering the burden of income tax so that people are able to keep a greater proportion of the interest earnings on their savings. Then individuals will have a less distorted environment in which to decide the level of savings, as against consumption that is appropriate for them. The overall level of savings is less important than the major deficiency of domestic savings, as against investment that we so desperately need in Australia at present. This has necessitated increased foreign borrowings to finance our investment requirements, which of course is the flip side of our current account deficit and its contribution to our foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA>  The savings investment imbalance in Australia is becoming chronic. There is nothing wrong with Australia's making extensive use of foreign savings in order to finance future productive investment in Australia, whether it be in the traded or non- traded goods sector. Indeed we could not grow and create new jobs without such borrowings, but we need to be assured that such borrowings are providing the basis for increased national output if we are to be confident of being able to meet the associated servicing requirements of our overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, the evidence for this has not been forthcoming. Australia's net foreign liabilities--that is, total foreign investment in Australia less total Australian investment abroad--have increased dramatically as a percentage of the growth in GDP over the past 10 years. This measure provides us with an indication of the extent to which foreign borrowings are providing us with the capacity to increase national output and to service our foreign debt. It is not a pretty tale. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1970 net foreign liability as a percentage of the increase in GDP was 21.3 per cent. In 1980 the figure was slightly higher, at 22.2 per cent. But by 1990 the figure had blown out to just on 56 per cent. The continuing increase in our net foreign liabilities is failing to provide for increased national output to the extent that it should if we are to meet our future obligations. This situation is unsustainable and will be corrected either by action on our part in this Parliament or by action taken by overseas and domestic markets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have already told the honourable member for Perth what I would do. It is always a source of amazement to me that he does not listen to our proposals and interjects inanely in such a way. But the situation is unsustainable. One way to address the situation is to increase Australia's savings effort in both the public and private sectors. I hope the honourable member for Perth will let that sink in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  To its lasting discredit, this Government has presided over a major collapse in national savings. The June quarter national accounts revealed that national savings have fallen from $24.2 billion in 1989-90 to $9.3 billion in 1990-91. Household savings fell by $3.4 billion over the same period. The June quarter national accounts note:</PARA>
<PARA>More significant falls were in the general government surplus on current account. . . and in other saving (mainly corporate undistributed income and provisions for income tax) from minus $2.9 billion in 1989-90 to minus $7.8 billion in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>  These absolute figures are further reflected in a major collapse in the household savings ratio--that is, household savings as a percentage of disposable income--over the past 10 financial years, as well as more recently. The household savings ratio has fallen from 10.4 per cent in 1980 to 6 per cent in 1990. For the March quarter of 1990-91 the figure was only 4.3 per cent. Household savings are currently at their lowest levels since 1960, having last peaked in 1974 at 15.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia's household savings performance compares extremely poorly with that of the Group of Seven leading members of the OECD. Only the United States had a lower household savings ratio than Australia in 1990, being 4.6 per cent. For Japan the figure was 14.3 per cent; Germany, 13.4 per cent; France, 11.8 per cent; Italy, 15.1 per cent; the UK, 8.6 per cent; and Canada, 10.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's superannuation levy announced in this year's Budget has been touted as a major boost to our national savings effort. What has been conveniently and deliberately ignored is that the levy simply redirects the existing commitment people have to savings without increasing the overall pool of savings.  People cannot be forced into saving more of their income by crude legislative imposition. They need positive incentives to save, particularly through the taxation system, if the overall level of savings in this country is to be reduced. Despite the massive increase in the size of pooled superannuation funds, there has been a complete collapse in the level of household savings at the very same time. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My honourable friend interjects, `Tax them more'. That is the very thing this Government has done. In eight or nine years it has managed to increase the total tax take by about double the rate of inflation. My friend may well look at Hansard tomorrow and have a good look at the table that I have incorporated. It paints the picture of the Government's total taxation. From the recession that we had to have, which was inflicted by the honourable member for Blaxland with the total support of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), we are now reaping the ills--and the benefits, politically, I suppose; but it gives us no satisfaction at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Superannuation may be the Government's preferred savings vehicle, but it is rapidly becoming the only one. The superannuation levy is a cop-out to the ACTU, which successfully demanded from the Government what it could not obtain through the Industrial Relations Commission. The recession has also taken its toll on the investment side. Private sector investment collapsed in 1990-91. Gross fixed capital expenditure, as a percentage of GDP, fell from 24 per cent of GDP in 1989- 90 to 21.8 per cent in 1990-91. This is the lowest level of gross fixed capital expenditure as a percentage of GDP in at least 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  Total private investment fell 11.3 per cent on a year average basis in 1990-91. This reflected an 11.4 per cent fall in dwelling investment, a 14.5 per cent fall in non-dwelling construction, a 10.6 per cent fall in plant and equipment investment and an 11.9 per cent fall in business investment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The outlook for this year, 1991-92, in terms of investment is not much better. Private investment is expected to fall by 6 per cent on a year average basis. The June quarter national accounts showed significant falls in all categories of private sector investment, except housing. However, public sector investment grew by nearly 2 per cent-- confirming the lack of restraint in the public sector. The Government, through the Budget and its other policies, has not provided the foundations for increased national output, employment and export growth--increases in all of which are necessary to pull us out of the recession. This second Loan Bill for 1991 is symptomatic of this failure and the Government's legacy of public sector debt at the expense of private sector growth. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's handling of the Commonwealth's finances is reminiscent of the handling of the corporate finances of those companies unfortunate enough to be managed by the friends of Labor governments in the late 1980s. The immediate past Treasurer--if I may refer to him that way--once talked about his disgust at `seeing spivs rip off decent people'. He once referred to `these characters who are picking up hundreds of millions of dollars worth of debt and then walking away to let other people pick up the pieces'. That is exactly what this Loan Bill is all about--saddling hardworking Australians with public sector debt, so that the Government is spared the trouble of running a decent fiscal and wages policy of a sort that would upset some of its public sector and trade union mates. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is fairly tiresome to listen to the Government members, including the honourable member for Blaxland, decrying the spivs and funny money merchants when Labor governments--State and Federal--have had such a close association with those very same people. It is, of course,  a complete misrepresentation to refer to many of these people as entrepreneurs. They were, generally speaking, beneficiaries of shonky deals with Labor governments, which required no entrepreneurial skills whatsoever--unless a glib tongue is regarded as all that is required to be an entrepreneur. </PARA>
<PARA>  All that was needed under this mob's State and Federal governments was a well-placed mate and a brown paper bag. The remainder of the so-called `corporate cowboys' were the beneficiaries of the Government's loose monetary policy and excess credit growth--post the 1987 stock market crash. These entrepreneurs then became the victims of monetary policy tightening. Once monetary growth was curtailed, as it inevitably had to be, all the malinvestments of that period were exposed to the retributive justice of the market. It was this Government, and in particular the honourable member for Blaxland in his former capacity as Treasurer, that did more to create a spiv economy in this country than did any other group or individual. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I know that my friend the honourable member for Wannon understands that more than most. It was the former Treasurer who was responsible for the thoroughly politicised conduct of monetary policy during those years. It was the former Treasurer who boasted that he had his hands on the levers of policy and who then proceeded to make a series of serious miscalculations in the application of monetary policy. It was the former Treasurer who failed so badly in picking the turns in the economy, which was the rationale for his short term, activist approach to policy in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Loan Bills this year are the mirror image of the corporate debt and non-performing loans that this Government's handling of monetary policy has generated in the private sector. The Government is inflicting on the Australian people the costs associated with this debt rather than taking responsibility for the hard decisions that need to be made to put Australia back on the path to prosperity--just as the corporate spivs spawned by Labor governments pushed the costs of their activities onto small investors and depositors. These Loan Bills are the mirror image of the $4.2 billion in combined losses so far declared by the State Bank of South Australia and the State Bank of Victoria. It is coincidental, is it not?</PARA>
<PARA>  The Loan Bills are also the mirror image of the huge loses recorded by the various State government insurance offices in the Labor States. It is entirely appropriate that the House should condemn the Government for its economic performance at this very time. The Government has knowingly engineered the worst recession in 60 years--throwing one million people out of work, and probably making a similar number of people underemployed, while mortgaging our future. Instead of responsible economic management, all we get from this Government is fratricidal warfare over the poisoned chalice of Labor leadership. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Loan Bill (No. 2) 1991 allows for a machinery financing measure to enable expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth and to supplement the moneys available to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This represents a measure which allows for appropriate liquidity in government funding of its program throughout the financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As mentioned by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), the Bill represents an appropriate measure which is, and has been, part of the structure of financing government programs over a large number of years. It is nothing new. In an unprecedented time of running Budget surpluses--as we have had over the last three or four years--it has not been necessary for such Bills to be brought before the Parliament. In the environment of a recessed economy--that we face now--it is necessary in the present circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is with interest that I look at the amendment moved by the honourable member for Curtin and the suggestions that he makes. The inconsistency of his comments is mind- boggling. The Opposition came into this place at a time when for nearly 30 or 40 years we had a situation whereby the Government never produced a surplus in its domestic deficit. It was only under Labor and only over the last four or five years that, in fact, we have had surpluses in our domestic Budget. It was only because of those surpluses that we have been able to think in terms of having a zero or negative public sector borrowing requirement. It is only in those circumstances, produced by the fiscal restraint of this Government, that we have been in a position where we can talk in those terms.  Yet the Opposition comes into this place and takes those surpluses as though they were its own; as though they were the result of its own diligence and hard work; as though they were the result of its own policy positions; and suggests that this year we should, in fact, have a Budget that is balanced and we should always be aiming to have a balanced Budget or to produce a surplus. The fact of the matter is that for the whole time the coalition was in government over some 40 or 50 years, it never produced a Budget surplus. It is this Government that has been able to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>  A number of issues were raised by the honourable member for Curtin and it behoves me, I believe, to respond to them, because it is important that these things be seen in perspective. He ranted and raved about taxation and said that this Government is a high taxing government. If one looks at international comparisons, then it is very clear that Australia is a low taxing government. Compared with other OECD countries, Australia is second or third from the bottom of a list showing countries against taxation as a percentage of GDP. We are now below Japan and, I believe, the United States. Only Turkey has a lower percentage than Australia. So we are second or third from the bottom when one looks at international comparisons of taxation rates. Australia is not a high taxing country. While that mythology may help the political aspirations of those opposite, it is something that needs to be understood by the Australian public. The public needs to understand very clearly that in fact that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA>  While the Opposition may rant about gross tax receipts and all sorts of other figures, it needs to look at the Budget figures for this year. If it did so, it would find that the outcome for this year in respect of taxation is one that we should be proud of. Indeed, 23.1 per cent of our tax of GDP was raised by taxation this year in the Estimates for the Budget for 1991-92. Last year the figure was 24.5 per cent. Historically, it has been in that range. Indeed, what we find is that, as a percentage of GDP, taxation revenue has been falling. One could not in any way use the Budget figures to suggest that during the time we have been in government revenue as a percentage of GDP from taxation has increased. </PARA>
<PARA>  More outstanding than that is, of course, the fact that outlays as a percentage of GDP during the time we have been in government have fallen dramatically. Yet the Opposition suggests that the solution to our present difficulties lies in further cuts in outlays and further cuts in taxation and that in some way such cuts would enable it to achieve a Budget position which is balanced. I suggest to the Opposition that those cuts would be extremely draconian and would be the sorts of things that in government it would never consider. It is okay for an opposition to talk about what it would do in government and to be hairy- fisted, but its track record in government does not indicate that it would ever do it.</PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members opposite have suggested that the tax cuts that formed part of last year's Budget and that have flow-on effects in this financial year and which represent $1,100m in the pockets of Australians should not be proceeded with; that the $450m which represents a reduction in the wool tax for farmers should not be proceeded with; that the changes to sales tax on business imports that were part of the Government's industry statement earlier this year should not be proceeded with; and that, in fact, the tariff cuts which were part of this Government's industry statement earlier this year should not be proceeded with. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition is talking about a massive change in those policy changes that the Government has introduced. On top of that, the new expenditure proposals, which have been offset by outlay cuts by the Government, are also aspects of our budgetary process which, in fact, should be changed. If one looks at the individual programs that make up some of those new expenditure initiatives, then one finds they include things like labour market programs and programs such as Skillshare, which provide training and skills for long term unemployed and disadvantaged people in our community. They represent added assistance for Austudy, more places in higher education, increased funding for science and other proposals which are absolutely important in the environment we find ourselves in at the moment.  It is clear that unemployment is a massive problem in this country; no-one is walking away from that. But, in such a time, it is only too appropriate that the Government be applying expenditure to those sorts of programs which provide training and educational opportunities for people who are unemployed and for those young people who will be part of the work force in the future. They are the sorts of programs that will make these young people more flexible, more employable and will provide flexibility and resilience for our economy in the future. The opposition bleats that we should cry crocodile tears for all people in those circumstances, but it cannot provide any more money for training programs, extra education programs, Skillshare and all of those things which will be critical to the future employment of such people. I suggest that such an approach is not only hard-hearted and thoughtless, but also short term and will not produce the sort of economy and flexibility that we require. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Curtin ranged far and wide in his contribution here today. His comment about the need for foreign investment was one that I would wholeheartedly endorse. Of course, the requirement should be that this investment should be productive and provide the ability to service our foreign debt. But the honourable member did not suggest how he would do it nor what the Government should do to ensure that the foreign investment was appropriate for Australia's environment. Indeed, the Opposition's policy in this area includes the proposal to abolish the Foreign Investment Review Board, which would indicate to me that its approach to this matter is `Let us have the market determine all of these things. Let us not have any scrutiny by the Australian Government of foreign investment proposals'. </PARA>
<PARA>  In those terms I cannot understand how, in fact, the honourable member's philosophy or position would effect the change that he wants to bring about. He made the suggestion, of course, that real interest rates were too high. Yet, in exactly the same breath he put forward the suggestion that interest rates should not have been lowered today. He suggested that their lowering was the result of the Government caving in to pressure and said that the environment for an interest rate reduction was not right. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is impossible for us on this side to understand what the Opposition is suggesting because it is so inconsistent on this particular policy position. When interest rates were lowered in January 1990, the Opposition suggested that in fact that was a cynical political ploy and that interest rates should have been maintained. At a time when interest rates were historically high, it suggested they should be higher. Now that interest rates are coming down, the suggestion is that they are coming down too fast. Yet, at the same time, out the back door of this place, the Opposition will be saying to people, `We believe interest rates should be lower'. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is impossible for us to understand where the Opposition stands on these issues. It seems to me that its populism has got away with it and that there is no understanding of what the situation is and how sensible and maintainable policy should be determined. </PARA>
<PARA>  On top of that, the honourable member for Curtin decided that he would range to the area of household savings. The panacea for savings in this country is to be the Opposition's broadly based consumption tax. One only needs to speak to individuals in the electorate to understand the trepidation with which they face that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  More importantly, if a consumption tax will bring about a savings boost in this country, let us look for the empirical evidence elsewhere. I cannot find it. In New Zealand there has been no improvement in savings as a result of a broadly based consumption tax. The historical evidence and the evidence in New Zealand has been to the contrary. The evidence that this will effect the change that the Opposition thinks it will appears to be very sketchy anywhere.</PARA>
<PARA>  The broad based consumption tax is also, supposedly, to be the vehicle whereby we will be able to reduce tax rates. It is increasingly becoming clear that if the Opposition is to compensate individuals in respect of their taxation liability with the introduction of a broad based consumption tax there will be no net gains and there will be no possibility of the lowering of marginal tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have a Government that understands that there is a need for increased savings. As a result, over a period of time and through strict fiscal discipline, this Government was able to generate surpluses on its domestic budget. Hopefully, it will now be able--the Senate being willing--to legislate for superannuation, which will provide a massive pool of savings within our financial structure. It is clear to us that there is a need for Australians to save more. But it is unclear whether the Opposition has the solution. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remember very well the proposal put forward by a former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), when he floated the possibility of having interest on savings accounts corrected for inflation and therefore taxed accordingly. While this proposal lasted only for a week, it was an example of the Opposition's policy foresight and the depth in which it considers these issues that such a proposal was put forward by an Opposition leader, lasted a week and died a miserable death. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is the case that we have a foreign debt difficulty; that is an historical thing. It is the case that we are going through a period of transition in Australia, and that transition is painful. I have yet to hear a responsible economic commentator say that qualitatively there was not the requirement for a downturn in Australia's economy. Qualitatively, I believe that we had no alternative. While many would regret the extent of the downturn----</PARA>

The sensible and prudent approach to take in these circumstances is to run this Budget deficit this year.

If we were to take a more cutthroat fiscal position, as suggested by the Opposition, and if we were to have a balanced Budget and therefore perhaps not the requirement for this Loan Bill to be put before the House today, we would find a great deal more pain out there in the community, a great deal more difficulty for those people whom we purport to represent and a much slower recovery and a much deeper recession than we have at the moment. Such a philosophical approach and such a position would be irresponsible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to support the Opposition's amendment to the Loan Bill (No. 2). I have sat here and listened to the rather pathetic defence by the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) of what is, in many respects, the indefensible. I am not about to stand here and say that everything that this Government has done is wrong. The honourable member for Perth pointed to the fact that it has had some success in creating surpluses in the Budget in the past few years, although there has been a massive turnaround in this current Budget, where we have gone from a surplus to a significant deficit. I am not about to say that everything that this Government has done is wrong or bad, because it has done a few good things. But it is totally clear to us on this side, and to most people in Australia, that the negative or bad things far outweigh the positive or good things. I do not think there is any doubt about that proposition at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Perth challenges us to state clearly our position on interest rates. I take him up on that challenge. We do say that interest rates should be lower. Certainly, we want long term sustainable reductions in interest rates. The key word is sustainable. The honourable member for Perth ought to realise that real interest rates in this country, despite a drop of one per cent in the nominal rates, remain extremely high. Why are real interest rates in this country so high? Simply because of the economic mismanagement of this Government. There is a direct correlation between our real interest rate levels and the economic mismanagement of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  Clearly, the gap between Australian and offshore interest rates has grown consistently wider simply because the credit rating of this country has gone down and down under this Government's management. As a reflection of that reduced credit rate, we have had to pay more; we have had to compensate foreign lenders for the rising risks that they are taking by investing in this country and by exposing themselves to the risks inherent in that. There is the answer to that question. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course interest rates should be lower. Of course we applaud a reduction in interest rates. Let it be stated very clearly that interest rates are still way too high--at least when we talk about real interest rates--and that is a reflection of poor economic management. We are having to pay more to attract the funds that we need simply to get by. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Loan Bill (No. 2) 1991 is a machinery finance measure to enable certain Defence expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to supplement the moneys available to Consolidated Revenue. As has already been stated by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), we do not oppose this particular proposition, but the honourable member for Curtin has moved a very significant amendment. We have proposed that certain words be substituted. I would like to remind the House of those words. I am surprised that there are not more members of the Government in here to defend the Government's performance. This is a very significant amendment. We are proposing:</PARA>
<PARA>  That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>  `whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:</PARA>
<PARA>  (1)  engineering the worst economic recession for 60 years;</PARA>
<PARA>  (2)  knowingly putting over one million people out of work;</PARA>
<PARA>  (3)  its economic mismanagement and fiscal irresponsibility revealed in the Budget;</PARA>
<PARA>  (4)  failing to create a climate for increased national savings, investment, growth and jobs;</PARA>
<PARA>  (5)  not curtailing its own purpose spending, running a reckless deficit and plundering the savings of households and firms; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (6)  providing no leadership, no example and no hope to the people of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is an extremely significant amendment, which will be strongly supported by the Opposition. However, there are no members of the Government here, save for the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is at the table, to actually play a role in this debate. In recent days an increasing number of Government members have been prepared publicly to criticise the performance of the Hawke Government and to criticise, in particular, its most recent Budget--which, after all, is the straw that has broken the camel's back as far as the Australian people and the business community are concerned. I note that even the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) in the past few days has attempted to distance himself from the 1991-92 Budget. Let me say to Government members who may be listening in Parliament House somewhere that here is an opportunity for them to support an Opposition amendment. I am sure that there are some members on the other side of the House who would want to do that. I encourage them to do that, to stand up and be counted and to show some intestinal fortitude. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many Government members would be realising that their seats would be very much at risk at the next election because of the performance of the Hawke Government. They now have the opportunity to come in here and support this amendment and to tell their constituents that they do not want to be a part of the economic mismanagement which the Opposition is highlighting here and which was so starkly revealed in the recent Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  This worst economic recession for 60 years, for which we are condemning the Government here this afternoon, has spoilt the great Australian dream for many Australians. Many people will no longer be able to buy their own home, purchase a Holden or have any prospect of taking a holiday. This is because of the Government's ineptitude, economic mismanagement and fiscal irresponsibility. In the words that Dr Kim Hortree has used in his recently published book Life After Debt, the 1980s will be remembered as `the decade of the fabulous financial fiascos and boots and all borrowing'. Dr Hortree knows what he is talking about, because he is a former senior bank economist. </PARA>
<PARA>  A dark shadow has been cast over the 1990s, and the blame lies very much at the feet of this Government and its former failed Treasurer. Of late, we have come to realise--and I hope perhaps not too late--what it is to maintain a First World standard of living with a Third World style of economy. As we look back over the 1980s we find that it was a period marked by highs and lows. There was the resources boom which followed the 1982-83 recession, and the dollar float and fiscally inspired optimism of the middle 1980s, which of course gave way to the great Banana republic shock and the October stock market collapse of 1987. Then there was an investment boom in the late 1980s, but this of course was soured by the downgrading of Australia's credit rating in global terms and the crushing build-up of foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA>  As time went by, there were constant attempts to explain away what was happening. We heard the former Treasurer on many occasions stand up in this Parliament and attempt to tell us why the things he had said a month before would not happen had in fact happened. The Australian people were constantly misled or lulled into a false sense of security. A new set of terminologies became household words. Many of them were Keating-speak. For many months we heard of the J-curve, and yet, while things were changing everywhere else around the world, Australia remained pretty much the same. While our economy has evolved only slowly, the rest of the world has moved on ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>  The strong economic growth that was experienced in the mid-1980's, with GDP increasing on average by 5 per cent each year between 1983 and 1986, has of course now been revealed for what it was--that is, a very shallow result. It has become apparent that that growth was simply funded by a widening external deficit. That deficit, which has resulted in debt, is today causing severe problems and it will continue to act as a major constraint on growth throughout the whole of the 1990's and perhaps even beyond. </PARA>
<PARA>  From 1987 to 1989 the Government blew it yet again. As we look back over the years during which the honourable member for Blaxland was Treasurer, we are amazed that he made so many mistakes; that time after time, I assume on advice, he misread the signs and consequently made mistake after mistake. Between 1987 and 1989 we saw a period of overheating of the economy. Perhaps just when we had the opportunity for some movement ahead, the economy was allowed to overheat. An easy liquidity policy was introduced, almost in panic I suppose, after the 1987 stock market crash. We had the introduction of negative gearing. At the time we had strong commodity prices, which were contributing. We also enjoyed the boost from the bicentennial tourism. We had credit growth, good farming conditions and high immigration. During those years we saw the demand side of the economy grow by around 11 per cent, while the supply side grew by only five per cent. At this time consumerism was also at its height and the gap between supply and demand was inevitably met by imports, but that exacerbated the already evident external deficit problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are condemning the Government for engineering the current recession, the subject of the Opposition's amendment. We are talking here about what could almost be called a depression. The recession represents a severe backlash from the decade of debt and corporate collapses which brought down the curtain on the 1980s. What we are experiencing now is not another cyclical swing--in many respects we have come to live with those--but we have on our hands the need for a complete and absolute restructuring of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  After the honourable member for Perth (Mr Charlesworth) had spoken I agreed that some good things had come out of the last eight or nine years--although not too many--and said that he may be able to point to a few achievements of the Hawke Government. The honourable member for Perth referred to the Budget turnaround from deficit to surplus--and we applaud that. Financial deregulation was perhaps an achievement, although obviously, with the benefit of hindsight, it was not properly implemented. Also, the slowdown in the growth of real wages could be seen to have been a positive outcome of that time. However, these things pale into insignificance when one looks at the glaring failures of the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA>  Despite the rhetoric, the tax system remains in a mess. We are happy to debate this right up until the next election. We will not shy away from that, and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has made very clear his absolute commitment to the reform of the Australian taxation system, for it does remain in a mess and is badly in need of change. Any accountant one likes to ask will advise how out of control the tax system is, how there are pages and pages and reams of regulations and how the Act has grown like Topsy and is now really to the point where we need to scrap it all and go back to square one. To some extent that is what the Opposition proposes to do, as the tax system is indeed in a mess. </PARA>
<PARA>  The labour market is still centralised. It is virtually the only centralised labour market in the industrial world. Yet we tend to persevere. We are shackled with a centralised labour system. It is only in recent times that we suddenly started to hear the Government-- and, although the Government is using the words a little out of context, it is almost music to our ears--talk about decentralising the wage fixing system and about enterprise bargaining, although its understanding of it is, of course, rather different from ours. But at least it is an awakening, and we are astounded as we start to hear it use those words after the years that we have spent talking in this place about the need to move away from the shackles of that centralised system. When we look at structural reform, we find, of course, that it also is much more a wish than a reality. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition's amendment also calls on the House to condemn the Government for providing no leadership. As the Leader of the Opposition said the other day, the Prime Minister and the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, are fighting over who should have the honour of captaining the Titanic. I thought that comment was very apt. I thought also that the Budget could be seen very much as an exercise in rearranging the deck chairs on the same ship. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our amendment also condemns the Government for engineering the worst economic recession for 60 years. The people of Australia are not going to forgive the Government for this. However the Government may attempt to explain it away, on the former Treasurer's own admission this was a recession that was engineered; this was the recession that we `had to have'. They were his words. So this recession that we are experiencing was deliberately inflicted on Australian families and it has destroyed the livelihood of a million Australians. I think the Government will stand condemned by the Australian people for that come the next election--and for most Australians out there, I would think that the sooner that next election comes the better. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister continues to struggle to hold onto his own job. Ironically, many Australians at this time are also struggling to hold onto their own jobs. As many as 322,000 Australians have lost their jobs since the last election and 831,900 Australians are officially out of work. Already in this place today we have underlined time and again that we are talking about official statistics. These statistics vastly understate the number of unemployed Australians, those who have for one reason or another given up looking for work. Of course the statistics make no attempt to measure the number of Australians who are considerably underemployed, who would like to work more but cannot do so. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government calls itself a Labor Government. I would think that that is a misnomer. It is in fact a no-labour Government. The further we go, we will see this more and more. Members of the Opposition are not gloating over this at all. We are all touched personally, almost on a daily basis in our offices, by the plight of people coming to us who have lost their businesses, who are facing bankruptcy, who just cannot make ends meet any more. We are touched by the difficulties that that creates for families, for relationships and for children who are taken out of school because their parents can no longer afford to send them there. We hear it every day, and we are not gloating over it. We believe that this Government stands condemned for what it has done. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is also through this Government's economic mismanagement that Australia's net external debt has built up to absolutely alarming proportions. Australia is now amongst the 20 most debt ridden countries in the world. Our gross debt compares poorly with those of other industrialised countries but, worse, it is also on a par with those of many developing economies. Australia has the largest balance of payment deficit relative to GDP in the Western world, and we continue to accumulate debt faster than any other country in the OECD. I often talk to people about debt and the fact that, last year, our debt grew by $15 billion. After all, that was meant to be a good result because the budgeted deficit was to be $18 billion, and it turned out that we lost only a further $15 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>  The problem with debt on an economy-wide basis is exactly the same as it is in a household; that is, it has to be serviced. We hope that ultimately it is paid back, but in the meantime, of course, the problem is that it has to be serviced. This enormous debt that we have built up has been used largely to support consumption. We have effectively borrowed from our children to maintain our living standards, and that is a terrible indictment on the Government. The higher interest rates that we have had to offer to attract funds and support the Australian dollar have impacted severely on businesses and families. Australia is a land of enormous potential situated on the edge of the fastest growing markets in the world, but large portions of our economy remain completely handicapped. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This Loan Bill (No. 2) and the Opposition amendment give the Parliament an opportunity to get the Government's management--or, rather, mismanagement--of the Australian economy into some perspective. The necessity for this Bill is related to the extent of deficit in the Government's overall accounts. It is the Loan Bill (No. 2). The previous Loan Bill debated in March this year was to cover the impact on the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the possible collapse of the planned Budget surplus for 1990-91. But prior to that, we would have to go back to about 1987 for a similar measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Contributing significantly to the necessity for this Bill, as previous speakers have made plain, is the extent of the recession in this country at the present time. The Treasurer (Mr Kerin) in introducing the Budget referred to the past year as `a disappointing year'. One might wonder just how much understatement the new Treasurer wants to indulge in. We have a situation--and let me review it briefly and reinforce some of the comments made by my colleague the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), who has just spoken--in which 832,000 Australians are officially unemployed, upwards of 400,000 are, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in effect assented to in the last week of sittings, underemployed and at least 100,000 more are discouraged job seekers. So we have upwards of 1.3 million Australians unemployed or underemployed, with all the hurt, hardship, deprivation and devastated self-esteem that that represents. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the small business sector there is also devastation. Many small businesses have gone to the wall because of murderously high interest rates. Businesses which should not have done so were driven to the wall because business interest rates were pushed to more than 20 per cent for much longer than one year. That is not to mention the large business sector, where even in the mining area, in respect of which the Treasurer from time to time makes reference to things holding up, things are by no means crash hot. Indeed, as recent company reports have shown, companies in that area are bleeding as well. </PARA>
<PARA>  As to investment in the mining sector, I would warn the Treasurer that that is fragile enough in the wake of the purely political decision against Coronation Hill and the maintenance of the absurd and illogical three uranium mine policy--not to mention of course the Green blocking of world scale plant investments in wood, pulp and paper, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>  In totality, what we have had is a collapse of non-farm growth in this recession nearly double the collapse of non-farm growth in the 1982 recession. This is, indeed, the worst recession since the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA>  As my colleague hinted a moment ago, we might ask: where is the dividing line between a recession and a depression? A Freudian slip it may have been, but during Question Time in the last week of sitting the Treasurer did actually refer to `depression'. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have a situation where the aggregate of national spending has fallen significantly in each of the past five quarters to a cumulative total of now 7 per cent. That is no gentle dip. As the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) mentioned earlier, investment spending in relation to GDP is currently at the lowest level for 30 years. But the fall in total national spending of about 7 per cent is no gentle dip; it represents nearly $25 billion of private and public spending on an annual basis. That is more than the current Commonwealth annual spending on defence, health and education put together. No, we are not in depression, but it is a very deep recession. </PARA>

Then there is the other major Keating legacy: our vast and crippling foreign debt of $165 billion gross at last count. It is down a few billion, but the total of foreign liabilities is up. That figure for debt represents a five- fold increase since the advent of this Government. It is the most rapid accumulation of debt in the world, stemming, of course, from our persistent structural balance of payments deficit--the $1 billion, give or take a bit, that we hear about every month and that people rightly get excited about but then the Government forgets----</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes, it conditions us to an expectation of a certain figure and, if it is a little below that, there is rejoicing. But $1 billion is about $50m extra into hock every day, from this time yesterday to this time today. I was conducting someone around the Parliament building the other day and we were commenting on what a magnificent building it is. But the person said, `Oh, but the cost was over $1 billion'. `Yes', I said, `one month's borrowing'! That is what it was. That is the sort of order of magnitude that we need to take on board. That costs, for the interest to service it, about $1,000 per annum for every man, woman and child in Australia. The total is about $17 billion, and the population is 17 million; honourable members can do the arithmetic for themselves. That is certainly what it costs every Australian, directly or indirectly. Of course, the entity or business which incurred the specific debt overseas pays the interest directly, if the entity has not been liquidated and departed the scene; but, indirectly, one way or another, we all pay, and it is a significant subtraction from living standards. So, as I have said, `a disappointing year' is a tremendous understatement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  What we have, involving the need for this Bill, is this very deep home-grown recession. It has been a home-grown recession, brought on by bad policy, with the failed former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, the chief architect. It is in fact the `Keating recession', the one `we had to have', as my colleague quoted a moment ago. </PARA>
<PARA>  But we did not have to have it. If I can take a few moments on that, I would like to refer to the fact that on this side of the House one gets sick and tired of hearing the Prime Minister, in particular, parroting, as he did during the last week of sitting at Question Time, both Tuesday and Wednesday, about the fact that a slowing of the economy was necessary--`to be responsible, we had to do it'. I quote from his answer on this matter:</PARA>
<PARA>I am proud of the fact that when we were faced by circumstances, as we were, where the rate of increase in expenditure was twice as fast as the increase in production . . . he--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the former Treasurer--</PARA>
<PARA>and I . . . had the courage to take the decisions that were necessary in those circumstances to slow down the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  But the point I want to underline is that the circumstances that he referred to--the action he had to take--were circumstances largely of the Government's own making. That is not just my say-so; it is the concerted judgment of recognised commentators pretty well across the spectrum of opinion, including the present Treasurer, perhaps the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who have also made statements on the matter in recent times. It would include many journalists; the Opposition, of course, to a man and a woman; the recent technical study, the Tasman Institute's Treasurer Keating's Legacy; and, albeit in rather more muted terms, the Treasury itself in Budget Paper No. 1 for 1989, and certainly the current one at page 2.31. </PARA>
<PARA>  The situation was that, after the downturn in 1986, the then Treasurer wanted to boost the economy. On top of a commodity price surge--which I recognise--the then Treasurer deliberately eased monetary policy in the early part of 1987 in the run-up to the election that year. He eased it further after the stock market crash later that year, and the easing continued in the run-up to the March 1988 New South Wales election. Honourable members will perhaps remember Mr Barrie Unsworth. All that brought on the dramatically overheated economy of late 1988 and 1989--and further there was an actual easing of fiscal policy in the 1989 Budget--and it  brought on the situation to which the Prime Minister so constantly refers, that the Government `had to act because national spending was growing twice as fast as national product'. It was. Spending increased by about 8 per cent; national product by about 4 per cent. But it was the Government's doing--that is the point--and I am concentrating on the spending side. I might, of course, also mention the production side--up only 4 per cent. That was because of the laid- back, non-existent approach of this Government to micro-economic reform which could have added so much to production--`the wasted years' that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) referred to this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA>  Then, having reached that point, it intervened every bit as ineptly to slow the economy. I refer to an article by Paul Cleary in the Sydney Morning Herald last year which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government--</PARA>
<PARA>after April 1988--</PARA>
<PARA>played ducks and drakes on monetary policy, continually saying that each tightening would be the last. </PARA>
<PARA>  It should have admitted spending and credit growth were out of control, that the party was over and that short, sharp increases in monetary policy were in store. </PARA>
<PARA>  [It pushed] business rates to more than 20 per cent for more than one year. </PARA>
<PARA>  It waited until everything apart from employment, was turning down before easing. In the end it produced the overkill that is here for all to see. </PARA>
<PARA>I also refer to an article by Glenda Korporaal in the Age a couple of months ago:</PARA>
<PARA>The current recession has its roots in the over- generous monetary policy that Keating and his advisers oversaw in 1987 and 1988. This over- stimulated the economy, pulling in too many imports and causing a further blowout of the current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>  Keating changed tack in 1988 gradually tightening monetary policy. But instead of publicly signalling the change, he initially denied it and then presided over a gradual notching-up of rates throughout 1988. The initial tentativeness meant that it took far too long, at a cost of punitively high interest rates to dampen activity. In retrospect, interest rates were then too high for too long, turning the expected soft landing into a severe recession. </PARA>
<PARA>So what I am stressing to the Parliament and to those listening is that this was a home- grown recession, and more than one million Australians on the unemployment scrap heap is the outcome. That is Labor's achievement in this, its centenary year, and the Australian people are not going to forget it. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have, with this Loan Bill as part of the process, a Budget which does not address the deep-seated economic problems of which the severe recession and the burgeoning overseas debt are the outcomes. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was right when he said that this Budget is more about preserving the job of the Prime Minister than preserving the jobs of Australians. In particular it does nothing to encourage new investment, which, as I said, is currently at its lowest level for 30 years. Investment is the key to renewed growth, but the Government does nothing, as I said, to address it seriously, nor our balance of payments and debt problems. The Government's central failing is a massive Budget deficit. In respect of new investment there is a situation of squeezed profits. So often we hear from the Prime Minister about the profit share and so on under his Government, but corporate profits after tax and after interest are at their lowest level for 25 years, as shown in a graph in the Budget papers, and possibly for the whole of the period since World War II. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget deficit of $4.7 billion, and probably much more than that, requires this Loan Bill for financing. That Budget deficit can only mean continued high real interest rates. With squeezed profits and continued high interest rates, there is no investment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, there are other features. Except for the Treasurer mouthing his favourite phrase, `a more devolved wages system', there is no effective procedure for moving to an enterprise based wage bargaining system. There is no program with any sense of urgency for essential structural reform, and there is no proposal for the tax reform which is so urgently needed. Perhaps the only specific proposal is the ill thought through proposal for a legislated superannuation levy, which, as it stands, is nothing more than a multi-billion dollar payroll tax calculated to boost unemployment by 100,000. The fact that it is ill thought through is witnessed by the Treasurer's commitment since the Budget to provide a detailed study of the proposal before Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whether we are talking about a Loan Bill or Budget Bills, the fact is that in Australia's difficult economic circumstances there is no alternative to fundamental change. Tinkering at the edges will not solve our economic problems. We on this side of the House will put before the Australian people an across-the-board reform agenda, proposed with understanding, commitment and determination, that will act as the catalyst for improved business attitudes and expectations. It is a program that will increase productivity and competitiveness and enable us to trade our way to a reduced current account deficit and the stabilisation--and, in time, an actual reduction--of the enormous overseas debt, and that will increase the capacity to provide jobs. It is a program that will result in a larger and increasing national cake so there is more for everybody--more for pensions and social security, more for essential city infrastructure if it is insisted upon, more for rural development, more for defence and, most importantly, more for investment. Investment must be sustained at a high level over the next few years if we are to get anywhere near trading our way out of the overseas debt and providing rising standards of living. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we do it right and if everybody pulls his weight, the prize can be, as the Governor of the Reserve Bank said recently, fantastic. It is of the order of an extra $50 billion of national production, the equivalent of about 3 to 4 years of extra growth on top of what we are getting. That is no figment of the imagination; it is a hard nosed economic calculation by the Industry Commission and others. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need a bit of leadership and vision. We know what has to be done, but the crowd  opposite--with a diminished Prime Minister, a chewed-up-inside Keating and the rest of the squabbling, disunited rabble--simply cannot deliver. The ACTU and the Left, by the very nature of things, prevent it from doing so. As I said, we know what has to be done. Believe me, it will not be easy--fundamental change never is--and in some respects it will be a long haul. Yet there is no other way, and the prizes for success are great indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In seconding the amendment to Loan Bill (No. 2) 1991 as moved by my colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), I would like to make a few brief comments--firstly, on the amendment and, secondly, to correct some of the mistakes the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) made in his contribution to this debate. The amendment shows very clearly just where the Government has gone so wrong, and it quite rightly condemns the Government for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  First of all, I congratulate my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) for his most lucid explanation of the Keating years. I think he put, chapter and verse, the level of the damage that the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating)--together with his Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his Government--has done to this nation. It is quite tragic to see what has been done by a person who now seems, quite unashamedly, to be allowing his naked ambition to get the better of him in his attempts to try to knock off his own Prime Minister. Yet the record is there for everyone to see, and it should be explained daily to the people of Australia so they can see what has been done. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendment itself refers to the worst economic recession in 60 years. This was the recession that was engineered by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland. It goes on to talk about putting over one million people out of work--this in a Labor Government having the highest unemployment in over 60 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Quite right. As the honourable member for Curtin has said, it is probably about time the Party of honourable members opposite considered a new name. Obviously `Labor' is no longer appropriate; it would have to be `no labour'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>   My colleague the honourable member for Curtin pointed out in some detail the economic mismanagement and the fiscal irresponsibility revealed in the Budget and said how sad it is for the people of Australia that this Government has not taken the tough decisions, has not been prepared to face up to reality and is allowing things just to drift on. In the fourth part of the amendment we talk about the failure to create a climate for increased national savings, investment, growth and jobs--all the things that this country is desperately crying out for. Where are they?</PARA>
<PARA>  In the Budget, which lasted only about two hours before it was knocked over, we find little to give any encouragement that we will see any of these things happening. As we point out, we are now seeing a massive deficit, a deficit masked in many parts by asset sales. The real deficit is obviously far greater. So much for the talk about savings, when the Government finds that its own economic mismanagement has forced it to run a major Budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, the most telling criticism or condemnation is that the Government is no longer providing leadership, example or hope for the people of Australia. This was reflected in the way the honourable member for Perth presented his case. He obviously did not have his heart in it; like many people in the Government, he has virtually given up. He has realised it has become too much for him. He has seen the failures, mainly engineered by the honourable member for Blaxland, together with his Prime Minister, that have left those on the back bench with very little hope of any worthwhile future after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>  I come to a couple of detailed points. In particular, the honourable member for Perth taunted the Opposition by asking whether it would increase or maintain a higher wool tax. It is a great pity that when the Government changed the accounting method for the wool tax--the wool levy that is levied on the gross proceeds of all woolgrowers--and allowed it to be included within the Budget Papers, it did not highlight the fact that it is an industry levy, levied on woolgrowers to run the Australian Wool Corporation and its associated bodies. It is important that all honourable members understand that it is not part of the Government revenue; it is very much an industry levy raising money for industry purposes. It should not be counted in terms of the overall Budget Papers. I hope that the honourable member for Perth will realise his mistake. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member brought up a couple of other matters which ought to be highlighted. He taunted us about whether there should be cuts in the area of training. I remind him that the most important thing is to have jobs first before we start worrying about training. There is no point in increasing training if those people who are being trained cannot find jobs. I am sure all honourable members would have examples of people who are absolutely desperate. They have done their training and have gone back and done further training because they cannot get a job. These are genuine cases of people who are perfectly capable of holding down a job in normal times but in the current climate--in the recession that the former Treasurer said we had to have--they are being thrown on the scrap heap. As has been pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on a number of occasions, the real fear now is not just of losing one's job; there are many who are terrified that they will not be able to get another job--and this with a Government that operates under the guise of a labour party. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Berowra made reference to a recent publication by the Tasman Institute of the Keating legacy. I believe that ought to be compulsory reading for every member of this chamber. I think it should be circulated amongst all Australians because it shows quite categorically how heavily Australians have paid for the mismanagement of the honourable member for Blaxland. It shows very clearly what the Keating gap really is--the gap where we had higher interest rates than did the rest of the OECD for a number of years and where we had a higher inflation rate than the OECD average for a number of years, and it shows quite clearly that not only were these parts of the former Treasurer's financial policies but also that Australia has paid very dearly for that mismanagement. Hence we now have the worst recession in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is also salutary to note the limp attempt by the honourable member for Perth to ask about the future of a goods and services tax. I got the impression that he had very ambivalent feelings towards it. I suspect he knows in his own heart that it would be very much to the benefit of all Australians if a goods and services tax were to replace the wholesale sales tax, along with an overall reform of the taxation system. I think it was one of the least convincing attempts to attack that tax that I have heard in a long time. His heart was not in it. Maybe that sums up the whole approach to his support for the Government's policies in general. </PARA>
<PARA>  He also spoke about the importance of raising the level of savings. He tried to talk about the importance of the Budget surplus. The fact is that savings in Australia are falling. Private savings are falling and they will continue to fall while we are in a very serious recession. The most important thing is to get the economy right to encourage individuals to start saving before we start going on to some manufactured type of savings such as a compulsory superannuation levy. If we do not have the economy in the right frame and if we do not have real progress, then a compulsory superannuation levy becomes, as my colleague the honourable member for Berowra has pointed out, a form of payroll tax which will increase the number of unemployed by anything up to 100,000 people. I do not believe that will serve any useful purpose for Australians. Superannuation is a great idea, but it should not be compulsory, as the present Government is pushing for. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, we have to remind ourselves that is was the honourable member for Blaxland who said that this was the recession we had to have. I am sure when he made that statement that he had no idea how serious this recession would be. I feel that, unfortunately, Australians are going to bear a lot more pain for many more months because of the mistakes of this Government. While the panic decision today to reduce interest rates would be welcomed by all Australians who have borrowings, the fact is we have got to have policies in place that will lead to a sustained reduction in real interest rates, not just a one- off stab in the dark, hoping that somehow things will come right when we still do not have the correct policies in place. I have much pleasure in seconding this amendment, which I believe truly sums up what this Government should be condemned for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The first Budget of the current Treasurer (Mr Kerin)--and, who knows, perhaps it will be his last--represents a continuation of the recessionary policies of his predecessor, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). The superficial differences in style between the current Treasurer and the former Treasurer--with which the press gallery are all agog--do little to conceal the fact that the Government's failed economic policy framework remains essentially unchanged. The previous Treasurer gave us the worst recession in 60 years. The current Treasurer is failing in the task of lifting us out of that same recession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The 1991-92 Budget contains several key clauses which serve to postpone any return to strong and sustainable economic growth in the foreseeable future. There is a serious weakness in the Government's conduct of fiscal policy which has delivered us a projected Budget deficit of $4.7 billion but, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has pointed out, the actual Budget deficit is much larger than this figure would indicate. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we abstract from the Government's usual Budget fudges such things as the proceeds from asset sales, the transfer of maturing debt to the States, receipts from government business enterprise superannuation and profit transfers from the Commonwealth and Reserve banks, we find that we have a Budget deficit more of the order of $10.7 billion. The projected Budget deficit for 1991-92 is not just the result of cyclical factors running down revenue collections during a recession; as Deputy Reserve Bank Governor John Phillips said in a speech in Brisbane recently, the Budget contains `a significant discretionary element'. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has also been an increase in outlays of some 5.7 per cent in nominal terms and 2.6 per cent in real terms. Commonwealth own account spending will increase by 4.9 per cent in real terms in 1991-92, bringing such spending above the levels of 1983, at 18.2 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget contains a number of large spending initiatives, most notably the $800m so-called better cities program, which Australia simply cannot afford at the present time, even if we could be assured that centrally planned cities were in some way a good thing. These spending initiatives undermine what are otherwise some admirable exercises in expenditure restraint contained in the Budget, particularly in the area of health. But what did we see at Question Time today? That Budget initiative is under threat;  the Prime Minister was fulminating against every indication that he is going to get rolled in Caucus on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA>  The most important consequence of the forecast Budget deficit will be its effects on the net public sector borrowing requirement. We are now looking at a net public sector borrowing requirement for 1991-92 equal to 4.3 per cent of GDP, compared with minus 1.6 per cent as recently as in 1988-89. The public sector in Australia has once again become a net borrower, drawing upon the nation's savings at the expense of who else than the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's bond selling program will need to increase from $2 billion to some $11 billion. This will serve to keep interest rates high and to crowd out already low levels of private sector investment. Coupled with the current low inflation environment, this will mean that Australia will continue to labour under some of the highest real interest rates in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  A strong fiscal policy needs to be complemented by a sensible wages policy. But what do we see? The Government has rhetorically recognised the need in principle to move towards a more flexible wage fixing system. However, this Budget, like those of the former Treasurer, does nothing to move us in that direction. There is no attempt to move towards true enterprise bargaining and workplace productivity as the basis for wage determination. Instead, wages policy continues as a series of ad hoc compromises with the trade union movement undermining labour productivity and placing severe constraints on the other arms of macro-economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Instead of seeking a more sensible basis for the determination of unit labour costs, the Government has used this Budget to introduce a de facto payroll tax in the form of the superannuation guarantee levy. My honourable friend the member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) made mention of that in an earlier debate. Forced employer contributions to this levy will begin at 5 per cent next July, increasing to 9 per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's proposed legislated minimum levels of employer contributions have been modelled for the Australian economy, the results of which show that the levy will increase unemployment by around 100,000 people by 1994-95 as well as contribute to inflation. The true folly of this measure, however, lies in the fact that it will not increase the pool of national savings. It will simply result in the diversion of savings into superannuation at the expense of other types of savings. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note that the level of national savings has collapsed in this country at the same time as pooled superannuation funds have ballooned in size. In terms of monetary policy, there is a continuing absence of any strategy to secure low inflation outcomes and lower inflationary expectations, most importantly, over the medium to long term. The Government's approach to inflation continues to reflect the political expediency that characterised the honourable member for Blaxland's approach to this issue. Low inflation figures are hailed as successes, when in fact they are symptomatic of other profound policy failures. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is sanguine about the prospects for the current account deficit, forecasting continuing improvements in the trade account. The Government is ignoring, however, the role of high real interest rates in drawing in foreign capital and keeping the exchange rate at levels which retard international competitiveness for our exports. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our exchange rate has hardly shifted against that of our major trading partners in the last two years. The possibility of a further deterioration in our terms of trade raises the prospect of a blow-out in the current account deficit. The Budget thus fails in meeting what Budget Statement No. 2 describes as `the important policy challenges', namely, generating enduring employment growth, ensuring that the gains made on inflation are sustained and built upon, and reducing the current account deficit and stabilising our external debt relative to GDP. </PARA>
<PARA>  The lead-up to this Budget was notable for the exchange of words between the Treasurer and the honourable member for Blaxland over the best way to conduct macro-economic policy. This exchange was part of the ongoing leadership struggle in the Hawke Government, which is consuming so much of the Government's time and what little energy it has left, to the detriment of sound policy development and implementation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, used some comments from the current Treasurer to launch an unprecedented attack on the current Treasurer's handling of the economy. The attack was published as a feature in both the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. The honourable member for Blaxland upbraided the current Government for adopting a medium term view of monetary policy, and contrasted this to his own short term activist style of policy making and implementation. The former Treasurer declared that `the medium term rumble is an echo of an old conservative incantation that did not work in the past and should be dismissed by any Government worth its salt--especially a Labor Government'. That is familiar talk from the former Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA>  The disastrous consequences of this activist approach to economic policy, championed by the honourable member for Blaxland, have been well documented in a study that was recently published by the Tasman Institute entitled `Treasurer Keating's Legacy'. Both my friends the honourable member for Berowra and the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) referred to that article in an earlier debate. The authors, Peter Hartley and Michael Porter, identified the chief legacy of the Keating years as excessively high inflation and excessively high interest rates relative to the Group of Seven leading members of the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA>  These high interest rates resulted in the real cost of short term borrowing in Australia averaging some 2.5 percentage points above the average cost found in the Group of Seven countries between 1983 and 1990. This excess of Australian over foreign real interest rates the authors have appropriately dubbed `the Keating gap'. I like it! The Keating gap stems from an excessively high rate of average money growth in Australia which has caused our high levels of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>  As is now widely appreciated, Australia's inflation rate was well above the OECD average between 1983 and 1990. These high levels of inflation in turn contributed to higher nominal interest rates. Interest rates were also kept high by the variable and unpredictable nature of monetary policy under the stewardship of the former Treasurer. This variability and unpredictability has made investing in Australian assets a much riskier undertaking than it needed to be. Consequently, there has been a significant risk premium built into our nominal interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was the honourable member for Blaxland's conduct of monetary policy that gave us our high real interest rates and the subsequent recession we `had to have'. It is not entirely surprising then that the new Treasurer should repudiate the short term activist approach to monetary policy championed by his predecessor in favour of a more neutral stance and a medium term policy outlook. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not long after becoming Treasurer, Mr Kerin gave a speech entitled `Policies and attitudes for the 1990s:  some lessons from the 1980s'. In that speech, he made a number of interesting observations about the Government's handling of macro-economic policy up till then and they are worth quoting. Amongst other things he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is now obvious that the Government ran a too loose fiscal and monetary policy in the mid- 1980s--that we traded off a tighter fiscal policy for a looser monetary policy in the late 80s, particularly after the stock market crash--that we underestimated the strength of the terms of trade turnaround and the strength of the asset price boom--that the 89/90 tax cut meant monetary policy had to be tighter--and that during 1989 monetary policy was tightened too far. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Before dinner I quoted the Treasurer. Needless to say, this has been the Opposition's analysis of the Government's conduct of macro-economic policy in recent years. In other words, the very thing that the Treasurer had to say was what we had been pointing out to him and his colleagues. On that occasion the Treasurer observed:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>With this experience in mind, it is clear that it is desirable to move to setting macroeconomic policy in a medium term framework rather than responding in a knee-jerk way to the latest economic statistics. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, because of the varied and unpredictable lags involved, short term fine tuning of macroeconomic policy can run the risk of actually being pro-cyclical, thus aggravating fluctuations in activity caused by international circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>Qualified support for this position is also to be found in the Treasury's Budget Statement No. 2 for 1991-92, which observes:</PARA>
<PARA>The past five years have provided a clear reminder of the difficulties that macro-economic policy faces when economic events are unusually difficult to predict, where economic trends are not easily discernible and where policy responses operate with substantial and uncertain lags. Those circumstances will always confront, in varying degree, an internationally open economy like Australia's. This points to the advantages of relating policy more to the medium term and assigning policy instruments to their area of greater effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an explicit repudiation of the Keating approach to macro-economic policy and of his legacy to the Australian economy. However, this has been a repudiation in words only, which so far has not been translated into a change in the Government's actual policy framework. The Government has not put in place the mechanisms by which monetary policy in particular can be managed with a view to the medium and long term. </PARA>
<PARA>  Monetary policy is still hostage to the whims of the Government and the bureaucracy, rather than being set by an independent authority with an explicit mandate to pursue medium to long term objectives. Strong monetary growth in 1990, coupled with a return to deficit financing in this year's Budget, would strongly suggest that we are about to enter another round of stop-go monetary and fiscal policy that will prolong the effects of the recession. The current Treasurer's views will ultimately make little difference if the honourable member for Blaxland takes over the reins of policy again, this time as Prime Minister, and reasserts his position on the conduct of macro-economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The former Treasurer made it abundantly clear in his article for the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age that he would return to the short term, activist style of policy making if once again given the opportunity. The conclusion of Hartley and Porter was that politicians of the honourable member for Blaxland's character and ability can:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . do both great good and great harm. His period as Treasurer was marked by some successful reforms, but also by some appalling failures. If he becomes Prime Minister, we--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the authors--</PARA>
<PARA>sincerely hope that he will have learned from these mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, in his article for the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age the ex-Treasurer shows no signs of having learned from his past mistakes. It is only recently that he has deigned to admit to them. This must be largely because he does not accept responsibility for them. What is new about that?</PARA>
<PARA>  The attempts of the honourable member for Blaxland to avoid taking responsibility for the recession which he inflicted on this country through his manipulation of policy are laughable. Honourable members will recall that the former Treasurer once boasted that he had `Treasury in my pocket, the Reserve Bank in my pocket', and will recall his claim that Reserve Bank officials `do what I say; that you can put your money on'. It now transpires, in the Keating version of events, as he rewrites history, that the ex-Treasurer did not have nearly as much influence as he claimed when it came to the crucial turning points in macro-economic policy over the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA>  In his article for the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, the ex-Treasurer now says that with the benefit of hindsight he would have done things differently. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>I would have been less accommodating in the second half of 1987 to the monetary authorities' willingness to cut interest rates in the face of a substantial fiscal policy tightening. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on in the same article to note:</PARA>
<PARA>I would also have been more insistent in following my own view in 1988 to lift interest rates earlier and harder, and I would have given greater weight to those individuals in the Treasury and the Reserve Bank who wanted to similarly tighten policy. </PARA>
<PARA>And once we had started cutting interest rates in January 1990, I should have been even more insistent than I was against Treasury and Reserve Bank advice in getting interest rates down more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA>Notice how in each of these quotes the ex- Treasurer suggests that he had a better idea of the correct course of action to follow than did his Reserve Bank and Treasury subordinates. It turns out that the ex-Treasurer did not have these institutions in his pocket while he held that office and before the onset of his recession to the degree that he would have had us believe. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the report which I mentioned earlier, Hartley and Porter observed:</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the most important legacy Mr Keating has bequeathed is that he has powerfully demonstrated that Australia would be much better off if fiscal and monetary policy were depoliticised. </PARA>
<PARA>Depoliticising the conduct of macro-economic policy is the very essence of coalition economic policies. These are among the raft of policies that will serve us well come the next Federal election, and they will provide a very sharp contrast with those of the Labor Party under the leadership of either Hawke or Keating. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I think this Budget is uninspiring and a bit cautious. My criticism is that it lacks a clear vision of a future Australian economy which successfully accommodates acceptable levels of economic and employment growth with an inflation level about equal to other OECD countries. There is acceptance of inevitably low growth levels and a slow and patchy economic recovery. There are some very laudable measures, such as the legislative push for universal superannuation, but also measures which I think are socially divisive and politically untenable--for example, the Medicare co-payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  According to Treasury, the Australian economy went into recession as a result of a fall in the terms of trade, the unwinding of asset price build-ups, the collapse of the construction sector, including non-residential and housing, and also a downturn in plant and equipment investment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The prime cause was an excessive reliance on high interest rates and a reluctance to reduce early enough. In 1989 we were told that high interest rates were necessary to restrain imports and foreign debt. We are now informed that high real interest rates are needed to bear down further on inflation. There are economic and social costs to this approach--low growth and rising unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  One has to be concerned, I believe, at the Budget forecast: private domestic demand averaging minus 0.25 per cent and gross national expenditure averaging only a 0.25 per cent increase. Exports are projected to be up 5.25 per cent, but business and plant and equipment investment are down yet again, by 10.5 per cent and 8 per cent. Gross domestic product, after falling by almost one per cent last year, is projected at 1.5 per cent average growth for 1991-92. Unemployment is projected to peak at 10.75 per cent, or 910,000 persons, and average 10.5 per cent for the year. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last year I questioned the GDP projections of plus 2 per cent and said unemployment would greatly exceed the Budget projection of 7.25 per cent. I am concerned about whether this year's predictions will be more accurate. The failure to achieve the expected growth projections saw unemployment peak last July at 9.8 per cent, or approximately 832,000 people--up 320,000 in 16 months. This financial year, 1.5 per cent growth must be achieved in order to average 10.5 per cent unemployment. One must ask: what are the likely unemployment figures if even this small growth forecast is not met? For example, zero per cent growth could see unemployment peak at around 12 per cent--or one million persons plus--in the March quarter next year. There is also much hidden unemployment, given falling participation rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  The $4.7 billion deficit does little to stimulate further economic activity. Although outlays are estimated to increase by 2.6 per cent in real terms, increased outlays on unemployment benefits account for 2.1 percentage points of this growth. Econocrats refer to this as the `automatic stabilisers' at work. They would argue that, if during the recession the cyclical deficit is not reduced, an automatic stimulus is involved. It is a rather novel economic line to argue that there is a stimulus in the payment of unemployment benefits as an alternative to the receipt of wages and salaries. I am not convinced that a strong recovery will be under way automatically by Christmas or that growth will increase, on average, by 1.5 per cent this financial year. But even if this projection is achieved, it is an unacceptably low level of activity. </PARA>
<PARA>  The social and political dangers of stagnation and unemployment inherent within a sedated economy are, in my opinion, a greater risk than import growth and inflation in a resurgent economy. The Australian labour movement and the business sector, I think, have been concerned at the dominance of monetary purists in the Treasury and the Reserve Bank--those who see the prime task as bearing down harder on inflation at the expense of growth in industry and employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Already, Australian inflation has been reduced from a yearly average of 8 per cent two years ago to 5.3 per cent, and now to a current annual rate of 3.4 per cent. This is commendable, but now 3 per cent is forecast for 1991-92. This is fine, but the inflationary projections of our major OECD trading partners are currently forecast at 4.25 per cent. Germany is currently running at 4.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  All this implies that the Treasury and the Government believe that Australia not only has to equal its OECD partners on the inflation front but also actually has to improve on their performance. If that is the belief, and they intend to work that through, there is a cost to Australians--and that cost is rocketing unemployment. In Illawarra--that is, virtually in my electorate--there are 6,000 people under the age of 24 registered as unemployed in Corrimal, Wollongong, Warrawong and Dapto. This is the triumph of ideologues and the slaughter of the innocents. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget Papers predict recovery this financial year, driven by an upturn in housing starts, private consumption, the replenishment of stocks and also by net exports. Recovery will arrive--there is no doubt about that--eventually; but, as in the United States and the United Kingdom, it will be slow and it will be extremely patchy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Given that housing interest rates have already fallen by 4 per cent to 13 per cent, one would expect a strong recovery in housing starts. But 1991-92 is not 1987-88. In July of 1988 unemployment stood at 6.8 per cent. Today it is 10 per cent, with substantial numbers of hidden unemployment. Consumer and business confidence is quite low. Housing loans and sales were up substantially in May and June, followed by a July surge in housing approvals. However, the industry reports flat sales in August. That is the anecdotal evidence coming through, for example, to the Housing Industry Association. We are witnessing not the commencement of a housing boom but a modest increase in housing starts projected at 135,000 for 1991-92. It is welcome, but it is moderate--not a huge kick- start to the whole Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  High real interest rates have been deterring potential investment in plant and equipment and business investment. Projections are down by 8 per cent and 10.5 per cent respectively. Manufacturing exports have been a success story with strong growth--at least until recently. This is partly the result of the 1985- 86 depreciation of the Australian dollar, but much of that competitive advantage has now dissipated as a result of high interest rates--again, holding up the dollar. Manufacturing investment has fallen 4 per cent in the March quarter and is 11.5 per cent below the corresponding level of last year. Manufacturing employment has fallen 3 per cent in the June quarter and is down 6.5 per cent on the level a year earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>  I cannot understand the Treasury's reliance upon growth in private consumption as a prime agent of economic recovery, given that final private domestic demand is projected to recover only from minus 2 per cent growth to minus 0.25 per cent. Australia also will not receive much stimulus from overseas. Although the US Federal Reserve has recently reduced interest rates, it believes that national economic conditions are improving only at a very slow and uneven pace. The United States is beset by $300 billion-plus budgetary deficits, which will not be easily turned around and will push up long term US interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  The UK economy is still in deep recession. According to the Bundesbank, which I spoke to in Frankfurt, the reunified Germany, which I visited recently, after stimulus from reunification is now concerned with the effects of increased public borrowing and inflation. Interest rates have been jacked up, and the Bundesbank now predicts an economic downturn in Germany. Japan, our prime trading partner, also faces a slowing economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is politically exhilarating to observe the course of events in central Europe and the Soviet Union. The process of democratisation and the creation of several independent smaller nations are now irreversible. But political democracy does not necessarily translate into early economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA>  As several central European nations achieve associate membership of the European Community, there will be increased agricultural production added to already excessive European Community production. There will be even greater pressure to maintain European Community export subsidies, unless the European common agricultural policy is dramatically reformed. I think this is unlikely.</PARA>
<PARA>  So, due to domestic and external factors, although economic recovery in Australia is coming, it will be delayed and it will be uneven. We may not achieve the growth of 1.5 per cent predicted in the Budget. Even if we do, we face declining investment and little relief from socially disruptive, personally debilitating and politically untenable levels of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unlike the people who have written this Budget, I do not accept that this bleak outlook is unavoidable. We should embrace further policy initiatives. Official interest rates have today been reduced by one per cent and this action is welcome and totally justified. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since Budget day many people, including me, have been calling for a one per cent reduction. Ninety day bills were at 10.2 per cent and the US euro rate was 5.6 per cent, a differential of 4.6 per cent. Real interest rates on bills were almost 7 per cent, real housing rates around 9.5 per cent and real business rates at an extraordinarily high 12.5 per cent. So there was no justification for holding back rate cuts because of a fear of an inflationary surge, nor for believing capital inflow would be affected. The banks must pass on this reduction urgently and in full and even then real business and housing rates will still be at an historically high level. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think the Australian dollar is still overvalued. It must come down. We criticised the previous Government's strategy of using an overvalued dollar to counter inflation. The Government is repeating the error which collapsed manufacturing output in the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>  One supports reduction of protection, as outlined in the March industry statement, phasing down general tariffs, reducing tariffs on textiles, clothing and footwear and reducing tariffs on motor vehicles and components by the year 2000. However, to wind down protection while maintaining an overvalued Australian dollar and high real interest rates on investment in plant and equipment, given that such investment fell by 12 per cent last year and is projected to fall a further 10.5 per cent this year, represents a policy of de-industrialisation. A policy of reducing protection, I believe, is correct, but only in conjunction with reduced real interest rates, increased investment and a lower Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is pleasing to see an improvement in the current account, as it is reduced from 6 per cent of GDP to a projected 3.9 per cent of GDP this financial year. Given that the economy cannot be kept permanently sedated in order to control imports, we must consolidate improved export performance. There is a need to extend the successful export facilitation scheme, which uses export credits to reduce the tariff burden on import components of a value added export product. This scheme applies to the motor vehicle and textile, clothing and footwear industries, and I think it should be urgently extended to cover other manufacturing exports. </PARA>
<PARA>  State payroll taxes are a tax on jobs, a deterrent to investment, manufacturing outputs and exports. Federal and State governments, in my view, should seek a timetable for phasing out this tax. This cannot be funded by consumption taxes; it may need to be funded from future cyclical surpluses and by forgoing wage-tax trade-offs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Much has been written of the need to place more investment in public and private infrastructure other than property--in transport systems, communications and ports. This is certainly not occurring at a State level right now. Total capital grants in the States were $3.45 billion five years ago. They are $3.57 billion in this Budget. This is hardly representative of a determined commitment by Federal and State governments to improve infrastructure which may improve our industry and export performance. </PARA>
<PARA>  Pay-as-you-go pensions funded by the working taxpayer will become increasingly untenable as the ratio of those working to those in retirement or unemployment continually falls. The Government's intention to expand superannuation by requiring 5 per cent of ordinary time earnings from employers whose payrolls exceed $500,000, with a smaller 3 per cent from other employers by July next year, is a welcome and achievable initiative, as is the increase in the contribution to 9 per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA>  To an undetermined extent there will be a subtraction from wage and salary increases that might otherwise have been achieved. It is a great and historic superannuation reform. It is also a compulsory domestic saving which should see a total investment portfolio rise from $125 billion to between $400 billion and $600 billion within the decade. The majority of this vast savings pool should be invested within Australia giving a corresponding reduction in our reliance on overseas borrowings to finance economic and industrial expansion. </PARA>
<PARA>  Besides legislating to implement these arrangements, the Government will implement strict and accurate prudential security for employers and employees. It must also examine how superannuation investment portfolios can be directed or influenced in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has been some criticism of the better cities proposals. I fear that much of this criticism is justified, given the cloudy outline of the program, but we do need to reverse the urban sprawl, with its huge infrastructure costs, towards the redevelopment of inner city areas. There may be a disturbing absence of detail as to how all this can be achieved by the better cities program. Perhaps there are more specific measures that can be taken as an addition or alternative to demonstration projects in the States and Territories in agreed areas. One such measure could be to accelerate to 4 per cent or 5 per cent the depreciation allowance available to investors in private, medium density rental accommodation for approved designs in designated inner city areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition and its Leader, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), offer few rational, acceptable or compassionate policy solutions to Australia's problems. The Leader of the Opposition would seek a balanced Budget, thus extending the recession and causing further job losses. The Opposition would impose a consumption tax of at least 15 per cent on all goods and services, giving a hefty short term boost to inflation and probably creating housing and business interest rates of 18 to 22 per cent, as occurred in New Zealand in 1987. So the Opposition is offering very small alternatives. All members of this Government wish to avert the catastrophe of a coalition government. The deficiencies in this Budget must be debated so that the necessary changes, including economic and industry policy adjustments, can be implemented. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is a delight, I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to follow the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West). He said, and I believe I quote accurately, `This Budget lacks a clear vision'. I agree with that; the Opposition agrees; the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) agrees. Not only does it lack a clear vision, it also lacks any vision at all of what Australia might, should and could be in these dying years of the twentieth century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Cunningham talked quite eloquently about unemployment in his electorate. I tell the honourable member that over the last 12 months my electorate of La Trobe had the greatest increase in unemployment of any electorate in Australia. I have a great deal of compassion for those constituents in my electorate who are now without jobs, those who have never been unemployed in their lives, such as electricians, carpenters, builders labourers, accountants, bureaucrats and others with very specific and detailed skills who no longer can use those skills because no-one has the capacity to use them in the bankrupt State of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Appropriation Bills, which give effect to the 1991-92 Commonwealth Budget, have been the subject of intense public debate and comment in the two weeks which have elapsed since the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) tabled the Budget papers and spoke to these Bills at the second reading stage. Public comment has been largely negative and critical of the Budget, the Government, the Treasurer and the ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who would be Prime Minister if he could be. It is true that almost no-one is happy with this year's effort, including the honourable member for Cunningham. While some have criticised the new Treasurer for lacking a silver tongue to market the Budget strategy, there is no doubt that the concept behind the Budget is as flawed as is this tired, demoralised and strife ridden Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Appropriation Bills represent a lost opportunity to commence the economic rebuilding process so necessary in Australia following the devastation of our economy and the destruction of the lives of so many people resulting from policies pursued by this Government which have led to our worst recession in 60 years. For the Hawke Labor Government this lost opportunity is unlikely to be repeated, for it is unlikely to survive the 12 months before it could bring down another Budget which just might start to make amends. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look for a moment at who has attacked this Budget with criticisms of either specific actions undertaken in the Budget or lack of action which should, could or might have been taken. The list is long and includes some of Labor's best and most traditional mates, including the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the social services lobby groups, the welfare lobby groups, the health industry, the education sector, university students, business, industry and the almost one million individuals thrown on the unemployment scrap heap by a Labor Government that was elected on a promise to `look after' them. </PARA>
<PARA>  When I first studied the budgeting process I recall that I was taught that a Budget is, first of all, an estimate--that it is a mechanism, a vehicle, for financial planning to express the expected income and expenditure of a business or other financial entity. I was taught that Budgets are used for forward planning and that, because none of us really have knowledge of the future, Budgets contain some vision for tomorrow and the day after. Along with this vision must go a plan of action or the vision will have no mechanism for implementation. This Budget fails on both counts: there is no vision and there is no plan of action. The Hawke Labor Government holds out no hope to the people of Australia for a prosperous future. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget's vision is for continuing and unabated massive unemployment, interest rates which continue to be high by world standards, a continuing and unsustainable current account deficit and increasing percentages of our gross national product being committed to paying the interest bills to other countries for the maintenance of our standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA>  When one looks at the proposal for national superannuation, one finds a mechanism for ensuring that unemployment not only will stay at unacceptable levels but will likely increase. We all know that this is a Government that is tired, that is coming to the end of its days and whose only vision is a landscape of devastation rocked by its policies and its actions--a Government that is tearing itself to pieces internally through division and acrimony while trying to place blame for past failure and argue about future leadership. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget bears no resemblance to the kind of document which Australians might have expected had not the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the ex-Treasurer been otherwise distracted in the mother of all battles for the Lodge. That battle is so consuming that there is no time and energy for this Government to address the real problems facing our nation and put forward real solutions which might bring an end to those problems and an easing of our constituents' suffering. Australia suffers because of the egos of two men--the Prime Minister and the would be Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are so many positive issues that this Budget might have addressed and did not that my constituents have sent me back to Canberra to find out why they were not addressed. It is interesting, for instance, that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), the Prime Minister, the President and Secretary of the ACTU, most employer bodies and the leaders of most unions all talk about enterprise bargaining. It is interesting because the concept of enterprise bargaining in the Australian context was put forward by the coalition of the Liberal and National parties in 1986 as the only logical way to improve productivity in an economic climate of increasing international competition. </PARA>
<PARA>  The socialists and the regulators picked up the words, but not the essence, of the argument. In this Budget there is no proposal for voluntary employment agreements. In this Budget there is no proposal to rescind the Industrial Relations Amendment Act 1990, which will force massive union amalgamation. In this Budget there is no proposal for voluntary union membership or the end of the closed shop. My constituents want to know why not. In the April national wage case decision the Industrial Relations Commission said that Australian management and Australian workers were not yet mature enough to handle enterprise bargaining. Our then Treasurer had a few rude words to say about the Commission on that score. So did the Secretary of the ACTU and so did lots of other people. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this Budget the Minister for Industrial Relations has brought down no proposal to allow management and workers to get together or for employers and employees to decide for themselves how they will work, how long they will work, under what conditions they will work and for what rewards they will work. Why not? Instead, this Budget foreshadows compulsory national superannuation on top of award superannuation and in addition to compulsory industry training. It is this mind-set on systems, procedures and compulsion which drives this Labor Government--a Government in debt to the ACTU and captive to the ACTU veto on every Government Bill, including this Budget. Not one of my constituents was consulted by the Expenditure Review Committee of Cabinet. Not one of my constituents was consulted regarding specific detail of the Budget. Not one of my constituents was consulted regarding changes to Medicare, compulsory superannuation or $800m for Alice in Wonderland fairy floss cities. But the ACTU was consulted and the ACTU had to say yes before the Treasurer could stand in this House and table the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is about time that the Australian people woke up to the fact that they are being governed not by the elected members of the Australian Labor Party whom they sent to Canberra but by Bill Kelty, Martin Ferguson and the faceless bureaucrats of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. People should make no mistake: it is the ACTU which governs this country, while the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Blaxland dance to the tune of the Merry Widow, and Canberra burns. </PARA>
<PARA>  My constituents want to know why this Budget takes no account of a 100 per cent possible improvement in efficiency on the waterfront because of implementation of this Government's waterfront reform plan through the in-principle agreement with the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. They want to know why negotiations drag on and on, with no results and with the same old continuing rorts and inefficient work practices that have dogged the waterfront in this country for so many interminable years. They also want to know why so many of those people who have taken their $100,000-plus redundancy packages are back on the wharves again in a casual capacity, still working in the same jobs that they were paid to leave. But my constituents are not likely to get any answers from a government that is determined to prevaricate and refuses to confront the power of Mr Tas Bull. </PARA>
<PARA>  Further, my constituents would like to know why this Budget contains no provisions for improvement in shipping costs through a dramatic improvement in coastal shipping and reduction in coastal shipping charges-- because the Government has taken a hard decision to tell two unions to get lost, in the interests of all Australians. But my constituents are not likely to get any answers from a Government that is bound by and beholden to the unions, regardless of the costs in jobs and job prospects for my constituents and for many hundreds of thousands of others around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  My constituents want to know why public transport is still so inefficient and why this Government is still talking instead of acting, instead of getting rid of the demarcations and getting on with the job of governing, building a third runway and helping to make industry more competitive so that there are jobs for my constituents. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we address the inadequacies of this Budget, it is incumbent on us to address the reasons why we are here today discussing an Australia with almost one million well and able men and women who want to work, who want jobs, but for whom there are no jobs. There is no work. My constituents ask me: why did it happen?  How could it happen?  How is it possible that in the lucky country, the clever country, one-tenth of our working population is without work?  I tell my constituents that that is an easy question to answer. It is easy because this Labor Government, and the arrogant ex-Treasurer who thought he knew better than anyone else, made a number of major mistakes, including, firstly, spending like crazy because of the 1983 recession and building up the Public Service to unsustainable levels; secondly, by deregulating the banks and the financial sector without deregulating the labour market and without adequate prudential supervision; and, thirdly, by  taking interest rates to unsustainable levels in a panic effort to decrease local consumption because of an imbalance between imports and exports and, in the process, decimating industry, business and commerce. </PARA>
<PARA>  Labor governments have never woken up to the fact that the bureaucracy does not produce real wealth, that trade unions do not produce wealth, and that it is only real business and real people in the real world who produce real goods and real services who ultimately allow us our standard of living. Any businessman in Australia could have told the ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, the would- be Prime Minister, that simply pushing up interest rates to extremely high levels would destroy many of our businesses. The bankruptcy rates and the insolvency rates clearly indicate the truth of that statement. The ex- Treasurer's high interest rate policy has destroyed the property market and has destroyed much of Australian small business and small industry without producing any sustainable, positive result. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government will point to low and falling inflation as a positive result of its policies. But the low inflation rate is a direct result of Australia's depression rather than a structural attempt by the financial regulators to improve inflationary outcomes or an attempt by Government to revise our wage determination system to make wage changes sensitive to productivity rather than to inflation. There are a lot of dead soldiers out there as a result of today's low inflation. But those dead soldiers are not providing increased business for the undertaking industry; they are just job dead. </PARA>
<PARA>  I can certainly tell the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the honourable member for Blaxland that those job dead constituents of mine in the electorate of La Trobe will be terribly unforgiving of this Labor Government at the next Federal election. They really are not particularly interested in whether Bob Hawke is Prime Minister or whether Paul Keating is Prime Minister or whether Bill Kelty is running the country. My constituents are interested in their own self-esteem and welfare, which they know is tied to the welfare of their nation. Today, finding a job becomes the all-consuming interest. They have had a gutful of Labor. They have had a bellyful of Bob Hawke, Paul Keating, John Kerin and Bill Kelty. They have had a real gutful, and they tell me so in the pubs, at the footy ground, in my office, while they are in the lines at the CES, at the Social Security office, at public meetings, in the halls of the chambers of commerce, at the RSL hall, in the shops and on the street. They have had a gutful of Labor, and I do not blame them. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Cunningham has had a gutful of Labor, too, I think. The honourable member had a great wish list-- and I liked part of his wish list. It was pretty positive stuff. He said that we need lower real, sustainable interest rates. No kidding!  Boy, is that true. He said that we need a lower Australian dollar. I reckon!  He said that, if we were to wind down protection through tariffs without reducing interest rates, without a lower dollar and without increasing investment, we would decimate industry. That is precisely what is occurring, is it not?  I also add that we ought to deregulate the labour market while we are at it. He said that we should consolidate our improved export performance. He wants a few dollars to start that off. I am not sure that the kick--start is worthwhile but, anyhow, I would not argue with him. We need to improve the export performance of our manufacturing sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  Further, the honourable member said that we need to eliminate State payroll tax, because it is regressive. Who could disagree?  We shall see about talking about that as part of a goods and services tax--if not this year, the year after, or the year after that?  He said that we should invest in private infrastructure, but without a determined commitment. Of course we need more investment in private infrastructure; and that means investment in jobs and productivity for our country. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise tonight to support the Appropriation Bill. I would like to relate that recently, when driving to work, I was distressed to see--as would be the experience of other members in their electorates--a queue of people some two blocks long lined up outside the Fairfield Department of Social Security office. Actually, there were so many people that at first I thought that there was a demonstration or a problem concerning that office. Later that morning I made some inquiries and discovered that more than 1,000 people had been through the Fairfield Department of Social Security office by 11 a.m. Unemployment in my electorate, it saddens me to say, has continued to increase, largely because of the huge non-English-speaking migrant population which is finding it more difficult than ever to obtain employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Fairfield-Liverpool area now has the second highest general unemployment rate in New South Wales and the third highest in Australia--statistics, I might add, that I am not proud of. But statistics from the Department of Social Security reveal that there was an increase of some 380 people in June receiving unemployment benefits in Fairfield, and an increase of some 234 people in Cabramatta. The local Commonwealth Employment Service staff has been struggling to find jobs for the unemployed people in the area, as even unskilled work has not been available. </PARA>
<PARA>  Studies by the Bureau of Immigration Research have revealed that immigrants from non-English speaking backgrounds were significantly over-represented among the long term unemployed. Despite this, long term unemployed migrants are severely under- represented in labour market programs, such as Jobstart and Jobtrain, which favour women, the recently unemployed and the better educated. One of the BIR report authors, Dr Roger Jones, from the Australian National University's social science data archives, suggested in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald, on 6 August 1991, that the high rate of long term migrant unemployment was because CES staff tended to select people they knew would be more likely to be placed in the work force rather than those most in need. Dr Jones said that the problem was that CES had two roles: firstly, to fill job vacancies and, secondly, to provide employment opportunities to those who register. Dr Jones suggested that, in the case of disadvantaged groups, the needs of the labour market were being put ahead of the needs of the unemployed. Consequently, the people who were being left out were the long term unemployed, the young and the uneducated. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 6 August 1991 Professor Ian McAllister, from the Department of Politics at the University of New South Wales, said that the high levels of unemployment among newly arrived immigrants were due to the `systematic biases' which were operating against them. The Professor said that there were four main biases working against migrants in the labour market, which included lack of educational qualifications, low levels of English proficiency, short terms of residency and, in some instances, their status as refugees or unsponsored migrants. The Professor went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The big problem for these people is that they often possess several or all of these problems. Once they walk out into the work force they are at a very big disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>It is crucial, therefore, that during these hard economic times the Government establish a range of programs which assist those bearing the weight of the recession, and which encourage economic recovery and make it easier for restructuring. I am pleased to say that, unlike the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), I have read the Budget Papers. The 1991-92 Budget has embarked on a route by which it can achieve these goals through changes to social security entitlements, increased spending on language and literacy activities and increased spending on labour market programs. The increase by some $199m in spending on labour market programs is a welcome one not only for my electorate but for the whole of Australia, as this will create new training opportunities, bolster the nation's skills base and provide counter-cyclical assistance to workers and employers during the recession. </PARA>
<PARA>  The labour market programs are geared towards the most disadvantaged job seekers in the labour market and this funding increase will benefit the long term unemployed. It will certainly benefit workers with literacy and language difficulties, the young people I have referred to and the workers facing the risk of losing their jobs. More than 10,000 new training places in TAFE, costing over $40m, will become available during the next few months as a result of this Budget. This will help counter the drop in apprenticeship training provided by industry because of the recession. Australia's TAFE system is also receiving a one per cent increase in recurrent funding. This will strengthen the ability of the nation's most extensive training system to provide high quality and relevant training to Australia's work force for thousands of young people preparing and training for their working lives. </PARA>
<PARA>  Labour market programs, such as the Job Search training program, Jobtrain, Jobstart and the community based Skillshare program, are the main focus of support for those most disadvantaged in the labour market. Immigrants with language or cultural difficulties that may limit their employment opportunities are particularly targeted for special assistance. Extra help will now be provided to these people as a result of increased funding in the Budget for these programs. An additional $38m has been allocated in the 1991-92 Budget for Jobtrain and Jobstart for the long term unemployed. Funding for these programs has risen from $192m last financial year to $230m in 1991-92. Additional funding for Skillshare projects, particularly in my electorate but all around Australia, has been approved in the Budget. Of the $7.8m extra approved for allocation nationally, the Skillshare projects in the Prospect electorate will receive an additional $120,000 in supplementary funding. Two million dollars has been allocated for a special literacy and language program to assist migrants and people with poor literacy and language skills, and there has been a 10 per cent increase, taking the amount to $23m, to expand the special intervention program which provides interpreting assistance to clients who are not proficient in English. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is also continuing and expanding its range of language and literacy activities which it began during International Literacy Year. The Budget has allocated funding to provide increased resources for adult literacy teaching and increased resources for teaching English as a second language, preserving Aboriginal languages, innovative projects, publicity and curriculum development, an early intervention strategy for child literacy, a new scheme to pay schools $300 for each year 12 student studying a priority language, restructuring of the ethnic schools program, and the National Languages and Literacy Institute of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Expenditure under the adult migrant English program, which provides English language courses and initial settlement orientation and information for adult migrants and refugees, is also to be increased by $15.3m in 1991-92 to more than $100m. This will enable a higher proportion of AMEP clients to achieve social proficiency levels in English, and as well the Budget will enable an increase in the average number of hours of formal tuition per client from 370 to 510. This Government is doing all it can to financially and educationally support the vast numbers of unemployed around Australia, particularly those who are newly arrived migrants or immigrants from a non-English speaking background. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia is in recession and I believe that it is time some of the people who live here realise that, although it is tough out there, they should be thinking more about what they can do for this country and themselves rather than relying on the Government to support them through handouts. Initiative and determination are needed for Australia to be put back on the road to recovery, not a dependence on the Government to see the people of Australia through this. It seems to me that no matter how much our Government gives to many of our community groups and social workers running the various assistance programs in our society, they always need more. I understand that there is a great need for assistance from the Government for community projects and I hope this help is not taken for granted. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my electorate recently, I was written to in Vietnamese and Spanish by clients of a local AMEP centre. These people had been encouraged by their community development worker to write to me complaining about the discontinuation of their AMEP class. On investigation, I found that these people had all been in Australia for a period of more than five years; in fact, one had been here over 10 years. They were, therefore, not entitled to participate in the program as priority clients. The AMEP national plan gives priority access for classes to adults within five years of arrival. Within the plan there is also some access to English language training for longer term residents. But the main aim of that program is to equip new arrivals with English skills soon after their arrival, to assist them in their early settlement and to avoid the creation of a backlog of English learning need in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Adult Migrant Education Service has regional centres which monitor the composition of student enrolments in terms of their period of residence. These centres endeavour to accommodate longer term settlers with special needs and refer unsuccessful applicants to other educational providers where appropriate. Why should migrants who have been in this country for more than five years continue to be supported by the Government in this way, perhaps to the detriment of other newly arrived migrants who need the service more?</PARA>
<PARA>  When is it time for the Government to say to these people, `Stand on your own two feet, we have done all we can for you to help you settle into our country, but now you have to give us something in return'? The Government cannot continue to hand out financial and educational assistance to people who are taking the system for granted, or who have merely come to expect it. Times are hard in Australia; nobody is disputing that fact. However, we still are a lucky country with a relatively high standard of living--particularly in comparison with countries such as Ethiopia, Bangladesh, China and India--and we have valuable human resources. I suggest many Australians need to stop blaming the Government and everybody else for their predicaments and do something to help themselves and their country. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wonder how many Australians think themselves truly lucky to be living in this great country. The people from the countries such as the ones I have just mentioned have suffered from natural and economic disasters and have been desperate recipients of aid from the Australian Government. These people must rely on the goodwill of other, more wealthy countries to survive. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some new Australians have fled countries faced with this plight and have come to rely on the Australian Federal Government for food, money, shelter and education. Others, confronted by a similar situation, have come to Australia, found employment and shelter, and learnt English in their spare time. I believe the Australian Government is doing more than enough for the unfortunate in our society. We are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on labour market programs, social security benefits, education and training programs and emergency relief. However, all over the world there are still millions of people starving and dying by the minute who need as much foreign aid as can be spared. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was pleased to note that the 1991-92 Budget saw a slight increase in foreign aid to $1,313.9m, or 0.35 per cent of our gross national product, a rise of one per cent in real terms. Despite this increase, however, Australia's aid budget is only half the target of the 0.7 per cent of the GNP as recommended by the United Nations. Contributions of 1.17 per cent of the GNP from countries such as Norway, which is also suffering economically, put our offerings to shame. The increase is, however, a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA>  The quality of Australia's aid program has improved distinctly since the beginning of the 1980s. The efficiency and effectiveness with which each dollar has been spent has progressed markedly from year to year, and the Hawke Labor Government is to be congratulated for it. </PARA>
<PARA>  This year the Budget has resulted in a number of areas of foreign aid benefiting from a useful injection of funds. Some $60m has been approved for spending over the next four years on the environment assistance program, which is perhaps the most important initiative in the aid budget. This money is to be spent on programs such as population and family planning, forestry in Papua New Guinea and South East Asia, research on climate change and contributions to the World Bank's global environment facility. Non- government organisations have also benefited from an extra $1.3m in direct funding, which provides some recognition for the important role such agencies play in development assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia must remember that providing aid, even in times of recession, particularly in our own neighbourhood, not only is a humanitarian action, but also is in our country's self- interest.  As the Age put it in its editorial on 22 August:</PARA>
<PARA>Global survival may well depend on poor countries being assisted to raise their living standards, reduce population growth and develop in environmentally sustainable ways. Far from a waste of public money, overseas aid is a sound investment in our own future as well as the future of the recipient countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Foreign aid, particularly food aid, will be required on an increasing scale during the 1990s. The August edition of Insight, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau newsletter, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>As many as eight million are said to have joined the ranks of the hungry each year during the first half of the 1980s. . . hunger today may be stunting the lives of as many as 800 million in the third world. </PARA>
<PARA>Food aid plays a vital role in feeding the poor, saving lives in emergencies and enabling countries to achieve economic growth and greater social equity. Although Australia is one of the world's largest providers of food aid to developing countries, the number of starving people and therefore the need for food aid is ever increasing. (Quorum formed)  I am sorry that the honourable member for La Trobe is worrying about world aid and what the Australian Government is doing. Although Australia is one of the world's largest providers of food aid to developing countries, the number of starving people, and therefore the need for food aid, is ever increasing. </PARA>
<PARA>  Despite a significant decline in food aid expenditure in country programs in recent years, emergency food aid now amounts to 30 per cent of the total annual food aid expenditure. Australia provides the majority of its food aid in the form of wheat and wheat derivatives. Wheat aid is one of the most cost effective forms of foreign aid, as it is cheaper to freight than processed food because it is non-refrigerated and it is shipped out in bulk. Australia is also involved in grain swaps, especially in response to emergency relief and refugee situations. As an example, Australia has provided 15,000 tonnes of maize to Mozambique in its feeding program. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This is very much to the point, Mr Speaker. The honourable member for Canning circulated to members of his Party a document criticising the Government's Budget decision on Medicare. I heard him this morning on the radio defending this position, attacking the Cabinet decision--his own Government's decision--on Medicare. This is the person who is the Whip for the Australian Labor Party, the person who is supposed to be supporting the Government, the person who we know should be supporting his Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). But what is he doing? He is going around undermining the Prime Minister, supporting the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) as a candidate for the prime ministership and also directly undermining the Government's policy on Medicare as announced in the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Obviously it has had some effect. Here we are going back to the days of the Whitlam Government, because today, for the first time, a decision of the Cabinet has been rolled in the Labor Party Caucus. We can see the pattern of the years between 1972 and 1975 emerging again. We had the same pattern of confusion, of difficulty, of disputes between Ministers, of Ministers leaking what happens in the Cabinet against each other and of the Prime Minister not able to speak to Ministers--a total disruption of Government business and total confusion. All we are lacking is the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) writing to Mr Khemlani asking for funds for his mad cities program. That is about the only thing we are missing in the present situation when we compare it with what happened during the Whitlam period. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is one thing about this Medicare decision. Or is it a decision? We do not know yet, because the Caucus has told the Cabinet to go back and have another look at it. The Caucus appointed a committee. I understand there is some considerable difficulty in appointing committees. How many are put on a committee in the Labor Party? If there are four persons on a committee and there are three factions, how is that organised? How is it known what the committee will say? What kind of recommendation will it make? Does each member of the committee have to go back to his faction and find out what the faction says about the issue before the matter comes back to the Caucus?</PARA>
<PARA>  The country is in its worst state economically since the Depression. The members of the Government are running around like headless chooks, and so are the members of the Caucus. And now we have the ultimate hypocrisy from the Government, this decision on Medicare in the Budget. If ever there was an abject failure on policy, it is the failure on Medicare. If ever there was an example of cant and hypocrisy, we have it on Medicare. If ever there was another direct example of a broken promise made by the Prime Minister during the last election campaign, we have it on Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me quote from the Prime Minister's policy speech from the last election, the 1990 election. When having a go at the Opposition, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>For all their confusion, their twisting and turning, the truth is that the Liberals and Nationals would dismantle Medicare--scrap bulk billing . . . </PARA>

Does it still stay when one of the architects of Medicare, Dr Deeble, is writing to the Government saying that the foundations of Medicare are not being observed with this decision and that, from his point of view as one of the architects, it is an absolute disaster? I have never agreed with Dr Deeble. I did not agree with the way Medicare was set up. I pointed out, when the Bill was first introduced in 1983, what the problems were, and those chickens are now coming home to roost. But day after day, year after year, in this Parliament the Government has attacked the Opposition for pointing out these difficulties. For seven years, from March 1983 until March 1990, we had the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, the former Minister for Health (Dr Blewett) pointing out that there were certain elements of Medicare that were absolutely sacrosanct, and certainly free patient services for doctors was one element. He kept repeating it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  For the last 18 months the present Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services has day after day in the House castigated the Opposition for questioning these matters, pointing out what the difficulties are with so-called free services. Day after day, year after year, there has been this absolute cant and hypocrisy. When it suits Government members and when there is a deal done between the Left and the Prime Minister to shore up the Prime Minister's position on this mad cities program, money suddenly has to be found. It is ripped out of the health system by abandoning one of the basic planks that Dr Blewett told us day after day for seven years was an essential ingredient of Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA>  No  wonder  there  is  turmoil  in  the Government. I do not feel sorry for Government members in the slightest, because the whole program was wrong in the first place. I can refer back to the debate in 1983 when I pointed out exactly what the problem was. I will quote what I said on 14 September 1983 in a debate on Medicare which went on until after 3 o'clock in the morning:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill does nothing to improve the quality of health care in Australia. Indeed, it includes measures that will lead to the deterioration of service in doctors' surgeries and public hospitals. It is a major act of nationalisation, increasing taxation by $1.7 billion per annum to cover additional government expenditure previously met by private insurance . . . It hides the real costs of health care. The $1 billion one per cent levy on incomes represents only one-eighth of the $8 billion spent on health by Federal and State governments.</PARA>
<PARA>I might say that the 1 1/4 per cent levy still covers no greater proportion of the total health bill in Australia. I again quote my speech from 1983:</PARA>
<PARA>It hides the cost at the consumer level by providing so-called free service in hospitals and doctors' surgeries to people who can afford to insure. It threatens the continuing existence of private hospitals which make a major contribution to health care and puts extreme pressure on the public hospitals. It threatens the future of private medical practice by shackling doctors to a direct government payment system. </PARA>
<PARA>These were the criticisms that the Opposition put up in the debate on the Medicare legislation in 1983, and every single one of those forecasts has come true. The Government in the Budget has acknowledged one of them by making changes, by saying that patients who are not welfare patients have to make a contribution for medical services--a proposition with which we have always agreed. The Government has castigated us year after year for saying that, but now in the Budget, after 8 1/2 years, it finally had to admit it--and that has caused a spasm in its own Party and in the Caucus. The Caucus has rolled the Cabinet on that issue and sent the matter back for review.   The whole thing is a sham. The Medicare levy is a sham. In 1983 I said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am often asked whether I think the Government will need to raise the levy beyond one per cent to cover the real costs of Medicare. At first I tried to estimate what the levy would need to be to make it an honest reflection of the real costs. I tried also to project the increases in costs that will inevitably arise from abuse of the so-called free system. I now realise that such calculations are beside the point. The one per cent levy figure is totally unrelated to costs. . . . it covers only one-eighth of what taxpayers pay for health to Federal and State governments. It was never designed to be a real figure, it is merely a political device to pretend that Labor's health scheme will be cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words from 1983 are still true.  Regarding free services, in 1983 I said:</PARA>
<PARA>Let us have a look at this supposed question of free services. . . . pressure is being put on all doctors to make no charge to the patient for surgery visits but to accept 85 per cent of the schedule fee direct from the Government as full payment for the service. To increase the pressures put on doctors by patients to bill the Government direct, the Government has decided to ban `gap insurance' . . .  If patients know that it will cost them money out of pocket to make up this difference and if they know that it is official government policy to put pressure on doctors to bill the Government direct and accept the 85 per cent as full payment, many patients will threaten to change doctors in order to get a free service. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's aim is to force all doctors to bulk bill for all patients. As with free hospital beds and free outpatient visits, these free doctors surgery visits remove any sense of financial responsibility from the patient and also from the doctor. </PARA>
<PARA>During the debate I was castigated by the former Minister for saying that. I was attacked in the House, and I have been attacked for years ever since for saying that. But, after 8 1/2 years, the Government has finally admitted it in this Budget.  Let us go on to the hospital systems. I said in 1983:</PARA>
<PARA>The great fear about Medicare--it is not a groundless fear--is that the new insurance and reimbursement arrangements load the dice in favour of the public hospitals without giving those hospitals the additional resources to meet the fresh rush of patients. Under Medicare a patient, regardless of means, will be entitled to a free bed in a public hospital provided he or she accepts the doctor decided on by the hospital. So much propaganda is put out by the Government suggesting that Medicare will cover all health needs that many people will actually believe it and not bother to take out additional private insurance even though they could afford it. </PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say--again in 1983:</PARA>
<PARA>  Any reduction in the percentage of the population taking out private hospital cover will lead to additional claims for admission to free hospital beds in public hospitals. That must follow;  it is simple logic. If the public hospital beds are already under pressure, as they are in many city and suburban locations--</PARA>
<PARA>I am saying as they were in 1983--</PARA>
<PARA>people will have to wait for admission. One can imagine the results of that. We will finish up with a British national health situation where patients wait ages for necessary operations. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed they do. I have here an article from the Sydney Morning Herald of 31 August 1991 on the leaking of a report prepared by the former head of the Federal health department, Mr Bernie McKay, who was appointed by the former Minister as head of that department. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>  Medicare has not stopped widespread discrimination against poorer patients in favour of the privately-insured in public hospitals, a confidential report prepared for the Federal Government's health review says. </PARA>
<PARA>  . . .      . . .      . . .      . . .     . . .      . . .</PARA>
<PARA>  Despite Medicare's promise of equal access for all according to need, the report shows that public hospitals discriminate in a number of ways against those without private health insurance seeking elective care. </PARA>
<PARA>  A survey conducted for the report shows that many public hospitals make sure that one private patient is operated on for every public patient, even though the public patient may be more in need of surgery. </PARA>
<PARA>  As well, hospital specialists are more likely to care for privately insured patients while public patients are relegated to more junior doctors. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report also reveals that patients can suffer because of incentives in the health system which encourage the States to shift costs to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>  For instance, it says seriously injured and even anaesthetised patients are being moved from public hospitals to private CT scanning services, even though it would obviously be better for them to stay put. </PARA>
<PARA>The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>The report, prepared by Mr Bernie McKay . . . includes many other specially commissioned studies. It forms part of the long-awaited hospitals report to be released next month by the Macklin health review. </PARA>
<PARA>So after 8 1/2 years the promise of this Government to provide free hospital treatment for everybody, regardless of means, has led to exactly the results that I forecast in 1983--that the people who should be getting the treatment, the pensioners and the disadvantaged, are at the end of the queue. The Government's own report says that this is a failure. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not only a failure in the doctors' surgeries--the failure of overservicing and of professional practice to cope with the financial pressures of bulkbilling, the deterioration in professional practice, in the number of patients seen for too short a time, and in too many referrals to specialists. All these things were predictable, and indeed were predicted by the Opposition in September 1983 in one of the most extensive debates ever held in the House of Representatives. Every single one of those charges is true. Here we are, 8 1/2 years down the line, suffering from the consequences of a very bad decision. At the end of that debate, I said this in summary:</PARA>
<PARA>We stand at a very crucial turning point in the delivery of health care in Australia. The Government, regardless of overseas experience, regardless of experience of certain aspects of the existing scheme, regardless of the inquiries by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, regardless of all the available international evidence, has decided to go back on a 20-year-old experiment, an experiment of a kind that will certainly reduce consumer choice, patient choice, and will inexorably move choice in health care away from patients and providers and in the direction of public servants and politicians. There is no suggestion by the Opposition that in the end the Government will not control the costs of this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>I said this in 1983--</PARA>
<PARA>We are quite certain that in the beginning the costs will start to run away; but by force majeure, as has been tried in England, one can contain costs by squeezing the system dry--squeezing, ultimately and inevitably, the poorest and the least advantaged. </PARA>
<PARA>The report from Mr McKay--the Government's own report--proves that. I said then:</PARA>
<PARA>  If this legislation is not rejected by the Senate this nation will take a path which is fundamentally in error and which it will certainly regret in the future. . . . That will become clearer to people once the scheme gets closer to implementation and afterwards. The end results will become clearer as the months and years draw on. The kinds of things we have to say at this point,--</PARA>
<PARA>this was in 1983--</PARA>
<PARA>however unpopular they might be in certain quarters, will be seen to have been necessary and true. </PARA>
<PARA>I said at that time:</PARA>
<PARA>I have a great deal of faith in the Australian population because I think they have learnt over the past 20 years that there is no such thing as a free lunch, that health care is not free and never can be, and that the good health care we have in Australia is worth preserving. It is worth paying for, and it is worth keeping as much of it as we possibly can within the private sector of our nation's activity. </PARA>
<PARA>It was a very long and extensive debate in September 1983. None of the things said were said in an ill-considered way. They were all said on the basis of evidence from all over the world of government intrusion into health schemes. Inevitably there must be government intervention in health schemes--but the direction this Government took was fundamentally in error and could be known at the time to be in error. </PARA>
<PARA>  At this very day we still have a health system called Medicare which has fundamental shortcomings. It has overservicing and less attentive service because of the bulkbilling of medical services. There is an undercapitalisation of public hospitals because too much of the burden has been put onto the taxpayer and streams of private funds have been denied to the system. After all these years there are also gross inefficiencies in public hospitals due to poor management systems and restrictive work practices. These problems have not been satisfactorily tackled. They are made much worse by unionisation in the public hospitals, which is worse than in the private hospitals, and of course it is another reflection of the Government's failure to reform the labour market system. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is an underuse of private hospital facilities. There is an oversupply of hospital beds nationally, but a lot of them are empty in the private system. There is an instability of private health insurance because of the availability of so-called free health care to those who can afford to pay. There is an oversupply of doctors, except in a few specialties, an unsatisfactory split of responsibilities between Federal and State governments, and also unrealistic public perceptions of the cost of government run health services due to the misleading nature of the Medicare levy. </PARA>
<PARA>  No longer can these Ministers on the other side of the table stand up, Question Time after Question Time, debate after debate, and get stuck into us about health matters, because in 1983 we predicted what was going to happen. The chaos we forecast is with us, and it is quite clear that this Government has not the slightest idea of how to get out of that mess. It is another example of its abject failure, the same as its total failure on the matter of providing employment. It has a million people unemployed and it has thousands of people, pensioners and disadvantaged, on the waiting lists of our public hospitals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Tonight I want to emphasise the yawning chasm which exists between the policies of the Federal Labor Government and the Federal Opposition. Every time this Government has considered a just wage increase for the workers of Australia, the Liberals and Nationals have opposed any wage increase. `Australia can't afford wage increases for workers', those opposite scream. Recently, a group of nine business leaders put forward an action plan to assist the Australian economy. The action plan exhorted Australian labourers to work longer and harder while accepting wage restraint. The day this plea was issued, one of the nine businessmen had his salary increased by 32 per cent. Mr Ian Burgess, chief executive officer of CSR, said, `Save the country's economy, you plebs. Work longer and harder for less pay'. He then accepted for himself a $150,000 per year salary increase. The $150,000 increase lifted Mr Burgess's salary to around $620,000 per year. My mind boggles at such a figure. Could this $150,000 hike, however, be justified by improved performance? Hardly--not when CSR shareholders were informed that the company's after-tax profit for the year had fallen by 21 per cent. I bet shareholders are applauding Ian Burgess and his $150,000 per year pay increase! Next time Mr Burgess asks workers to tighten their belts, we will all listen with bated breath.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I refer to the above story not in any attempt to embarrass Mr Burgess but merely to point out that many people who claim superiority over this Government possess a vision which works through double standards and is blinkered by greed and self-interest. Understandably, there is a great deal of disenchantment with this Government because Australia's economy is in recession, but I believe that most thinking persons will realise that we have to share our problems by working together and treating every person fairly. We will not win our way back to prosperity by pursuing one favourable set of rules for the haves and draconian measures for the have- nots. </PARA>
<PARA>  No Government will ever be perfect, and this Government does not try to absolve itself from part of the blame for the current recession. However, many will recognise that this recession is as much due to the indolence of long years of conservative rule as it is to our eight years of difficult restructuring. Furthermore, England, Canada, the United States and many other economies are in recession and it must be remembered that, because of their cyclical nature, recessions are very difficult to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA>  What this Government is doing, however, is establishing an economic structure which will better position Australia to escape the boom-and-bust syndrome. In previous recessions the people who have borne the pain have been the poor. In our current recession, we must make sure that the privileged share the pain of these difficult times. By working together and sharing the pain, we will lessen its intensity and speed the return to economic prosperity. It is my passion for a fair deal for all Australians that causes me to reject totally the heartless policies of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some people say that the overwhelming weakness of the Opposition is that it has no policies, and in one sense that is correct. The Opposition cannot clearly enunciate a wages policy or a health policy, but the average Australian is quaking in his or her shoes, or should be, at the thought of the policies which the conservatives are pursuing so relentlessly. </PARA>
<PARA>  The truth is that the Opposition does have policies, and the truth is that the policies they do have are B-A-D--bad--policies, and they are U-N-F-A-I-R--unfair--policies. Those policies being pursued by the Liberals and Nationals will destroy the Australia that we know and love. </PARA>
<PARA>  The big issue on the coalition's agenda is the goods and services tax. The GST is an intolerable tax, and I know that there are some members of the Liberal and National parties who fear it as much as I do. There is no unanimity within the coalition parties regarding the goods and services tax, and every time I engage in a conversation with some honourable members opposite they express to me their concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not wish to be indecorous, but having just returned from a visit to Canada I feel compelled to say that the tax in that country is referred to by many as `the ball squeezer'. When I asked my doctor friend how this rather rude name came to be used, I was informed that GST stood for `grinding squeeze of the testicles'. The goods and services tax in Canada causes universal pain and is universally hated. Farmers in particular loathe the tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last night I was speaking to a Liberal member who agreed with me that the GST in Canada is a total mess and an absolute nightmare--but it is working well in New Zealand, he said. The claim that the GST is working well and is popular in New Zealand is a total fallacy. In New Zealand, the GST is disguised by being incorporated into the retail price, but no-one is fooled, and the middle and lower income groups in New Zealand, as in Canada, are being tremendously disadvantaged by the imposition. Honourable members should not believe for one moment that business people in Canada or New Zealand have any love for the GST. </PARA>
<PARA>  The administrative difficulties of the tax are causing excruciating pain and business people resent being unpaid tax collectors for the Government. One argument advanced by the Liberals in favour of the goods and services tax is absolute bunkum. It is absolute nonsense to claim that the GST will eliminate the black economy. So confident am I of this fact that I make a solemn promise that I will donate my parliamentary salary to the coffers of the Liberal Party if anyone can prove to me that the GST will completely obliterate the black economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said, the coalition does have policies, and in the time remaining to me I want to explain how disastrous those policies would be for Mr and Mrs Average in this great country of ours. The conservatives would abolish the capital gains tax, thereby allowing property dealers to make thousands of dollars on which they would pay no tax, whereas the poor shop assistant, who works five days a week and Saturday morning, would continue to pay tax on his or her pittance. Pray tell me, where is the fairness in that?</PARA>
<PARA>  The Liberals and the Nationals are determined to ease the assets test so that the bloated wealthy receive welfare while the genuinely needy receive a lesser share of the welfare dollar. We know that the coalition parties have always been unhappy about the fringe benefits tax, but we should not worry about that now because those opposite have a solution. They are not going to get rid of the fringe benefits tax. However, what they do plan to do is ensure that the fringe benefits tax is paid by the employees rather than the employers. That is their idea of fairness. They do not really believe in fairness, but they do believe in looking after their natural constituency. </PARA>
<PARA>  Other items on the conservative agenda include the end of compulsory unionism, which is another ploy to destroy unionism by stealth. I wonder how the working men and women of Australia feel about the plan of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and all his colleagues to abolish the holiday leave loading and to introduce cutbacks in sick leave.   The workers who are being wooed at the moment to support the conservatives because the hip-pocket nerve of the workers is hurting should consider how much worse their predicament would be should insanity triumph and the Opposition gain the Treasury benches. Will they applaud the conservatives' plan to reduce their holiday leave entitlements?  Will the unemployed in my electorate clap and cheer the Liberals when those opposite cut all unemployment benefits after nine months?</PARA>
<PARA>  I have told this House before how one walks along the streets in Canadian cities and sees queues a quarter of a mile long; they are not people lining up for unemployment benefits, but people who are 45 or 50 years of age, with no hope of getting a job, who after nine months of unemployment have to receive welfare. Those opposite have no sympathy whatsoever for those who are genuinely unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition is preaching the nonsense that we can solve our problems by cutting Government expenditure by $3 billion or $4 billion. This claim is being made despite the fact that the Hawke Government has brought Federal Government outlays back to the levels at which they were in the 1950s. The only way that government expenditure can be cut further is by slashing welfare payments which now go to the most needy. I am sure that Mr Ian Burgess, and other people on salaries in excess of $500,000 per year, will provide plenty of examples to the coalition think--tank about how the boot can be put more effectively into the already suffering bodies of the disadvantaged members of our society. Heaven help the pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA>  The policies of callousness which the Opposition would provide for us were it ever to win government are not yet exhausted. There are Labor voters who are not pleased about the necessary changes to Medicare, but I know how much less enthusiastically they will receive the Opposition's plan to scrap Medicare altogether. No-one on the opposite side has told us yet where the coalition will cut billions of dollars from government outlays, but we can bet our bottom dollar that the cuts will do nothing to reduce the profit margins of doctors, dentists, chemists and the other rich mates of the conservative parties in this country. We can be certain, however, that there will be a huge sale of public assets and complete privatisation. Unemployment will reach heights never before experienced in this country. </PARA>

<PARA>  I notice that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition told the RSL annual conference that a coalition government `would address the reasonable concerns of the RSL'. That promise is the epitome of cheapness. Can anyone really believe that a $3 billion cut in government expenditure will not hurt veterans' entitlements? I bet Bruce Ruxton had problems swallowing that furphy. Should those opposite be successful in the next election, we can say goodbye to fairness, just as we said goodbye to so many other things which I have already mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA>  There will be an entrenchment of conservatism in this country by the abolition of compulsory voting. There will be a return to the type of divided society in which those who believe they were born to rule enjoy all the privileges while the workers enjoy none. The policies of the conservatives at the Federal level are a re-run of Greinerism in New South Wales. That Greinerism reminds me of the word I used earlier--`grinding'. We will not mention the other part of the anatomy, however. The policies are intended to benefit their constituency, but certainly they will prove very painful to the rank and file members of society. </PARA>
<PARA>  This address is not intended to be a scare campaign, but no-one can deny that the policies being enunciated by the Liberals present rather a scary scenario. The inflexible aims of an ideologically driven Opposition represent shock, horror and pain for the majority of Australians. We have some time to go before an election and we will continue our sound government through a very difficult period. I know that we will receive the applause of the people of Australia when we bring this country out of the depression and when we get the people back to work, as we did after we copped the mess left to us by the Opposition in 1983. As we explain the Opposition's policies to the people of Australia, those opposite will be left lamenting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I will not try. The extent of the rural tragedy is revealed by the reaction of rural people, the rural press, farmer organisations and the Opposition parties to this Budget, because the general reaction has been that the Budget fails the rural poor. It is tragic that that should be the main focus of reaction by country people to this Budget, but it indicates the tragic situation in so much of rural and regional Australia. It is the worst economic situation since the depression of the 1930s. The tragedy is real.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Average farmer income this year--net disposable income--will be less than what a pensioner receives, even though the theoretical asset for the average farmer in Australia is $1m. It is a combination of corrupt world markets for agricultural products and the high internal cost structure of this country that is the most significant problem facing our farmers in their battle to remain viable. </PARA>
<PARA>  One can run through the list of the great agricultural industries of our country that are in great trouble at present: wool, wheat, sugar, the export sector of our dairy industry and a range of horticultural industries. Even the beef market is now very uncertain. There is no point in the Government complaining about the concentrated reaction of rural people to this Budget, because the Government itself, mainly through the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), was very good with deliberate leaks ahead of the Budget that things would be improved for welfare for farmers; that the Job Search allowance--the unemployment benefit--would be made available; that Austudy would be improved. In the Government's own handout, social justice was the first major headline in relation to what it was doing for the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another tragedy is that all of those claims of the Government are false. It is a con. It is an illusion. I refer, for example, to the family allowance. The Government stated that moving to a $600,000 asset test on the family allowance would be much better for farm families and, for that matter, the self-employed small business people who are so much the heart of country and regional towns throughout Australia. The $600,000 would be better than the $300,000, and then the $500,000, that the Government wanted to bring in last year. Many people bought that--that $600,000 had to be better--but what they had not been told was that there is no assets test whatsoever on the family allowance at the present time--thanks to the Opposition, thanks to the coalition parties. Any assets test has to be a reduction in access and assistance for the non-incorporated, small business sector of this country, the farmers and the business people. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another example concerns the Job Search allowance or, if you like, the unemployment benefit. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy had told the National Farmers Federation and hinted in the leaks ahead of the Budget that he would talk to his mate the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) and it would be fixed, that farmers would once again be eligible for unemployment benefits. What has happened? Absolutely nothing. The $347,000 assets test still remains, the work test still remains and all of the other things that make it impossible for the farmer or his spouse to receive an unemployment benefit are still there. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) told the National Farmers Federation not to worry about Austudy, that he would fix it. What do we have for Austudy? It is probably the greatest of concerns to country families at the present time as their children are not able to continue education because of the dramatic reduction in their income, combined with the additional costs that many country people have to face for the education of their children. We have had a hardship criterion for Austudy to lighten the burden of the assets test, but the two criteria that make up the hardship are that the farm family has to be on welfare--and we have already discovered that it is impossible for a farm family to be on welfare, because of the way the Job Search allowance, or the unemployment benefit, is structured--and they must be on part C of the rural adjustment. </PARA>

<PARA>These amounts will not include unused lines of credit or undrawn bank overdrafts, but will include funds available for working capital. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the crunch--`funds available for working capital'. If a crop farmer has to plant a crop, or has managed to plant it and has to harvest it, he needs $50,000 or $100,000 in available funds to finance that. If the farmer is going to shear his sheep or if he has hay to cut--whatever it may be--because of the capital intensive nature of modern farming, he needs on a seasonal basis significant available funds. That will be used against a farmer for the family allowance supplement. We have a tragic, very real welfare gap confronting farm families and, to a lesser extent, the small business sector of this country--which is the worst welfare gap confronting any group in this country at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government should be ashamed that it allows this welfare gap to continue. Because they keep pouring into our offices, every rural member knows of people who are not eligible for any form of assistance, who cannot even put groceries on the table for their children. On the one hand, we have the Job Search allowance, or unemployment benefit--which is off limits--and on the other hand we have rural adjustment part C, which is another loan. Even the family allowance supplement is only available if one has dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the other tragedies of the rural sector at the present time is that the average farmer no longer has dependent children. Because of the average age, the farmer's children have already left. They have had to leave to find work somewhere. It means that the Government either has to go back to what we did in government, making a grant--that is, the part C household support--available on the same level as the unemployment benefit for at least the first nine months, to put it on the same basis as the unemployment benefit or Job Search allowance, or allow a more flexible work test for Job Search allowance and also a hardship provision that overrides the assets test in these critical times. </PARA>
<PARA>  More and more it means that the only practical and fair hardship provision is the income test. That is what every other sector of our society has--the income test. When we leaf through all the criteria, the pages and documentation on hardship provisions, there is only one practical and fair provision: in these critical conditions, the assets test has to be overridden in favour of the income test. I urge the Government, if it has genuine sympathy for the real poor of this country, to look again at that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It does not. I want to move onto a more general comment about the Budget. It is a very dismal document. We already have one million people officially unemployed in this country. In reality, we have almost double that unemployed, and it will increase. Our new Treasurer, Mr Kerin, after helping with some of the problems--that is, creating some of the problems we have in the rural sector--is obviously going to add to those problems in the non-rural sector. He has been criticised for not going out to sell the Budget. What has he got to sell in the Budget? There is nothing to sell.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-He could not give it away. There is no strategy to increase employment in this Budget. There is no reason why anybody should invest because of this Budget. Business will have a greater cost burden because of compulsory superannuation--which is really an additional payroll tax. There has been a tremendous turnaround in the financing situation of this Government from an $8 billion surplus, supposedly, at the start of the last financial year to a $10 billion deficit in reality when we work through the figures for this financial year. It is an $18 billion turnaround.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  What does that mean when one puts it together with the wage projections for this Government? It must mean a movement again in inflation; it must mean that real interest rates will remain higher in this country than in any other country--that is even allowing for the one per cent interest rate reduction today. In country areas, in particular, there is already high unemployment. People in the country have to face corrupt world markets more than any other sector. More than any other group, they need a competitive interest rate and, through that, a competitive exchange rate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Investment has stopped. Fewer farm tractors were sold in Australia last year than in any year since the Second World War. That shows that the great productivity that has been so much the hallmark of agriculture in Australia will grind to a halt because the headers, the tractors and the machinery can no longer be purchased. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-They are the most efficient farmers in the world, but it is difficult to sustain if one cannot invest. In country towns, the machinery agents, the engineers and the people in service industries are all losing employment and their livelihoods now because of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  What is the new Minister's answer to all this? He says, `Well, we'd better have some value added little factories all around Australia. Let's do some further processing of these agricultural commodities'. First of all, they are not competitive. If someone does not have anything sustainable, it is of no value. Secondly, if all it means is that farmers will be forced to accept even lower prices for their product, that is certainly not going to be of any value to country people.  I give my electorate as an example. I have 15 major food processing factories in my electorate, probably more than any other electorate in Australia, because of the diversity that irrigation provides. There is declining employment in this value adding or food processing sector because there are increased food imports on the one hand and lost exports on the other, partly because of trade barriers--and I think of the United States-Canada free trade agreement which will squeeze out our canned fruit. But it is basically the high costs in this country, combined with that artificially high exchange rate, that makes anything once it leaves the farm uncompetitive. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the Minister was genuine about value adding and providing employment in country areas of Australia, he could immediately do four things. First, he could give some resource security to the forestry industry where $8 billion is ready to be invested in regional Australia in value adding--in pulp mills, paper mills and upgrading of timber mills. But not $1 is being invested. Why should the industry invest when it has no guarantee that its resource, that is the timber, will be available to it over that investment period?</PARA>
<PARA>  Second, the Minister could use his much vaunted expertise in industrial relations to fix up the abattoirs mess in Victoria. Wally Curran and his mates have cost Victorians thousands and thousands of jobs because of the industrial anarchy in our abattoirs. There is no point his saying, `Well look, there is a shortage of stock in Victoria so the abattoirs have to close down'. Anyone who has any choice in Victoria will not go into livestock when people from Queensland can buy livestock in Victoria and have them slaughtered cheaper in Queensland than they can in Victoria. It costs twice as much to have a beast slaughtered in Australia, even outside Victoria, than in the United States. That is an indication of the degree of uncompetitiveness of this country. One could go on with other examples, due to our low labour productivity, our transport and waterfront costs and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third step the Government could take immediately is that of introducing a goods and services tax. That would have the impact of removing a $1 billion export tax from our farm exports. According to Dr Bell of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, it would mean the removal of a 5 per cent tax on exports at the present time, as our Leader has pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fourth step the Government could take immediately is that of removing tariffs from agricultural machinery and spare parts that are not made in Australia. This would immediately reduce the input cost. Applying those four steps would be the real test of whether this Government is going to do something about creating employment in country areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  The final point I want to make is that the departmental figures for agriculture in the Budget are always difficult. One should never accept the totals in those columns as being for assistance to agriculture, because over 60 per cent of the figures in those totals is money in, money out. It is basically levy money--other forms of taxes, if you like, that farmers impose on themselves. For example, AQIS, our quarantine inspection service, is allocated a figure of $170m. When reading that, one might think, `Well, the Government is providing $170m'; but it is not. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The farmers pay it. That is basically farmer money. The figure against wool is down from $1,148m to $467m, which is an indication of the difference in the wool levy this year compared with last year. The same applies to wheat in relation to the very mean compensation for the Gulf War. One should say that should not come from agriculture; it should come from the Defence or Foreign Affairs vote because of the impact in relation to why wheat growers lost those markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I acknowledge that the Budget Papers are recognising and explaining that a bit further, but there are still some pretty false impressions. For example, the diesel fuel rebate suddenly appears this year as assistance to agriculture. One can argue that is where it should be and should have been all along, but it has never appeared in the figures before. So if one looks at the figures last year compared with the figures this year, one suddenly thinks, `There is far more assistance for agriculture because there is suddenly $386m that was not there the year before'. One should always look across the columns from one year to the next. </PARA>
<PARA>  To conclude, I acknowledge the additional assistance for rural adjustment and the continuing bipartisan support for Landcare, the Murray-Darling Basin and the Federal water resources assistance program. I ask the Government to recognise the genuine and terrible welfare gap that now exists in rural Australia to which no other group in this country is subjected and to look again at its criteria in those areas of Austudy, et cetera.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As I was listening to the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), I was wondering whether anything he said I could agree with. There were some things. For example, I would certainly like to see the exchange rate lower. I think that would be a very important contribution to an improvement in the current account deficit. It should come down when interest rates come down. That would be the logic of the market situation. Other things that he said were positive. I was glad to see that he finished on a positive note because there are a lot of very important policies in this Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Opposition has a central problem. On the one hand, it is saying that it would like to have money spent on or tax concessions given to many more things. On the other hand, it has its Leader, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), saying that the Budget should have been balanced. We have the extraordinary situation of the Leader of the Opposition saying that this could have been a balanced Budget. That would have meant that outlays would have had to be cut or revenue would have had to be increased by nearly $5 billion, that is, 5 per cent of the Budget and over one per cent of national income. It is an extraordinarily irresponsible, simplistic and quite naive proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the context of this Budget, for example, that would have involved doing away with the reduction in the wool tax, which benefits woolgrowers by $450m. It would have involved doing away with the abolition of the sales tax exemption for business inputs, which is going to save business $200m. That is exactly the kind of thing that the honourable member for Murray was suggesting ought to happen in the case of many inputs to agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition's proposal would have involved abolishing the rural adjustment scheme counselling program, which is costing $51m this financial year. It is exactly the kind of support for farmers that the honourable member for Murray was proposing, but his Leader would not have allowed that to happen, because under his extraordinary proposition that would have had to be cut out in order to balance the Budget. That is an amazingly irresponsible proposition that I will come back to in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to concentrate on some of the very positive proposals in this Budget. There have been some extraordinary comments made about the Budget. Some people have suggested that it does not do anything for employment, that it does not do anything for the current account deficit and that it will not stimulate business. All of those things are untrue. The Budget has policies which will make a difference to the level of employment, the skills of the work force, the level of exports and the extent of import replacement, and it does so in ways that are of long term benefit to the economy. Let me give some examples. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the area of education--which must be the most important contributor to improvements in the skills of the work force--the level of real outlays on education has risen by over 7 per cent, at a time when the Budget was very constrained. That increase totals $790m and will be distributed to a whole series of areas. For example, there will be increased places at universities and $20m has been allocated for additional higher education capital funding. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the pre-Budget discussions when some of us were thinking through what the priorities for this Budget should be, the highest priority area of outlays that we identified was increased expenditure on higher education and technical education. The Budget has responded to that in a most creative way. The universities will get an additional $20m and more will be added in later years. Many of our universities were built a long time ago. They have buildings that are decaying or are inadequate. It is essential that they be maintained more effectively and improved. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is extreme overcrowding at some universities. Friends who are university lecturers talk of students sitting in the aisles and in the passages around lecture theatres because there is not enough room for students in the main lecture theatres. There is a great need for additional and larger lecture theatres, more tutorial space, better laboratories and staff for them as well. The Budget takes some steps towards meeting those needs, although not adequate steps. The needs will not be met in one Budget, nor will they be met in two or three, but a process is beginning in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  Additional funding will go towards increased salaries for academic staff, the growth in Austudy payments and additional Austudy support for technical and further education. It is possibly the most important support for improvements in skills in the work force so that we improve our national productivity, increase our international competitiveness and are able to export more effectively. That is one very important area which contributes both to the growth of employment and to the growth of exports. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another centrally important area which contributes to enhancing the dynamism of the economy is increased expenditure on research and development. I am delighted to see that this financial year total expenditure on science and innovation goes up by 4.3 per cent in real terms, which is a very significant increase, to $2,600m. That will be used in a whole series of areas. Some of it goes to the CSIRO, which goes up 3 per cent in real terms. The Australian Research Council funding goes up substantially. R&amp; in health goes up substantially. Rural R&amp; goes up by 23 per cent--exactly the sort of proposal that the honourable member who spoke before me was making. </PARA>
<PARA>  A whole series of initiatives will be possible because of that increase in funding for science and technology. I am glad to see that the priorities within the science budget are being addressed too and that there has been some reduction in funding for defence science to make way for higher priority civilian research in the CSIRO, in the rural area and so on. That is not to say that defence science is not valuable, but at this stage, when it is essential that we build up the skills and the innovation in our manufacturing and rural sectors, they must have the highest priority for additional research funds. </PARA>
<PARA>  A third area which has some funding is infrastructure. It is not nearly as much as I would have liked to see, nevertheless there are some additional outlays, particularly for equity investment in the National Rail Corporation--a very important innovation--to increase the efficiency with which freight is moved around the country, and also in the better cities program. The $56m for the better cities program is an important new initiative which will contribute to all sorts of improvements in services in outer suburban areas--areas which have been neglected in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>  Surprisingly, this program has been criticised by some people who have not read the proposals very carefully. The States and Territories are being asked to make proposals for the use of those funds. Those proposals will be assessed and the funds will be allocated. That seems to be by far the most effective way of allocating the funds, because the States and the Territories are the level of government responsible for improvements in outer suburban areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are also a series of important social programs, including the family assistance package, and a very striking increase in outlays for child-care of over $100m. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are also other important changes in priorities. I am glad to see, for example, a very small, but nevertheless significant, increase in real overseas aid funds made possible by some restraint in defence outlays. In terms of balance in the way in which we can most effectively work in the foreign affairs area, I would have thought that building up our overseas aid program whilst restraining growth in our defence program was the right relationship. The aid program is a tiny portion--about one-ninth--of the defence program. In terms of its benefit to the countries in our region and in terms of its contribution to peaceful development, the aid program has a much more constructive and positive impact than defence. The balance has been corrected in very small ways. </PARA>
<PARA>  The surprising thing about the Opposition's comments on this Budget is that the Leader of the Opposition has said that he would have liked this Budget to be balanced. He is critical of the fact that the Government offset increases in outlays by reductions in outlays. He would have liked to have seen simply reductions in outlays or increases in revenue. Yet he begins his speech on the Budget by saying that he is concerned about unemployment. We cannot have it both ways. The effect of the kind of balanced Budget that he is proposing would have been a massive further increase in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the total level of economic activity had been reduced by the $5 billion that he is talking of taking out of Government spending, the effect of that would have been to deeply depress the economy. It is an astonishing, naive and simplistic proposal. I find it particularly astonishing that it comes from a man who was a professor of economics. He must know that we cannot make a draconian change like that to government outlays without having a massive impact on the rest of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  He is proposing a change that would not only affect the aggregate level of economic activity but also reduce the extent and quality of government services in a whole host of areas. That would have the effect not just of increasing unemployment but of reducing the quality of life and living standards for possibly the majority of the population. I have gone through some of the improvements that are in the Budget. He would have had to do away with all of those. He would have had to do away with some of the beneficial changes in revenue. I mentioned one or two at the beginning, but perhaps one of the most important is the exemption for business from sales tax for inputs into its activities. That has the effect of reducing the cost of production, at exactly the time when we have to reduce the cost of production for all our exporting industries and our import competing industries, so as to build up our own international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Leader of the Opposition uses that as one of the justifications for the introduction of the consumption tax that he is proposing. Yet, he is opposed to doing it in this Budget. He cannot have it both ways. He is being entirely and directly inconsistent in what he is saying. I do not think that the Opposition's critique of this Budget carries any credibility at all. The Leader of the Opposition took some pride in the fact that he spoke without notes and made a political attack on the Budget. It in fact meant that he was making a very superficial and, as I say, completely inconsistent attack. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not want to give the impression that I do not think that more could have been done or that more should not be done in the future. I shall conclude by suggesting some priorities for the next round of fiscal change--whenever that is. Personally, I hope it is in March next year, because I am quite sure that the economy will need further stimulus then. Of course, the Government has today taken the very important step in stimulating economic activity, by reducing interest rates by one per cent. That is exactly the right policy. I would not be at all surprised if in due course there were not still further scope for reducing interest rates. We must remember that we have had a very sharp reduction in the level of inflation whilst interest rates have been coming down, and that means that the real level of interest rates is still relatively high by international standards. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we want to reduce our exchange rate, as I believe we should, in order to make us more internationally competitive in ways that the National Party would love to see, and that I would love to see too, we need to reduce the comparative ratio between our real interest rates and those overseas. I think that there is strong and complete justification for the reduction in interest rates that occurred today. I hope that that process will be continued in due course. </PARA>
<PARA>  As well as that, other steps need to be taken. About three weeks ago the Government published the Finn report on post-secondary education. We have been through a period during the 1980s when the proportion of students finishing secondary school increased dramatically, from roughly one third to two thirds. The effect of that is that there are many more students wanting to go on to technical colleges, to vocational training and to university. The Finn report makes a series of recommendations about increased outlays and improvements in quality and changes in institutional arrangements, principally within the TAFE sector but also in other sectors as well, so as to meet that additional demand for further education places. I hope that there will be a very quick response to that excellent report. It is essential that we minimise the number of students who are being kept out of technical colleges, as many were at the beginning of this year. </PARA>
<PARA>  As well as that excellent report, an idea that has been floated by many organisations--business, unions and academics--is the possibility of accelerating the depreciation allowance, perhaps limiting that change to value adding exporting industries. That would be a way of minimising the amount of revenue forgone by the change and targeting it most effectively at our export industries. That change might cost quite a deal, perhaps $100m or $200m in revenue forgone, but it would be an enormous encouragement to our industries, which must take the highest priority if we are going to reduce both the current account deficit and the level of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another proposal which was accepted by the Labor Party national conference in June was that public authorities that are fully commercialised should be excluded from global borrowing limits. That may sound a rather esoteric idea, but the point is that it would leave the fully commercialised public authorities free to borrow and so free to invest as they judge, consistent with their objectives. The effect of that would be to build up investment at a time when it is relatively depressed. That is exactly the kind of policy that we should be encouraging at present. There is clearly a positive correlation between public investment and business investment. When public investment goes up, business investment goes up. By freeing the public authorities from the restrictions on their borrowing they would be free to borrow, free to invest, and that would be of direct benefit to the private sector. There are other proposals that could be made, but I think that is enough to give some sense of the priorities. We must look for policies which reduce both the current account deficit and unemployment simultaneously. This Budget will make some contributions to that task. More is needed in March next year and in later Budgets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In this place over the past three years I have pointed out on a number of occasions that on 10 February 1964 we saw one of the worst disasters in the peacetime history of the Royal Australian Navy. Many honourable members will recognise that I speak of the collision between the destroyer HMAS Voyager and the aircraft carrier and flagship HMAS Melbourne off Jervis Bay, claiming 82 lives. Since 1988 both in this place and outside I have supported the compensation cause for some 80 survivors, through to a successful High Court precedent-setting action for one of them late last year. Although that gentleman's claim has now been settled, regrettably many of those survivors and their families still bear the scars of the tragedy: the scars of psychological trauma, of persistent nervous shock, of domestic instability, of financial strain and, very importantly in this parliamentary setting, of misplaced confidence in a Government which espouses social justice--and we heard this earlier today in this place from the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe)--but which demonstrably has failed to put its money where its mouth is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I have been informed only in the past three weeks that in two of those cases, one in Victoria and the other in Queensland, the claimants have succumbed physically and/or emotionally  to  the  trauma  of  the Government's continuing obstructionism. To illustrate, I refer to an editorial entitled `Justice at last' in the Brisbane Courier-Mail of 7 September last year, which stated, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The view that the Commonwealth has behaved with despicable bureaucratic self-interest in the Voyager case would result in very little argument in the general community. The High Court ruling . . . paving the way for compensation claims by the survivors of that horrific 1964 naval accident is a signal victory for social justice. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth long denied liability for compensation. Mr Hawke's first government lifted the statute of limitations on the case in 1985, then slammed the door--</PARA>
<PARA>in 1986--</PARA>
<PARA>when it found there might be substantial compensation claims in the offing. </PARA>
<PARA>The High Court judgment by its Full Bench means that the Commonwealth, as the employer of people paid to defend the country, cannot claim exemption from civil compensation if they come to harm in the course of their natural or normal duties. This is not only an important precedent but also a simple reflection of elementary justice, albeit achieved only after a tortuous confrontation with the Commonwealth. I regret to say that the path to justice once again has been obstructed. This is best illustrated in a recent letter I received from Jim Taylor, one of the claimants' counsel, which says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Is the Government aware that in the Victorian Supreme Court on Wednesday 8th May on the third day of the Voyager trial--</PARA>
<PARA>and he refers to and cites the case of Clark v. the Commonwealth--</PARA>
<PARA>the legal representatives of the Government sought and succeeded in having a Jury discharged because of possible prejudice to the Commonwealth by Counsel's opening address?</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Clark issued his Writ in August, 1985 on the faith of the promises made by the Commonwealth and six years later the Commonwealth are fighting the whole issue over again in spite of their loss in Verwayen's case which was regarded by everyone as a test case. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, Jim Taylor finishes with two questions. Firstly:</PARA>
<PARA>Why will the Commonwealth not accept the verdict of the umpire i.e. the High Court decision that Verwayen and those like him were entitled to have their cases tried and to have the solemn promise made by the Commonwealth to them adhered to?</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly:</PARA>
<PARA>Is it the policy of the Government to continue to treat members of the defence forces in this shabby fashion?  Is this really the Government's policy or is the nose of some bureaucrat being put out of joint in these matters?</PARA>
<PARA>A telephone call that I received earlier today from another of those survivors says it all. He said to me in part:</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that the Government will not accept the umpire's decision. I am desperate and our voices continue to fall on deaf ears. Please put our case again. For many of us, time is running out. </PARA>
<PARA>I therefore ask the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy): will the remaining Voyager compensation cases be allowed by the Commonwealth to run their unhindered natural course through the courts of this land?</PARA>

I was delighted to be there and join with some hundred or more other citizens of my electorate to commemorate the establishment of this organisation in my electorate. For 20 years Yeronga Meals-on-Wheels has provided outstanding service to the community and particularly to the aged community in the Yeronga area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I wish to place on record my personal congratulations to all of the people involved in the Yeronga Meals-on-Wheels for, without their service to the community, there would be many hundreds of people who would be in dire straits caring for themselves and who would in fact be unable to remain in their own homes because they would not be able to provide for themselves, particularly with meals. Yeronga Meals-on-Wheels has had a proud history of 20 years of service, and it is currently led by Mr Kevin Weise, who has done an outstanding job for a number of years. He is ably supported by his secretary, Jean Haworth, and the coordinator of Yeronga Meals-on-Wheels, Esther Topping. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the twentieth birthday celebrations on Sunday, 11 August it was interesting that in the audience there were some 50 active volunteers in Yeronga Meals-on-Wheels who were supporters at the time of its establishment 20 years ago. That is some testament to the fact that it provides an outstanding service and that it is, in fact, a very strong community based organisation that people are willing to support. Yeronga Meals-on-Wheels has the great privilege of having its own kitchen facilities, its own building. That was provided about 15 years ago from funds donated by the Lions clubs in the area, and my congratulations also go to the Lions clubs which have continued to provide very strong support to the Meals-on-Wheels organisation, not just in Yeronga but throughout the electorate of Moreton and, in fact, throughout the city of Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA>  Yeronga Meals-on-Wheels is one of five Meals-on-Wheels organisations serving the community in the Moreton electorate and, at the twentieth birthday celebrations for Yeronga, representatives were present from the other four Meals-on-Wheels organisations--Woolloongabba Meals-on-Wheels, Carina Meals-on-Wheels, Holland Park Meals-on-Wheels and Mount Gravatt Meals-on-Wheels. All of those organisations do an outstanding job, but they do need volunteers. Without volunteers, they cannot survive. I put out a personal plea now to people within the community of Moreton and in the southern suburbs of Brisbane to get behind organisations like Meals-on-Wheels because they do need voluntary support. They do need people to come forward to give assistance, such as an afternoon or a morning once a month. Without that voluntary effort, we would not be able to provide the service that we provide for the very low price that we charge in Meals-on-Wheels. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Meals-on-Wheels organisation charges only $2.80 a person, a meal, a day. That is a very low price. It provides a very good balanced meal, a three-course meal for the people it serves. It is able to do that because it relies on such a strong amount of voluntary effort. But it has some trouble maintaining the numbers of volunteers. It needs volunteer drivers, cooks and assistants in the kitchens. It really does provide an important service in the community. The Government could not do it to the same level of efficiency and for the same cost. So it is important for our community that we do get behind groups like Meals-on-Wheels. I urge people in the community, if they do have some spare time, to provide that support. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a great pleasure to congratulate Yeronga Meals-on-Wheels on achieving its twentieth birthday, and I know it will continue in the next 20 years to provide the same level of outstanding service to the aged community in the suburb of Yeronga. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish to address a matter which I believe to be of national shame. It relates to the public enemy No. 1, which is unemployment. The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons), seated at the table, was recently through my electorate, and I do extend to him my thanks for having had the courtesy to let me know he was coming through, which seems to be a dying tradition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Speaking of dying, I again received word this afternoon that another Ballarat business has closed; another 50 people are out of work. Quite frankly, I have had a gutful of what has happened in Victoria, and I have had a gutful of what is happening in Ballarat. We are seeing the absolute heart ripped out of one of this nation's greatest regional centres, and it is slowly but surely being destroyed. I am not prepared to sit back and let this great centre and the great people who are in it be destroyed in the manner in which they are being destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have unemployment rates officially of some 16 per cent; we have unofficial unemployment rates of 20, 22 and 24 per cent; and we have youth unemployment of 33 and 35 per cent. I think it is about time that some decisions were made in this place that stop the rot and stop the destruction of centres such as Ballarat. It is just not Ballarat; it is happening all over this country. I think that this Parliament and this Government need to sit back and take stock of what is happening. They cannot sit here day in, day out, week in, week out and come up with the sort of proposals that we saw in the last Budget. There was absolutely no incentive in that Budget to move this country and to start getting centres like Ballarat back on the rails again. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), a Government member, told this Parliament what he thought of the Budget. I did not think he put it strongly enough, but other honourable members have done so. We simply have to take stock of what is happening. In Ballarat the community resources are being stretched to the absolute limit to stop people starving in the streets. We cannot expect the service providers to keep on doing what they have been doing for the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA>  I urge the Government and I urge the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to come to Ballarat, as the Minister at the table has done--not for this reason, but he at least came to Ballarat--and sit down to gain an apolitical view as to what is happening. I will take my member's hat off, I will leave it in the office, and I will take him out so that he can meet the people whom this depression is affecting. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is public enemy No. 1; have absolutely no fear about that. I hoped that perhaps the march in Sydney today was for the unemployed and for the future of this country. It was not. I respect the views of those who did march, but there are far more pressing issues than those for which they marched today. Quite frankly, I just do not think it reasonable, nor legitimate, for comments to be made in this House that we must accept unemployment levels of 10 or 11 per cent. I do not believe that we, as representatives of the people, can sit or stand in this place and accept that as a realistic concept. We are putting people on an unemployment scrap heap that they will never get off. We are putting their children on that scrap heap. I believe that as a community we are wasting our most valuable resource--that is, our people. </PARA>
<PARA>  Centres like Ballarat have been part of this county's history. They are dying. As I said before, the hearts have been ripped out of them. There are a lot of people in Ballarat who are prepared to do what they can to address the problems, but they need some incentive. They need a signal--a green light--from government. They need the green light from this place:  if they do invest, there are going to be some rewards; if they do invest, six months down the track they are not going to have to turn around again and start laying people off. </PARA>
<PARA>  I plead for something to be done, because we are just going to destroy those parts of this country that have contributed economically and socially, and I again plead with the Prime Minister to put this business with the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), out of the way, to get rid of it once and for all, and to start addressing the problems that face this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-From time to time, particularly during periods of hardship, we get calls for citizen initiated referenda. These calls are usually in association with the League of Rights or bodies aligned with the League of Rights, and really are quite specious; they have nothing to do with democracy. If we look at the examples of Switzerland and California where they work, we see that they certainly do not work towards democratic ends. Switzerland is much more a corporate state than a democracy in any normal understanding of the word. It allows pressure groups to monopolise the political system, causing great expense. I might add that, as California has shown, it is relatively easy to get resolutions passed simultaneously cutting government expenditure by reducing taxation and increasing government expenditure in amenities. Contradictory policies can be passed simultaneously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Last week I put out a press release, which was not picked up by anyone in the press gallery. Of course, the press in this country would not know an issue until a week after it had arrived. The press release was titled `Give the People a Say' and read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been a great deal of talk about reform from both the Government and Opposition, but both have overlooked a reform which is vital to Australia at this time. That reform is to give the people a means to directly express themselves on three policies which the elites of the day have imposed from above. </PARA>
<PARA>  The people should be asked directly about what they think of immigration policy, the policy of multiculturalism and the policy of integration with Asia. These three policies are of vital and genuine concern to every Australian, yet the elites have shown an overbearing arrogance and hostility towards those who have dared to question them. </PARA>
<PARA>  The most effective way to give the people a say is by means of a census, with multiple choice questions on these topics. A space should also be provided for people to list other subjects which concern them. In this way we can obtain a clear indication of public thinking. The mechanism used for the recent census could be used. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a certain Italian political theorist said, all states have to undergo renovation from time to time in order to prosper and "the way to renovate them . . . is to [figuratively] reduce them to their starting points". The nation of Australia was conceived as a democracy, not a corporate state oligarchy. Its federation was achieved by one of the most democratic processes which has ever brought a nation into being. </PARA>
<PARA>  So in Australia's case renovation means circumventing the privileged elites who have dictated policy to the people and going directly to the people themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>  By consulting them on these vital matters and heeding what they have to say we would go a considerable distance to restoring their strained faith in our parliamentary system. It would also be a step on the way to renewing the democratic process, as we approach the centenary of our federation. </PARA>
<PARA>I think this is a very important issue, Mr Deputy Speaker, because from my experience out in the electorate, the issues which are concerning ordinary Australians are jobs and the divisions which they see arising in Australia. For many years--sadly, under both</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Mr Speaker, I have received correspondence from a processor in the town of Albany, just adjoining my electorate, known as Southern Processors Ltd, which is a big processor of frozen vegetables, most of which are grown in my electorate in the area of Mount Barker in the Plantagenet Shire. In recent times Southern Processors has expanded its activities to limited exports to Japan. I remember speaking at length with the manager as to the sorts of criteria and requirements it had to meet in getting this export market. These criteria, of course, were set not only by the importing country of Japan but also by our own Department of Primary Industries and Energy and others, ensuring that this was not only a product that met every criteria relating to pesticides, et cetera, but also a product meeting criteria of quality, size and you name it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This company is now under considerable pressure, like many other food processors within Australia, because of the competition from inports. Mr Griffith, the manager, writes to me as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>While we believe the Australian industry must be truly internationally competitive, and Southern Processors has demonstrated its desire to achieve this goal through substantial capital investment in state of the art equipment in all operational areas of its business, it is a fact that imports enjoy a price advantage through export subsidisation, marginal costing or dumping by the supplying country and indeed we are not playing on a `level playing field'. </PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence, the company considered importing some stock itself and selling an imported product. In the process of doing so, it wrote the following letter, originally to the Australian Customs Service:</PARA>
<PARA>We are presently investigating the possibility of importing frozen vegetables into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Could you please advise what, if any, restrictions apply as to quality, country of origin and conditions under which the produce was grown, such as the use and possible residues of pesticides not permitted for use in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a simple inquiry. Customs said, `It has got nothing to do with us', and referred the company to the Department of Agriculture. In the meantime, the company also wrote the same letter to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, which replied:</PARA>
<PARA>At present frozen vegetables are not included in the sampling programme. </PARA>
<PARA>That Department referred the company to the State Department of Health and the State Department of Agriculture, Quarantine Section. The company wrote to the State Department of Health, which said:</PARA>
<PARA>  The Health Department has specific labelling requirements for imported foods and a pamphlet giving the relevant details is enclosed. </PARA>
<PARA>  In relation to pesticide residues, it is the importer who bears the responsibility of ensuring the wholesomeness of the food and that prohibited pesticides are not present . . . The Health Department does not analyse frozen vegetables on entry, however, the product may be sampled at retail level. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that practically never occurs. He was referred to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Western Australian Department of Agriculture. The Western Australian Department of Agriculture said:</PARA>
<PARA>Quick frozen fresh fruit and vegetables are permitted entry without the need for a permit from any country provided that the product has been subjected to a treatment to eliminate the quarantine concerns e.g. blanching and freezing at 18 degrees C for at least seven days. Documentary evidence of the above would be required for at least the first few consignments. </PARA>
<PARA>Might I add that I have had similar complaints from the fishing industry. Photographs have been shown to me of some places where fish is handled prior to its being frozen and sent to Australia from Asia and other countries. It is deplorable. It is literally out on a bitumen road. Yet our authorities allow that into Australia while they go around and harass our exporters to a degree that is almost intolerable and then charge them a large fee. </PARA>
<PARA>  The level playing field in this instance is the public health. It is time that the authorities took steps to ensure that those goods which come in to compete with our products, notwithstanding any price advantage, should meet the same health requirements that apply to local production, and the requirements that those exporting countries would apply to our exporters were they to send goods to those countries. We know that in most countries around the world the residue provisions and other things are used as a tariff barrier, and in fact they should not be. But here we are with an open door policy operating to the detriment of some very efficient operators, such as Southern Processors, and I draw it to the attention of the Parliament in the hope that something will be done about this situation. </PARA>

<TITLE>Urban Flooding in Western Sydney</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6T4">Mr ELLIOTT</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Parramatta)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.52 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Tonight I wish to raise an issue of great concern to people who live in my electorate and parts of western Sydney. I refer to the problem we have with the urban flooding that occurs in much of western Sydney. We have experienced devastating floods on at least three occasions in the last five years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Over the last few years the Federal Government has recognised that this is a major concern and that there is a need for it to play an active role in overcoming the urban flooding problems in western Sydney. Indeed, in the last financial year the Government allocated $750,000 towards immediate flood mitigation works in the Parramatta River catchment. That funding, under the normal flood funding formula, has to be matched by the State Government and also requires a contribution from local government. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last financial year the quarter of a million dollars allocated by the Commonwealth was regarded by many people as insufficient to accelerate flood mitigation works in our area. So the local community, the local councils and the Upper Parramatta River Catchment Trust made an approach through me to the Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to see whether extra flood funds could be provided. Early in June this year the Minister was able, very pleasingly, to assure me that an extra quarter of a million dollars would be allocated in the 1990-91 financial year for these flood mitigation works. This was a major breakthrough because it meant in total, with the normal matching contribution from the State Government, that over half a million dollars worth of flood works would be carried out in the local area. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was amazed to find out, only a week or so ago, that rather than match the extra funding provided by the Federal Government, the State Government wrote back to the Commonwealth saying it refused to match it. This meant the opportunity to accelerate crucial works to ensure that homes in areas such as Toongabbie, Wentworthville and other parts of my electorate around Parramatta was lost. </PARA>
<PARA>  This refusal by the State Government to match the Commonwealth's commitment to flood mitigation works in western Sydney is an absolute disgrace because it means that the owners of many of the homes flooded in 1986 and 1988--over 400 homes were flooded in 1986 in the local area--have lost the opportunity to benefit from those works. They will not be accelerated in the way the Commonwealth Government sought because the Government of New South Wales has refused to give them the same priority that the Federal Labor Government has. </PARA>
<PARA>  This matter is made even worse because, as part of a deputation to the State Minister for Natural Resources last year, I sought an assurance from the Minister, Mr Causley, that the State Government would match any extra funding provided by the Commonwealth. The Minister said that whatever funding was provided by the Federal Government towards these works would be matched by the New South Wales Government. The Minister took approximately six months to break that promise, which is pretty good timing as far as the New South Wales Government is concerned. Because the State Government lost the seat of Parramatta at the last election, it no longer places priority on these works. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commonwealth has shown its commitment not only in the provision of the extra quarter of a million dollars last financial year but also in the Budget announced on Tuesday, 20 August, in which the Commonwealth agreed to a further program of urban flood works in western Sydney. In this year's Budget funding was allocated to a special program to deal precisely with these works. That program involved an allocation of an additional million dollars for the total area of western Sydney on top of the normal funding arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>  This matter has been even further worsened because only recently I have found out that again the New South Wales Government is resisting matching and cooperating in the new flood initiative that has been announced in the Federal Budget. Indeed, it appears to be arguing that resolving the urban flooding problems in western Sydney is not something that the State Government should allocate funding towards. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe it is imperative that the people of western Sydney, particularly the people in the Parramatta area, have their problems immediately rectified by the State Government, that the complacent and unreasonable attitude of the State of New South Wales be reversed and that the State Government fully cooperate in the major initiatives that the Federal Government is providing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Just over two weeks ago I held a housing workshop in the electorate of Bendigo, to which I invited a number of people who have ability and expertise in the field of building and housing construction in Victoria, including representatives from the Building Societies of Victoria Association, the Commonwealth Bank, the Australian Council of Housing Societies, the Real Estate Institute of Victoria, the Master Builders Association, the Housing Industry Association and also the Royal Australian Institute of Architects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  They addressed the question of making housing affordable for first home buyers. This is very important to the future of Australia, particularly for young couples trying to bridge the deposit gap and obtain a first home so that they can establish themselves and raise a family. The great Australian dream is still alive and well in Victoria and certainly in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was most impressed by a number of contributions to that workshop. Firstly, I was impressed by the address given by Mr Ian Bremner, who is the executive director of the Real Estate Institute of Victoria. He was able to present a paper at that workshop which highlighted a very important factor in people's potential for saving for that first home. Mr Bremner addressed the question of where superannuation funds might redirect potential savings away from the housing industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  If funds are redirected into superannuation, that will leave less savings for young couples to be able to bridge the deposit gap and to be able to afford a first home. It is going to be of major significance because of the Hawke Government's stated intention to have ultimately between 9 and 12 per cent as the superannuation contribution from employers with a matching contribution in the future for employees. It will mean that employees will have to contribute to superannuation and it will then lower their capacity to save money for a first home. This will have fairly serious effects on the housing industry right throughout Australia. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Before addressing specific questions raised by the honourable Member, it is perhaps worth outlining the payment cycle embodied in the legislation covering both Stages of the Child Support Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act as introduced into the Parliament, identified a collection system which would be calendar monthly and a payment system which envisaged payment no later than the first Wednesday of the month after the payment was due to the Registrar. In other words, there is, and always has been, a clear time frame between the liability to make the first payment and the date of receipt of that payment. Thereafter, the legislation envisages the regular and timely payment of maintenance calendar monthly by all payers. The Bill, introduced into this House in December 1987, received all party support from the Parliament and was passed without amendment.</PARA>
<PARA>  The population that is affected by the arrangement is every individual who registers with the Child Support Agency. Registration is not compulsory for persons other than those in receipt of an income-tested pension, allowance or benefit. To the extent that the custodial parent was receiving regular maintenance before registering with the Agency, there will be a `hiatus' in the receipt of the first maintenance payment from the Agency for such individuals. The honourable member should be aware that the Institute of Family Studies in its publication `Settling Up' found that in the vast majority of cases, parents liable to pay under the old system, if they paid regularly, they did so for a relatively short period of time. The `hiatus' is the small cost, if you like, for the custodial parent joining a national and effective enforcement scheme. The benefit is having the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) as his or her "cost free" enforcer of child maintenance in the future and subject to their other income, eligible custodians are entitled to full pension or benefit in the interim.</PARA>
<PARA>  Having said that, the answer to the honourable member's questions are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>  (1) Generally speaking, following receipt of payment by the Agency, the time period which elapses before payment is received by the custodian can be as little as 7 days and as much as 28 days.</PARA>
<PARA>  Less than one week transpires between transferring payments between the ATO and the Department of Social Security. The ATO advises the Department of Social Security of amounts collected on the last Thursday of each month and the Department of Social Security then draws an equivalent amount from the Child Support Trust Account and pays that amount into the custodial parent's nominated bank account on or before the first Wednesday of the following month.</PARA>
<PARA>  With regard to interest earned on monies credited to the Child Support Trust Account, it should be noted that the Trust Account, in itself, does not earn interest. The account forms part of the Commonwealth Public Account. The Budget as a whole receives the benefit of interest on cash balances in the Commonwealth Public Account and other benefits in terms of reduced Government borrowings and subsequent reduced public debt interest.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Child Support Agency correspondence may bear dates on which the Office is closed. This could arise when large print runs are undertaken at weekends or public holidays and the letters bear the date that they are actually printed.</PARA>

<PARA>  (1) Between 1970 and 1979 Dr Mahathir was twice invited to visit Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>  In August 1971 Dr Mahathir took up an invitation to visit within Australia under the S.O.V.F program following a private visit he had made to attend a seminar at Monash University.</PARA>
<PARA>  An invitation from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to visit Australia as a Guest of Government in 1979 was not taken up by Dr Mahathir.</PARA>
<PARA>  In 1968 an invitation under the SOVF program was issued to Dr Mahathir to visit Australia during June of that year.</PARA>
<PARA>  Dr Mahathir did formally accept that invitation.</PARA>

<PARA>  Dr Mahathir, in response to this invitation to take up the visit later in the year, indicated he was unable to do so because of his own commitments.</PARA>

<PARA>  (1) In connection with the proceedings of the coronial inquiry into the death of Assistant Commissioner Colin Winchester, in particular proceedings of that inquiry on 20 and 21 November 1990, did the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence (ABCI) instruct Mr Halliday, its solicitor, that Mr Maguire, QC, representing the Australian Federal Police (AFP), would also be representing the ABCI.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="574" SPEAKER="Duffy The Hon M.J." NAMEID="6G4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NORTH SYDNEY">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The questions asked by the honourable member relate to proceedings before the Coronial inquiry into the death of Assistant Commissioner Colin Winchester and concern the actions and knowledge of various persons in relation to those proceedings. To assist the honourable member I have asked for and been provided with the following information:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) No. It should be noted that Mr Halliday was not the ABCI's solicitor before the inquest but rather its legal adviser in relation to specific matters. The ABCI was not called on to appear before the Coronial inquiry, and therefore did not seek representation.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) No such written report was received. I am advised that Deputy Commissioner Farmer had informed the witness Jolly that Mr Maguire had no instructions from the ABCI. Because Mr Jolly had ceased secondment with the ABCI when he resigned from the Victoria Police in June 1988, he appeared before the inquest as a private citizen, not as an officer or a 'witness' of the ABCI.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) No.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) No.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) No.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) The transcript of the inquest shows the following--the sensitivity of evidence relating to ABCI operations was raised at the inquest by Mr Winneke QC, Senior Counsel assisting the Coroner, on 20 November 1990. He referred to a letter from a solicitor concerning the issue on behalf of a witness, Mr Jolly. During a period relevant to the evidence, Mr Jolly had been seconded to the ABCI. Mr Jolly intimated that he wanted the Coroner to consider hearing the matter in camera. The Coroner declined to make such an order on the basis that the matters raised were not far removed from matters already raised in the hearing and `so to suppress it at this stage would not be any great achievement'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) I am unaware of any disclosure made by Mr Jolly that would have needed the permission of any authority.</PARA>
<PARA>  (8) The only 'charts and documents' referred to in Mr Jolly's statement comprised (a) folders labelled 'Camel' and 'Seville', housed in the NSW BCI, sighted by Mr Jolly around mid 1982; (b) a diagram or chart of Calabrian activity; (c) the 'Plati Cobweb'; and (d) charts prepared by the NSW BCI the ABCI and the SA BCI. The AFP was provided with copies of document (b). Document (c) was an AFP source document. Because of the vagueness of the description of documents in (a) and (d), it is not possible to categorically state whether those documents were all supplied to the AFP, but it is believed the AFP was provided, from time to time, with various charts/documents relating to Italian organised criminal activity by other law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA>  (9) Mr Jolly referred to his statement in giving evidence. The transcript shows that Mr Winneke, Senior Counsel assisting the inquest, did not ask Mr Jolly questions about the charts because he did not consider it necessary for the purposes of the inquest. In his view, it was not part of the Coroner's role to carry out detailed investigation into the 'mafia' for its own sake, but only to carry out such enquiries as might throw light on the identity of the person or persons responsible for the murder of Assistant Commissioner Winchester.</PARA>
<PARA>  (10) The ABCI had no official role in the inquest although Mr Halliday was present, at the request of the ABCI, while Mr Jolly gave evidence.</PARA>
<PARA>  (11) Yes. Former Deputy Commissioner Farmer cannot recall whether he was present at the inquest during any time that Mr Jolly was giving evidence, however he does recall seeing Mr Jolly at the court. As Mr Farmer's attendance at the inquest was only part of his duties, any absence, at this or any other time, would have been attributable to his role as AFP Deputy Commissioner (Operations) and matters requiring his personal attention in that capacity.</PARA>
<PARA>  (12) No. A statement of Mr Jolly's evidence was passed to all parties represented at the inquest by the team assisting the Coroner. The ABCI did not assist Mr Jolly in the preparation of his statement to the inquest, and the matters contained therein appear to relate to his own recollection of projects which were active during the time he was a project analyst at the ABCI (January 1982 - January 1984).</PARA>
<PARA>  (13) The answer, with respect to some of the documents, is:</PARA>
<PARA>  (a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (i) Some documents, that is those which were in possession of the AFP, would have been seen before Mr Jolly gave evidence; others would not have been seen until during or after Mr Jolly's evidence.  It is not possible to answer this question with certainty in relation to the documents referred to at answer 8 (a) above, as it cannot be confirmed exactly what information was contained in the specific folders in mid-1982, to which Mr Jolly referred in his evidence. Nevertheless, it is likely that Mr Maguire, his instructing solicitor, and Deputy Commissioner Farmer did view such of the documents relevant to Operation Seville brought into existence in 1982 by NSW BCI as were made available to, and distributed by, the legal team assisting the Coroner.</PARA>
<PARA>  With reference to the documents referred to at response 8 (b), none of the nominated parties recollect viewing these documents, though it is likely that the legal team representing the Commissioner did view this chart amongst a large number of other charts, tables and diagrams of organised criminal activity on the part of the Calabrians.</PARA>
<PARA>  With reference to the document referred to at response 8 (c), Mr Maguire did not see this. Mr Maguire's instructing solicitor and Deputy Commissioner Farmer saw it in December sometime after Mr Jolly had completed his evidence (20 and 21 November 1990). Mr Maguire's cross examination of Mr Jolly at page 6621 of the transcript was based upon a description of the physical appearance of the document given to Mr Maguire by a member of the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA>  With reference to the documents referred to at response 8 (d), all relevant charts within the possession of the AFP were produced to Counsel assisting the Coroner. Where relevant these were provided to the legal representatives of parties appearing at the inquest. Mr Maguire, his instructing solicitor and Deputy Commissioner Farmer can recall seeing charts relating to organised criminal activity on the part of Calabrians.</PARA>
<PARA>  (ii) See above.</PARA>
<PARA>  (iii) (a) and (b) as representatives of the AFP; (c) as a member of the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA>  None were representing the ABCI.</PARA>
<PARA>  (14) Mr Maguire was not instructed on behalf of the AFP to minimise the significance of evidence given by Mr Jolly. He was instructed to test the evidence.</PARA>
<PARA>  (15) No.</PARA>
<PARA>  (16) The NCA has existing references to investigate groups of persons some of whom are of Calabrian origin.</PARA>
<PARA>  (17) While no single agency has national responsibility for coordinating criminal investigations into Calabrian crime groups, the NCA has the authority to investigate such matters in all jurisdictions. Currently, it is not pursuing active investigations into matters referred to at (16), but it has embarked on a process of cooperation with all law enforcement agencies with an interest in this area, in pursuance of its policy set out in its `New Directions' paper.</PARA>
<PARA>  The AFP is the law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth government with general responsibility for investigation of Commonwealth offences. Investigations may also be conducted by State/Territory police forces in conjunction with the AFP. Task Forces may also be established to enquire into activities which extend beyond State/Territory borders.</PARA>
