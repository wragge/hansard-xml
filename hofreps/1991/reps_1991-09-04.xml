<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As has become traditional over some time, the House is again debating a Budget that was cobbled together without any particular effort to go in any particular direction. This has been happening for a considerable period under this Labor Government. Unfortunately, any credibility that this Budget may have had disappeared yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Yesterday, one of the major cost-cutting initiatives--the Medicare charge--was thrown out by Caucus. I see the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) is smiling his head off. Apparently he was one of those who thought that that was a good idea. But it flies absolutely in the face of the Government's criticism of the Opposition when it, for quite proper reasons, defended the rights of families and people with children when the Government tried to rip away from them the family allowance through the asset test. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-If the Government had chosen to use that policy, it would not be in the trouble it is in today and pensioners would not be waiting two years to get into hospital. I am proud of my policy. The fact that I did not get a chance to deliver it is another matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Let us look at this Budget. This Government commenced office with a commitment to deficit Budgets, after which everything else has happened by accident. Deficits, surplus, deficits--whatever the numbers come out to when the Government considers all the claims of everyone, that is what happens. There is no planning, purpose or vision and, of course, no ability and now, after yesterday, there is no credibility. </PARA>
<PARA>  The only thing the Government seems to have been good at--and even that appears to have failed in recent times--is self-congratulation. If there were one competent or successful businessman on the Government benches he would tell the Government about the bottom line. In this Budget the bottom line is an admitted--and I underline the word admitted because the figure is greater than this--$4,700m deficit, a stagnant economy and one million unemployed people. Again, that is the recorded number of unemployed; those who are out of work but who have not registered would make that number even higher. </PARA>
<PARA>  The total individual tax payments as recorded in these Budget Papers are down $4,000m on the estimate for last year's collections. Company tax collections are down $2,000m on the estimate. Withholding tax is down $150m. Sales tax is down a massive $1,300m. Payments to the unemployed are up $2,000m on the estimate--39 per cent higher than the previous year and 80 per cent higher than the previous two years. If that is not an indication of an economy in serious decline and collapse, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is after the 1980 decade of international financial boom when the Government should have been putting the acorns away so that we could address the inevitable cyclical downturn of an international nature. But for the last 10 years Australia has been taking its own economic action and has no longer been affected by circumstances around the world. While the economies of overseas countries were booming, we were getting into trouble. Who is to blame for that?  It is this Government. Where we should have had economic decision making we have just had a reactionary process. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to take honourable members back to the situation as I saw it. It has now been recognised that what I was saying years ago, that everything was being done incorrectly and at the wrong time, was right. The first Keating Budgets brought in an $8,000 billion deficit, which was stupidly blamed on the previous Government. The reality is that that overinflated the economy, as did the additional amounts which took deficit spending in the first four Budgets up to $26 billion. The economy was recovering on its own because it had rained. </PARA>
<PARA>  That was the first problem. Then we had all of these deregulatory decisions of the financial markets which were in themselves not wrong but they were wrong because the Government looked at only half of the situation. It left our tariff regime in place;  it left our regulated labour market in place;  and it left regulated commodity trading in place. These factors totally distorted the economy and, as such, the economy could not possibly work. We had deregulation of financial markets but no consideration was given to the ability of those markets to handle that change at that time. It was a correct decision taken without proper consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also had the floating of the dollar without any recognition that a currency like Australia's, with its relative certainty and safety, would become Monopoly money for the major speculators around the world. We now have a situation where we have 500 billion Australian dollars turned over on Australian foreign exchange markets every month. Of that amount, $8 billion is required to finance our normal economic activities. In other words, there are substantially more Aussie dollars played with than are needed. Those speculators decide almost entirely the value of our dollar. It no longer is a recognition of our financial circumstances. They have got our money, they have got the Aussie paper, and they are determined to retain its value. </PARA>
<PARA>  Who pays for that?  Australian exporters. The dollar is grossly overvalued, as was admitted by one Labor member yesterday when he called for its devaluation. The reality is that the Australian Reserve Bank is simply not large enough to conduct its role of establishing the correct value for the Australian dollar in the international market. We have seen time and time again that, when it has attempted to force the dollar down by selling it, it has been taken on by the major institutions and given a hiding. The simple fact is that some of those major financial institutions around the world turn over more money than Australia does. They are now dictating the value of our currency. Of course, that is very damaging to our economic future. </PARA>
<PARA>  We had a cloistered Canberra bureaucracy, an arrogant Treasurer and a hypnotised press gallery which all combined to damage the Australian economy and bring it to its knees in a mere eight years. The bottom line--which I refer to again--is $133 billion of international debt. If those opposite do not think that has an effect on everything from here on in, they do not understand the fundamentals of business. The tragedy of that situation is that most of that $133 billion was borrowed for fun and games, for corporate play, the doubling of values of assets that produce nothing extra. That was the tragedy in that period. The simple rule in the business rule book is that if one borrows money one must invest it in income producing assets. </PARA>
<PARA>  Anybody--be it a family or anyone else--who goes out and borrows money to have a good time with it, ends up in a tragic situation, and that is what has happened to Australia. The blame can be levelled all over the place, but while we have a government, the buck stops there. We are the regulators;  we do take the final responsibility, and we have just got to look at that. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have been told that we are going to have a housing led recovery and that interest rates have been dropped another one per cent to achieve it.  If we had any local savings left, they would be used to lower that foreign debt of $133,000m, and that is not happening. When we get this debt led recovery, which we are going to have for the second time around apparently, where is the money going to come from?  It can only come from the savings of people living overseas. Housing is 95 per cent debt. That is the way housing is being funded today. It is going to come from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is the Government going to do when the deficit starts to blow out, when the overseas funds start rolling in and there is a rapid increase in foreign debt?  The Government has only got one way of stopping it--to put interest rates up again. What happens to all the poor devils who borrow this month to build a house?  What happens to all the small businessmen who think that now is the time with interest rates falling to buy a new truck or a new bit of machinery?  None of them can borrow at fixed interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting that, at the instruction of the Reserve Bank, short term money fell yesterday and long term rates went up. That is the true market assessment. I have been watching it very closely because I, too, am a businessman. The message still is to borrow long; in fact, the long term interest rate market went up yesterday because the market says that this cannot last. It cannot last because if people are encouraged to borrow money, there is only one place that Australia can get it from--overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Stutchbury, along with Professor Pickford, told us today that overseas debt does not matter. They, too, are academics. In the real business world, debt matters at all times because it has to be serviced. The biggest component of our trade deficit at the moment is the interest bill. Unless we are producing things in this country, we cannot pay the interest bill. Fundamentally, we continue to borrow to pay it. We are now told that we are going to have a recovery by getting people to borrow money and build houses. That would be fine if the savings existed within Australia. They do not. </PARA>
<PARA>  Where do we go from here?  The Government has a couple of solutions. It is going to impose superannuation on the people. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the concept of telling Australians that they have to start providing for their own retirement income. That is an excellent procedure. However, the Government just happens to have chosen the worst vehicle. The only thing in favour of superannuation as a retirement investment is convenience. It is otherwise a lousy investment. </PARA>
<PARA>  If honourable members go back to their electorates and ask the recently retired who have private insurance superannuation investment how much they are getting by way of a lump sum they will see that it would be $60,000 or $70,000 and, if they are lucky, $100,000. When they signed up for it 30 years ago, they could buy three or four houses with that amount of money. They really thought it was a fortune. What can they buy with it today?  Not one house. The reason it is a lousy investment is the inflation component. The Government should look at that. That cannot be managed because the investments that are safe enough for those types of institutions pay very low dividends. Over the decades, people have learnt that if they chase the top interest rate, it is probable that when they go to get their money back, it will not be there. We have seen it in Western Australia;  we have seen it all around Australia. Every time institutions pay  one per cent or two per cent above the market, they fall over. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those institutions are going to have to deal in safe securities and are going to have to take money offshore. They are going to have to do all sorts of things to try to get a return that, in most cases, will not keep up with inflation. That is the first reason. </PARA>
<PARA>  Now that the Government will make this compulsory, will people still be committed to trade union funds? The Government has not explained that. Trade unionists run the Australian Labor Party. In Western Australia and Victoria we have seen what good money managers they are. How would people like to have those blokes handling their dough?  The Government's past Treasurer went down to a trade union conference once and told it, `Do not leave the money with the money managers. Take it over yourself. Have the financial muscle--your industrial muscle is disappearing'. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would hate to think of any of my employees' retirement future residing in the hands of people like Mr Parker, for example--a one-time leading trade union official. How would anyone like him running his or her financial retirement money?  This is what is being proposed--unless the Government is going to tell us that that is not on and that there will be no trade union involvement and trade union rake-off. </PARA>
<PARA>  A third point that worries me is that the Government tells people to invest in their retirement, but the first person to get his hands into it is the tax man, who takes 15 per cent of it. He does not wait for it any more at the point of retirement; he wants it up front. That is an initiative of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The trade union wants its dollar a week. I do not know what it does for the money. Then there is the fund manager. When we read of 30 per cent, 10 per cent, 5 per cent and minus 3 per cent returns on investments by the fund manager, those returns are after all of this other money has come out. People are not getting 30 per cent, 5 per cent or minus 3 per cent--which I think is the current rate--on what the employer puts in; they are only getting those returns on what is left. I have had people send me documents as to how their vocational union superannuation is going. In most cases, the current net worth of their policy is substantially less than employer contributions. I guess that over time that might grow; but it is a pretty slow process. </PARA>
<PARA>  Why cannot people have some options?  Why cannot ordinary Australians go out and buy a unit of accommodation which will have the appropriate value in time and use that as their retirement investment?  Why can we not give them incentives to do that?  They will spread their investments. I reckon we could have a redistribution argument outside, because I think the economy is pretty important. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes. I reckon redistribution is a matter for the corridors. When we get down to this situation and the final point, people should be able to make their own choices. We are telling small businessmen who are battling, who have not been able to afford even a $3,000 a year contribution, which is a deduction, for their own superannuation, that under this arrangement they have to find 3 per cent or 5 per cent of their total wages outlay. Little business has got to give it to big business, because when the superannuation funds get it, they will not invest in small business. There are 760,000 small employers keeping this country going. It is silly. It should not happen. It is one of the things that really worry me. It is wrong and I will oppose it at every step. It is a good idea with the wrong solutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Of course we need Australians to invest in their retirement. But is it not interesting that this is what we say to Australians today, `Do not worry about health, the Government will fix that; do not worry about your kids' education, the Government will fix that; do not really worry about retirement, the Government will fix that--but we would like you to save some money.'? We then say, `We have taken half your income away, 40 per cent at least, to enable us to give all these handouts. You have not got much left, but we think you should save some'. If people were left with some of those problems that I have just referred to and with the money that is taken from them, I think most people would save it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would tell them honestly the facts. I think the facts are irrefutable. I think the fact is that there could be, in 20 years time, an anti-pensions party. It is a terrible thing to contemplate, but I think there will be a time when the workers who are left will revolt and say, `We will not pay this money'. That will be a tragedy for the people who have not provided for themselves. I cannot see why for a period--say, for 10 years; not a long time--the family home is not a deductible investment for retirement. Nobody gets along very well without his or her own private home in retirement; it is a necessary part of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We should look a lot more widely at investment opportunities for people, and we should encourage them. If people want to buy a little factory, let some other small business go into it, make some money and pay some taxes, it sounds a lot better than giving it all to two or three major fund managers who, by prudential requirements, cannot take the risk on the little guy. </PARA>

That would be a tragedy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I did not get very far this morning with all the advice I have for Australia. That particular issue was an important one. I will no doubt get some other opportunities at a later date to talk about some of the other issues. There is only so much money in Australia. If the Government wants to take it all and spend it--which governments of any political colour generally do not do very well--then the private sector cannot spend it. I do not know why we do not just leave the money with the private sector and let it get on with the job. It will make mistakes but they will be a lot of little ones. When government makes a mistake it is usually a very large one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to talk about one of the highlights in this year's Budget--the preparedness of the Commonwealth Government to look again at problems of urban development in Australia through the building better cities program. Today I will concentrate my remarks on that facet of the appropriations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is true that most surveys of international living conditions rate Australian cities very highly. The last one that I was able to rake up, which was published in November of last year, had Sydney and Melbourne in the top three. This is against the fact that the residents of other cities in Australia would regard living conditions in Melbourne and Sydney as somewhat worse than their own. By international standards we have cities that are very well serviced for the people who live in them. Honourable members might ask why we intend to spend more money on improving them yet again. </PARA>
<PARA>  The good urban environments that we have in this country are the result of four or five generations of Australians being prepared to plough the economic surplus generated by our very efficient primary exporting sector into the urban environments and to protect them and their industries by various subsidies, tariffs and other government subventions. In the 1990s and beyond, that kind of policy will not be possible and we will have to address some other aspects of urban development, including the efficiency of our cities and equity of access to our facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  Firstly, in relation to access and equity, the distribution of urban lifestyles, and the pleasures of them, is not equal. On the one hand, we have areas in the outer fringe suburbs that develop and receive much of the new housing stock, and have done over the last few decades, but they have been distant from the job market and from many cultural facilities and they have been late receiving education opportunities, child-care places, public hospitals, public transport and so on. We have the paradox that these outer suburban areas are expensive to develop, are inefficient and receive community resources only late after their development. In the late 1960s I bought a new house in such an outer suburban development and experienced this process. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the same time we have inner city areas that are showing evidence of urban decay resulting from the simultaneous movement of industries away from them and flight of population to outer suburban areas. Honourable members might say that rectifying these situations is not the province of the Commonwealth government. But to the extent that the government is responsible for improving the efficiency of the Australian economy and the equity of access to social facilities and opportunities for Australians, it is clear that we need to get involved in the developing demographic structure of our major cities. Since these cities hold somewhere between 60 and 70 per cent of our population, they also hold well over half of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Labor Party has long had an interest in urban development. The latest program that we have put together in this Budget results from the initiative of the Special Premiers Conference in October of last year which was convened to bring micro-economic reform to the system of government itself and to improve its efficiency. A resulting report, the report of the working group on patterns of urban settlement, was presented to the next Special Premiers Conference in July 1991 and sought to suggest ways in which urban development could be improved, made more equitable and made more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report points to the relative decline in government urban infrastructure expenditure over the past 20 years, while at the same time private demand, particularly for low density urban housing in the outer suburban areas, has increased, with resultant poor linkages between employment and housing, labour market inflexibility, high journey to work costs, traffic congestion, pollution and so on. It suggested essentially three ways in which to do something about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  The first is urban consolidation, to encourage a range of approaches, including medium density infill and urban containment in the outer fringes of our cities, the essential point being to limit the growth of the geographic spread of our cities while filling in land that is presently not settled. Secondly, it suggests that infrastructure financing should be placed on a more commercial basis by public authorities to avoid the excessive subsidies going to urban sprawl, which has been a feature of past government infrastructure funding. Thirdly, it suggests the establishment of better government coordination mechanisms, to ensure that the impact of Commonwealth policies on State and local governments, and vice versa, can be more clearly assessed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget has taken up these ideas, as the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) has put it, by establishing the aim of a new partnership between Federal, State and local governments, so that our cities and the quality of life of the people who live in them can be improved. To this end, $800m has been allocated over the next five years, with $56m of it to be spent during the coming financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to put in context what this is trying to deal with. If the present growth rate of population continues, during the next 10 years we will need to put more than 1.2 million dwellings into our cities to provide for the population growth, and 700,000 of those at present would be built on the fringes of our cities, with the billions of dollars in urban infrastructure expenditure resting on the public purse. This better cities program is designed to alter the emphasis of development but it will vary from place to place, in accord with State and local government suggestions and needs. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commonwealth will try to encourage the matching of new housing to job opportunities, to public services and to transport. This process will be undertaken through the States. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) have already written to the State governments to ask them to nominate a Minister each who will be involved in this process. They, in turn, will be asked to nominate suitable developments and, if necessary, to determine those in conjunction with local government authorities. Again I need to emphasise that the cost of the present system of development is such that public funds subsidise outer suburban blocks to the tune of $19,000 each in the Adelaide area, and much more in the larger cities. We are trying to deal with a redeployment of those facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  The important question that we now face is: how can this work on the ground? I want to spend most of my remaining time dealing with how I feel this could appropriately be applied to the metropolitan area of Adelaide. It is true that Adelaide does not face the problems of urban sprawl development and inner urban decay in quite the same form or proportions as Sydney and Melbourne, because it is a slower growing city and it does have vacant land; nonetheless, it is facing the same general process of having the most affordable low density housing in the northern and southern extremities of the metropolitan area. Public funds, as I have said, have been used to provide increasing infrastructure for these outer suburban developments, but people are still left with lower access to job opportunities and social support systems. </PARA>
<PARA>  What are the options?  In the metropolitan area of Adelaide there is land that can be used for urban consolidation and for other processes of the kind that the better cities program is designed to deal with. I have spoken in this chamber before about the Northfield development project, which is such a development. With the Northfield development it is envisaged that up to 10,000 people will be located on what is presently largely vacant land in the north-east inner suburbs. This land will be vacated by the redeployment of two hospitals and the moving of a dairy research farm from the area. This will enable a very large urban consolidation project to take place. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are other kinds of urban consolidation which are rather different in the western suburbs. If we envisage the metropolitan area of Adelaide, we find that there is a strip that runs from Anzac Highway to the west of the central business district, from Anzac Highway northwards, a couple of miles wide, until it reaches the proposed MFP site, which is in itself a form of urban consolidation about which I have spoken before but which has its own opportunities and has different forms of commitment from the Commonwealth Government, which has accepted it as a national program. </PARA>
<PARA>  Immediately to the south of the MFP site there is a strip of land which is very appropriate for urban consolidation and for the building better cities program. Most of the land is presently run by the local councils of Port Adelaide, Enfield, Hindmarsh, Thebarton and West Torrens. I would like to say most about Hindmarsh because I have had most to do with members of that local council over the last couple of weeks. </PARA>
<PARA>  Hindmarsh developed as a settlement separate from Adelaide during the later nineteenth century. During the early part of this century it became a very significant industrial area. After the Second World War there was a boom in the development of light secondary industry, behind the tariff wall and with the subventions of the kind that were then the way in which we carried out our industrial development. As a result, its residential population actually declined as its industrial base increased. But, of course, the social amenities, like schools, public transport, some parklands and so on, which had been developed during the previous period of population from the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth century, remained. </PARA>
<PARA>  During the 1980s, the attractiveness of this area for residential settlement became more evident as people were faced with either moving to the northern or southern fringe suburban development areas or trying to get alternative accommodation closer to the city. The Hindmarsh and surrounding councils started to try to redevelop the suburbs which had been depopulated and industrialised. Suburbs like Bowden and Brompton, which had during the 1950s and 1960s been synonymous with the poorer areas of Adelaide, started to move up market. By the mid-1980s, the plans of these councils for repopulation were starting to pay off. Young middle class families, including one of my sons and his wife, moved into the area. As more people like them moved in, greater demand was generated for facilities, public services, upgrading of community services and so on, but the council did not want to see the total flight of light industry and the jobs which it generated. </PARA>
<PARA>  Land in this area, unlike that in Northfield and unlike that in the MFP site, is not completely vacant. There are, in other words, pockets of residencies which remain from the earlier period. There are also pockets of industry that remain. So it is not possible to say, `We are going to a greenfield site; this is the development we are going to undertake'. We have to work closely with what exists, with the people who are there and with the resources which are there. </PARA>
<PARA>  The land in the inner western suburbs is available from a wide range of sources and is not greenfield land. We have redundant industries which have either moved out, been unable to face the rigours of competition or become obsolete owing to the technology or products that they have produced; we have old and inadequate housing stock which is no longer acceptable and is being demolished; we have the old Rowley Park speedway, where stock car racing took place for many years, within a couple of miles of the central business district, which is now not a financially viable proposition; and we have a brickworks which, quite apart from all the pollutant controls that are now in place, was again an uneconomic usage for such an area close to the city. </PARA>
<PARA>  The local councils have been trying to organise rezoning of these areas in order to maintain a reasonably clean, light industrial base, in order to maintain the community facilities which have already existed from an earlier era, and yet to rezone in such a way as to enable people to move into relatively cheap inner suburban dwellings. </PARA>
<PARA>  As soon as I heard about the building better cities program, I got onto the people who I thought might be interested in it, including the State housing Minister, Kym Mayes, who expressed a very keen interest in the redevelopment of the inner suburban western suburbs. I also got onto two chief planners of local councils--in particular, John Hunt, who is the chief planner for the Hindmarsh Council, and Andrew Young, who has a similar role to play in the Thebarton Council. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is interesting is that they already had plans on the board to move in the direction that the building better cities program has in mind--that is, the programs already exist in the minds of forward thinking local government planners and in the minds of State Ministers, and now it is a matter of the Federal Government getting in and providing some direction, some financial assistance and some program assistance to facilitate the redevelopment of these inner city areas as a serious option for people who do not want to move a long way from the central business district into outer suburban areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was very appropriate, I might add, that last week the Prime Minister, who was visiting Adelaide anyway, went to these suburban areas. Let me give an example of the things we looked at. We went to a school in West Croydon that is being amalgamated with another school in a local suburb because of the depopulation of the area. If the area is repopulated, the school system will already be in place. We then went to the Hindmarsh industrial training Skillshare project, which is an instance of an old factory that is being reconverted into a Skillshare project in order to provide industrial training skills in the middle of a light industrial area for the residents of that area. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, we went to the medium density housing project, which is actually being built on the old Rowley Park speedway site. The old Rowley Park site was about 30 feet below the level of the surrounding land, so it had to be filled in and settled, and they are just starting to put the housing up. It is a wonderful example of inner city urban development as an alternative to the suburban block. The blocks are much smaller, the roads are much narrower, the courtyards are smaller, they are two and three storeys, but they are very nice. The demand for them is considerable and they are a cheap, inner suburban option--and of course they are winning prizes for development. </PARA>
<PARA>  The necessary community infrastructure in this part of the world already exists and has existed, in some instances, for the last 50-100 years. There are public transport systems, there is rail and there are roads, and there are schools and augmented child-care. We went to a very good child-care centre run by the Greek Orthodox community. Aged care programs are being introduced there, and there are already parklands, as a result of the urban plan which was laid down 150-odd years ago. The region is adjacent to the central business district and thereby makes job hunting that much easier; it is adjacent to the MFP, which will provide high-tech job opportunities in the coming 20 or 30 years; and it maintains the traditional light industrial base which is there as a result of developments over the last 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are extensive pockets of vacant land in the area. I find it difficult to describe, but I have here a map from the Hindmarsh Council of the available land, some of which is old factory land and some of which is old housing land. There are about 58 hectares of it. Commonwealth planning initiatives are required. We have to get in and say, `This is how you will rezone it; this is how you could do it', and private and public developers will be only too happy to get involved in the process once it becomes known that it is an option for suburban development. For example, next Friday night I am meeting with the Greek Orthodox community, who are the owners of a very large slice of land in that part of the world, and I think with some Commonwealth encouragement they could develop it into the kind of urban consolidation that I am talking about.</PARA>
<PARA>  The South Australia Gas Co. also has some land which is now surplus to its requirements; ETSA has some land; and companies who used to have factories in the area have land. This is a great opportunity to undertake this kind of process. As I say, it is already under way. All the Commonwealth Government will be doing is providing additional financial and planning incentives in order to encourage it. The old Horwood Bagshaw site near the Hilton Bridge has already been redeveloped. The old brewery site on Railway Terrace has a number of dwellings on it. There is a large barracks at the top of Anzac Highway where there are no soldiers in any number--they are up in Woodside--and I am told this would be capable of taking about 300 dwellings of medium density housing for people who wish to retire close to the city. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commonwealth initiative, working through the States and local councils, and with the encouragement of local members of parliament, such as myself, could provide a rejuvenation of inner suburban areas--a rejuvenation of areas that have decayed over the last 20 or 30 years, and a rejuvenation of these areas as an option to the very expensive, for the public purse, and very inefficient development of outer suburban areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not want to pan outer suburban developments because, as I said, I settled in one myself in the late 1960s and early 1970s, although I now live in a more inner suburban area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This is the ninth Labor Budget, the third since we had the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) bringing home the bacon. It has been quite a rasher of bacon. As I look around Australia today I see the appalling state of the general economy with unemployment at very high levels. The real level of unemployment is substantially higher than that which is reported. There are many thousands of people who simply have not registered for unemployment benefits throughout Australia. It has not only hit young people where there are very high levels of unemployment, but it has also hit people in their forties and fifties who have been forced out of management positions. Their real chances of re-entering the work force are minimal, especially in the current climate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This bringing home the bacon exercise has been roundly bagged by everybody. The ACTU has said that it is not much of a Budget; the Business Council of Australia has said the same. The left wing, of which the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) is proudly a member, says it is not much of a Budget. It even had a little Caucus get together the other day and came up with the idea that the Medicare levy is no good. </PARA>

<PARA>  I wish to point out two things that happened overnight in this country. The Treasurer (Mr Kerin) said in the Budget a fortnight ago that he was taking a medium term view of interest rates. To back that up, the Reserve Bank annual report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Too rapid a reduction in interest rates, therefore, would risk suggesting to a sceptical public that here was another round of `stop/go' policies. In that event, price expectations would not go lower and the opportunity to achieve a lasting reduction in inflation would be lost. </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>For its part, monetary policy can best contribute to growth and equity by maintaining a clear commitment to medium-term price stability. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is clearly saying that interest rates should not be adjusted for political purposes. Yesterday we had the prime example of that, if ever I have seen one. If honourable members do not believe me, they should read the papers today. If they do not believe the papers--and there is a good case for not doing so--they should ask the money market and they will be told exactly the same. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst that debacle was going on, the Left and a few others, including Minister Hand, the talkative fellow at the table, were gathering with the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) to tell him that the Medicare levy was not on. So it was shunted off to a committee--this is real Whitlam-day politics--and there it dies. </PARA>
<PARA>  Who pays now for this better cities program we heard about from the previous speaker, the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley)?  Listening to the Budget, I understood that the moneys raised by charging for Medicare were to be a major contributor over five years towards the housing program. I presume that it will be funded in some other way. </PARA>
<PARA>  These two examples, which happened only yesterday--a fortnight after the Budget came down--show that the Government has lost its will to govern and has lost its commitment to Australia. It only has one commitment left--the personal survival of a government which can no longer run itself. </PARA>
<PARA>  I move around a bit and see what goes on.  I talk to people in the business world. They have no plans for employment in 1992. I fear for the school leavers who will be affected by that. Many tens of thousands of people will go onto the job market in the new year knowing that the business community has no real plans to engage new labour. It also has no investment plans at this point. The one per cent drop in interest rates will not have an impact until the middle of 1992 and expectations of business activity will not alter in that period. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the same time, productivity in Australia continues to wobble along. There is no great increase in productivity, and that is reflected in corporate results. With a few notable exceptions, corporate results in Australia--one sees it in every newspaper one picks up--are down by one-third, and some by much more. </PARA>
<PARA>  On top of that, there are record levels of bankruptcy. Every day mortgagee and possession sales are advertised in the papers. The value of assets in this country has dropped by roughly one-third in the last two years, depending on the circumstances. Along with this there is a general loss of confidence among Australian people and a growing petty crime rate to match it. Australia is in a deplorable state. </PARA>
<PARA>  While all this has been going on, Australian companies that are still generating profits are not looking to this nation for future development; they are indeed looking overseas in a very big way. Recently I was in South America. In one country I saw nearly $2 billion worth of Australian investment showing good returns. The development of a very substantial mining interest was to the benefit of that particular country and to the company concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>  That trend will continue because of the nature of the economy bred, particularly in the last two years, by current government policies. As a consequence, people facing the future have very little to cheer for and certainly nothing to thank this Government for in relation to its current policies. </PARA>
<PARA>  According to the 1986 census my electorate had some fairly high levels of income and household employment. For example, of all the electorates my electorate had the fifth highest level of households containing people with tertiary qualifications; for persons with professional qualifications it ranked tenth;  for the number of women in the work force, fifteenth; for the employment ratio, fifteenth; for median family income, fourteenth; and for families with annual income levels of over $40,000, it ranked fourteenth. </PARA>
<PARA>  Yet that relatively well-off electorate, in terms of qualifications, income and employment levels, suffered the following in my two agencies:  in Alderley, which I share with the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), unemployment has risen 76 per cent in the last year; and in Toowong, which is in the middle of Ryan, it has risen by 49 per cent. Those are largely in the categories of young people. Those are depressing statistics from an electorate much better placed than the vast majority of electorates. </PARA>
<PARA>  One does not really have a great amount of time in these debates, so I picked one other subject relating to the Budget which I thought was important, and that is superannuation. It has been a long held view of mine that superannuation is necessary for all. The concept of having a diversion from income tax gathering every year to provide pensions for all never seemed to me to be a very sound process; therefore, I am a supporter of national superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, the way we have gone about it in the current environment is bound to have an adverse effect on employment and future investment, because the proposed concessions for small business will mean that a lot of corporations with either a particular number of employees or a particular level of payment to employees will contract staff to remain within those limits. Those companies in the bigger areas are more likely to consider the payment of superannuation to be a burden, an add-on cost, rather than a benefit for the person concerned or the nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Already, add-on costs are probably 40 per cent of a straight wage. This measure will certainly impose a 50 per cent, maybe a 60 per cent, add-on cost factor on any wage payment. The Government should have considered the present economic climate before imposing such a measure. Indeed, Bryan Frith of the Australian said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the levy will add to unemployment levels and ensure that those who are already unemployed will remain so for longer than otherwise would have been the case. </PARA>
<PARA>I subscribe to that view. The timing of the introduction of this measure is very unfortunate and, once again, will be paid for by the Australian work force. It is nothing more than a new type of payroll tax which will add to the costs of employment at a time when very few can afford to pay it. To add to the Labor Party's worries, I quote that great supporter of the Labor Party, Max Walsh, when in one of his articles he says:</PARA>
<PARA>One does not need to be a genius at economic management to question the sanity of imposing a compulsory superannuation scheme on a bleeding corporate sector. . . Had Keating brought down this Budget, his reputation as a responsible Treasurer would have been destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA>I use that quote for the benefit of the thoughts of honourable members on where this scheme might fit in. The problems of having funds in Australia acquire this huge program of superannuation, which really is conscripted savings, requires the Government to give a lot of consideration to the regulation and management of these funds. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not a place where governments should be able to dabble and suggest that there ought to be a contribution to entrepreneurial activities as government wishes, because that is bound to be a flop. However, there is a need to ensure that the management of these funds, which will be enormous, is professional and accords with certain prudential requirements. If not, it certainly leaves open a great avenue for fraud.</PARA>
<PARA>  I should like the Government to address the problem at the moment where the only authority that has any rule over the raising of funds is the Australian Securities Commission. The only group which has any authority in the management of superannuation is the Insurance Commission. When one looks at the Act which establishes that body and its procedures one realises that it simply does not have the powers to ensure the adequate regulation necessary to supervise acquired funds.   Conscripted savings in this form need some clear definition of security, prudential management and the way they will be handled in the future. I hope that the amounts raised are invested without regard to ulterior uses. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is quite probable that certain funds may be managed by a trade union.  A trade union may seek to invest those funds with a disproportionate weighting in a particular industry or in particular companies within an industry to achieve a result which is not in the interests of the holder of the superannuation but is in the interests of the management of that particular union or particular trust. That is one aspect which I think needs to be addressed because the temptation to do that has been demonstrated in the past both in the corporate sense and in the trade union sense. The investor who has been compulsorily required to invest in that fund should be protected from such action. We have seen all sorts of instances in recent times in which innocent investors have been taken to the cleaners because the objectives of management are intended to suit its own purposes and not those of the investors. </PARA>
<PARA>  I conclude on the matter of the Trade Practices Commission, which for some years has been underfunded. In my view, the requirement imposed upon the Trade Practices Commission to ensure that competition is put into the market place has been left to run in a very haphazard manner. There has been no attempt by the Government to increase funding in this very important area. Unless the Commission is in a position to prosecute cases, there will never be an adequate testing of the trade practices law so that competition can be measured in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The tests that have been applied in the last 10 years or so of market dominance have never really been tested in the courts, because government has said to commissions, `If you take this court case on, it will cost you X millions'. These cases are very expensive. The fine at the end is minimal. The Commission will not retrieve its costs by taking action, yet the Government has had the gall to tell the Commission, `You take the case at your risk'. Therefore, a lot of commissioners have taken the view that it really is not worth the candle. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer not only to the Queensland Wire case but also the case involving Unilever, in which the sheer weight of money that the corporation put up tested the nerve of the Commission to such a degree that with the passage of time it did not prosecute or test the laws that were there to protect competition. </PARA>
<PARA>  This year there is no increase in the Budget allocation to the Trade Practices Commission. We have a new Chairman of the Commission, who is putting forward a different point of view for the Commission. Whether this will be endorsed by the Government, which would require some change to the Trade Practices Act, is yet to be seen. But change or not, it will not alter the fact that corporations will not be deterred from acting in a collusive sense while penalties are so small and the cost of litigation is so high that the government of the day will not back up the Commission in this particular important area. </PARA>
<PARA>  This matter is important to the Opposition because with a privatisation program there will need to be a strong Trade Practices Commission, but it is more important for the business community as a whole to know where it stands. It will not be deterred unless fines are substantially higher and it knows that the government of the day will enforce the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am pleased that the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) is committed to the expansion of superannuation. I can assure him that many of those constituents whom he is about to inherit from Brisbane and the inner city suburbs share that commitment. Many of them, in fact, do not now receive superannuation. They will be pleased to see his commitment to it transformed into some action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In fact, superannuation is one of the areas that I wish to touch on, but before I do so I would like to talk about some of the broader questions associated with the Budget. In my view, this Budget provides the foundations for what will be a sustained recovery in the next 18 months. It addresses the problems of unemployment and the recession by injecting some funds into the economy to boost employment and to provide assistance in training and a range of other programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Much has been made of the deficit which is contained in this Budget, and speakers on the other side of the House have criticised that deficit. I will come to that shortly. Before I do, I make the observation that I would have thought that those honourable members on the other side of the House accepted the conventional view of economics, which I think is still widely accepted, that in times of difficulty and in times of recession a government's responsibility is not to withdraw funds from the community but in fact to provide some assistance and an injection of funds. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget provides for a modest deficit. The $4.7 billion figure represents only 1.2 per cent of our gross domestic product. However, it indicates a significant turnaround on fiscal policy over the last two years. It represents a turnaround in Government expenditure of some $13 billion in that two-year period. That is a major injection of funds to provide programs, to provide assistance to families, to provide assistance to those who are unemployed through training and helping them gain employment, and to also help those who rely upon pensions and other government payments for their livelihood. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conjunction with those measures, over the last 12 months the Government has been able to reduce inflation, as the Budget Papers set out, from some 7.7 per cent to an annual figure now of 3.4 per cent. Australia is now in a situation where its inflation rate is less than the OECD average, less than its major trading partners, and in fact at the lowest level that it has been in this country for more than a generation. That is a major achievement, which has also facilitated the opportunity to reduce interest rates. The most recent reduction, and a welcomed one, announced yesterday, was a reduction of a full one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is worth exploring the Opposition's view on that point because it is very difficult to pin the Opposition down to a position on not only areas of policy but in fact on the details of economics. In spite of the rhetoric which we have heard from Opposition members, they have on at least three occasions in the last 18 months attacked the Government when interest rates have been reduced. They did it at the end of 1990; they did it at the commencement of 1991; and again they have done it in the last 24 hours. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has danced around the question every time he has been asked, including in the media, about his position on the interest rates cut. It would be refreshing to see any members of the Opposition rise in this debate, or indeed in any other debate, and state clearly their view on interest rate levels. Do they support the reduction that occurred yesterday?  The Leader of the Opposition has spent the last 24 hours whipping up the media, complaining about it as a political stunt. Does that mean it was wrong?  Does that mean that it should not have occurred?  Does that mean that the Opposition, if in government, would not have reduced interest rates, as it did in fact say in 1990 and earlier this year when interest rates were lowered?</PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition needs to come clean with the community and the public and honestly put before them not hollow rhetoric but a position which can be assessed. What is the Opposition's policy on the interest rate reduction? Opposition members should have the decency to acknowledge that it was a correct decision, that it was a decision that most commentators in the commercial world not only anticipated and expected but also in fact were advocating in recent weeks. It was a decision taken properly by the Reserve Bank and the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), and it is a welcome one. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last year when we were debating the Budget the Opposition set out its view that last year we should have reduced expenditure by $3 billion. I remind honourable members that in fact last year the Budget at that time had a planned surplus, so it was a very tight fiscal Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  Notwithstanding that fact, the Opposition claimed that we should have reduced the Budget by $3 billion. Having said last year we should take $3 billion off what was a tight Budget, the Opposition then failed to provide any details of where that $3 billion cut should be made. </PARA>
<PARA>  This year, the Opposition--I suspect having learnt the lesson of its folly 12 months ago--has not made a response to the Budget in detail. We saw the intriguing spectacle of the Leader of the Opposition, in reply to the Budget Speech, not addressing a single word to any alternative policy which he would advance. He has obviously decided that setting out too many policies gets him into hot water. It got the Opposition into hot water over health policy; it is still in hot water over the consumption tax and education vouchers. It would appear, from this side of the House, that the Opposition strategy has been to learn from those mistakes of the last 12 months where it cannot formulate policies and therefore to avoid any policy statements whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA>  As best we can analyse the Opposition's view of the Budget deficit, apart from criticising the fact that there is a deficit, the Opposition has said that we should have a balanced Budget. The Leader of the Opposition made that announcement yesterday in a press release. Again, let us put the question to the Opposition Leader. What areas of the Budget does he propose to eliminate? What increases in taxation does the Opposition intend to impose in order that the Budget may be balanced?</PARA>
<PARA>  Is the Opposition suggesting that the tax cuts which this Government has introduced and which are included in this Budget should not be given?  Is it suggesting that we should reduce the family allowance supplement, which has been enhanced and improved in this Budget?  Is it saying that we should reduce the payments on Austudy and the advantages of Austudy that have been included in this Budget?  There have been significant improvements in Austudy, a program which I regard as critical for the long term future of Australia's economic well-being--but it is not just for our economic well-being; it is for the good of all of our citizens to be able to participate fully in our education system. Is the Opposition saying that the long term unemployed should not get unemployment benefits?  We know that is the Opposition's policy, but let us get it on the table and hear where it will make these cuts. Is the Opposition saying that we should cut the job training programs that the Government has increased in this Budget, and so on?</PARA>
<PARA>  The list of these matters is quite extensive. The Opposition has failed at every opportunity to set out its alternative program and in any way detail the measures it would use to cut expenditure or to increase revenue. It makes the bland statement that we should have a balanced Budget and leaves it at that. That will not wash with the Australian community, not only because of its transparency, but because of the coalition's own record in government. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend to the House the table on page 5.15 of Budget Paper No.1, which sets out total outlays and revenue from 1953-54 through to the current time. In the last year in which the coalition was in office, in 1982-83, there was a Budget deficit of 2.6 per cent of GDP. Since 1953-54 the only occasions on which the Commonwealth has run a surplus Budget have been in 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989- 90 and 1990-91. The only occasions on which there have been surplus Budgets have been under this Government, the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the truth be known, since the Liberal Party was formed, since Sir Robert Menzies got the idea and created the Party, it has never once in government had a surplus Budget. Opposition members have stood in this Parliament in recent months and attacked the Government because we are going to have a deficit--when every single Budget a Liberal government brought down was a deficit Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  I mentioned that the last deficit of a Liberal government in this place was 2.6 per cent of GDP. The deficit proposed in this Budget is 1.2 per cent of GDP--less than half the deficit the coalition left in its last Budget and much less than many of the deficits it managed to accumulate during its period of office in this place. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to turn to the question of superannuation because I believe that the Budget initiatives, in providing a superannuation guarantee levy, are to be commended and represent the most significant initiative to provide a high quality of living for our retired Australians since the introduction of the aged pension. It is no secret to honourable members in this place that over the next 20 to 30 years the age distribution within our population will place enormous strains upon any government in providing the sorts of social security benefits for the aged to which we have become accustomed, certainly since the Second World War. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that in 1991 the percentage of our population aged 65 and over is about 11.3 per cent. In the year 2026 that will rise to 20 per cent. Any responsible government is in a position where it must act now if it is going to provide a secure future for our current citizens of working age when they reach retirement in the next century. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the short term, the Government's measures will affect only those employers who have avoided their obligations under Australian industrial law. In 1986 the industrial commissions of this land introduced award superannuation of 3 per cent. In spite of the fact that that was inserted into every industrial award in this country in the years soon after 1986, some 30 per cent of Australians are currently without any superannuation cover whatsoever. Enterprises with more than $500,000 in payroll payments will be required to provide only 5 per cent from July 1992. For those employers who have been complying with the law to date, that will mean an increase of only 2 per cent because they should already be paying 3 per cent. If the enterprise has a payroll of less than $500,000 per year, it is required to make only the 3 per cent payment anyway. </PARA>
<PARA>  Effectively, all we are doing is saying to those employers who have not honoured their obligations under Australian industrial law that they will now be required to do so. If they have been paying the 3 per cent award superannuation they are not affected. If they have not paid the 3 per cent superannuation we will require it of them, not only to ensure equity for all Australians but also to provide some equity for the employers. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have also been out talking to many employers who are struggling in these difficult times. The responsible legitimate employers complain to me, amongst other things, about the irresponsible and unscrupulous operators who are seeking to take advantage of those in less well off positions during this recession and who fail to provide award wages and conditions such as the 3 per cent superannuation. I have had a number of employers in my electorate say to me, `Why don't you do something to make those sharks in our industry pay the correct wages? Why don't you do something to make them pay the superannuation like we are, because we're being responsible employers and yet we are being undercut by these sharks in our own industry?'. The Government's decisions on superannuation provide that guarantee to the honest legitimate employers who have honoured their legal obligations under industrial law. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some 68 per cent of employees currently receive 3 per cent superannuation or more. The superannuation guarantee levey will not affect those 68 per cent of employees and their employers. There are 35 per cent of employees who receive 5 per cent or more. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to turn to the question of the 5 per cent contribution and the plan that these superannuation payments will increase to 9 per cent by the year 2000. Not only is the 3 per cent award superannuation included as a credit for that purpose but so too is other employer funded superannuation. If we take employees in the public sector and many other private sector enterprises, not only would they have been receiving the 3 per cent under award superannuation, but also many of them contribute to a company superannuation scheme to which the employer provides a subsidy. That employer subsidy also counts towards the guarantee levy which this Government is introducing. A large slice of the business community who are good employers and who have been doing the right thing from the outset will not be required to pay one cent more. </PARA>
<PARA>  The people whom members opposite are seeking to defend are the sharks in industry who are not only eroding decent working conditions but also cutting the throats of decent employers who are trying to do the right thing in building a strong Australia. The Government's decisions will protect legitimate employers from these backyard operators. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this debate on superannuation, the Opposition has attacked the Government and has sought to conduct a scare campaign, referring to unemployment increases and difficulties that employers will have in making the payment. As I have already indicated, that will not be the case and in fact most employers are already meeting the standard that the Government has set in this Budget. The interesting thing, though, is that I have not heard anyone from the Opposition tell me what it would do if it was in government. Honourable members opposite know as well as we do the demographic problems to which I have referred. Would they remove this guarantee if they were in office?</PARA>
<PARA>  They should tell the Australian people what their policy is in respect of superannuation. It is not good enough for members opposite to stand up here and say, `Well, yes, we support a national superannuation scheme--but not now'. They have never thought that it was a good time. In 1986, when award superannuation was introduced, they opposed it. They said it would ruin industry, and many of the employers around the country complained as well. In 1986 the economy was booming. There was probably more money in the economy than there should have been and certainly a lot of it was not spent very wisely. However, in those days, which in relative terms were good days, honourable members opposite said, `No, now is not a good time'. It was not the right time when there was plenty of money in the economy and now, when there is not as much money in the economy, it is still not the time. </PARA>
<PARA>  Members of the Opposition take the view that it is never the time to introduce universal superannuation. I refer specifically to universal superannuation, because we in this place all receive a superannuation benefit, and members on the Opposition benches think that that is pretty good. They have no complaint about superannuation schemes for politicians and they have no complaint about superannuation schemes for public servants, either. Their generosity in this field even extends to the business community. They support not only superannuation schemes in the private sector but also totally employer funded superannuation schemes where the employee pays nothing. Members opposite think that is a good scheme, but as soon as we say that we will give it to everyone, that we will include that 30 per cent for those who should have it but who have been denied it because of unscrupulous employers, they cry, `No, the economy cannot afford it'. Apparently, it is good for politicians, public servants and business executives but it is bad for the 30 per cent of Australians who are ordinary wage and salary earners. If members opposite go to the people with that proposition, which is in fact their true position, if they go to the people with their assessment of superannuation, they will see the Australian people's response to it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The hypocrisy of members opposite in relation to superannuation reflects their general deceit on budgetary matters. I sat here a couple of weeks ago listening to the debate on defence outlays and the review of the defence forces. I made some comments on how I would like to have seen some increases in defence expenditure. I acknowledged some of the difficulties that the Government has in providing that. Speaker after speaker on the opposite side of the House hopped up and spoke about grand plans for increased defence expenditure, but there was not a word about where the cuts would come from. The Opposition had a policy of a $3 billion cut last year, it has a policy of a balanced Budget this year and it has a policy which says `superannuation, but not now'. Honourable members opposite should get up in this debate, or in any other debate, and provide the details and come clean to the people of Australia. People will not accept the hollow rhetoric of members opposite and, in the end, they will not accept their policies, either. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This Budget has now been roundly condemned by economic analysts and recognised for what it is--an exercise in shoring up the position of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) rather than a serious attempt to address the real economic problems that we currently face. This Budget is a culmination of the mismanagement and misreading of the economy for the past eight years. In fact, I get the distinct impression that the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) have thrown their arms up in the air in despair, because they are unable and unwilling to face the economic reality that we are a country riddled with high debt and continuing high interest rates as compared with our overseas trading partners, and that we have massive levels of unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As the architects of this latest excuse for a Budget have thrown their arms up in despair, they have decided to throw millions of dollars towards a building better cities program and to force employers to wear the cost of increasing superannuation, at a time when they can least afford it, in a vain attempt to camouflage the lack of real economic substance in the Budget. The Government has made no attempt to stop the swelling ranks of the unemployed and to show compassion for the almost one million unemployed who have been thrown on the scrap heap as a result of its disastrous economic policies. For young people this Budget has been particularly irresponsible because their needs and plight have been totally ignored. </PARA>
<PARA>  At a time when rural communities are struggling under extreme hardship, this Government is treating them with contempt by making $56m available to the building better cities program in the first year and $800m over the next five years. I find it particularly distressing that this Government has done this while rural Australia is in the midst of the worst depression for generations. It is obvious from this that this city oriented Government is totally out of touch with the hardship that rural Australia is experiencing. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, unlike the Government, rural communities are actually doing what they can to help each other through the depression. Nine days after the Budget was announced, I attended a one-day workshop in Riddells Creek in my electorate. This workshop, called Recession Problems Day, was organised for people having difficulty coping with the recession. A variety of speakers gave those attending practical information about how to cope with the financial pressure and stress of being unemployed and hints on how to stretch the Budget dollar further. The overriding concern of those who attended was that they wanted to get a job. This is what this Budget fails to address. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's decision to legislate for compulsory superannuation is certain to increase the number of people unemployed. The Government's special deal with Bill Kelty and the ACTU to legislate for compulsory superannuation will cost 100,000 jobs and add to inflation. It is a tax on business and a tax on employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The coalition supports the idea of extending superannuation coverage, but not without due regard for capacity to pay or increased productivity. The Budget ignores both these criteria. It is totally unrealistic for the Government to expect employers to provide superannuation at this time. Small businesses are struggling to keep afloat and this superannuation deal could be the one to sink them. The Government just does not seem to realise, or maybe care, that small businesses simply cannot afford this added cost. The numbers of small businesses going to the wall will increase and, with these numbers increasing, so too will the level of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a glaring omission in this Budget that there is not one single mention of youth unemployment. This is what I specifically want to address. Australia's young people feel abandoned by this Government. This feeling is best summed up by the words of Michael Wilkinson, a year 12 student from Assumption College, Kilmore, in my electorate. He sat in the public gallery and listened to the Treasurer deliver the Government's Budget. His comments after witnessing that say it all. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>As a young Australian who will be looking for work next year I was particularly upset to note that there was not one mention of ways to combat the problem of youth unemployment in the Government's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>A letter I received just yesterday from another year 12 student in my electorate details further the despair and heartache young people are experiencing, especially those who live in rural areas. Jackie Cardwell from Seymour requested that I try to make the Government understand how she and her peer group feel. This is what Jackie had to say:</PARA>
<PARA>My name is Jackie Cardwell and I'm currently studying year twelve...I wish to carry on my studies in 1992 at tertiary level. I would like to study law, but unfortunately due to my family's financial situation I will be unable to attend university next year. If I wish to take up a course in the following year. . . it is absolutely necessary that I seek employment now. With the current unemployment levels as they are, it is unlikely that any business is going to accept me for a position as I have no experience and I am straight out of school. Although I will try my hardest. I ask you Mr Hawke, what am I supposed to do?  You seek to have an educated society, but how do we at 17 years of age, afford the costs of university?  Then the budget comes out and you've increased student costs by $140 a year. I come from the country and wish to complete a five year course--this means HECS will cost me over $10,500. You want to raise revenue, you want an educated society, but now only the rich can afford to be smart. . . I'll have to join the dole queue or stay on at Safeway--</PARA>
<PARA>where she apparently works after school--</PARA>
<PARA>I can't see a very stimulating future in either of these alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA>It is signed, `Student without a future, Jackie Cardwell'. I frequently receive letters like that from my constituents, crying out for help and relief from the pain this Government has caused them. Unfortunately, this Budget does not signal an end to the pain, only more of it. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is time to ignore the Government's rhetoric and look at the facts. The unemployment levels for youth say it all. The latest seasonally adjusted figure for youth unemployment is 28.5 per cent. This is almost three times the rate of adult unemployment. Over the last 12 months, 130,000 young people have lost their jobs and, as if that is not bad enough, things are predicted to get worse. The Budget has forecast an increase in total unemployment to 10.75 per cent, compared with the present rate of 9.8 per cent. This ultimately means that the youth unemployment figure will increase and almost certainly hit 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Young Australians are facing bleak employment prospects and are being denied the opportunity to develop their skills and talents. They are obliged to take what little is on offer, whether or not it suits their ambitions or skills. There is no choice of opportunity, no variety of apprenticeships or traineeships. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the rural areas of my electorate, where the youth unemployment rate is much higher, the situation is even more desperate. Many of the jobs that used to be available to teenagers, such as apprenticeships, farm work, et cetera, are no longer available. Many teenagers are being forced to leave their home towns, to look for work in larger centres, but because they often lack training and qualifications they face the prospect of being unemployed and homeless. They have little choice. They either stay at a home without work and place even more demands on their families and on the town's meagre welfare services, or they move to the cities and swell the ranks of the urban unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget is the culmination of eight years of mismanagement by this Government, and nowhere is this more evident than when examining the problem of youth unemployment and the failure of the Government's policies to solve it over the past eight years. In the International Year of Youth in 1985 the Government declared youth priority one. However, they were not considered priority one for very long, and the fact that there was no mention at all of youth unemployment in this Budget makes me think that they are no longer even considered a priority by this Government. The 1988 inquiry into homeless youth, which condemned the Government for failing to help Australia's young homeless, was proof that the Government's measures to help Australia's youth were a dismal failure. </PARA>
<PARA>  In response to that inquiry the Government committed $100m over four years in the 1989-90 Budget. The now Deputy Prime Minister admitted recently in an article in the Melbourne Age that this decision was a failure. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Federal Government policies to combat youth homelessness were a fuzzy response to political pressures in the `hope' that things might get better. </PARA>
<PARA>He further went on to say that there was no way of knowing whether the money had done anything to help because, as he says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we weren't all too clear what the problems were at the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA>What an admission! He further added:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . when a problem arose, governments usually added another program and spent some money without focusing on the causes of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that government must change its approach and tackle causes rather than use cash as a bandaid for problems. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has obviously ignored his advice as this Budget is full of bandaid solutions and has failed to go to the core of the problem. This Budget was the opportunity for the Government to address the problems in our society and address the high unemployment levels, but instead it has chosen to ignore them. The announcements in the Budget are piecemeal and will do nothing to equip young people with the relevant training for work or help them to find a job. In fact, in many cases all it will equip them for is learning how to live on welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has made changes to youth homeless allowance, rent assistance and Job Search allowance in the vain hope that it will assist Australia's homeless. The young homeless allowance will be available on a weekly basis and rent assistance will be extended to single people under 18 years. These measures do absolutely nothing towards getting those young people into secure full time employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  While welfare may be needed to help people over their difficult times, it should not be a substitute for rational and well developed economic policy. It appears to me that, instead of trying to tackle the problem of youth unemployment head on, the Government has decided to help our youth onto welfare. This is not the way to go about solving the problem of youth unemployment or our economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the 1987-88 Budget the Government decided to place its emphasis on training programs. The Government has embarked upon a similar course of action again this year. It announced that it is going to increase spending on training and labour market programs by $260m this year, a 50 per cent increase over last year. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker: training for what? This is just more bandaid therapy. This Government should give No. 1 priority to and should be focusing its attention upon the real problems at hand--the state of the economy, our massive foreign debt and falling living standards--because it is only when our economic problems are overcome that Australians will be able to find secure and stable employment. No amount of training programs can compensate for that lack of action by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  These schemes which the Government has implemented, changed and modified over the past eight years have all failed, because today young people are finding it impossible to get a job, and that is what it comes down to. This Budget is a final indication of this Government's lack of commitment to young people. It has given up trying to help them because it just does not know what to do. It is in fact the last episode of a sad and sorry saga of failed policies. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is one thing for this Budget to ignore the massive problem of youth unemployment and not to reform Australia's economic structure to allow young people the chance of gaining employment, but it is another thing to ignore completely the human tragedy of youth unemployment and its consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>  The unemployed suffer from a variety of physical and mental problems. Work has both manifest and latent functions. The manifest function is income. The latent functions are time structure, enlarged social experience, engagement in collective purposes, identity and activity. These functions need to be satisfied for positive mental health to be attained. Young people who are unemployed are more likely to have poor mental health because, unlike their employed counterparts, they have no imposed time structure, no involvement in collective purposes, no socially ascribed identity and low levels of activity.</PARA>
<PARA>  Studies have shown that psychological maturity is the result of a successful transition through a series of development stages. One of the most important stages is work. There are solutions to these problems.  Australia needs to undergo a massive reform program if it is to become an economically prosperous and healthy nation. High on the agenda must be taxation, industrial relations, and transport and waterfront reform. These reforms will change the direction in which we have been heading for the past eight years. They will turn this country around on the road to economic recovery and towards lower levels of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government has abrogated its responsibility towards our young people. It has failed in this Budget to come to grips with the fundamental economic problems that Australia faces--the problems that offer no hope to our young. No amount of money being poured into training programs will help the unemployed if there are no jobs for them to go to when they have finished the program. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government needs to encourage investment and adopt and pursue economic policies which will pull Australia up off its knees. But this Government does not have the fortitude to implement the reform which we need to be able to do this. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1985 the Government tried to implement taxation reform, but could not get it past the ACTU. It has been far too slow with privatisation and waterfront reform. It claims that it is implementing reform in the areas of industrial relations and transport, but we all know that that is simply empty rhetoric. The Government has failed and is now not even trying. This Budget is testimony to that fact and to the fact that the Government has lost direction, lost responsibility and lost the will to lead. </PARA>
<PARA>  Only when Australia is allowed to become a competitive and productive nation will unemployment be lowered. It is in that sort of environment that our young Australians will be able to look to the future with confidence and have the opportunity to find a job which is suited to their talent and ambitions. It is also an environment in which small businesses will have the opportunity to flourish and students the opportunity to continue their education. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget offers no hope, no new ideas and no fresh policy approaches--it is uninspired and uninspiring. It has been labelled `Kerin's do nothing Budget' and `Kerin's hang on and hope Budget'. Those labels are indicative of the reception this Budget has received in the community far and wide. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget will do absolutely nothing to improve our living standards, our high levels of unemployment and our high levels of foreign debt. It has been called `the nothing Budget' because that is exactly what it is. This Budget has failed and this Government has failed Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It was very interesting to listen to the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey). There was very little constructive input in that speech. In 1983, when the Australian Labor Party came into government, those opposite had the onerous distinction of having the trifecta: double digit unemployment, double digit inflation and double digit interest rates--yet the honourable member comes in here castigating the Government. I notice that she is now leaving the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The honourable member is also one of the great promoters of the goods and services tax. I am surprised that she, as a person representing a country area, does not realise the extra costs--freight costs, goods and services costs, and charges--that would be imposed on country and regional people if those opposite had the opportunity to introduce that sort of policy. Fortunately, the Australian people will not have a bar of that. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is also very important to say that every Anglo-Saxon country is in recession. Many conservative governments--such as those of America and England--have the same difficulties and problems. There is no doubt about that whatsoever. This is why Margaret Thatcher is out and why John Major is on the nose in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA>  But there is no doubt that unemployment is a real cancer in our society. The Government's strategy, in these hard economic times, is to get the economy right. We ought to pay tribute to the Government: inflation is at its lowest level for 30-odd years and interest rates are coming down. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased that interest rates have come down one percentage point. I certainly hope that the banks do the right thing. They have a responsibility in our society to bring down their interest rates also. Of course, once the economy picks up, morale picks up within the community and confidence comes back. Then, of course, people will start reinvesting and opportunities will arrive for young people to get employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Earlier my colleague the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) spoke about superannuation. Many people overlook the fact that previously we had to borrow money from overseas if we were going to build some massive industry in Australia. This superannuation scheme--I must say that I am a wholehearted supporter of superannuation and I most certainly would like to see a national superannuation scheme--creates a pool of wealth within our country so that we do not have to borrow money overseas. We have this huge pool of resource that we can call on and it is funded on a local basis. Who could argue with that concept?  This is what it is really all about. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia should be responsible for and have authority over its financing. It should not have to borrow money from overseas to fund necessary projects. It is a great thing to have a pool of resource money funded from a national superannuation scheme. We are heading in the right direction.   Because of our unemployment problem, we have a responsibility to seek views from all sections of the community. I pay tribute to an Anglican priest within my electorate, Father Gordon Hewitson, who is very concerned about unemployment. He has a tremendous track record in social work. He looks after underprivileged people--people in desperate straits and those less fortunate in the community. In Whyalla, he has come up with the LETS scheme, the local employment trading system, which is a bartering system. His philosophy is that everybody should have a reasonable standard of living and that everyone must have creative work to do for and in the community of which he or she is a part. I wholeheartedly agree with this. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commonwealth Employment Service and departments such as the Department of Social Security, the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Labour and Industry should look at the sort of scheme that he is trying to initiate to see whether we can get young people to do something positive and constructive within their community so that they feel they are making some worthwhile contribution to society. It is very important that departments and Ministers try to liaise with these people to see whether we can come up with something positive to overcome this horrific problem of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am also delighted that the Government has seen fit to get a committee together to have a look at Medicare. In my area alone there are very few doctors, if any, that bulkbill. In one particular community there is a cartel of doctors who get together and charge $9.50 above the schedule fee. If one takes this $9.50 and then adds the $3.50 less that people get back from their Medicare, one sees that people are paying $13.00 for a visit to the doctor. This imposes a tremendous burden on families. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is pleasing to note that a Caucus committee has been set up to have a look at the Medicare legislation. There is no doubt at all that the fees for medical services have blown right out of proportion and that there are obviously too many doctors. It is a terrible indictment of many doctors that they see the way to make a quick quid as going into country areas, making their fortunes and returning to the cities. That does not apply to all doctors, but many of them have this type of philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn now to the tremendous response by Senator Graham Richardson to my representation for assistance for people in regional and rural areas. Far too often it is too easy to kick Ministers, particularly during harsh economic times. However, I must say that Senator Graham Richardson is possibly at the forefront of Ministers who are prepared to listen to backbenchers, take on board any constructive suggestion, argue it in Cabinet and come up with a solution. I acknowledge the tremendous work and support that he has given me in a number of areas, particularly the area of family allowance supplement to farming families and funding for assistance to rural and regional businesses. </PARA>
<PARA>  For the first time the Government is addressing the problem faced by the farming community in gaining access to support benefits. As I have said many times in this place, many farming families are income poor but asset rich. Extending the eligibility for FAS means that many farmers who were previously excluded from getting benefits will now qualify. I acknowledge the support of Senator Graham Richardson in having that brought about. </PARA>
<PARA>  Other measures included the allocation of $450,000 to the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics towards the cost of conducting a survey of rural areas to identify specific regions affected by the rural downturn. Student assistance through Austudy and the assistance for isolated children's scheme will be improved and simplified, including the introduction of a hardship provision so that the present assets test--effectively $695,000 for farm and business assets--will no longer apply if a student's parents or spouse are receiving a social security or veteran's pension or benefit or household support under part C of the rural adjustment scheme. Funding for existing or already announced new programs includes the rural access program, the rural counselling program and countrylink information services. </PARA>
<PARA>  Turning to economic development--there will be $2m from 1992-93 for the rural industries business extension service; a program to assist with the development of successful agriculture and related businesses, especially in export markets and greater value adding; $1.8m for business advisers for rural areas; and a program to provide business advice to assist rural people to develop new and more diversified enterprises. It is incredible how many people who live in rural areas unfortunately have not had accounting or cash flow experience in running books and have in many cases left that to the banks and accountants and have fallen short. So this is a real boost to rural people. </PARA>
<PARA>  Provision is made for an increase of $500,000 a year for the local government development program and the broadening of the eligibility criteria to assist selected key regions to diversify their economies. Continued funding will be provided for existing programs such as the innovative agricultural marketing program and marketing skills program. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased that funding for RAS will be increased by $100m to $160m. This will give the Commonwealth the capacity to support up to $1.4 billion of rural debt during 1991-92. Also of major importance is the national soil conservation program, which will receive $24.9m for 1991-92. This compares with $21.5m in 1990-91. Within that program additional funding will be available for landcare groups to facilitate farm and district planning and to develop better approaches to risk management for factors such as drought. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of paramount importance to South Australia is the funding for the Murray-Darling Basin initiative, which will be increased from $9.93m to $11.29m. This includes $7m for a program of works under the national resource management strategy, including revegetation schemes, farm planning projects, community education programs and community participation projects to combat water logging and salinity. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is extremely important to South Australia, as we depend very much on the River Murray. South Australia being the driest State in the driest continent, it depends very much on the River Murray. So these positive financial supports are imperative. The Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation is to receive $10.8m for the second year of operation.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the short time remaining, I will outline some of the positive steps announced in the Budget designed to alleviate the problems being faced by some who are disadvantaged in our community, such as those young people who are State wards in foster care. As from 1 January 1992, young people who are State wards in foster care and who are not in receipt of any other allowance by the relevant State authority will be eligible for the independent rate of Jobsearch allowance, sickness allowance and special benefits, where applicable, at a cost to the taxpayer of $520,000 in the 1991-92 financial year and $920,000 in a full year. These changes will assist approximately 1,400 young people throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another positive aspect of the Budget is the changes to eligibility for the special benefit, which has been extended to include unemployed school leavers aged 16 to 20 years from low income families during the 13-week education deferment period. This is a step which will assist 500 additional special benefit recipients, at a cost of $570,000 in a full year. This move will be applauded by my constituents in Grey, who have found this 13- week period of deferment of benefits very difficult financially. I have no doubt that most of those 500 will be in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>  As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I look after 86.2 per cent of the land mass of South Australia, and under the redistribution proposals which have just been announced, I will soon have all but 8 per cent of South Australia to look after. It makes me wonder what the rest of the pollies from South Australia on both sides of the House are going to be doing. </PARA>
<PARA>  To continue--in addition to this access to Jobsearch allowance, sickness allowance conditions for certain special beneficiaries under 16 years of age have been extended, allowing these young people access to labour market assistance including training. This measure will apply from 1 January 1992 and will improve the employment prospects of disadvantaged early school leavers and help reduce unemployment.  It is expected to increase the number of Jobstart allowance recipients and reduce the number of special benefit recipients by around 3,700 in a full year, at a cost of $80,000 rising to $160,000. </PARA>
<PARA>  The plight of the young homeless has also been addressed in this Budget by establishing pilot projects which will make it easier for homeless young people to get both social security payments and complementary services from other agencies. One of the aims of this initiative is to cut through the bureaucracy that homeless youth have to deal with. The estimated cost to the Commonwealth of this initiative is $1m each year. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another measure to help our young homeless is that the young homeless allowance will be available on a weekly basis from January 1992. Some may say this is not enough, and I would agree that more needs to be done. However, I believe this initiative is a step in the right direction. The plight of our young homeless is a matter which each and every one of us must concern ourselves with. Our young people are our future, and as a parent I find it heartbreaking to see the life that many of these young people are forced to live. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a reduction in the waiting period for rent assistance, from 26 weeks to 18 weeks, and reductions in the waiting periods for the Jobsearch allowance, the Newstart allowance and the sickness allowance. The special benefit provisions for recipients without children will be welcomed by approximately 153,600 beneficiaries aged between 18 and 60 years who for too long have been sideswiped because they had no children. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those pensioners and retirees who require financial advice also benefit from the Budget decision to increase the staff of the Financial Information Service by 75 officers Australia- wide over the next three years. This service will be expanded to provide advice to other Department of Social Security clients, including Jobsearch and Newstart allowance recipients and sole parent pensioners. Financial Information Service officers will give greater assistance to people from non-English speaking backgrounds. There will be a more active outreach to disadvantaged groups, increased training for staff, and more intensive promotion to advise pensioners of the pension loans scheme and home equity conversion. </PARA>
<PARA>  The changes to the existing voucher scheme for telephone rental is also welcome. I receive numerous complaints from pensioners that they forget to take the voucher with them at the time of paying their account and subsequently cannot use it to reduce their next account. The implementation of this cash-in- hand payment or telephone allowance from July 1991, still to be made payable four times a year and currently worth $51.80 per year, will enable pensioners to exercise their full entitlement without fear of using the wrong voucher on their accounts, as happens at present resulting in the loss of the concession. </PARA>
<PARA>  Child disability allowance is another area which has received attention, with 43,000 current recipients benefiting by $2.15 per week from 2 January 1992. There will be 2,000-plus recipients of the disability support pension aged 16 to 20 years, and approximately 3,000 new grants in this category will be made in subsequent years at an estimated cost of $2.73m in 1991-92 and $5.7m in 1992-93, restoring the real value of the child disability allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another matter of concern for my constituents, and one which I have first-hand knowledge of through the loss of an aged relative, is the arrangement for the bereaved pensioner or beneficiary. A death in the family leads to a trying and traumatic time, and it is not a time when those left behind are thinking of worldly matters such as finance. It is not a time when one wants to have the added burden of the red tape of bureaucracy, and anything that can be done to ease the burden at such a time should be done. I am glad to say that this Government has taken the necessary steps to ease the burden in relation to social security beneficiaries. The Government had already made improvements in January 1990 to assist pensioners and beneficiaries with dependent children for a period of 14 weeks following the death of a spouse or child. </PARA>
<PARA>  The new provisions announced in the Budget build on those 1990 changes, extending these payments to more clients and correcting a number of anomalies. Where a person makes a claim for a pension or a benefit but dies before payment, a spouse or parent will be able to receive the bereavement payments. I could go on with a number of significant things which are in the Budget to help those less fortunate in our community. However, time has run out for me. I commend again Senator Richardson and some of the people who have taken the initiative to help those who really are in need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This Budget is without vision and without hope. It has failed to create any enthusiasm or confidence within our nation. Indeed, it was stillborn. The new Treasurer (Mr Kerin) in his very first test has been demonstrated to be inept. I guess that comes as no surprise to those of us who have followed primary industry over the years and have watched the way in which he presided over that portfolio. We saw the greatest exodus of farmers in the history of our nation and the greatest decline in rural prosperity. That man is now entrusted with the Treasury portfolio and he has delivered to the people of Australia a recipe for continuing despair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Of course, the shadow of the pallbearer, the ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), hangs darkly over this 1991-92 Budget. When introducing the 1990- 91 Budget the former Treasurer, with his typical extravagance, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Economic policy has worked and is working. The faith the Australian people exhibited in the Government is now being repaid as the economy adjusts to a sustainable rate of growth. . . .In short, the kind of outcome the Government was seeking, delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the kinds of boasts that the former Treasurer introduced in the last Budget. By contrast, the current Treasurer has been much more modest, much more restrained. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It was a disappointing year for Australians; a year of lost jobs, squeezed profits and dashed hopes. . . .We were living beyond our means. We could not continue to do that without facing dire consequences. . . .The objective of stepping down to lower growth but stopping short of recession was not achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>Much more modest comments indeed!  The extravagant boasts were gone. The current Treasurer began his Budget with an apology, a confession that Labor had got it all wrong. Gone were the phrases such as `bringing home the bacon'. Indeed, the Government did get it all wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Treasurer had good reason to be modest in his opening remarks. The Budget had much to be modest about. The past year was a disastrous one for all Australians. It was an appalling indictment of Keating's final year of economic management. An $8 billion surplus became a real deficit. There was massive unemployment, way above the levels that Labor said it could ever tolerate in government. There were record bankruptcies and zero growth. There were 12,991 bankruptcies in the year 1990-91, way up on the previous record of last year, which was 8,552. </PARA>
<PARA>  The national debt reached a new high of $170 billion gross, with falling living standards right across the board. What an embarrassing end to the world's greatest Treasurer, to have left our great country in such a state. I guess it is commendable that the current Treasurer has at least acknowledged the past failure, that Labor has got it all wrong. Sadly, the difference was only in style and not in substance. This Budget does not address the problems.</PARA>
<PARA>  As a financial document it has failed. Even the proud boast of the former Treasurer of balanced Budgets has been abandoned. A $4.7 billion deficit is the bottom line of this year's Budget. The Government again will borrow to pay unemployment benefits, social welfare</PARA>
<PARA>and foreign aid. This will continue to place upward pressure on interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a document that should have offered hope for a better future, this Budget has also failed. There is no hope for the 830,000 unemployed, or the 1.3 million or more who are underemployed. There is no hope for a more efficient economy. The reform agenda has been abandoned entirely. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a planning document for the future, this Budget has been a failure. Its central features are in tatters. The Medicare reform package was rejected by Caucus. The superannuation package is probably unconstitutional and the better cities program is completely uncosted and unplanned. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a stagnant Budget with a central theme of hopelessness--not that the Budget had nothing to do with jobs. It was particularly concerned with one job--the job of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It was prepared against the background of the leadership crisis in the ALP. The Budget provided rewards to the Left for its loyalty in the last leadership crisis, bringing back memories of the dying days of the Whitlam regime. </PARA>
<PARA>  The present Treasurer has now come to use the `d' word. We could not get the previous Treasurer even to acknowledge the `r' word. The present Treasurer has gone so far as to accidentally spill the `d' word, depression, which of course will lead to despair, defeat and degradation--plenty more `d' words. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, this Budget contains no measures to boost productivity, to cut industry costs, to relieve the tax burden, to create job opportunities or to develop optimism. The Left has extracted only more welfare measures--cotton wool and bandaids for those injured. It contains provision for more public servants and more social services. The ALP Left has never learnt that, when one man gets something without earning it, someone else has to earn something without getting it. </PARA>
<PARA>  This kind of philosophy has given birth to the better cities program. It provides for $800m over five years, with $56m allocated for this year. There is plenty that needs fixing in Australian cities. Thousands of people are moving to the country to escape the social degradation and despair that is so much a part of life in our urban areas these days. However, that social despair has been caused by the Government's economic and social policies. The better cities program will do nothing to restore the well-being and the quality of life in urban areas. The Budget contains little or no detail. Yesterday, the Prime Minister admitted during Question Time that there were no projects in mind, and it seems that many in the ALP Caucus were prepared to trade the whole program in on some improvements for Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA>  There can be little or no doubt that the better cities program is a pre-election slush fund for Labor marginal electorates. Better footpaths for the unemployed to queue on;  better parks for the unemployed to sleep in; and better drains for the unemployed to lie in. This will not solve the problem and will do nothing to address the social ghettoes and the welfare mentality that this Government's economic policy has created. </PARA>
<PARA>  The great crime of the ALP Government has been the way it has destroyed the will and the need to work in this country. When we return to government, how are we going to restore the ethic of working, the ethic of being constructive and productive in our society?  People have come to rely on this welfare mentality that has destroyed incentive and productivity in our nation. A better cities program, a better park bench, will do nothing to resolve those fundamental structural difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many people are moving to provincial areas and rural residential estates to opt out of city life. They want to get away from the pollution, the crime and the social despair. How much better it would have been if this $800m had been allocated towards a worthwhile and carefully thought out decentralisation program, because people leaving the city areas are leaving for areas where there are no jobs, no services and no facilities. They move to new hopelessness and despair. They enjoy a better lifestyle, and these new provincial areas provide wonderful opportunities for business and for people to enjoy a better lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA>  We ought to encourage industry to locate in rural and provincial areas. There will be major savings not only for industry but for our nation. Industry will enjoy the benefits of a skilled and cooperative work force and of a supportive community where the local authorities will not put obstruction in their way. There will be no protest groups, but there will be encouragement and support, away from the union bosses who would do nothing but try to destroy a productive industry. For our nation, there will be a better utilised infrastructure and cheaper land; social and welfare measures would not be needed in the urban areas; there will be less pollution and a much more wholesome lifestyle for all. </PARA>
<PARA>  Cities are costly places. Land for schools, hospitals and roads is expensive. Urban public transport annually chalks up huge losses--something like $2 billion for the city rail system alone--and most of it is in Sydney and Melbourne. There is much that we can do to improve the urban lifestyle, but this money would be far better spent and far better used if it were devoted to well thought out regional development programs to ensure a better lifestyle for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  While the Budget has this grand plan to squander $800m on froth and bubble and tinsel and lights in the cities, it does very little to confront the crisis in rural Australia. The Budget clearly acknowledges the severe hurt in the rural sector. The Treasurer has just moved from the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio, so he should have known the position. After all, he helped to create much of the trouble that currently exists. However, he soon forgot his old ministry. There is very little, and certainly nothing of substance, to help revitalise the rural sector; indeed, much of what is contained in the Budget under the banner of primary industry will provide little or nothing for farmers. </PARA>
<PARA>  For instance, the primary industry budget provides $26.4m for new flood warning systems in Sydney, Brisbane, Newcastle and Wollongong. There are not too many wheat paddocks in Wollongong, yet there is a new flood system under the primary industry budget for those cities.</PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, there is the ever increasing primary industry bureaucracy. On 21 February this year, I asked a question on notice about the staff levels of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. The Minister confirmed that the Department currently has 4,600 staff. One thousand five hundred of the 4,600 staff are in the middle management level and 1,200 of these 1,500 staff are located in Canberra. In addition, there are some staff in senior management. One does not need to go beyond grade two mathematics to figure out that that is approximately one person in middle and senior management for every two workers in the Department. In addition, something like three-quarters of all those staff are located in Canberra. There are not too many farmers in Canberra and yet we have this enormous primary industry bureaucracy located in the national capital. </PARA>
<PARA>  It seems to me that this burgeoning national bureaucracy associated with primary industry, not only at the Federal level but also at the State level, is biting deeply into what little rural income there is in this day and age. I suspect that the take home pay of all of the farmers in Australia this year will be less than will be spent on the primary industry bureaucracy. Clearly, we need to look at our priorities in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA>  In amongst the fine print, the Budget announced that this year the Industry Commission's work program will include a review of primary industry policy and regional policy. My immediate reaction to that was: surely there are no primary industry policies left that have not been reviewed?</PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry Commission has successfully destroyed most of the farm industries in this country. It is currently reviewing the dairy and sugar industries, and there are not too many left. Yet we are to have another review of primary industry policy. The farm organisations despair at the amount of time they have to spend responding to these bureaucratic inquiries, when seemingly the commissioners take no notice of the real facts, yet there is to be another inquiry into primary industry policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-No doubt many more jobs for many more bureaucrats. In addition, there is to be a new review into regional policy. I admit that I did not think the Government had any regional policy; if it did, it was probably left over from the Whitlam days, the dreadful regional concept that the Left promoted at that time. I suppose the rise of the Left within the Labor Party has led to a rebirth of regionalism also within the Labor organisation. Is this inquiry to try to resurrect that old skeleton?  Certainly thousands of people around Australia deeply hope that is not the case. Or is it again to review what small level of service is left in the rural sector around this country?  Is it another guise to try to axe services to country people?  Will Federal Labor follow in the same footsteps as the Goss Labor Government in Queensland?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Goss Labor Government has employed half of all of the new public servants appointed in Australia over the past 12 months. Half of those employed by Federal, State and local governments around the country have been engaged by the Goss Government. It has gathered together a collection of failed bureaucrats from the southern State regimes to ensure that Queensland is unable to prosper into the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-They have employed them from all over the place, but they are all failures. They have gone to Queensland to burden the bureaucracy of that State. In spite of that, the Goss Government has axed jobs ruthlessly in provincial Queensland. Twenty- six court houses have been closed and hundreds of rail sidings and stations. There has been a loss of 174 staff in just one section of the Department of Primary Industries. The Queensland Minister for Transport tells us that in tomorrow's Budget he will axe 900 road construction jobs--all in areas of critical importance to the rural sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Is the Industry Commission now to be used by the Federal Government to follow in the same footsteps and to axe regional services? If the Industry Commission has got nothing to do, why does it not look at Medicare? The Labor Government does not know what to do with it. The Caucus is going to have another try at it. Let us give the Industry Commission a go at fixing up Medicare. What about looking at the Government's industrial relations policy, or its policy on the arts and the environment, or its policy on the social welfare industry? What about looking at the Government itself and its gross levels of incompetence?</PARA>
<PARA>  If the Government could apply the same principles to those areas which I have just mentioned as it has applied to primary industries over the years, our country would be a much more productive place. The Government's only new rural measures have been in some small areas of welfare. There has been nothing to address the causes of the degradation of rural areas. There is no tax relief, substantial structural reform or industry support. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under the measures that have been announced many families will be worse off. The Government is making a third attempt to reintroduce an assets test on the family allowance. It tried at $300,000, and it compromised at $500,000. Fortunately, the coalition parties rejected that assets test. Now the Government is trying again at $600,000, and thousands of Australian families will be denied the family allowance. Thousands of families will be worse off and most of those will be in small business and on the family farm.</PARA>
<PARA>  There have, of course, been a few concessions. There will be some hardship provisions, but amongst the conditions attached to those hardship provisions is one that will mean that anyone with more than $10,000 in working capital will not be eligible. I know that we have a new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and that he does not have much of a record in agriculture, but I would like to ask him when he last planted a paddock of wheat or bought a load of feed for a piggery or filled the farm fuel tanks. One cannot do any of those tasks for less than $10,000. Any farmer who is still in business will need to have a minimum of $10,000 working capital--and a whole lot more. For that reason alone, such farmers will not qualify for the new hardship provisions under the family allowance supplement or for Austudy as well. They will have to be on welfare or on rural adjustment part C. As I have already mentioned, farmers are not eligible for most of these welfare programs, so little of these concessions will have any real value for ordinary Australians caught up in the rural crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>  I appeal to the Minister. He is new in his position, and I could understand if he did not appreciate the full economics of running a rural property. I urge him to reconsider his decision if he has any compassion or any sincerity and if he meant his promises to the rural sector that he would do something about ensuring that those on farms have equal access to welfare and other benefits. I appeal to him to reconsider that decision and to make those hardship provisions meaningful and worth while. </PARA>
<PARA>  Just two weeks after its presentation, this Budget is in tatters. All of its central planks have fallen apart. Like the Government that introduced it, it has failed. Even Caucus wants to try again, but Labor has lost the capacity to get it right. I can only hope that our country can survive this maladministration until there is another election. The Treasurer has sadly failed his first test and Australians everywhere will suffer continually as a result of this dismal Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In rising to speak in support of the Appropriation Bills, I would like at the outset to take up a couple of the points made by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). It seems that he is suggesting, on behalf of the National Party, an approach to government similar to that of the Queensland branch of the National Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The honourable member criticised the better cities project, towards which this Budget has allocated $56m, not the figure he spoke about. Maybe we should adopt the Queensland branch's approach of looking at what it achieved on the Gold Coast. Maybe that would be the sort of alternative strategy that would be suggested. Another alternative would be to wheel out the pork barrel in the way that was suggested in terms of the rural issues that the honourable member talked about. I recall having the same discussion with him in a previous debate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Above all else, what is highlighted not only by the honourable member for Wide Bay but by so many of those who have gone before him is that, on the one hand, there is this constant attack on the Government because there is too much public expenditure, too much provision of services in the Budget and, on the other hand, according to the National Party and the Opposition generally, that should be cut back. At the same time, the Opposition has got all these new programs that it suggests the Government should be funding. It says that the Government should be providing money for services in rural or other areas.</PARA>
<PARA>  One of the difficulties we have is that at the same time as that is occurring, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), are saying that this Budget should have been balanced. I do not know how they would achieve the variety of objectives that the Opposition is talking about. There seems to be this constant sort of resorting to humbug and hypocrisy. The equation just does not balance. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition, through all its speakers, decided not to come up with any detail about policy, direction or alternatives. It does not talk about that. Opposition members do not talk about any of those things; rather, they come here and cry crocodile tears about the sorts of difficulties that many Australians are facing. Many Australians are facing difficulties in both urban Australia and rural Australia. To suggest that the problems can be isolated to one area, as the honourable member for Wide Bay sought to do, was wrong. To suggest that the Government is not addressing the problems, as the honourable member for Wide Bay sought to do, was wrong. Also, to suggest that the Budget strategy that underpins the process that we are following through is not going to the heart of those issues is totally fallacious. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget process this year shows a recognition that the country is facing very serious economic difficulties. It is a recognition that there has to be a sustained passage out of that recessionary period and it is a recognition that what we need for Australia is long term low inflation and, at the same time, a sustainable, outward looking country, which we could never achieve in the decades that the Liberal and National parties ruled Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget goes to the very heart of those problems. There is no doubt that the move of the Budget from surplus to deficit was critical to help to provide the sort of basic stimulus that is needed at the same time. The ongoing interest rate strategy adopted by the Government is important. It is worth noting that the process of lowering interest rates started in February 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>  On every occasion that there has been adjustment in the easing of monetary policy since February 1990, the Opposition said it was inappropriate. On every occasion the Opposition has condemned those initiatives that have been taken to ease monetary policy, believing, as it has said all the way through, that this was a political sort of response; that this was the Government and the Reserve Bank operating in a political way. On each occasion the Opposition said the adjustment either would fuel inflation or was not recognising the underlying trends in the economy. At different times, it has said that, rather than a continuation of the low inflation strategy that had been adopted, we would see the boom and bust sorts of symptoms that have occurred in the past when the Opposition parties were running monetary policy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  That has not happened, so the change in monetary policy yesterday was appropriate because it recognises the continuing need to promote business investment and to provide the stimulus that is needed. I do not believe or accept that it is going to cause the fuelling of inflation that people have talked about. One only has to talk to the people in the community to recognise that it is appropriate to have a modest easing in monetary policy now and to ensure that it is fully passed on to consumers and, particularly, the business investors. They deserve to have the full 8 1/2 per cent cut in official rates which has occurred since February 1990 passed on to them. The responsibility of the banks and financial institutions to do that should be recognised by all. </PARA>
<PARA>  Underpinning all of that process to try to ensure that we move out of the economic difficulties that the country faces is a recognition on the part of the Government that it must maintain the low inflation strategy and also its commitment to the well-being of ordinary Australians. Unemployment is a very serious problem. It is a major concern for people across the country. The Government has recognised the problem of unemployment and is responding as it should. It is ensuring that the skills base that is needed to be maintained as we move out of economic difficulties is there with the additional funds that have been provided to training programs to the education sector and to that vital skills base. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is worth noting that if we compare the recession today with that of 1982-83, we see a very marked change, particularly in areas such as western Sydney, which I represent. These days people are actually able to complete school; they are able to get a tertiary education. This Budget has been criticised by some in the Liberal Party for not doing enough and by others in the Liberal Party for spending too much. We have continued to increase the funding for higher education because we recognise that training and skills will be critical for the country's future and for its economic recovery. It is pleasing to note that an extra 13,000 higher education places are being funded in the Budget, on top of the 100,000 places already funded by the Federal Government since it came to office in March 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have the very real statistic that in 1983 something like 25 per cent of young people in western Sydney were unemployed. Not only do we have that dreadful statistic, but we also had the statistic of only one in three people completing secondary education, let alone going on to any form of tertiary or technical education. Those statistics have changed dramatically. Today two in three school leavers from western Sydney, which is the greatest population growth base in the country, complete higher education. That is ensuring that the opportunities and the scope for those people to get employment are a dramatic improvement on what might have been the case had the sort of non-existent policies and the lack of strategy of the Liberals been allowed to follow through. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even worse than that, we have repeatedly heard about the level of unemployment from the Leader of the Opposition and others who have spoken in the Budget debate. They decline to recognise that when they left office in 1983 they not only had double digit unemployment but they also had double digit interest rates and double digit inflation. They achieved a unique trifecta in that regard. It was an appalling record. Their policies, as far as we can judge them to date, suggest that they have not learnt at all from that.</PARA>
<PARA>  In his contribution, the honourable member for Wide Bay complained about the growth in Commonwealth expenditure to deal with the problem of urban flooding. I raise this particularly because the honourable member for Wide Bay suggested that somehow it was inappropriate for the Government to allocate money to deal with the problems of urban flooding. Last night in the adjournment debate I said that the Commonwealth Government had rightly increased its contribution to deal with this vital problem. Over 400 homes were flooded in the western part of Sydney in 1986 and almost the same number were flooded in 1988. Twice since then several homes have been flooded in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conjunction with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), we have been seeking solutions to those problems. I am delighted that the Federal Government responded, as it did in this year's Budget, by providing a special initiative to seek to deal with that problem. That is a very important and worthwhile step. It deals very much with the heart of the safety and well-being of ordinary Australians--something that governments should have been dealing with for decades. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Federal Government has not only provided $1m for the western Sydney flood drainage initiative, it has also provided major funding under the Federal water resources assistance program. The Commonwealth Government has allocated $805,000 to the Parramatta River catchment project. That is a very timely funding allocation as well. </PARA>
<PARA>  These issues are made even more stark for the people of western Sydney because at the same time as the Federal Government increased funding for these particular flood mitigation initiatives we have had the spectacle of the State Government refusing to cooperate in providing funding. Last year when the Federal Government allocated three quarters of a million dollars for local flood mitigation works in western Sydney, the local councils and the local community sought more funding. They were supported in that campaign by the New South Wales Liberal-National Party Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  I attended a deputation to the then Minister responsible for water resources in New South Wales. He made the statement to me that if any extra Federal funding was provided towards these works, he would ensure that the State Government matched those funds. As a result of that, I went back with my colleagues to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and said, `We need supplementary funds in 1990-91 towards urban flood mitigation works in western Sydney'. After considerable deliberation and difficulty, the Minister was able to ensure that those funds were allocated in June this year. An extra quarter of a million dollars that had to be matched by the State Government was allocated towards these vital flood mitigation works. The announcement was made in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA>  Following that, the New South Wales Minister--having given a public assurance as well as an assurance to me personally at a deputation and an assurance in the New South Wales Parliament--reneged. He refused to match that Commonwealth funding. As a result, the opportunity to accelerate these urgent flood mitigation works was lost. Even worse than that, the State Government is saying that it does not believe the announcement that we made about the urban flood mitigation program in this year's Budget is appropriate. It does not see urban flood relief and flood mitigation works as appropriate. It would rather see the money spent in the pork- barrelling way that the National Party is notorious for. We will not let that happen. However, it highlights the Opposition parties' complete duplicity at all levels, particularly the duplicity of the State National Party and the State Government of New South Wales, in their refusal to contribute the same assistance as was provided by the Commonwealth Government in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA>  This matter was highlighted further last week in the State Parliament when the Deputy Premier of New South Wales criticised the Federal Government for the lack of support for this particular initiative. At the same time he said that it was writing to the Commonwealth to say that it was not going to match the Federal Government's funding for these particular works. What humbug! What hypocrisy! The spectacle of the lack of integrity in the Liberal-National parties approach to these issues is there for all to see. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another area in this year's Budget which highlights the Government's recognition of key areas of growth and key opportunities for Australia is tourism. In this year's Budget and in the March economic statement the Government committed a massive increase in funding to tourism promotion overseas. At this stage the tourism budget now stands at $65m per annum. The great bulk of the increase in funding is going to the promotion of Australia as a tourism destination in Asia, the United States and Europe. We have already started to see the benefits of that flow through. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have some figures that show that levels of tourism have increased significantly in the last few months. Obviously, the difficulty with the Gulf war has ensured that the growth is not as great as it could have been otherwise. Now that that situation is behind us, the scope for a massive growth in Australia's tourism industry, with the resultant employment and foreign exchange earnings that that creates, is there for all to see. It is projected that this year our earnings in foreign exchange from tourism will be 10 per cent of our total export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is also worth noting that we expect 2.4 million visitors to Australia this financial year. This is because the Government, in conjunction with the tourism industry, has recognised the strategic value of this industry--its potential as a multiplier in terms of not only foreign exchange but also job creation and sustainable long term jobs, not only in cities but in regional Australia and in the key tourism destinations right around the nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  What alternatives to that does the Opposition suggest?  The Leader of the Opposition  has refused to commit any future Liberal government to the same level of expenditure on the promotion of tourism. He has publicly refused to do that on many occasions. He has been given the opportunity by the industry but refuses to treat campaigns such as the Greg Norman tourism campaign as serious issues that should be taken up on behalf of his Party. Not only that, but the alternative suggestion of the Liberal-National Party is its goods and services tax. It is worth while considering what the effect of the goods and services tax would be on the tourism industry and to again highlight the inconsistencies in the arguments relating to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA>  To give an example, the shadow Minister for tourism attacked councils in north Queensland because they were talking about proposing a bed tax. He said that that would be repugnant to everything that the tourism industry needs and stands for in that part of Australia. How can he attack that tax but at the same time advocate a value added tax on all the tourism services throughout north Queensland--or anywhere else in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA>  Let us take another example of the difficulties that the consumption tax would impose on tourism. What is the situation as far as people who are buying Qantas tickets are concerned? Will the goods and services tax apply to all of those sorts of tickets? Surely, if we just apply a tax in that form the net result would be to send tourism offshore. It would not promote it. People would buy their one-way fare here and then pick up their return fare elsewhere as it would be free of the value added tax and cheaper. With the goods and services tax and this disincentive, effectively we would be destroying Qantas's capacity. Not only that, but many comparable countries applying the VAT for tourism services, particularly relating to goods, exempt foreign tourists from the VAT. Apparently, the Opposition does not believe that that is the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA>  The net effect of a consumption tax would be to greatly harm the promotional and climatic advantages that Australia has, and it would hit the very industries that we are trying to promote and encourage. It cannot be applied effectively to the tourism industry. It would devastate the industry. As people in north Queensland have been told by the shadow Minister for tourism, any form of bed tax or any form of additional impost of that sort would be a total anathema to their natural interests. That being the case, honourable members opposite cannot come in here with any integrity and say that they believe in promoting Australian industries that are good at promoting and developing themselves, such as tourism, while at the same time advocating the introduction of a goods and services tax. The two things just do not sit together. That is the sort of dilemma that the Opposition will be faced with. That is why it will have great difficulty producing a tax package that actually does the necessary sorts of compensatory things to make up for this iniquitous goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget is a constructive document. It recognises both the economic concerns and needs of Australia, and the need to develop a broad and impressive country which can lead to the bulk of the economic recovery that we need to have. The economic recovery does need to be in areas such as tourism. It does need to be in areas that generate export potential for us. We need to recognise that Australia must become an outward looking, competitive country. The Budget provides the mechanism, as did the March industry statement, to ensure that those things happen. For that reason, I believe it is a good document. It recognises our difficulties while at the same time it provides the right sort of impetus for Australia to go forward into the next decade. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Although the first Budget to be brought down by the new Labor Treasurer, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), on 20 August was more realistic than those of his predecessor, it was nevertheless a dour and dismal one over which the grim spectre of unemployment, with all its disastrous implications, loomed large. It was a Budget born of a decade of public and corporate excess, when increasingly more money was being spent than was being earned. In the Budget the Hawke Labor Government was forced to concede, if only indirectly, that the fiscal and budgetary policies of the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), were not merely cavalier but also thoroughly irresponsible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  During the 1980s, under Labor, Australia's foreign debt increased alarmingly. When the Liberal-National coalition lost government in March 1983, the net foreign debt was $23.4 billion. In March of this year it had risen to $133.3 billion. So, after eight years of hard Labor, the debt had quintupled. Similarly, Australia's gross foreign debt last March stood at $165.5 billion whereas in 1983 it was a fraction of that figure, at $35.8 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even though interest rates in Australia have, thankfully, dropped during the past year--including the just announced one per cent reduction--overall, Labor's term of office has been characterised by excessively high interest rates compared with those of our OECD trading partners. Our average interest rate, according to June 1991 statistics, was running at 11.15 per cent. In May of this year our interest rate was 10.75 per cent. This was lower than for any time since Labor took office, but it was still clearly higher than that of any of our major trading partners. Our interest rate in May compared most unfavourably with Japan at 7 per cent, the United Kingdom at 9.9 per cent, the United States at 8.33 per cent, Germany at 8.4 per cent and New Zealand at 9.7 per cent. The figures speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>  How can Australian business be expected to compete favourably on the world market, given the significant disadvantage imposed over time by this nation's higher average interest rate? Most honourable members in this place would realise that, additionally, the Labor Government in the 1980s has been a party to and responsible for incompetently implemented financial deregulation without the balancing factor of adequate prudential controls. The Labor Party has directly and indirectly encouraged corporate excesses. Skase and Bond--and there are several others, of course--have become household names synonymous with suspect financial practice. The people know only too well that they, the taxpayers, are left to foot the bill. Who in this place has not heard of Tricontinental? Who, particularly in my own State of Victoria, has not wondered why no Government Minister, no financier or no lawyer has been found guilty of fraud, impropriety or even negligence and why once more the people will have to pay that debt?</PARA>
<PARA>  As far as I know, the only person to have been convicted in this regard was a Melbourne man, Kiang Lang Teh, a former accountant with the National Companies and Securities Commission, who as recently as 2 September was sentenced to three months gaol and ordered to pay $36,594 to the Commonwealth for insider trading. Teh used confidential and price sensitive information to trade in company shares before the information was made public. However, the trial judge, Judge Kelly, said that Teh was a `petty employee' who would not be made a scapegoat for community anger against, in the judge's words, `serious fraudsters'. In sentencing, the judge said that the community had been `betrayed by sundry large-scale manipulators of companies and financial institutions'. The judge added that to severely punish Teh would indicate that `the law was incapable of catching and punishing serious fraudsters but harsh in its dealing with petty employees'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recently, Melbourne-based feature writers like Kenneth Davidson and Terry McCrann have highlighted this corporate immorality. Sentiments similar to those of Judge Kelly were expressed by Terry McCrann in his article entitled `Greed rules' that was published in the Melbourne Herald-Sun of 18 July, in which he scathingly wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>It's easy to look back on the 1980s as the decade of greed, in which business ethics evaporated and corporate morality collapsed. Some millions of dollars were made and/or plundered--then spent in a long-running orgy of highly conspicuous consumption. . . While it was happening there were few questioning voices. Now that it's all over there appears to be little reckoning. . . The banks just write off the billions of dollars in bad loans. Nobody goes to gaol. . . and they (the corporate offenders) are still seen in polite society.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr McCrann later attributes the corporate immorality of the 1980s to the `glossy projection of the entrepreneur' and to financial deregulation. I would add that it was deregulation without the balancing adequate prudential controls needed to implement it effectively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-At least the Leader of the Opposition has the advantage on me in this area: he has nothing he can go back on in regard to health policy, because he has none. He cannot break any promise about health policy because he has none. Let me make it quite clear that, as far as the Government is concerned, in the preparations for the Budget we had to face up to a real issue about the problem of the increase in services being provided at a rate which would bring about a doubling in 20 years, and we made decisions in regard to that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I remind the Leader of the Opposition that, going back to 1983, this is not the first time when this Government has had to face up to hard issues and make decisions which have created problems in the community, including in my own Party. I take members opposite back to 1983. It is a period that they would not want to remember because, in the August 1983 Budget, we faced up to the question of an assets test. We inherited a position where the Opposition was paying pensions to millionaires and we decided that that was crook, so we brought it to an end.</PARA>
<PARA>   I can see the Leader of the Opposition smiling, and well he might smile. The decision then created a bit of a problem, including in my own Party. What did we do? We did not walk away from the decision. We said to our Party, as we said to the community, `All right, it's legitimate--</PARA>

We set up processes within the Caucus, within the Party, we had consultations and we stuck to our guns. We took the advantage of listening to what our people had to say, unlike what the Opposition did. The then Leader of the Opposition went around the length and breadth of the country saying that this was the end of civilisation as we knew it and that, as sure as night follows day, he would bring it to an end. Of course, what the electorate did was both respect us and re-elect us. We were respected and we were re-elected. That was in 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In the Budget of 1988-89, again we had to tackle a very fundamental issue, and that was in the pharmacy industry. We had an oversupply of pharmacists. In the Budget of 1988-89, we again took a tough decision. This created a lot of concern and heartburning in the community, including in my own Party. What did we do? Again, we set up the processes within the Party. We examined the issue. As always, we had against us the opportunists of the Opposition lining themselves up, as they did with the chemists, as they did with the pilots. But we did not run away from the decision and, as in 1984, in 1990 we were respected and we were re-elected--as we will be in 1993.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have been interested in some of the comments about the interest rate decision. If some commentators had their way, we should have dropped interest rates on 7 August when the quarterly figures came out and put them up again on 30 August when the housing figures came out. What I have been at pains to point out is that we are following due process and there is a lot of confusion about due process in politics. The reality is that due process required an announcement yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As I have already made clear, yesterday was the first time the Reserve Bank Board met since the Budget was brought down. It does not meet in August. We needed to announce--and it needed to announce--the decision before a bond tender of $1.5 billion yesterday. That is not politics--far from it. It is transparent, sensible management of monetary policy. It is the working out of due process. The opposite to having deals and perceptions as the driving force in economics and political decisions is having detailed policy, economic analysis and due process. That is what we have done.</PARA>
<PARA>  If people really want to be critical of the decision, the Governor of the Reserve Bank has delivered an address this morning that carefully argues the case for a one per cent cut in interest rates. Again, if people wish to label this decision as political, they will need to address the arguments outlined by the Governor of the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA>  This decision reinforces the prospects for economic growth outlined in the 1991-92 Budget. The Budget was introduced, as is always the case, with the intention that monetary policy would be set appropriately. In fact, the Budget Papers stated that monetary policy will `remain sufficiently firm to restrain inflationary expectations and not jeopardise the recovery in domestic demand'. Yesterday's decision is totally consistent with that approach.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is addressed to the Treasurer. What factors led to the Government's Budget decision to legislate for occupational superannuation and, further, in coming to this decision, what alternatives were considered?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="613" SPEAKER="Kerin The Hon J.C." NAMEID="QH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WERRIWA" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The decisions announced in the Budget about superannuation represent a necessary and pivotal long term reform. The factors that are behind the decision are historical and they also anticipate demographic changes. As I have said on other occasions, something like 11 per cent of the population is now aged 65 or more; 20 or 30 years down the track that figure will go up to 18 per cent. Whereas today there are five people in employment for every person over 65, by the year 2021 there will be only three. So this decision being taken now, this reform, is correct, it is timely and it is fair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is all right our sitting here as politicians--and on the other side they do so very hypocritically--because we have a big, fat superannuation fund but, no, the rest of the population cannot have it. About two-thirds of the population have some form of superannuation, and the Opposition is saying the rest of the work force cannot have it. This reform is about tidying up the tail on superannuation. Award superannuation was provided for in 1986 as part of the productivity-wages trade off, and we want to tidy up the non-compliance and the non-award area. This is part of the retirement incomes policy. There are two legs to that. There is always going to be the income support part of it through the age pension and, of course, we are giving more and more scope for self-provision. Let us have a look at some of the recent comments. On 18 August the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I don't believe that occupational superannuation makes any sense in a country like Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The next thing he says, on 22 August, with total cynicism--a bit of reverse snobbery--is:</PARA>
<PARA>Superannuation has been rorted for the benefit of the rich against the poor.</PARA>
<PARA>Just eight years ago superannuation was a joke. The situation we inherited from the Liberals was an absolute farce. It was little more than a means whereby the rich milked the tax system for all it was worth. Lump sums were virtually exempt from tax. There was no assets test on the government pension, so superannuation lump sums did not affect entitlements at all. If they had any choice, nobody took a superannuation pension, and annuities were almost unheard of. There was no roll-over mechanism to enable superannuation benefits received on changing jobs to continue and to accumulate in a concessionally taxed environment. Vesting and preservation standards were only limited and, most serious of all, superannuation was the preserve of a very small proportion of the work force. It was rorted;  it was a farce;  and the Opposition did nothing about it.</PARA>
<PARA>  We have changed all that. We have put a comprehensive retirement incomes policy in place and the tax applying to superannuation has been cleaned up, placing superannuation on a sustainable long term basis. Preservation and vesting have been introduced and award superannuation has dramatically increased coverage. So with our policies we have cleaned out the rorts, we have made the system fairer, and I will just mention that access to superannuation tax concessions is limited by a person's reasonable benefit limit. The reasonable benefit limit is now also on a tapered scale ensuring more equitable distribution of tax concessions.</PARA>
<PARA>  What we have put in place, for a range of reasons, is a major reform that is timely and fair. We have wiped out the rorts, we are making sure that the Australian population takes care once and for all for its own retirement, and we are doing it now--and only Labor could do it.</PARA>

There is not one. That is what he ought to be doing: producing an Opposition health policy. Then we can have a serious debate about this issue. We were denied it last time. The Leader of the Opposition knows what happened in regard to health policy:  his Opposition shadow spokesman had to stand up--nothing like this had ever happened in the history of politics in this country--on the eve of the last election and say, `Australian electorate, I am sorry, we are going into this election without a health policy'.

That is the question that farmers in this country are entitled to ask because the Opposition has not come up with the details. In addition to this great strategy that produces no gain, what are honourable members opposite going to do?  They will hit them with a 15 per cent hike on everything they spend. On top of the price for everything that they now purchase there will be 15 per cent. There will be no gain but all the pain. It is against that background----</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The 12 March statement announced changes to depreciation, and that legislation has yet to come to the Parliament. The main reason for the delay, as the honourable gentleman is aware, is that we said we would consult with industry. The changes that we announced then basically were for an immediate write-off for any investment of a three-year life or $300, asset pooling, self- assessment and definition of effective life. There are some other minor changes to what was put forward. The business community, in its various components, has various attitudes about some of these components that we announced. I am in discussion with both the business community and Senator Button, and we hope to bring that forward to the Parliament as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The point I would stress in all of this is that we will get a far more sensible depreciation system out of this discussion, out of this work, but in some instances we may have to make some accommodation for some specific industries. Industry itself is not agreed about all of this. The question of definition of `effective life' for some industries is quite different from others and there is simply a lot of work to do.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I ask a question of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Has his attention been drawn to suggestions that the Budget should be in balance?  Can he advise the House of the implications for programs in his portfolio of the expenditure cuts necessary to achieve such a result?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="617" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I noticed in what must go down in history as probably one of the most complacent and vacuous replies given in this House to any Budget that the Leader of the Opposition advocated that this year's Budget should have indeed been a balanced one. The first consequence of a balanced Budget this year would, on the basis of the Murphy model, to which the Opposition itself subscribes, be to increase unemployment by 46,000. That is the first consequence of a balanced Budget--to directly increase unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In order to get to a balanced Budget, one would first have to adjust the revenue and expenditure sides. As has been pointed out on many occasions, this is one of the many areas where the Leader of the Opposition has yet to come clean, that is, how he would reduce expenditure in order to achieve this in any event incorrect objective.</PARA>
<PARA>  But if we go back to the last election and the economic action plan we get some hints, some clues, as to where expenditure cuts would apply. First of all, the Opposition said at that stage that it would abolish Jobstart, which is worth $93m;  it would abolish Skillshare, which is worth nearly $120m;  it would abolish the industry training support scheme, worth $45m;  it would abolish the new enterprise incentive scheme, worth $22m; and it would remove $9m from the Australian traineeship scheme. That is a reduction of $288m in precisely those programs which are designed to assist the unemployed. In other words, it would add 46,000 to the ranks of the unemployed and remove support for 150,000 of the unemployed as a result of reducing expenditure in these programs. That, of course, is without even mentioning the fact that the Opposition has this appalling policy that will remove assistance from the unemployed after a period of nine months. That is one of the most appalling policies that has ever been proposed, particularly from a party which under current circumstances is beginning to pretend to have an interest in the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>  I might say that the lie was given to the Opposition's real stance on unemployment when the honourable member for Bennelong said on 26 August:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't pretend that if the Opposition fell into government tomorrow that overnight we could pull unemployment down. Anyone who runs around saying that is not really coming clean.</PARA>
<PARA>Well may he say that. The Opposition has just embraced a slogan used by Mrs Thatcher prior to her 1979 election when she ran around Britain saying that there were a million Britons unemployed and that British Labour was not working. I think the Leader of the Opposition has done us a great service in revealing his true agenda, who his true political icon is, because now we can examine what would be in store for Australia if indeed the consequences of this slogan, the work of these sloganeers, were ever to come to pass in Australia. Mrs Thatcher was elected in 1979. By 1983 the one million unemployed had become in excess of three million unemployed. She managed, in a period of three or four years, to actually treble the rate of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>  Not only did she do that, she was also able to reduce the real GDP of Britain by 1.2 per cent, and--honourable members should listen to this--she was able to get inflation up to 18 per cent in 1980. Here we have the true, secret, hidden agenda of the modern Liberal Party under Dr Hewson. He does not have any compassion for the unemployed; in fact, he is so keen on the unemployed that he wants more of them. A million of them are not enough for him, he wants three million.</PARA>
<PARA>  This is the real policy of the Liberal Party. This sham compassion is just evidence of the hollow grief coming from a hollow man. The more he is revealed as hollow the more permanent he will become; that is, permanently Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-For a start, I can tell them that I would not be doing what those opposite would be doing if they had the chance. I would say to the unemployed--they would be the people most concerned in the honourable member's hypothetical question--that under the policies of this Government we have substantially increased the benefits that are paid to the unemployed in real terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>   We certainly would not be saying to the unemployed what those opposite would be saying if they could summon up the honesty to tell them the truth about their policies; that is, that they would be throwing them onto the street, with no unemployment benefit after nine months. Those opposite should not try to wriggle out of it by saying, `We don't really mean it' because I will remind them what was said by their--if I may fall into the trap--increasingly tedious Leader of the Opposition in August 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>Why not cut off unemployment, we challenge him (the Treasurer). Cut off unemployment benefits after nine months and match our policy. We are saving about $750m from that change.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that the honourable member should go along to the Brotherhood of St Laurence and say, `Under the policies of my Leader, we will deliberately increase unemployment in this country', which must be done by a savage cutting of $3 billion to $4 billion in expenditure. He should tell the Brotherhood of St Laurence that the Opposition will increase the number of unemployed. When that has sunk in, he can then say, `By the way, I also want to tell you that I am going to increase the burden on you as I save $750m by throwing the unemployed onto the street'. When he has finished telling the Brotherhood of St Laurence about that, and if it is still prepared to listen to him, he should come back and I will give him the next chapter to tell it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is directed to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. In the western region of Sydney we face enormous problems caused by lack of investment as well as lack of adequate planning. How will the building better cities program address these issues?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="618" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; HEALTH, HOUSING AND COMMUNITY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for Prospect for her question, emphasising her concern for the quite serious problems that are evident not only in western Sydney but also in all major cities:  the high cost and the lack of suitable housing;  the lack of access to services, whether it is health care, child-care or transport;  the high costs of enforced car use; and the long distances to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  On the subject of distance to work, research indicates that increasing numbers of people--for example, women with dependent children who are in the work force; almost 20 per cent of such people--are now travelling more than an hour each way to and from work. The honourable member for Prospect would know what that statistic means in human terms.</PARA>
<PARA>  Clearly, the problems that are evident in areas such as western Sydney have to be faced by State governments.  Governments need to provide fundamental services, whether it is water, sewerage or power and they need to improve transport and health facilities which arise as much as anything because of the lack of partnership between the different levels of government--Federal, State or local governments.</PARA>
<PARA>  Clearly, while the Opposition would want to ignore this fact, the Commonwealth exerts great influence on the structure of cities through its migration policies; through its tax policies and the ways that they affect business and investment decisions; through its monetary and industry policies which affect the housing industry; as well as through the decisions it makes as to where its work force is located. In order to improve the cities it is vital that the Commonwealth takes its responsibilities seriously. The better cities program is an important step in developing a partnership between the different levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA>  In Sydney the minimum cost of a three bedroom house is around $120,000. For this amount, the house is likely to be at least 50 kilometres from the city centre. Sydney will have to house an extra one million people by the year 2006. Yet the land available provides for about 75 per cent of this demand, causing price increases and housing shortages.</PARA>
<PARA>  Sydney is one of the great cities of the world. The Commonwealth needs to work with the States to ensure that land is available so that the constant pressures of the housing industry are effectively avoided.</PARA>
<PARA>  Regarding planning, the provision of hospital services to particular areas of cities--for example, the south-west corridor of Sydney--ought to be a matter in which the Commonwealth Government takes no particular interest. These issues are well understood by a number of commentators. For example--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Leader of the Opposition increasingly specialises, like Snow White amid a number of dwarfs, in interventions that have no political content. He says, `Where is the money coming from?'  No-one has suggested that the problems that I have referred to are problems that will be solved by the Commonwealth or would be resolved simply by money. But those problems are as much problems of micro-economic reform as any of the other issues that we hear focused on in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note that an editorial in the Australian Financial Review of 22 August--it is interested in some substance; we get little substance from the Opposition--stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . micro-reform must also be built from the bottom upwards. And the successful deployment of the nation's considerable assets depends on the ability of all the governments to build an effective system of co-operative federalism.</PARA>

<PARA>I have quoted from the Australian Financial Review because, essentially, the better cities program is an attempt to achieve partnership between levels of government. It is a way of approaching structural problems in the Australian economy; achieving flexibility in the labour market; and achieving a recovery in the housing industry in order to provide the necessary land. It is an attempt to deal with the quality of life of people which is essential----</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Let me dispense with this question very quickly. First of all, if I am going to be in this business of gratuitously giving advice, I would start off again by saying that the honourable member for Bendigo should tell his constituent what I said to the honourable member opposite who asked the previous question. He should tell him, `Do not vote for the Opposition because we are going to increase the number of unemployed'. Secondly, he should say, `Don't vote for us, because, if we get in'--which the Opposition will not--`you won't want to stay unemployed, Raymond'. I think that is what you said his name was. The honourable member should say, `Enjoy the unemployment benefit while you can, Raymond, because, when we get in, after nine months we are going to take the unemployment benefit off you'. The honourable member should tell him that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Opposition says Raymond wants a job. He should not go to the Opposition because its prescription is for an increase in unemployment. Its own model says so.

Don't vote for me because I am going to throw you on the street after nine months'. That is what he should say to Raymond.</PARA>
<PARA>  I would say to Raymond that this Government has put in place a massive increase in the number of programs for the training and retraining of people who are unemployed at this stage. The fact is that the policies in place--as I have said before--will mean that during this financial year there will be a 4 per cent increase in GDP and there will be a significant increase in employment. It is only adherence to those policies, laced with the compassion that we have, which keeps people on benefit and does not throw them onto the street. That is the only way that the constituent of the honourable member for Bendigo can have any hope in this country.

Apparently, this morning, on ABC radio or one of the other stations, the Leader of the Opposition was asked why he wimped the censure motion yesterday. He said, `Oh, you don't need to worry about those. Today in Question Time we are going to subject the Government to rigorous cross-examination'.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have got to say one thing about the reply to the Budget by the Leader of the Opposition. While he has yet to give us specifics on $3 billion worth of cuts that he says will accompany his introduction of the consumption tax, he did in fact get specific about what cuts there would be to achieve the balanced Budget that he wanted. The Minister for Finance drew that to our attention yesterday. The Leader of the Opposition was quite specific: all the additional expenditures that were associated with those offset, plus the taxation measures that were put in the Budget to reduce taxation to the average Australian and to deal with the problems of the wheat industry--he was quite specific--would be cut.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Incorporated in the cuts that he would be prepared to look at, and that I assume must have been accompanied by some serious policy examination, was all the expenditure which went into the Rail Freight Authority. One of the most significant initiatives in our area--one that has been crying out for attention for 70 or 80 years and that has finally got attention by this Government and no other--would be totally jettisoned by the Leader of the Opposition, irrespective of undertakings and statements made by his various spokesmen, including the Leader of the National Party, on their attitude to the Rail Freight Authority. The National Party has not been calling for it to be cut, as the Leader of the Opposition, in his Budget response, called for it to be cut. The National Party has said that it is a sensible initiative by the Government and ought to be supported. We assumed that when the Leader of the Opposition looked at his program of micro-economic reform he decided as part of it that he would jettison the Rail Freight Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>  Incorporated also in this particular Budget is expenditure related to reforms on the waterfront. The Opposition is a great mob when it comes to dealing with micro-economic reform. As with the consumption tax, we never get specifics. The fact of the matter is that by the end of this month, under the reforms that we have put in place, some 2,000-plus people will have left the waterfront, on the basis of serious, detailed negotiations with the people concerned, and real gains in productivity will result. Both those essential micro-economic reforms required Budget outlays to deal with the problem.</PARA>
<PARA>  The position that is evidently being offered by the Opposition is that it cares nothing about micro-economic reform when it finally comes down to deliberating on what conceivable impact it will have on budgetary arrangements. Of course, Opposition members care nothing about what other promises they might be making at the same time as they call for cuts. The Budget contains road funding. Again it is suggested that there should be a cut. Not one month before the Opposition made that response to the Budget, the Leader of the National Party made a few comments on expenditure. One of the joys of life in politics, or at least of being in government, is that one has access to a clipping service and becomes aware that there are two coalition presentations. There is the coalition presentation in the city and before the national media, and there is the coalition presentation in the country, on this particular occasion as covered in the Rockhampton Morning Bulletin. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>Coalition: Extra $1b for roads.</PARA>
<PARA>  A Coalition Federal government would increase funds to improve Queensland roads--</PARA>
<PARA>we find the article has a bit of specificity here; it is $1 billion for Queensland--</PARA>
<PARA>by up to an extra $1 billion, National Party Leader Mr Fischer said at the weekend.</PARA>
<PARA>  He promised Belyando Shire Council during a visit to Clermont that the Coalition realised Queensland's neglected road system desperately needed a huge injection of funds.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Opposition will just rock in with $1 billion worth of Commonwealth funds to make absolutely certain that the old Belyando Shire is not left out the next time old Tim comes around for a two-minute visit. I could go through a plethora of examples where robust statements are made in this place about Budget cuts--and they have been particularly robust in debate on this Budget, including a promise, effectively, that if those opposite had been in office they would have increased taxation--while outside the statements are particularly robust about increases in expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>  The problem for this Opposition, and it will become an increasing subject of interest to the public as an election draws closer--in 18 months time, as opposed to the three months that those opposite seem to be telling their various candidates--is that Opposition members will be subject to cross-examination. We will wish to know what it is that they intend to do with the various promises that they make so promiscuously around the country on subjects such as road expenditure. We will want to know in detail what they intend to do about health policies. We will want to know in detail what they intend to do about education policies. We will want to know what they intend to do about consumption tax policies. They will be subject to cross-examination, and it will not be a continuation of their wimpish performance in this place. It will be a great deal more robust than that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There is absolutely no doubt that the introduction of a consumption tax would see the smashing of the gains that we have made on inflation in this country. Rather than address this question hypothetically, let us look at an example of very considerable relevance and one that is very dear to the heart of the shadow Treasurer. Let us look at New Zealand. A consumption tax was introduced in New Zealand in 1986. As a result, inflation immediately shot up to 19 per cent. It has since fallen to 3 per cent. The shadow Treasurer gleefully latched on to that figure when speaking on the 7.30 Report on 17 July. Honourable members should remember the quotes of dear Peter. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>They--</PARA>
<PARA>that is New Zealand--</PARA>
<PARA>introduced a consumption tax and now they are the world champion in beating inflation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fascinating. New Zealand is the world champion in beating inflation--that is the lesson from the shadow Treasurer. Mr Speaker, as you know very well, and as most other honourable members in this place know, that is only half the story. I will complete the story about New Zealand. Since the introduction of the consumption tax----</PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Reith interjecting--</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Come on!  Be quiet, Peter. You have had your go. Since the introduction of the consumption tax in New Zealand, they have been in a five-year recession. Let us look at the facts. This is the achievement since the introduction of the consumption tax in New Zealand, the spiritual home now of the tories of Australia. It has been in recession for five years and now the GDP in New Zealand, five years later, is 4 per cent lower than it was five years ago with the introduction of the broad-based consumption tax. Against that 4 per cent reduction in GDP in New Zealand since the introduction of the broad-based consumption tax, the GDP in Australia has increased by 13 per cent. In other words, there is a 17 per cent differential between the experience of Australia and New Zealand following the introduction of the broad-based consumption tax there. On our GDP aggregates, that represents a difference of about $65 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We should also look at this world champion performance, this model to which the Opposition turns, in regard to employment in that period. Here again are the facts: in New Zealand, employment has fallen by almost 6 per cent since the introduction of the consumption tax and, in the same period in Australia, employment has risen by 8.8 per cent. That is a 15 per cent differential in employment outcomes. In Australian terms, that represents a million jobs in this country. There we have it--a $65 billion difference in the GDP differential performance and one million jobs in terms of the employment differential. That is the size of the Opposition's credibility gap and that is the magnitude of its hypocrisy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This country is not only gripped by one of the worst recessions in its history, it is not only gripped by the social agony created by one million unemployed, it is also gripped by a negative paralysis which is now dominating the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)--this Government's attitude--in a way that is adding greatly to the burden of the situation. Today in Question Time we saw the Prime Minister stumble again and again over the question of the Medicare policy of this Government, the Medicare decision of the Budget and its reference to the Caucus committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I now reveal to the House that the Prime Minister has also been stumbling over certain other matters--a matter of his schedule in Melbourne a few weeks ago. The Prime Minister was invited to officially open one little chink of hope, one ray of light, for the hard-pressed people of Melbourne, particularly in the area of Box Hill, at the Bowater Ltd factory in the eastern suburbs of that hard- pressed city, which is, in many ways, the epicentre of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our Prime Minister accepted that invitation. Considerable cost was incurred and considerable arrangements were made in preparation for that opening to take place on Wednesday, 14 August. What happened? Just a few days before that opening was to proceed, the Prime Minister's office contacted that company and said, `No, we are going to remove the Prime Minister from that function, we are going to remove that one chance to give a little brighter profile to the opening up of new jobs in that part of Melbourne. The Prime Minister is now no longer able to proceed with that opening'. That reply was given at very short notice. </PARA>
<PARA>  The true reason for that action by that Prime Minister--the temporary Prime Minister--on that occasion has been revealed. Yesterday I received a copy of a letter from the Australian Timber and Allied Industries Union No. 7 Branch, Pulp and Paper Workers Branch, addressed to the Prime Minister and dated 29 July. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Prime Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>  I understand that you have accepted an invitation to officiate at a function at Bowater Limited, Box Hill, Victoria on Wednesday, 14th August, 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to talk about the situation between the union and the company and then it adds:</PARA>
<PARA>  Accordingly and regretfully I request you to decline the invitation as your attendance would be intolerable at a time when our members are fighting to secure the delivery of an Australian Government/A.C.T.U. Accord. </PARA>
<PARA>So the union vetoed the Prime Minister's proceeding with his schedule on that day to that factory to the opening of additional facilities of a job generating kind. The letter is signed Chris Northover, secretary of the ATAIU.</PARA>
<PARA>  I put it to the House, to the nation, that we have a Prime Minister paralysed by the union movement, paralysed by his own inertia, and paralysed by the negative attitude which is dominating as we go through this recession we did not have to have. I put it to the House that it has reached a stage where there can be only one solution--the early election, the change of government, and the economic reform agenda which will give some hope to the one million unemployed who exist in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have reached a stage where we have a stand-still mentality, a status quo approach, a Government running scared of almost each and every serious decision it should be making on industrial relations. Where is the real progress? Where is the genuine enterprise bargaining? Where is the genuine protection of the right of a person to belong to a union and the right of a person not to belong to a union? There is none. </PARA>
<PARA>  In relation to taxation policy, it was very interesting to hear the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) wade into this area and get it all wrong. In any event, why did we not hear the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy tell the House that the National Farmers Federation supports tax reform and the GST; that the Chamber of Manufactures in New South Wales supports GST; that the New South Wales farmers in a very aggressive newsletter and column in the Sun-Herald last Sunday strongly supports GST?</PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister did not even have the courage to admit at the Rice Growers Association conference, which he addressed in Deniliquin--which I also addressed--that the rice growers supported GST. One might well ask: what happened at the Cattlemen Union's conference? No less a dignitary than the Prime Minister--he got that schedule right; he actually made it up to Mount Isa for a few brief hours and then dashed back to that famous dinner and tete-a-tete with Senator Richardson in the Lodge on Monday night of last week, thereby denying the people of Mount Isa the benefit of a lengthy stay--addressed the Cattlemen's Union conference, and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) then addressed the conference. Guess what the Cattlemen's Union then determined and put out in accordance with its previous policy? Support for tax reform! Support for the GST! Support for the abolition of sales tax!</PARA>
<PARA>  Let us have less nonsense from the Government with regard to tax reform. Let us have more accurate, constructive debate, and let us get on with the job. This Government is paralysed in its whole approach to a range of key projects. My colleague the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) will in support deal with some of those projects, including the very fast train--but, similarly, I want to put before the House some very key examples. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was back in March 1989 that the Federal Cabinet approved the third runway at Mascot. Even under the mathematical ability of the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), that is now two years and five months ago. It is a delay which is unacceptable. I asked the House last March, in liaison with the shadow Minister for aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), given the fact that it took six years to build the Louvre, six years to build the whole of the J.F.Kennedy Airport complex at New York, and nine years to build the Sydney Harbour Bridge, how long is it going to take to build the third runway at Mascot?  The reality is that in the two years and five months since Federal Cabinet approved that key development project, the Kuwait international airport has been closed, has been partially destroyed, and has been rebuilt and reopened with additional runway capacity. </PARA>
<PARA>  What hope is there for Australia when we have a delay to the key project, the third runway at Mascot?  The sharp edge of this delay is now apparent to all honourable members with the announcement by Hazelton Airlines on Monday that it has no choice but to wreck in part the economy of so many towns in New South Wales by revoking air services to Forbes, Cowra, Young, Cootamundra, Walgett, Coonamble, Brewarrina, Bourke, Nyngan, Lightning Ridge, Gunnedah, Quirindi, Coonabarabran and Temora from next Friday. The reasons given were the recession, the delays at Mascot and the peak period charging system. </PARA>
<PARA>  What price is the inland economy of New South Wales paying for the delay of the third runway at Kingsford-Smith airport? It is not a cost only for New South Wales, it is a cost for the aviation industry generally, a cost for the tourism industry generally and a cost in terms of inefficiency for Australians at large. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will now refer to flights between South Africa and Australia. Honourable members might recall that the Government is ham-fisted about that matter in that when other airlines have been cheerfully flying directly from Europe to South Africa we still have a situation in which there are no direct flights between Australia and South Africa. We still have lingering trade sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will reveal to the House yet another example of the paralysis, the negative attitude and the incredible mentality which exists in this country. When a company arranged under the interpretation of the trade sanctions policy to continue with its imports of winching cable it also arranged to import $500,000 of special drilling rods. What happened?  A Customs officer arrived and gave a slightly different interpretation of the sanctions exemptions in existence at present. As a consequence, there was no facility given for those rods to be on- sold or put into bond storage until the trade sanction policy was lifted. Guess what happened?  Each and every one of those drilling rods, by direction of Customs, had to be destroyed on location on the wharf. What progress can Australia expect when we have a government and a trade sanctions policy which has led to that circumstance with regard to that particular mining company?</PARA>
<PARA>  Coronation Hill has been dealt with on a number of occasions. I simply add, by way of comparison with Coronation Hill, which I have recently revisited, that BHP's Escondida project in Chile has come on-stream. The project was commissioned seven months ahead of schedule and was $161m under budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Porgera gold project in Papua New Guinea poured its first gold 14 months after construction commenced and only 26 months after approval was first sought. In other words, a gold mine in Papua New Guinea has gone from nowhere to operation and this Government is still considering the third runway project at Mascot. What hope is there for Australia with that negative attitude, that paralysis and that delay adding to the burden of the situation we face in this country?</PARA>
<PARA>  Some $9 billion worth of projects are in limbo and have been delayed. Those projects have been drawn up not by me but my Access Economics. It is a well known list. I am sure that the Minister has seen the list. The Minister should be ashamed of the list which has come about not altogether entirely due to his inactivity--I concede that much--but certainly due to the amount of red tape, green tape, black tape and every other form of layering on the processing of these decisions in a way which has led to the collapse of investment confidence in this country with the mining sector, the agricultural sector and even the manufacturing sector. </PARA>

<PARA>  At a time when we need positive decisions, at a time when we need positive development and at a counter-cyclical time in terms of economic international trends and building up our job base, we have a Government that can only talk of delays, referrals and a range of excuses for inactivity. When it eventually comes to the Cabinet table for that decisive decision we have the incredible circumstance where the Prime Minister, who did not even have a majority on the day at the Cabinet table, still extracted that no decision, that veto decision, on Coronation Hill to the absolute anger of the Minister for Resources, who is at the table. I know that this Minister is a little more in touch than some of his colleagues, although not many. That is why he went into that Cabinet room arguing for Coronation Hill. The Minister should tell me if I am wrong. The Minister did that. He went into Cabinet and argued for Coronation Hill and he got done. Worse still, the jobs which were available to so many Australians--the export income of half a billion dollars which this project would have generated over a short period of years--were lost for the time being to the ranks of the unemployed of Australia until a change of government. </PARA>
<PARA>  I put it to the House that we have a Government entirely run by the ACTU, with a union veto circumstance which has paralysed policy decision making in a range of areas, including resources and uranium. The ACTU has an incredible policy on uranium, which the honourable member for Aston will refer to in more detail. We stand for decisive decision making, staying the course on the tough decisions, offering a true economic reform agenda and in doing that not only giving the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) the keys to the Lodge but giving workers the keys to jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer), as the shadow Minister for energy and resources--this is entirely consistent with the Opposition's policies on resource matters--took 10 minutes on this alleged matter of public importance to begin to canvass the issues that relate to the resources sector. He spent five minutes speaking on resource matters. That speaks much more eloquently for the lack of insight and the lack of interest in this important sector than anything I can say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Issues such as Medicare and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) not attending a factory opening might be seen by some as matters appropriate to a matter of public importance on resources. I suspect that there are very few in the resources sector who would embrace the same view. I travel around the country and I ask rhetorically a wide range of audiences who the relevant shadow Minister responsible for resources issues is. I concede that it is not always, but usually, met with deafening silence. The Leader of the National Party knows this because this issue was raised by the Chamber of Mines in Queensland where a spokesperson for that organisation canvassed these issues. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us move on, hopefully, to something more substantive. Whilst I do so, I offer members of the Opposition the opportunity to answer this simple proposition:  in nearly three decades of tory Government can any member of the Opposition name one significant micro-economic reform during that period?  I can certainly name one or two, but I would like the opportunity extended to all on the Opposition side to test their memory and the history of their own period in government. At the end of this debate perhaps the other contributors from that side can provide a comprehensive list after they have all got together. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me make a few brief points about the resources sector.  The first thing to understand about it is that we need to have the macro- economic environment settings correct. We cannot simply go in and embrace a policy on the run or some rhetoric as a substitute for an appropriate resources sector framework. People might disagree with some of the policy outcomes, but no-one can sustain an argument that since the Government took office in 1983 there has been insignificant reform. Key policy decisions in terms of the economic framework include the deregulation of the financial market, the floating of the dollar, substantial reductions in government outlays, corporate and personal tax reform, a stable wages environment and substantially reduced protection. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some of the features of the Government's achievements include: a disciplined approach to fiscal and monetary policy, which has been successful in reducing inflation from the double digit levels of the early 1980s, a time when honourable members opposite were in government, to the present underlying rate of just over 3 per cent;  broad reform of the taxation system, including lower personal and corporate rates, making Australia now the fourth lowest taxed country in the OECD;  the introduction of dividend imputation to eliminate double taxation of dividends and to add to Australia's savings base;  and so on and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting that there was so little debate on the March statement. It is worth canvassing for a moment the importance of that statement. As people will recall, the Prime Minister, in his March statement Building a Competitive Australia, announced significant ongoing lower tariff reductions across the board, reduced wholesale taxes for business, granted duty exemptions for minerals processing equipment, increased support for workplace reform and created a more favourable depreciation regime. All of these things mean lower input costs and greater competitiveness for industry, and particularly resource based industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's decision to reduce general tariff levels by 5 per cent by 1996 is in this context worthy of specific mention. The dimension of those changes ought not to be underestimated. Professor Ross Garnaut, who is widely accepted in this Parliament and elsewhere as a good authority in these matters, said:</PARA>
<PARA>  We would lack all sense of history, all sense of the tides of national life in Australia, if we let last week's announcement--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the March economic statement--</PARA>
<PARA>pass without savouring for a moment its place in bigger schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>  They are big changes. Bigger than the end of the British corn laws that earned Peel and Cobden a dozen pages in our high school history books, eight or ten time zones and over a century away. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Why is this?  Just for the resource sector alone, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, again quintessentially an independent umpire and independent arbiter of these issues, indicated that the March economic statement alone would drive an increase in production volumes in the resources sector of 5 per cent, which translates into around $1 billion per annum in 1988 prices. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think I can safely assert that in the history of the Federation there has never been in this chamber a policy statement that offered up the prospects for such significant reform to Australia's important resources sector. That is why the independent arbiters, rather than the partisan commentators from the other side of this House, described the statement in such strong terms. </PARA>
<PARA>  In respect of the areas for which I am responsible--forestry, petroleum and mining--I make the following points. The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) indicated that he had recourse to the Access Economics report and he indicated that the investment environment was never so bad. The author of the very report from which he quoted begins an article in The Economist in December 1990 in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>Investment interest in energy and metals processing is still healthy. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite the opposite to the misleading observation of the Leader of the National Party. I now turn to the specifics, and let me refer to one area of the resources sector that is of incredible importance to this country, namely, the petroleum sector. It is a major player in the resources sector. It contributes over one per cent of our GDP. About 10,000 people are employed in that sector. It exports about $2.4 billion worth of product and that will increase dramatically in the years to come. It provides import replacement of about $8 billion. It is by any definition a most significant part of the resources sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  As to Government initiatives, let me give the House a thumbnail sketch, a brief overview, rather than going through all the details. First, the Government deregulated the crude oil market and removed restrictions on crude oil on 1 January 1988. Anyone in the industry would regard that as a most significant reform. I released the offshore exploration strategy in June 1990. It has been met not only by our domestic players but by international players as well with very strong interest indeed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The package of reforms to secondary taxation applying to petroleum production, announced in the August 1990 Budget, including company-wide deductibility, was described in part by the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association in the following terms, and I must paraphrase them. When we look back from the next century at Australia's oil and gas exploration and production industry, August 1990 will be seen to be `the decisive moment'. Never has an organisation like the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association so solidly endorsed a Federal Government decision in those terms. Again, I would rather rely on them than on the partisan rhetoric of honourable members opposite. </PARA>
<PARA>  As to the introduction of income tax deductibility for petroleum platform removal expenditures, some would think that that is not so big in the scheme of things, until one reflects on the cost of removal of those platforms. That was a very significant decision and it also of course has significant environmental implications. There was the deregulation of the liquefied petroleum gas market and LPG exports, a condition precedent to the proper development of this important industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  In terms of achievements, there was a record number of exploration wells drilled in 1990, a record seismic survey, exploration expenditure of more than $400m, and recently BHPP, one of Australia's premier players in this area, has indicated that it is shifting money that was directed towards overseas exploration and production back into domestic exploration and production. Again, contrary to the partisan rhetoric of honourable members opposite, I think that is a fair indication, at least in this sector, of company sentiment. </PARA>
<PARA>  What do others say about these policies?  The reforms to the resource rent tax and the extension to Bass Strait have been praised in a recent article by the Business Review Weekly, which indicated that Esso and BHPP would now renew the development phase in Bass Strait, our premier oil and gas area, and that it would spark `a new boom in oil exploration'. BHPP's management is quoted as endorsing the reforms, saying that the changes to RRT make it possible to finish the work in Bass Strait and `begin the task of exploring the other more prospective basins in the southern oceans'. I am happy that those reforms have been so well received. So, that is the domestic response. </PARA>
<PARA>  Internationally, the 1991 international new ventures survey of 66 international oil companies, conducted by the Robertson Research Group, ranked Australia as the fourth most favoured host country and fourth in terms of exploration expenditure--a jump from twentieth the previous year. It is an extraordinary result for this country. Honourable members may have read just a couple of days ago an article in the Australian newspaper by Mr Gomez, a respected resources writer, quoting a paper by Dr Fesharaki, the Director of Resources Programs at the prestigious East West Centre in Honolulu. Dr Fesharaki's views underscore earlier international surveys, as I have indicated. His proposition was that the resource rent tax proposals were of such significance that they have led a turnaround for the Australian oil industry. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government must be applauded for the implementation of this brave policy, which has proved to be very successful in revitalising the Australian oil industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Esso Australia recently indicated in the context of resource rent tax changes that it was going to spend some $650m further in Bass Strait. In terms of the forestry sector, again there has been a lot of rhetoric from the Opposition but very little indeed of any substance. Indeed, the premier organisation representing the timber and paper sector in this country, the National Association of Forest Industries, has criticised the Opposition's poor performance in the resource security debate, indicating that, as usual, those opposite are not prepared to put their own cards on the table. They have not done so yet. The debate is just about concluded and there is no policy. As a Minister I can tell them that it is a matter of enormous frustration for me that they will not put any material on the table so as to enable us at least to attack a sitting target. </PARA>

I have invited those opposite to reflect on their nearly three decades of government and, during this debate, to indicate to the Parliament, and through the Parliament to the people of Australia, what major micro-economic reforms they put in place in those nearly three decades. I have given them a thumbnail sketch of significant micro-economic reforms in my policy jurisdiction. That can be replicated and expanded upon by my colleagues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My colleague the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has raised perhaps the key issues of today; that is, jobs and the economic mismanagement of this country. In his response the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) has given us an exercise in contortion and evasion of those key issues. Frankly, if that contortion had had to be physical rather than verbal, I think he would have been in a very painful posture indeed. He complained that my colleague the Leader of the National Party did not spend enough time talking about resources. But, of course, if the Minister had read the wording of the matter of public importance, he would know that we are talking about the impact on jobs and the financial state of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Minister complained about not knowing who the Opposition spokespersons are and got into the personality game again. Of course, all we ever hear from this Government relates to personalities rather than getting down to the issues. He complained about our history in government and asked what we did years ago. Of course, this is a standard technique of every Minister in this Government; they talk about history rather than facing up to the issues and talking about the lack of jobs and the debt that they have brought upon this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister quoted selectively from a whole host of documents, trying to tell us how well we are doing as a nation. But let us look at the bottom line. All Australians know that there is something seriously wrong with the economic performance of this country. They know about the unemployment and they know about the hidden unemployment. They know about the lack of confidence. If they come from Victoria, as I do, they know about the complicity between the Kirner Government and the Hawke Government in making that even worse. They know about the lack of investment in business and industry and in resource projects. They know about the record bankruptcies. They know about the debilitating impact on the youth of this country and they know about the growth in debt, both personal and national, in this country during the life of this Government. They know recently about the failure of the Budget, which is already unravelling before our eyes. In my electorate we see it in local terms and in human terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) likes to stand up here and tell us how he relates to people. He tells us how he goes out and talks to people. Let us see him stop going to safe Australian Labor Party seats. I invite him--I ask the Minister to pass this on to him--to come down to my electorate and talk to some of the people who represent the 272 per cent increase in unemployment in my electorate in the last 12 months. I say to him, `Come and talk to some of the small businesses who represent the more than 70 per cent increase in bankruptcies in my electorate. Come and talk to some of the families and see the stress that they are under. Come and talk to some of the families who have come to me from neighbouring Labor electorates because they get no support or sympathy if they go to their own members. Come and talk to the families who come to me'. For example, a woman came to me and said, `My son is unemployed and the family is so hard up that he has had to resort to stealing within the family. With the distress and the trouble that that caused, we finally had to kick him out'. That is a human tragedy caused by this Government with its nearly one million unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I say to the Prime Minister, `Come and talk to the elderly who come into my office. They do not just ask for the Age Pension Guide that I produce as a service to my constituents, as do many of my colleagues. They do not come in for the Deeming Guide. They come in for the Unemployment Guide--not for themselves but for their children. Come and look at the `for sale' signs, the `for rent' signs and the `for lease' signs all around my electorate and the rest of the country. And do not tell me that interest rates have come down and how good a job you have done. They are still far higher than those of any of our competitors.'</PARA>
<PARA>  Many of the 6,000 small businesses in my electorate feed off larger projects--except, of course, that there are none. We have a critical need for industrial relations reform to sweep away those archaic work practices. We need tax reform. Before those opposite ask for the details, I can tell them that they will get them;  that is for certain. We need structural reform on the waterfront and in land transport. But all of those will give us benefits in time. </PARA>
<PARA>  The big opportunity for a faster payback comes in the resources sector where we can start to break the debt cycle much more quickly. As MPs we have the privilege of travelling around this country and we have seen a lot of those projects and opportunities--from Gove to Weipa to Port Hedland and all around the country--that are stalled at this moment. The Government is not helping business to develop those projects. It is building barriers. I will borrow a phrase from my colleague the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney): paralysis by analysis. There is no consistency of project evaluation criteria.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the 12 March statement the Prime Minister promised resource security legislation. Where is it?  Has anyone seen it?  Has the Minister seen it?  Of course no-one has. The schedule tells us that it might come in November. Six months after the Prime Minister's statement, we have not seen it at all--as usual, no action. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at some examples of the problems of this country in terms of stalled developments. I will not go into Coronation Hill;  my colleague the Leader of the National Party has already mentioned that. Let us talk about BHP Minerals. It has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in overseas projects in the last couple of years. This should send a message to the Government. Why has it gone overseas?  Why has it not invested here?  Obviously, we have cost problems and other problems here. But, if one talks to the managers of these companies, the main reason that they invest overseas becomes quite clear: it is the paralysis of the decision making process in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at CRA Ltd. It has developments stalled everywhere. It went into Indonesia and got a coalmining project up in very quick time, which is now competing with our own Australian black coal industry. We cannot afford to lose those sorts of investments, particularly not to lose them to countries that will then compete directly with us. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, the national joke, if it were not so sad and so serious, would be uranium. We do not get our fair share of that market. Of course, the rest of the world gets it. We have this Government's absurd three-mines policy, which has had the effect of transferring uranium production from Australia to Canada. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us talk about the VFT.  I am not going to talk about the route or the tax treatment; let us just look at it as an exercise in trying to get major projects off the ground. We had a consortium that spent tens of millions of dollars on a feasibility project for a major development that would provide ongoing jobs in construction and a ripple effect into other areas. That consortium had to deal with multiple levels of government--four separate governments. It had finance and tax issues, the environmental impact process, zoning and land acquisition and the regulatory framework. I might add that it is harder to get a project off the ground here in this country, with our States, than it is to get one off the ground in Europe with all its different nations. In the end, of course, it all became too hard, especially in the current economic climate, and the consortium had to walk away from it--another lost opportunity for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, this affects jobs in the metropolitan areas, where the vast bulk of our people live. We only have to go out to a lot of those remote areas and see the difficulties in which those people operate to understand that the engineering, technical and support needs are very considerable. Much of that support comes from the cities. My electorate is no different from many others. Many of the 6,000 companies in my electorate need those major development projects so they can sell the engineering parts, the oils and the lubricants, the foodstuffs, the computing support, the transport and so on. The knock-on effect in terms of wealth and jobs is significant indeed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, there are those who query the sustainability of resource development. `What about the environment?', they ask. So let us deal with that. We say unequivocally that we must have high environmental standards. We must spend money on the restoration of soils and mine sites, providing clean water and maintaining our parks. We must preserve our unique flora and fauna. We must establish targets in key areas, like soil conservation and biodiversity. In particular, we must aim to be the most reliable, cost efficient and technologically superior provider of natural resources possible. We need fast-track procedures so that major developments can go ahead. We need to establish requirements that cannot then be changed. We must encourage investment in Australia. We must create the economically sustainable jobs and the growth so necessary to restore our country. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, above all, we must, by adopting a positive approach to development, give some hope and vision for Australia's citizens. We need to return prosperity to young and old; and we need to provide the jobs so necessary to relieve the daily distress now being inflicted on Australians to such an extent that it is destroying the very fabric of our nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Opposition members had 25 minutes today in which to deal with the MPI and they failed the test and the challenge that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) put to them; that is, to name one micro-economic reform initiative in three decades of tory government. None of those on the other side of the House were able to come up with even one initiative that the tories instituted throughout 30 years of their government. I am not surprised because I am not aware of any initiative that the conservatives ever brought in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The tories gave us the tariff monkey on the back of farmers and manufacturers. They gave us an over-regulated dollar. They gave us a strategy that was more applicable to the nineteenth century. But what initiative did they give us?  Members opposite had 25 minutes to answer their own case, the case that they brought on with this MPI--and they failed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fundamental difference and the problem the Opposition has is understanding what development and resources are all about. It is not knocking down a building in the middle of the night, like the Nationals used to do in Queensland. It is not bulldozing down every sand-dune. It is actually getting the process right. We need transport and communications. We need harbour facilities. We need a low dollar, something which we instituted in the mid-1980s and which is now trading at some 20 per cent lower than it ever traded under the conservatives, so making our exports more competitive. We need micro-economic reform. We need to restructure the waterfront. All these issues we are addressing, and the reason it takes time is that it is not easy. If it were easy, someone would have waved a wand 50 years ago. But it took a Labor government in 1983 even to recognise that the problem existed and needed to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, we have heard the two speakers on the other side say `You need to fast track'. Let us look at what happened under a conservative government when it fast tracked. Three or four shady little characters in pin-striped suits would go to the Premier's Department in Queensland with a brown paper bag full of dough and they would get a fast track.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There are two important initiatives I would like to comment on which were touched on briefly by the Minister. One concerns an announcement by Associated Pulp and Paper Mills. The APPM went on to say, and I think honourable members on the other side would be interested to hear this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>As a result of the progress that has been made, we believe that we have now reached a stage where we can seek out partners to be involved in the project. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the APPM has confidence in the Government and it has confidence about getting on with the job. Resource security has now been endorsed by all State governments, and the Federal Government will be implementing that legislation in this coming session.  We have worked through a very hard and emotional process because there are people who are concerned about the environment, and they have a right to take part in the debate. But now we have a process that is in place that is going to work. But we are not going to have this fast track process where we have a brown paper bag and a few pin-striped mates in white shoes from the Gold Coast who will determine the way in which the resources of this country will be developed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another important factor in development and resources is the taxation system. It is interesting to note that the lowest level of tax is now 21 per cent, whereas it was 30 per cent under the conservatives. The top rate is now down to 47 per cent. Company tax is down to 39 per cent whereas, effectively, it was over 78 per cent prior to 1983. The Government has taken the tax monkey off the back of business, off the back of workers, so that they can become more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA>  What does the Opposition have to say about tax?  We have heard the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), and goodness knows why he wants to talk about a goods and services tax. He has about as much chance of selling that in the bush as he has of selling leprosy. But he is proposing to put a tax of 15 per cent on the retail price of all inputs right across the board, including services. That will devastate the resource sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  I get out in the bush and talk too, as the Leader of the National Party says he does. I can tell honourable members that there is no way any primary producer wants a tax of 15 per cent on the fruit and vegetables he sells, on the beef he sells or on anything else he sells in this country because, effectively, it means 15 per cent comes out of the market. That is what it means. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at tariffs. The Government across the board has brought down tariffs. Who does that benefit?  It benefits the mining industry; it benefits manufacturers. So, right across a broad range of initiatives we are putting the mechanisms in place so that we can be more productive and efficient. When it comes to manning levels and when it comes to the waterfront, instead of taking a backward step we are the ones who have taken the forward step. We have nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to the waterfront because we are addressing it. If we look at manning levels today, we can see that by 1992 we will be down to the level of the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, one of the difficulties with manning levels relates to the technology of the boats. Some old boats pre-Crawford, 1978, are not able, because of their technology, to bring down manning levels dramatically. They would simply run ashore or run into rocks. So it is all relevant to technology as well as restructuring. Of course, if we look at the tugs, we will have reduced by 1992 some 300 positions and have achieved a reduction of 25 per cent for tug crewing in harbours. Again, that has been a massive cost for the export sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another interesting point is foreign investment. As the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) mentioned at Question Time, the National Party has two policies: one down here when its members try to sound like statesmen, and one back home in the bush where the voodoo economics and the League of Rights come out--the Ku Klux Klan without bed sheets, the blokes who run the preselection process for the Nationals. They are against foreign investment because it suits them back home. They attack anyone</PARA>
<PARA>who wants to invest in this country to give us a bit more capital. But down here, they try to sound like statesmen, saying we need foreign investment. This Government has set in process a Foreign Investment Review Board to manage and monitor the way in which foreign capital comes into this country. It is a sensible approach, and it is a part of the whole development of a resource sector.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am basically saying that it is that process, a broad ranging and complex process, that helps to develop projects in this country, not something that is done with a knee-jerk reaction simply by saying, `There is a tree, cut it down; there is an animal, shoot it'. That is the redneck, hillbilly attitude of the National Party. It is something that does not work; it has not worked in the past and it will not work now. </PARA>
<PARA>  The important thing is that we are now in a global economy and it has been this Government that has brought us into a global economy. If we are going to be competitive and develop our resources, we can only do so in competition with other nations. It is disappointing that every time we try to restructure to be efficient and to be effective it is the conservatives--particularly the National Party--that oppose it, particularly with tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA>  The National Party opposed sugar tariff cuts. There are dozens of press releases. They say things such as `Tariff cutback hurts growers' and `Nationals split on backing tariff cut'. It is the best thing that ever happened to the sugar industry because it has given us a bit more effectiveness and competition. But it has also given us an edge in the GATT to get the tariffs and subsidies down overseas, because 80 per cent of our product is sold overseas. Of course, that is something that the Nationals have failed to understand or recognise. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another important initiative of this Government, through the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths)--and I applaud him--has been to continue the exemption from excise on petrol produced from approved shale oil demonstration plants. This has given an opportunity for the great shale oil project just north of Gladstone to go ahead. This initiative affects my electorate. If it goes ahead, it means thousands of jobs for central Queensland and for my electorate. I certainly do not need any yuppie on the other side of the House to tell me about the hopes and aspirations of the working men and women of this country or what opportunities are in place regarding the resources sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was the Minister for Resources who led the charge in this regard, and even in tough economic times he was able to convince Cabinet to make this concession, to give a shot in the arm to the resource sector. The confidence that has flowed through as a consequence of that has been fantastic--not just here but overseas in the international community. It is unfortunate that not enough people on the other side actually read what other people and other nations say about us. A lot of positive things are happening and it is a pity that it is the `poor, pitiful me' propositions that are put up by those in the National Party because they have nothing else to put up. It is no wonder that they are negative. People who read the papers will know that their biggest branch is in Boggo Road; it is growing every day. </PARA>
<PARA>  The National Party is opposing daylight saving, something that will help the tourist industry, something that will help the commercial sector, so we in Queensland will not be one hour behind when making a phone call to Melbourne. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Student Assistance Amendment Bill (No. 2) seeks to make three minor changes to the Student Assistance Act 1973. The Act gives the legislative basis for the Austudy scheme and provides a debt management regime for the other student assistance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>Appropriations clause</PARA>
<PARA>  Student assistance schemes are demand driven, with the overall expenditure depending on the number of full time students applying for assistance. It is therefore more appropriate to provide a special appropriations clause in the Student Assistance Act than to deal with the schemes through the normal appropriation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Accordingly, the Bill proposes to insert a section into the Student Assistance Act to appropriate the funds needed to pay allowances under the Austudy, Abstudy and assistance for isolated children schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>Cocos (Keeling) Islands</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will also extend the application of the Austudy scheme to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. This reflects the move to normalise the application of Australian laws to the territory, including the phasing in of normal income tax arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Living allowances for English as a second language scheme</PARA>
<PARA>  A third measure in the Bill concerns the living allowances for English as a second language scheme. This is a small scheme which provides living allowances to migrants undertaking Commonwealth funded courses in English as a second language at TAFE colleges. About 1,400 students were assisted in 1990 at a cost of approximately $3.7m. </PARA>
<PARA>  From 1 July 1991, the scheme has been integrated into the social security payment system, though the scheme is included as a separate budgetary item in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>  In view of the new arrangements, it is no longer appropriate for the debt management regime for the scheme to be provided for under the Student Assistance Act and the Act will be amended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial impact</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will have no significant financial impact on overall expenditure. The extension of Austudy to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is expected to cost about $20,000 a year. The other provisions are cost neutral and involve improved arrangements for paying the same amount of assistance to students. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The need for the International Monetary Fund (Quota Increase and Agreement Amendments) Bill arises from Australia's participation in a consensus of members of the International Monetary Fund for a general increase in quotas and a strengthening of measures available against members which are in arrears to the IMF. </PARA>
<PARA>  The first purpose of the Bill is to enable Australia to increase its quota in the IMF. The second and minor purpose is to amend schedule 1 of the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947, the principal Act, when an amendment of the IMF's articles of agreement comes into effect, since that schedule reproduces the IMF's articles. </PARA>
<PARA>  A country's quota in the IMF represents its financial subscription and determines its rights to draw other currencies in times of need, its voting power as a member, and its share in any allocations of special drawing rights (SDRs) which may be made by the IMF. </PARA>
<PARA>  From time to time the members of the IMF together review the size of quotas, in aggregate and for members individually. They do so in the light of developments in the world economy and the international monetary system, changes in the relative economic position of members and, related to these factors, expected demands on the IMF's resources. Last year, in what was called the ninth general review of quotas, the IMF's board of governors approved a resolution proposing a set of increases in quotas which would raise their aggregate level by 50 per cent to the equivalent of $A230 billion. The increases proposed for individual members vary around the average increase of 50 per cent, the variation being essentially the result of an updated economic ranking of IMF members. The increase proposed for Australia is some 44 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  The set of quota increases will come into effect before 31 December 1991 if members accounting for at least 85 per cent of existing quotas consent to their proposed increases before that date. They must also accept the set of amendments to the Fund's articles of agreement, called the third amendment, since that has been made a condition of the quota increase. The nearness of these changes makes it appropriate for the House to consider this Bill early in the current sitting. </PARA>
<PARA>  Quotas in the IMF are expressed in numbers of special drawing rights or SDRs, since the SDR is the IMF's unit of account. The proposed increase in Australia's quota is from SDR 1,619.2 million, around $2,800 million, to SDR 2,333.2 million, $4,000 million. The Bill authorises both the giving of Australia's consent to the increase and the appropriation needed to pay for it. However, I would point out to honourable members that payment of Australia's quota increase would have no budgetary implications as it is a financing or `below-the-line' transaction. </PARA>
<PARA>  The method of payment is provided for in the IMF articles of agreement and the ninth quota review resolution approved by the board of governors. Seventy-five per cent of the additional quota subscription will be paid in Australian dollars and the remainder in SDRs and foreign currency. </PARA>
<PARA>  Clause 6 of the Bill allows the Australian dollar component of the increase in Australia's quota to be paid in the form of a non-negotiable and non-interest bearing security. The foreign currency and SDRs required to pay the balance of the increase will be purchased from the Reserve Bank. Clause 7 of the Bill authorises an appropriation for the purpose of acquiring that foreign currency, while the SDRs will be purchased under the standing appropriation of subsection 5a(6) of the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  This purchase of foreign currency and SDRs from the Reserve Bank will be a financing transaction, with no effect on Budget outlays or the Budget outcome. The issue of the non-negotiable, non-interest bearing security will have no effect on the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Such a security is a promise to pay the IMF in Australian dollars in the event that the IMF should need more of our currency than it presently holds. In that event, which past experience indicates is unlikely, there would be a call on the Consolidated Revenue Fund, but again no effect on Budget outlays or the Budget outcome. </PARA>
<PARA>  In consenting to Australia's quota increase now, we shall help to augment the IMF's financial resources. These resources have been placed under considerable pressure by the drawings made by member countries since the last general review of quotas some seven years ago. The increase in quotas will enlarge the amounts of currency which the IMF is able to call upon from members in relatively strong external positions. </PARA>
<PARA>  That will enable the IMF to continue to provide temporary balance of payments assistance to members in weak external positions, and thereby to promote a stable international monetary system. This stability is undoubtedly in Australia's interests. By supporting the quota increase, we shall also increase Australia's drawing rights as well as protecting our voting power and our entitlement to any future allocation of SDRs. </PARA>
<PARA>  I move now to a brief explanation of the second purpose of this Bill;  that of amending schedule 1 of the principal Act to reflect a probable change in the IMF's articles of agreement. In so doing, I refer the House's attention to part 3 of the Bill. The members of the IMF, through the board of governors, have agreed upon a set of amendments to the IMF's articles of agreement, known as the third amendment. The amendments are designed to strengthen the IMF's capacity for dealing with persistently uncooperative members in arrears to it. The costs of arrears are carried jointly by the IMF's debtors and creditors through adjustments to the rates at which the IMF charges and remunerates them respectively. Australia has shared in these costs. At the time of the IMF's most recent review of its arrears on 30 April 1991, nine members had accumulated the equivalent of more that US$5.7 billion in overdue obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>  The strengthening of the IMF's capacity represented by these amendments is intended to discourage members from falling into arrears, and to encourage those already in arrears to cooperate with the IMF in clearing their arrears. Under this set of amendments to the IMF's articles:</PARA>
<PARA>.  the suspension of voting and associated rights of members in arrears would be a compulsory step interposed between a declaration of ineligibility and compulsory withdrawal;</PARA>
<PARA>.  a 70 per cent majority of the executive board would be required to impose or terminate such a suspension;</PARA>
<PARA>.  a suspended member would lose the right to vote in any organ of the Fund, on most amendments to the articles and in elections of officials;</PARA>
<PARA>.  the governor and alternate governor of a suspended member would immediately cease to hold office;  and</PARA>
<PARA>.  the executive director representing a suspended member would lose office though, if also representing other non-suspended members, would be eligible for re-election by those other members. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia can be expected to benefit directly under the amendment to the extent that there would be a diminution of the arrears problem and therefore lower costs to be borne by other members. Indirectly, Australia and other members are likely to benefit from a stronger IMF which can obtain more consistent adherence by members to their obligations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia has already accepted this set of amendments to the articles through the treaty making power vested in the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade as authorised by the Governor-General in Council. The amendments will come into effect when they have been accepted by the required number of members. This is likely to occur before the end of 1991. Since the IMF's articles of agreement are reproduced in schedule 1 of the principal Act, part 3 of this Bill amends schedule 1 in a parallel fashion. Clause 2 provides for commencement of that part by proclamation when the amendment of the IMF's articles has come into effect. I commend this Bill to the House and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Opposition supports the motion that has been moved by the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) on behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Price). There are two parts to this motion, as I understand it. The first is in relation to annual reports. The proposal is that automatically, when annual reports of departments are tabled, those annual reports will be referred to the appropriate House committees, and then it is a matter for the committees to decide whether or not some action is necessary. For example, the committees could decide to conduct some kind of inquiry into the activities of a department or a particular activity of a department. The Opposition believes that this is a step in the right direction. It will provide an automatic arrangement for the House committees to look at the activities of the various government departments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The point that I was concerned about when this was first brought to my notice has been taken care of. I was concerned initially that this might preclude a Minister's moving that the House take note of a report, which motion provides an opportunity for debate in the House. I am assured by the Clerks that this is not the case and that in fact there will be an opportunity now for committees to look at the reports while, at the same time, the House still has an opportunity to do so. </PARA>

The amendment to the Sessional Orders relating to the appointment of committees is certainly appropriate. I would like to thank the Government and Mr Speaker for the recognition of the problem and the very rapid solution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As currently framed, the Sessional Orders do not provide for the possibility of any disagreement within the Government and Opposition ranks on nominations to a committee. The Sessional Orders effectively assume that all interests in this House are represented by the two blocs--Government and Opposition--and that is a wrong assumption. Because the Sessional Orders are based on this wrong assumption, my recent nomination for membership of the Select Committee on the Print Media was frustrated. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not the case that all members sitting on the Opposition side of the House are subject to the discipline of the Opposition Whip, whether on the issue of nominations to a committee or anything else. The motion would amend the Sessional Orders to require the Opposition Whip to consult on nominations with any minority group or non- government member and, in the event of disagreement, the Speaker has to be notified and the matter brought before the House. To be completely consistent, the motion should provide for the same procedure to be observed by the Government Whip. However, that is another matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  I certainly do not anticipate making frequent use of the new provisions. However, I certainly welcome the amendment as a small step towards the reassertion of the role of this House as a true House of Representatives--and I stress the word `Representatives'--rather than just a rubber stamp for the parties. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on rice produced in Australia to raise funds for a research and development program for the rice industry. This has been requested by the Ricegrowers Association of Australia on behalf of New South Wales rice growers and on behalf of the Queensland Rice Marketing Board, which represents Queensland rice growers. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government will provide funding to match industry levies up to 0.5 per cent of the annual gross value of production in line with established policy of encouraging increased rural productivity and profitability through research and the commercialisation of research findings. The Government's rural research and development policy, which encourages increased contributions by primary industry, was established by the Government in February 1985 and reaffirmed in the May 1989 Government statement, Research Innovation and Competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian rice industry consists of a temperate industry located in New South Wales, producing about 95 per cent of total production and a tropical industry located in Queensland. The industry produces around 800,000 to 900,000 tonnes of paddy rice per year, with a gross value of production in 1989-90 of $148m. About 85 to 90 per cent of production is exported to around 30 countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  Domestically, sales--including value adding--exceed $60m. There is significant value adding involved, with the industry packaging and marketing its own branded product. The rice industry has a major commitment to research in order to maintain its competitive export and domestic marketing position. Research has, in the past, been funded primarily by growers with Commonwealth grant assistance also provided from the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, RIRDC. </PARA>
<PARA>  The establishment of a joint Commonwealth-industry scheme will broaden the industry's research funding base and assist in enabling the industry to achieve its full potential. The levy will apply to those varieties included in the schedule to the Bill but with provision for new varieties to be added and for varieties no longer produced to be deleted. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under current industry research funding arrangements, both the New South Wales and Queensland rice industries fund research on a budget allocation basis. That is, the industry agrees on the total amount of contribution before the start of each financial year and, in fact, before the greater proportion of rice is harvested. This ensures a reliable flow of funds to the research program, whereas a volume based funding system would have reflected the swings in production which have occurred over the last few years. For example, production fell from 923,000 tonnes in 1989-90 to a forecast 726,000 in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>  This arrangement will continue under the new scheme. In practice then, the operative levy rate per tonne will be determined following the decision by industry on the level of its bulk contribution. This rate will be calculated towards the end of the harvest but before the start of the financial year, when production can be accurately determined. </PARA>
<PARA>  The industry may determine different rates for different rice varieties to account for differing research requirements in each season but cannot determine a rate of more than $2 per tonne. Once the industry has determined a rate or rates, the Minister will be advised and will set those rates and have them published in the Gazette. The levy rate will be set by subordinate legislation because timing is tight between setting the rates of the levies and the first payment of levies. The levy will be collected from pool returns at the end of the season for the research program of the following year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The levy will be payable by the grower and its collection will be in accordance with the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. Amounts equal to the levy and the Commonwealth's matching contribution will be paid into a separate sub-account under the management of the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. Based on the current level of funding by the industry, in some years its contribution will be greater than 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production, which is the maximum the Commonwealth will match for funding purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is expected that total levy collections will remain constant from one year to the next, or perhaps increase slightly. The cost to the Budget, in terms of Commonwealth matching expenditure, is expected to be $570,000 per annum in 1991-92 to 1994-95. The Bill will come into force on royal assent and the levy will be imposed on rice produced and delivered to the processor after that time. It is intended that the levy will be imposed on rice produced in the 1991-92 season and the research program under this arrangement will commence in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA>  On behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Opposition parties support the Honey Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill, the Honey Levy (No. 2) Amendment Bill and the Honey Export Charge Amendment Bill. The honey industry is a very small industry compared to the great rural industries of Australia--the wool, beef, wheat and dairy industries. Nevertheless, it is a very valuable and efficient industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Using the 1989-90 figures, because the annual reports containing the relevant production figures for 1990-91 are not yet available, Australia generally produces 22,000 to 24,000 tonnes of honey a year. There are about 800 beekeepers. Australia exports over half that production--12,000 to 13,000 tonnes--and gained export income of $16m to $17m. Those exports went mainly to the United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore, the United States and Japan. Beeswax was also exported. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia is a small producer by world standards. According to the 1989-90 annual report of the Australian Honey Board, world production was 690,000 tonnes, with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics easily the largest producer with 225,000 tonnes. China was second largest producer with 180,000 tonnes and Australia was the eighth largest producer. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia has certain natural advantages in the production of honey. We have long hours of sunshine and a great selection of nectar- laden native trees that have the ability to produce honey in an array, flavour and quality as good as or better than anywhere else in the world. Unfortunately, the Australian industry is not yet taking full advantage of this asset. We sell too much bulk rather than branded products. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Honey Board believes that the future prosperity of the Australian honey industry rests with its ability to recognise and pursue the unmatched marketing opportunities presented by these varieties and an ability to produce to high, objective quality standards. Traditionally, Australian honey has been valued on colour and viscosity regardless of source--a practice that ignores its many other distinct attributes and limits its potential to command higher prices and increase consumer demand. This type of marketing has led to a decline in real incomes for Australia's honey producers. </PARA>
<PARA>  When honey is sold in bulk it must sell at whatever the world price is for bulk honey because we have only a very small percentage--about 4 per cent--of the world trade. So we certainly are not the price setters for the international market. Therefore, it is of considerable importance for the future benefit and prosperity of our honey producers that they move to a brand of product which can command and maintain that better price in a difficult marketing situation. That means that there is a need for promotion and research and development. Hence this particular piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the present time the honey industry is paying a levy of 0.45c per kilogram of honey for research and development. The standard dollar for dollar arrangements have been basically bipartisan for many years, and go back well before the 1985 legislation. I refer to the points made by the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) when he introduced the Rice Levy Bill earlier, because it is a similar type of legislation. We talk about such legislation a lot in this place because of all the different rural industries that have these levies. I think there are 20 or 22 and rice is an additional one. It is good to see the rice industry moving in that direction, although it means a lot of legislation. I think there might be a case, once again on a bipartisan basis, for looking at how the legislation could be simplified or rationalised, not in any way to remove the individual ability of the industries but to streamline the legislative process here. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last year the industry provided $129,000, and that was matched by the Commonwealth. The Federal Council of Australian Apiarists Associations wants to increase the maximum level beyond the 0.5c per kilogram to 0.75c--and that is the purpose of this Bill--so that it can increase the operative level from the present 0.45c to 0.52c per kilogram in order to maintain the research and development process. That will also get it closer to the maximum set by the Government, which seems to me to be a sensible goal. All of these rural industries have a maximum level of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production at the present time, while the actual levy or operative rate is about 0.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  The last annual report of the Honeybee Research Council was for 1989-90. It has since been replaced by the Honeybee Research and Development Council, which is in line with the Government's policy. I note that we will be presented during this debate with some figures for the financial year just ended. Certainly having those figures will add to the debate because it is better for us to have the up-to-date figures. Where possible, when the Government is introducing legislation of this type, it would be helpful to have the most recent information attached to it so that we can gain a better understanding. I have here the 1989-90 figures, although I know they are now out of date. I have just been presented with a copy of the later figures for approval for incorporation. That is sensible, but there is no time to look at them in detail. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are some questions that arise concerning the operation of the Research Council and the expenditure of money. Firstly, it appears that a high percentage of the total expenditure of the Council has been spent on administration. If possible, it would be better if we could be provided with a better break-down of those figures and also of the total expenditures. Additional figures I have for 1990-91 show that $77,000 was spent on administration, which is 23 per cent of total revenue--a very high percentage.</PARA>
<PARA>  I understand that that figure comes down to 18 per cent when a workshop that was conducted, and considered to be worth while, is removed. I would then suggest that the people who present the figures would be wise to exclude those costs, where there is some form of legitimate activity that should be under research and development, from expenses or administration because it conveys the wrong message. It conveys the message that there is a body which is top-heavy and that the money of the beekeepers of Australia, the honey producers, is not getting through for the purpose intended. </PARA>
<PARA>  I make the same comment on the figure of $55,576 for directors' fees and expenses. That is a pretty exorbitant percentage when compared with the total revenue of $343,424. I am told that that amount includes $14,694 for that same workshop. If it was a workshop for the industry, once again it would be better if it were excluded. That then brings directors' fees and expenses down to around $36,000. That certainly looks a better figure. I am saying that there should be some work done in this area. It may be evident in the 1990-91 report--when we have had a chance to look at these figures--that it is presented in a better way. It is important that the taxpayers of Australia can see--if they care to look--that their dollar for dollar contribution has been wisely spent and spent in the area that it should be, and that the apiarists are also relaxed because their money is being efficiently spent. </PARA>
<PARA>  It raises the question, for some of the smaller industries: what is the best way to have these research arrangements so that the dollar for dollar arrangement continues?  That is important. It means that that industry is contributing for research when many non-rural industries in Australia do nothing for research, and that there is some stability in the dollar for dollar basis with the Government. In good times or bad times, that rural industry provides the money. It is a very valuable concept which I believe we should maintain. I am saying that for the smaller industries there may be more efficient ways of delivery. I know there is the general Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, and I understand the honey people are becoming part of that. But is there included in the figures, as distinct from their own costs, the cost of membership or shared overhead costs of that board or body? If there is, what is it and how efficient is that total arrangement? That would certainly help me to gain a better understanding of the costs and benefits of this type of arrangement for the honey industry and, from that, other similarly sized industries. </PARA>
<PARA>  Perhaps when this other document is presented we will be able to see that in greater detail. If it is not there, then when the Minister is replying he may be able to answer. I put those as genuine questions as a supporter of the industry. A percentage of the industry is in my electorate. We have some very good honey coming out of northern Victoria because of the different trees that are there--box honey and so forth. I have a desire to see this industry strengthened because it is one which has a natural advantage in Australia. In the future it should be able to become a bigger and better industry in the sense of not only providing more in quantity but also being able to upgrade its quality image and maximise its return in the market. As I said earlier, we support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am pleased to support the Honey Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill, the Honey Levy (No. 2) Amendment Bill and the Honey Export Charge Amendment Bill. Honey is important to New South Wales because that State produces about 43 per cent of Australia's honey. It is important in the electorate of Eden-Monaro and south-eastern New South Wales because a high proportion of New South Wales honey is produced in that area. I appreciate that many honey producers are nomadic in their existence and quite frequently move around the State and the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The legislation will allow for more funding for research and development on honey and on honeybees. The Federal Council of the Australian Apiarists Associations endorsed an increase in the operative rate, which requires an increase in the maximum levy rate and that is what we are doing today. The Council requested an increase for R&amp; funding to 0.75c per kilogram. An increase is needed for research, and I compliment the Government, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the industry on reaching the agreement leading to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Honeybee Research and Development Council has the vested funds to administer a shoestring budget of $350,000, including Commonwealth matching contributions. I believe that the five member council and Anne Kowalski, the executive officer, are to be complimented on the management of those funds. I appreciate that the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has queried the 1990- 91 budget of the Honeybee Research and Development Council and I acknowledge that listing needs to be carefully made. In fact, the 1991-92 Budget indicates a reasonably high percentage being spent on research and development. As the honourable member for Murray has said, the designations need to be properly appropriated. The Council has said that $286,000 of the $350,000 has been spent on projects, workshops and reviews--that is 81.5 per cent of its budget. That seems to me to be pretty good. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at the priorities of the Honeybee Research and Development Council through its annual operational plan. There are 14 projects, of which five relate to nutrition and disease. These are not only important to honey production, but are vital to agricultural crops. There are paid and incidental pollination services available which assist farmers throughout this nation. The work of the honey producers is very important to other people involved in agriculture throughout the country. Increasing numbers of farmers and growers are appreciating the advisability of using honeybees. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some of those projects involve techniques for the control of the American brood disease, work on diseases and disorders of the queen honeybees, investigation on oxytetracycline in honey and on workshops and work on pollination. For instance, the University of Queensland at Gatton, which has a great record in apiculture, is being provided with part funds for a project on the results of foraging in entomophilous crops. Pesticide monitoring is also important. We need to maintain the high standards that we have. I understand that the Council is considering</PARA>
<PARA>research on pesticide monitoring. Honey is seen as a natural product, rich in essential minerals, and the Council wants to keep that reputation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The bee-breeding programs will keep going until 1994. This gives a very real opportunity for providing beekeepers with quality stock. As well as that, there is expenditure which will lead to better production in other ways. For instance, the Council is looking at the problems associated with loss or potential loss of useful nectar and pollen sources in the Ngarkat Conservation Park in South Australia. There is an investigation on banksia for that purpose. It is expected that there will be increasing demands on the nectar and pollen sources which could become a decreasing resource. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have with me a table of expenditure of the Honeybee Research and Development Council, which indicates research totalling $286,000 for 1991-92, Council expenses totalling $20,000, and administration totalling $44,000. I believe that is a reasonable breakdown of expenditure. The Council should be complimented on achieving that during this financial year. I seek leave to incorporate the table of expenditure of the Honeybee Research and Development Council in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Council also looks for development opportunities for Australian honey. The Honey Board, a statutory authority operating on a small budget, currently about $500,000, is also involved in development opportunities; for instance, domestic promotion, overseas promotion in conjunction with importers, the licensing of exporters, setting the minimum export price and the provision of an information service. The previous Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the present Treasurer (Mr Kerin), stated that the Honey Board could continue to operate until 11 May 1994. However, I understand that the Federal Council of the Australian Apiarists Associations accepts that the Board should wind up eventually and requests that the Board be terminated earlier, by 31 December 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government now has to consider whether to incorporate the Board into the Australian Horticultural Corporation, a larger umbrella organisation, or get out of marketing altogether. The industry could become a larger cooperative. Admittedly, the present cooperative is fairly large with 60 per cent of producers now in the Honey Corporation of Australia, which produces the Capilano brand of honey. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian export of bulk honey has reached 13,000 tonnes a year, with our principal markets being in the United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore and Spain. As the Deputy Leader of the National Party said, it would be better if that bulk honey was exported as prepacked honey. That fact makes our industry very important, and we do send prepacked honey to Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, for instance. Our honey represents about one per cent of the world trade and we need to compete, along with many other primary industries, with prices in other countries. The United States has its price support scheme and the European Community has its ad valorem tariffs on imports of up to 27 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is a $35m industry in Australia. New South Wales is the main producing State and the electorate of Eden-Monaro produces a significant proportion of that 43 per cent of Australian honey. I am delighted that there is overall support for this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am pleased to be able to speak on the Honey Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill, the Honey Levy (No. 2) Amendment Bill and the Honey Export Charge Amendment Bill because it is a very important industry throughout my electorate. The industry wants this legislation. It is good to see that it recognises the importance of research. I have a large number of beekeepers throughout my electorate. The Bendigo-Maryborough area in central Victoria is a focus for the beekeeping industry. There is a large industry in Maryborough which trades under the name of Capilano Honey. I am sure that it would be well known to honourable members in this chamber;  the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) may even have visited that plant at some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If the Minister has not visited that plant, I am sure an invitation will be forthcoming to him to visit it. It is an employer of 30 people in Maryborough and a lot of its product goes for export. This is very important from Australia's point of view. During 1989-90 Australia exported 12,637 tonnes of honey, with an f.o.b. value of $16.4m. One of the biggest years we had was in 1988-89 when we shipped 13,502 tonnes of honey in bulk out of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of Australia's advantages in producing honey is that it has long hours of sunshine and a great selection of nectar-laden trees--particularly native trees--and those two factors combine to produce honey in an array, flavour and quality unmatched in the world. I have had the opportunity to experience the taste of many of these varieties of honey, as has the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), who enjoys it also. We have here a very good export earner for Australia, if only we can develop this market fully. We can take advantage of exporting brand name products rather than exporting in bulk. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Capilano name is becoming better known worldwide. I believe that, if we add further value to the honey product, we will see a greater export market for Australian honeys, particularly into the near Asian market and the market in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that, traditionally, Australian honey has been valued on colour and viscosity, regardless of the source--a practice that ignores many other distinct attributes and limits its potential to command higher prices and increase consumer demand. There are some pretty big markets to the near east of Australia that we should be developing. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think that the background to this legislation is very important, and I will quote from the Honey Research Council annual report 1989-90, put out by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. It is important that the base for this is established. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Rural Industries Research Act 1985, provides funding, administrative and organisational arrangements for rural research trust funds and councils. The arrangements provide for council members (other than the chairman and government member) to be selected against objective selection criteria by an independent selection committee. </PARA>
<PARA>I am delighted to say that I have a representative who lives very close to my electorate, Mr Robert McDonald, who is a member of the Honey Research Council. He is a commercial apiarist and comes from Castlemaine. He is a member of the Australian Honey Board as well as the Honey Research Council and has a very great knowledge of the honey industry. </PARA>

<PARA>Councils are required to prepare five-year research and development plans and annual programs in consultation with the industry and research organisations. They are also required to prepare an annual report which provides industry and government with information on, and an assessment of, the operations of the council. The arrangements provide significantly increased autonomy and responsibility for research councils. </PARA>
<PARA>The objectives of its research are very important. It gives very good value for the dollars it spends on research. It has done some extremely good research projects and obtains extremely good value for the dollars spent on those research projects. I will quote a couple of them. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honey research projects 1989-90, priority area 1, `Bee nutrition and disease' was a very important program. It only received $2,600 in funding. Its purpose was:</PARA>
<PARA>To evaluate the quality of honey bee collected pollens so as to assist in the honey bee nutritional management. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to say that it also had a project on diseases and disorders of the queen honeybee. Its objective was:</PARA>
<PARA>To determine the types of diseases and disorders affecting all life stages of the queen honey bee and to ascertain the causes and possible control of those diseases and disorders determined to be most severe or common. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues with another project on the evaluation of the spread and present and future pest status of the European wasp, which is a potentially significant economic threat to honeybees and honey production in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honey industry is a very decentralised industry. It mainly comprises small apiarists who travel long distances. They are mainly small producers and sell their honey to people like Capilano at Maryborough. They are experiencing great difficulty with the cost of fuel. Most of them are small operators, as I have said, and the cost of petrol over recent times, which has seen an escalation fluctuating through the 60c range up to the 80c range per litre, has been a significant factor in the viability of the small apiarists in collecting honey. Much of that honey ultimately finds its way onto world markets. </PARA>
<PARA>  The previous Federal primary industries Minister, now the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), recently confirmed that the value of honeybees to the Australian economy exceeds $800m per annum. This includes honey and beeswax products and pollination to other forms of agriculture. The Honey Corporation of Australia, which is the trading name for Capilano at Maryborough, employs 30 people on a full time basis. When we take into account the large number of small apiarists who operate in the forests and throughout central Victoria and southern New South Wales, we see that there are a great number of people involved in this industry. It is very important that something be done to assist them in relation to the cost of fuel. It is one of the major costs associated with their industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  Apiarists believe that they are contributing to the economic well-being of this country by gaining valuable export dollars with the sale of honey overseas and also by providing it to the local domestic market. I have had correspondence at various times from Mr Trevor Tonkin, the President of the Central Victorian Apiarists Association. He raised this issue of the high cost of fuel and the detrimental impact that it is having on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the areas that has been underestimated and neglected in Australian agriculture is the value of bees as pollinators. There is quite a bit of research being done in this area regarding the pollination services sector of the Australian beekeeping industry. Currently, it has been undertaking an economic evaluation of that. One of the components of the study was the estimate of the social contribution of honeybee pollination. Honeybees pollinate a diversity of crops, pasture species and even private gardens. Most of this pollination is unremunerated, although it is of significant value to all sections of society. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is particularly good to be in Canberra at this time of the year when the Floriade festival is being held. We are able to see the wonderful display of flowers here and know that the bee population is out there working on behalf of Australia and gaining export dollars. I am encouraged by that. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the preliminary results of the Honey Research Council's survey, which forms part of its study, would place the social value of the pollination market at between $600m and $1.2 billion. The results of this part of the project have already been widely reported. There is much more to be gained on the export market, as I mentioned earlier, by doing more for value adding to the product. I have heard the Minister at the table, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), talking about value adding to products. I hope that he will give the Council every encouragement to continue its research. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased to be able to support this Bill which he has brought before the House. I trust that he will be able to give greater encouragement to the apiarists who perform this valuable role and particularly to the processors. I hope that he will encourage them to diversify and add value and will give them marketing encouragement overseas so that they are able to market under brand names specific types of honey collected from specific areas of our native vegetation which gives Australian honeys such a distinctive flavour on world markets. I believe that a bit of marketing in South East Asia would considerably increase the capacity of Australia to export into those areas and would establish a much larger export market than we already have. With those few remarks, I am pleased to support the legislation before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There are three Bills being debated cognately today--the Honey Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill 1991, the Honey Levy (No. 2) Amendment Bill 1991 and the Honey Export Charge Amendment Bill 1991. It is pleasing that both sides of the House support these amending Bills. The purpose of these Bills is to amend the Honey Levy Act (No. 1) 1962, the Honey Levy Act (No. 2) 1962 and the Honey Export Charge Act 1973 to provide for an increase in the maximum rate of the levy for research and development purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This is in line with amendments in many other fields of primary industry where leaders in those fields are requesting the Government to expand levies to spend more money on research and development. It is one of the positive aspects of agriculture. It indicates that, even in tough times such as this, there is a recognition of the need to spend money in R&amp;. If we are going to be competitive in the real global economy we live in, that is the main game. It is pleasing to see that the industry itself has requested the Government to move in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA>  To give some background, the Bills cover, respectively, levy imposed on honey produced in Australia and sold as honey, levy imposed on honey produced in Australia and used in manufacture and an export charge on honey exported and not already levied. The levy charge is used to fund the operations of the Honeybee Research and Development Council in accordance with the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Honey Levy Act (No. 1) 1962, the Honey Levy Act (No. 2) 1962 and the Honey Export Charge Act 1973 set the maximum levy charge rate, while the operative rate is set by regulation. The maximum rate is currently set at 0.5c per kilogram for research and development, with the operative rate also set at 0.5c per kilogram. As I have said, the Federal Council of Australian Apiarists Associations, the FCAAA, the recognised body representing levy payers, has endorsed an increase in the operative rate to 0.52c per kilogram, which is not possible unless the current maximum levy rate is increased. The FCAAA has requested that the maximum allowable levy rate for research and development purposes be increased to 0.75c per kilogram to facilitate further increases as part of its program for progressively increasing its contribution to R&amp;. </PARA>
<PARA>  Basically, increasing the maximum rate will give industry the flexibility to increase the contributions to research over an extended period and thus avoid the need for frequent amendments to legislation every 12 months or so. That is very sensible. I commend the industry for that. The amendment to increase the maximum rate of levy for research purposes is consistent with the Government's objective of encouraging rural industries to increase their contributions to research to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production. The Commonwealth matches the industry levies for funding expenditures on research and development up to 0.5 per cent of GVP. The Australian honey industry is currently contributing approximately 0.4 per cent of its GVP to research and development. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia produces annually approximately 25,000 to 28,000 tonnes of honey, valued at approximately $35m. As the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) pointed out, it has a broader aspect than that because the humble little bee has a massive impact on horticulture, in my area in particular. It is interesting to note that this afternoon the speakers in this debate come from many States, including Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. This industry is widespread. The contribution overall that the honeybee makes to agriculture is much larger. I think it is estimated at something like $1 billion in total value at the very least. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are approximately 2,000 apiarists producing commercial quantities of honey and some 30 to 40 packers and exporters. As I have said, apiaries are located all around Australia. Domestic consumption amounts to around 15,000 tonnes of the crop. Consumption has been static at around 0.9 kilograms per head in recent years. There is an increasing trend to floral species of honey rather than blends. Prices have been volatile but increased in 1990-91 to return about $1.25 per kilogram to producers, which we can regard as moderate. I would like to see it a little higher but there have been moderate returns. The Federal Council of Australian Apiarists Associations, through its State affiliated bodies, represents the bulk of producers. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia exports between 12,000 and 13,000 tonnes per annum, either in bulk--which accounts for about 90 per cent--or in pre-packed form. Our principal markets are the UK, Germany, Singapore and Spain for bulk honey and Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for pre-packed honey. That indicates that there are still small market niches in the EEC. While we see the Europeans as a massive trade bloc--which they are--corrupting world markets, we have to try to get every market niche that is available. If we are able to get honey into these markets and if we are able to get another product into these markets, we have to work hard at it and, while we are still in the main game, try to get some sense through the GATT. We represent about one per cent of world trade. Clearly, Australia is a price taker. World production of honey is about one million tonnes per annum. The major producers are China, USSR, the United States, Mexico and Argentina. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Honeybee Research and Development Council was established on 2 July 1990 under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, although it has existed previously with slightly reduced functions as the Honey Research Council. The HRDC is a subsidiary, although relatively autonomous, body under the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The majority of issues in these Bills have been canvassed. I think another speaker wishes to speak on this Bill before the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) resumes. I would like to say that, while the honey industry is small, it is a very important industry. I emphasise the role that bees play, not only in producing honey for Australia but in horticulture. Bee-keeping is one of the most ancient of primary industries, going back thousands of years. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) made an important comment about the ongoing need to ensure that chemicals do not get into the whole process of producing honey, whether it be through aerial spraying or drift. Bees are very susceptible. One producer in my area lost all his hives because of a problem with aerial spraying. Someone who was spraying a crop of another type inadvertently wiped out his bees. That is a problem that we need to address at all times. Bees are very susceptible to chemicals, particularly pesticides. I commend the Bills to the House. It is pleasing that both sides of the House support them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak to the Honey Levy (No. 1 ) Amendment Bill, the Honey Levy (No. 2) Amendment Bill and the Honey Export Charge Amendment Bill, as I was when I spoke in the debate when the original Acts passed through the House, again in a bipartisan way, in April 1988. I remember on that occasion there was a lot of banter about different connotations concerning honey, and so on. There was all sorts of talk about honey-toned words, sweet talk and so on, as we joined together on one of those all too rare occasions to speak on Bills in a bipartisan fashion. It is a pity that there are not more of these sorts of Bills around. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) indicated that there are Bills coming up for debate in relation to the rice industry, and it is to be hoped that we will also have a bipartisan approach then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  When I was coming into the House earlier, someone said, `Make sure you get up and make a 3B speech on the honey levy'--meaning that I ought to be upstanding, be brief and be seated. However, before I am seated I have quite a few things to say with regard to this wonderful industry that we have in Australia, which accounts for a considerable amount of export income for this country. We export something in excess of 13,000 tonnes of honey each year--which is a lot of honey. I shall mention a little bit about that later on when I say a word on behalf of the bees and do a little bit of promotion of the honey itself. It is easy to forget just what a significant part the bees play in this whole operation. In fact, if they were not there, as the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) would know, we would not have this industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  As all honourable members would know, my electorate of Macquarie has a considerable amount of beauty and magnificence because of the abundance of trees and gardens. Some of the most famous gardens in Australia are at Leura, Lawson, Hazelbrook, Katoomba and other areas in the Blue Mountains. I am quite sure that the bees feel that it is the bees' heaven when they get up there and enjoy the succulent nectar that they are able to extract from those magnificent trees and flowers. Within Macquarie electorate there are many apiarists engaged in what is a quite profitable and large industry. Also within my electorate is the Hawkesbury campus of the University of Western Sydney. It is a very famous campus in Australia. It was formerly known as the Hawkesbury Agricultural College. As a matter of fact, it is celebrating its centenary this year. A significant part of a faculty within that campus is playing a very important role in the apiary industry, and it has done so for many years. </PARA>
<PARA>  These Bills before us are the result of a request by the Federal Council of Australian Apiarists Associations to increase the operative rate to 0.52c per kilogram from 1992, as a part of its program of increasing the producer contribution to research and development. Research and development is very significant in terms of the University of Western Sydney. As has already been indicated, the Opposition supports this request, and the industry is to be commended for its commitment to the continuing provision of adequate research and development programs. In the context of this debate one could almost say that research and development are buzz words--not only in association with this industry but indeed throughout the rural sector and the manufacturing sector in general. The importance of research and development for all of Australia's industries cannot be underestimated, especially in the light of today's economic climate. </PARA>
<PARA>  These three Bills cover a number of specific areas, including the levy imposed on honey produced in Australia and sold, the levy imposed on honey produced in Australia and used in the production of other goods, and an export charge on honey exported not already levied. Since the research and development levy was introduced in 1980, the industry has endeavoured to keep abreast of increasing costs by regular upward adjustments to the levy. As a levy ceiling is stipulated in the Act, the industry has now sought amendment to the legislation in order that the contribution to research and development may be maintained in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA>  This approach by the honey industry must therefore be seen as a major input in this area and provides an example to other Australian industries. The honourable member for Murray made the pertinent comment that unfortunately we are not seeing enough funding for R&amp; from the private sector and other industries. The Honey Research and Development Council has a number of objectives, including increasing commercial returns to the members of the honey industry and to the community in general and making more effective use of the resources and skills in the community in general and of the scientific community in particular. </PARA>
<PARA>  Bee breeding and generic improvements of bee stock have always been a priority in research and development funding in this area and will assist in achieving the objectives that I have just mentioned. Of the two stock improvement programs that have been running for some years now, the University of Western Sydney, Hawkesbury campus--as I said, formerly known as the Hawkesbury Agricultural College--has played a major role. The Hawkesbury campus is located in a rural setting at Richmond, New South Wales, which is one of the historic Macquarie towns. Originally established in 1891 as the Hawkesbury Agricultural College, it produced the first agriculturalists in New South Wales and rapidly developed as a leading centre of agricultural education in Australia. Under the guidance of Professor Graham Swain, the Hawkesbury campus of the University of Western Sydney continues to maintain a high level of academic achievement and has complemented its horticultural and agricultural studies with the faculties of business and land economy, nursing and community studies, science and technology and the centre of commerce. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Hawkesbury network has a long tradition of applied research and has strengthened and extended its post-graduate work and research with the guidance of a full time research coordinator. It is nearly 100 years since Hawkesbury commenced an apiary with 12 swarms of hybrid and Italian bees. Commercial queen rearing has been a feature of the apiary department of the university. The university plays a vital role in development and research for the honey industry. In addition to that, the apiary department conducts schools and seminars for beekeepers and apiarists. It has had substantial influence over the years with regard to bee breeding and in the distribution of breeding stock throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  Two recent programs undertaken by Hawkesbury that are of particular interest in regard to development and research are  the eastern Australian bee breeding program, which involves research with Italian honeybees, and a project entitled `The    Evaluation of Honey Bees', which involves research into the establishment of honeybee stock imported from the USSR, which is very interesting news in this present day when we are hearing so much about the Soviet Union. We hope that further similar cooperation will become the order of the day. </PARA>
<PARA>  The apiary manager, the gentleman in charge of the apiary at the University, Steve Johnson, reports that each year four or five research submissions that would ultimately benefit the industry are put forward from the actual apiary on the Hawkesbury campus. Unfortunately, funding limitations will always have a bearing on their approval, which is to be regretted. Nevertheless, with the increase in this levy and with the dollar for dollar contributions, we may see more of these submissions put into practice with regard to research and development. I hope that these Bills will assist research institutions such as Hawkesbury to continue to undertake their special work. </PARA>
<PARA>  I mentioned that I also wanted to say a few words on behalf of the bees because, when one starts to read about them and thinks about what they achieve, one cannot help but be staggered. As I said earlier, not much has been said in this debate or in any debate in this House on their behalf. Of course, if we did not have them, we would not be here and engaged in this debate. But before I talk about the bees, I want to say a word or two about honey. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honey has been described as one of the purest foods available to humans. There are a great number of varieties of honey. There are many colours, all sorts of aromas, different flavours and varying densities. Some of the honey in Australia comes from over 600 varieties of eucalypt, which means that we get over 600 varieties of eucalypt honey. Honey is a wonderful food. I will give some details of just how good it is as I summarise a couple of points made by Fred Bailey in his excellent book Bee Keeping in Australia: for pleasure and profit, written in 1982. He says that honey does not need refrigeration and that, if it is kept sealed, it will keep indefinitely. He mentions that, when honey is eaten, it is easily digested, readily absorbed into the bloodstream and provides new energy, warmth and a feeling of general well-being which is brought on quickly and naturally. It tends to regulate the system without the aid of drugs or laxatives. </PARA>
<PARA>  Fred Bailey also mentions that, even though the basic components of honey are carbohydrates--they account for about 80 per cent of it--those carbohydrates are in the form of natural sugars and are non-fattening. Those people listening to this debate who are on diets may care to take note of that. Honey can be ingested directly into the bloodstream of the human body. It is said that athletes find honey very valuable as a training food as the energy released by natural carbohydrates is immediately available to the body; that cannot be said of a great deal of the other foods that we eat today. </PARA>
<PARA>  The content of natural sugars varies in different honeys depending on the floral source of the original nectar. Fred Bailey goes on to talk about the very complex nature of some of the sugar--glucose, fructose, sucrose, laevulose and so on. Of course, that does not mean much to us here today. But it reveals a little of just how complex this marvellous food is. He says that it contains significant minerals and that the lightness or the darkness of the honey often indicates the degree of minerals in the honey that are beneficial to human beings. The darker the honey, the more minerals it contains. Some of the minerals found in honey that he mentions are iron, calcium, copper, sodium, manganese, potassium, magnesium, nickel, silicon, phosphorous, cobalt, aluminium and chromium. A lot of people will be very surprised to realise just how many minerals are in this wonderful food. All this is gathered by that little bee that we see buzzing around in our gardens and do not take much notice of. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Bailey says that honey contains amino acids; in some varieties, as many as 17 different amino acids have been detected. It contains vitamins B1, B2, B6 and C in varying quantities depending on the degree of ripening of the honey within the hive. He mentions--and I agree with him wholeheartedly--that we can feel quite proud of the marvellous industry that we have and the honeys produced in this country when we go to the Royal Easter Show and see the displays there in various competitions. Those honeys are rated amongst the best in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  One or two other things can be said about honey; for example, it is aseptic and bactericidal. Tests carried out by bacteriologists prove that organisms and germs which affect the human body cannot live in honey because it withdraws the moisture necessary for the survival of the bacteria. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will not dwell on this for long but, in saying a few words about bees, I want to point out to the House and to those people listening just how much work is involved in bees producing one kilogram of honey. Mathematicians have calculated that to place one kilogram of honey on our breakfast table--let us remember that we export over 13,000 tonnes--the bees have to carry almost 80,000 loads of nectar. In doing so, they would fly a combined total of 160,000 kilometres, or approximately four times around the world. That is just to produce a kilogram of honey. It is almost impossible to believe, but it is proven. It is quite an amazing achievement that we take for granted when we have a teaspoon or a tablespoon of honey on our toast every morning. </PARA>
<PARA>  Bees may visit as many as 300 flowers or florets to obtain one load of nectar--one load of nectar being a very light weight indeed. These little creatures set us a great example. They live in almost complete harmony within their hive--something that perhaps in our parliamentary hive we have not learned to do. In fact, I noticed that Marcus Aurelius said:</PARA>
<PARA>What is not good for the hive is not good for the bees. </PARA>
<PARA>There are quite a few other comments and statements that could be made about that. </PARA>

<PARA>  There are lots of things that one can say. We have a wonderful example in the bee. Madam Deputy Speaker, the last time I spoke in a similar debate I made the mistake of mentioning the worker bee in the masculine form, saying that he did this and he did that, when in fact the workers are female. I was spoken to resoundingly at the conclusion of that debate in 1988 and I remember it very well. So I am not making that mistake today, Madam Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, I just want to say that it is a good idea for people to try to find out more about these creatures. There is a great film called The City of Bees, put out by the Moody Bible Institute. It is quite remarkable and ought to be seen by everybody. It describes the marvellous life that these creatures live. There are lots of books, such as National Geographic, which tell us a lot about them. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has been very good to be able to speak on this legislation and I would just like to quote from the book of Proverbs, which contains sayings which are supposed to be from the wisest man who ever lived, Solomon. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Kind words are like honey, sweet to the taste and good for your health. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I started out by saying, it is very pleasant to be in this House and to be able to speak in a bipartisan way on a Bill which a lot of people would not consider an important Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Those factors to which I made reference earlier today in this debate have all resulted in a slow-down in business activity and a consequent spread of business failures. Every day in newspapers throughout Australia, ominous headlines tell their various versions of the same grim story.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  A business survey carried out during the months of February to May of this year from my Deakin office gives a particularly accurate picture of Victoria's devastated economy. One thousand businesses were randomly surveyed over 11 industry sectors by my office staff and voluntary workers, 67 per cent of businesses being from the Melbourne metropolitan area and 33 per cent from country Victoria. It was alarming to discover when the results were collated that only 33 per cent of businesses were working at full capacity and businesses generally throughout the State were functioning only on average at 63 per cent capacity. A total of 54 per cent of respondents reported that sales were down in comparison with last year, while 52 per cent had decreased staff numbers and 24 per cent thought their businesses would not survive the coming 12 months. A staggering 94 per cent thought that the Federal Government was not adequately addressing the problems of small business. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some of the individual industry sector results were even more damning. In the Melbourne metropolitan area, manufacturing industry was found to be working at only 53 per cent capacity; in the transport sector, a third of country businesses were not expected to survive; construction, transport and general industry were working at only 57 to 58 per cent capacity. The metal products sector was working only at an appallingly low 46 per cent capacity. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some of the anecdotal information collected by interviewers as they conducted the survey was just as significant. Comments such as these were frequently made: `Get rid of the 17.5 per cent holiday loading'; `Bring back the 40-hour week'; `Banks should help businesses more'; `The cost of money is too high'; `The economy needs a kick-start with a new government'; `Penalty rates are too high'; `Unions are too powerful'; `It's not worth being a small business employer'. Other comments, frankly, were unrepeatable in this place. Perhaps the saddest comment came from one person interviewed in the manufacturing sector who said:</PARA>
<PARA>This business is closing down. It was opened in 1929. It's the fault of the Government. I've no faith in politicians. </PARA>
<PARA>Another respondent in the recreational and personal services sector ended simply with the words:</PARA>
<PARA>Closing down on 11.4.91. </PARA>
<PARA>As a direct flow-on from the widespread business failures already alluded to, Australia has now reached crisis levels of unemployment. Currently running at 9.8 per cent, unemployment is sadly expected to rise to 10.75 per cent. Some people believe in fact it will be much higher before it finally eases. The Melbourne Age on 21 August stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Budget has little but the dole to offer the jobless and nothing in the way of stimulus to offer employers or business investment--</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian comment on the same day was:</PARA>
<PARA>His--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Kerin's--</PARA>
<PARA>key prescription is simply to bear down on inflation and accept the inevitable unemployment . . . The superannuation levy . . . will act like a new payroll tax making it harder for business to employ new workers . . . The cost of the levy is unemployment at a higher level, for longer. </PARA>
<PARA>Kenneth Davidson's comment in the Melbourne Age of the same day perhaps best sums up the criticisms of the 1991 Kerin Budget, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>If this is truly the best the economy can do, then it is a fearsome indictment of everyone with responsibility for the economic policies of this country over the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA>However, as well as the economic costs of the excesses of the 1980s, there are dangerous social costs, the latter of which are now threatening the very fabric of Australian society. Bankruptcies, high interest rates and rising unemployment are impacting very severely on Australian families. The divorce rate has risen by 8 per cent since 1986. In 1990, there were 42,635 marriage break-ups, compared with 39,417 in 1986, according to the figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The pressures and tensions of current economic conditions are likely to have had a considerable effect on contributing to this appallingly high figure. </PARA>
<PARA>  The number of abortions has risen to the chilling figure of approximately 85,000 per year, according to figures from the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health. The fact that the recession is having an impact on whether families can afford to have more children was brought out in a series of very disturbing articles earlier this year. These articles suggested that doctors were observing an increase in the number of young middle-class women who wished to terminate pregnancies because of financial pressures, particularly because of difficulties in paying high mortgages--although it also has to be conceded there are no precise figures to support this. However, in March of this year, a spokesperson for the Sydney abortion clinic, Preterm, claimed that the number of abortions performed by the clinic had risen by 31 per cent since the recession began. </PARA>
<PARA>  Furthermore, all types of crimes are increasing from burglaries to the most horrendous of violent crimes, like rape and murder. We have even reached the stage where women in supermarkets are warned not to leave their handbags on shopping trolleys while they buy produce because of the high incidence of handbag snatching. People are stealing to buy food now, not just drugs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Out of desperation. An article in the Time Magazine of 12 August is entitled `Are We Safe?'  After reading it, one has to come to the conclusion that in fact we are not. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>...Mundane crimes - that catalogue of burglary, robbery, serious assault and rape so routine to police and such a violation to the victim--has rocketed in the past decade--and increasingly, a major venue is the family home. </PARA>
<PARA>The same article contained statistics illustrating that cases of serious assault in Australia had almost doubled in the last 10 years. In 1982-83, 52 people per 100,000 of the population suffered serious assault, compared with 103 in every 100,000 in 1989-90. In addition, the number of burglaries reported to police were up by 40 per cent during the same period. </PARA>
<PARA>  In our cities now there is a pervading sense of fear. Not only women living alone, but families feel unsafe. Citizens are preoccupied with security, so much so that in the more affluent suburbs some homes resemble medieval castles with high walls and padlocked gates, while inside the ramparts are to be found incredibly complicated and costly electronic devices, ensuring complete surveillance of house and garden. Others, who cannot afford such precautions, for the cost is high, install deadlocks on doors, metal grilles on windows, automatic light switches to feign occupancy, or whichever alarm system fits their income. Watchdogs are not as popular as they were because the rarest and most fiendish of intruders easily brutalise animals as they do human beings. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another appalling consequence of this recession is a growing incidence of child abuse, which has to be a matter of great concern. The Sunday Herald-Sun of 18 August carried an article entitled `Child Abuse Widespread'. This contained the findings of a survey conducted by the Victorian Community Services Department indicating that 10,000 Victorian children may have been abused during the past year but only 10 per cent of cases were in fact reported. The only accurate national figures available were those from the Standing Committee of Social Welfare Administrators (WELSTAT) for 1987-88, which quoted a figure of 42,116 reported cases of child maltreatment in Australia, but it should be pointed out that this figure excluded Western Australia, where data was not available. Certainly, media reports would suggest that child abuse, as well as child abduction, is increasing as part of the recessionary pressures that Australia is facing. </PARA>
<PARA>  The 1991 Budget addresses neither the causes of our economic and social decay nor its results. There is nothing in the Budget to give any incentive to the private sector, which employs, or used to employ, two-thirds of Australia's work force, to get it moving again. In the Budget there are no tax incentives--none whatever--for industry or individuals. There is a complete absence of any encouragement for industry to invest in plant and equipment which is fundamental to economic recovery. Nor is there any attempt in the Budget to implement other areas of reform so sorely needed, as indicated in the answers from respondents to the business survey conducted from my Deakin office. In that survey, tax incentives, labour market reform, a reduction in Government regulation and interest rate cuts were high priorities among respondents when asked what was needed to get business moving again. This Budget makes no provision for any of these initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA>  The symptoms of our disintegration are not being tackled in the Budget, either. What is being done in this Budget to strengthen the family?  Other than a small and very recent commitment by the Victorian State Government not to make any further cuts in its police force, what is being done to make citizens feel safe in their homes?  Why is it that we never hear that most Australian of Australianisms `She'll be right' any more?</PARA>
<PARA>  The only Budget reaction to our malaise is the provision in the appropriations for further unemployment relief. So it is obvious that `She won't be right' if Labor continues in office. The 1991 Budget lacks both practical solutions to our problems and any sense of national purpose whatever. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australians are looking for a vision as to their future. They--I might say `we', because I include myself in this--earnestly want to fulfil our full potential as a nation. The next coalition government will provide the vision and the purpose that are so vitally necessary to achieve that potential. </PARA>

<PARA>  Howe is active on both sides of this budget's ledger--making savings and initiating new policy. There will be big cuts in health. Howe has already announced pathology and radiology will be hit. On the spending side, Howe has won support for a substantial program to create `better cities', a hobby-horse of his for years. </PARA>
<PARA>We were also told that the new Treasurer (Mr Kerin) was not in the pocket of the Treasury bureaucrats as his predecessor was. He had developed a healthy dislike for those bureaucrats during his sojourn as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and he would be taking a fresh independent line. </PARA>
<PARA>  All of this was reinforced on the eve of the Budget with a series of stories revealing that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his Deputy (Mr Howe) had set aside the usual democratic processes of Cabinet to force through the economic review committee of Cabinet and then Cabinet itself a radical plan to rebuild our cities. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer to an article by Paul Cleary in the Sydney Morning Herald of 17 August, headed `A policy triumph for the Left's deal-maker', in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>  Brian Howe will have good reason to smile on Tuesday. He may not want to appear smug, but while this Budget will be the ninth for the Hawke Government, it is the first in which the Left has had a clear-cut policy victory. </PARA>
<PARA>Then he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The win in the ERC by Brian Howe, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, may well be written off as the payback for the Left support for Hawke. There is no question that the Left is more powerful in the Keating-less Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I have been around long enough not to be fooled by that sort of media hype; but hope springs eternal in the breasts of the Labor Party faithful, and I certainly wanted to believe that there would, at the height of this harsh recession, be something in the Budget for Labor's traditional constituency. Needless to say, the financial press was as surprised as everybody else. There were few reforms, let alone left wing ones, in the first Kerin Budget, which the Age editorialists so cruelly described as a `do nothing, be patient' Budget, and  which the Prime Minister prefers to label as a responsible Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  In fairness, the Press Gallery could not be said to be completely wrong when it predicted that the Budget would wear the stamp of our Deputy Prime Minister and, by extension, the faction he leads. The fact is that two of the three memorable features of an otherwise modest and dour document were the Deputy Prime Minister's Medicare co-payment impost and his better cities program. The other feature was of course the excellent extension of superannuation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>  Every Budget has to be judged in its economic climate. We are currently suffering a cruel recession, with official unemployment heading towards 11 per cent, real unemployment already past that point, and the work participation rate rapidly declining. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those of us committed to traditional Labor philosophy find no joy in a Budget that presents us with a strategy which will suppress growth, give no encouragement to investment and tolerate growing unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The recent national conference of the Labor Party made it clear that solutions to joblessness must become the Government's major Budget priority. The Federal conference called upon Cabinet to devise an integrated strategy. The first objective of the strategy would be to reduce unemployment through initiatives, to establish infrastructure projects compatible with low inflation and growth in the traded goods sector. The conference was referring in particular to projects improving the efficiency of our roads, railways and ports; housing; and development of our telecommunications and education export markets. Secondly, the conference called on the Government to expand our labour market programs to protect Australia's skills base and to provide training for the long term unemployed. It is a matter of considerable disappointment to me, and no doubt to most members of the Australian Labor Party, that only the job training scheme received any recognition in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  The national conference also resolved that an integrated strategy required the implementation of an effective trade and industry policy and suggested that the Government take several initiatives to that end. Firstly, the conference asked the Government to set up a national development fund to support the development of medium sized companies. It also suggested strengthening the national network of industrial supply offices which give direct assistance to import replacement projects. Next, the conference argued for a sectoral industry development strategy to enhance exports. A good example of the success of such policies can be seen in the current steel industry television advertisements. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Labor Party also argued that we should be giving our trade strategy an Asian emphasis. Asia already provides our major markets and, given our geographical position, the greatest potential is obviously in that region. Finally, Labor's governing body emphasised the need for funded programs to accelerate take-up and effective utilisation of advanced manufacturing technology. It also called for the exploration of financial initiatives such as tax exemptions on special savings accounts, similar to those in the United Kingdom, to mobilise savings of small investors. The outstanding success of the recent Commonwealth Bank float indicates the potential here. </PARA>
<PARA>  For my own part, I would have hoped that Cabinet would have explored even bolder initiatives such as the phased abolition of all or part of payroll tax in the traded goods sector. I know we are talking about large sums here but, at this time of high unemployment, surely we must be taking a second look at what is in reality a tax on employment. The phased abolition of payroll tax would give a boost to the competitiveness of our exporters and would have the dual effect of creating jobs and reducing the current account deficit. To achieve this end we may have to forgo reductions in income tax or even increase some income and company taxes. However, this may well be the price Australians have to pay for jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another initiative we could be examining is legislation to require the superannuation funds to invest part of their massive liquidity in major job creating infrastructure projects. Any concerns about trustees' liability or returns to beneficiaries could be met by the Government guaranteeing the return. The sorts of major projects I am talking about are the construction of Sydney's second airport, the modernisation of our sea ports and major rail and road projects. Such projects not only are highly labour intensive but also use Australian materials and greatly enhance our export potential. </PARA>
<PARA>  The response to all these sorts of propositions is, of course, already to be read in the Treasurer's Budget Speech. The Budget was framed under the dark cloud of fear that any expansion of our economy could see the loss of the undoubted gains in the areas of controlling inflation and the current account deficit. The Treasurer justified this frugality on the basis that it was maintaining the underlying integrity of the Budget. What that amounted to in practice was the application, in the economic review committee of Cabinet, of the unreasonably inflexible mechanism of insisting that any new or increased outlays had to be offset by reductions in existing programs. A mild expansionary Budget, paid for by some tax increases and a larger deficit, might have been a courageous political step and no doubt would have offended our political opponents and the right wing members of the business community who are demanding billions of dollars of cuts in welfare spending. It is a far easier alternative to wearing the wrath of one million unemployed and their families at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>  While I am talking about electoral wrath, I would like to turn to the matter of the proposed changes to Medicare which have been given the thumbs down by all peak welfare and health organisations in Australia, including ACOSS, the Consumer Health Forum, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, the Australia Consumers Association and the Australian Council on the Ageing. It has also been bagged by the AMA and State health Ministers, who are concerned about its effect on hospital casualty services. It has also received a vote of no confidence from the architect of Medicare, John Deeble, who has spent the last 24 years developing, introducing and administering our national health scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  The welfare groups saw the change as a consumer tax on the sick and the first nail in the coffin of Medicare. Deeble described it as `ill advised, unjustified and ultimately destructive'. The two great principles underpinning Medicare, those of a universal health service and bulkbilling, are certainly compromised by co-payments. Medicare was designed to treat all Australians equally. The proposal creates a charity class of beneficiaries on pensions or benefits. Ironically, it was the Minister's own consultant, Professor Richardson, who, in his strategy paper, argued strongly against using co-payments to reduce patient demand. The Professor found their effect to be negligible in deterring patients from seeking medical attention and irrelevant in preventing over-servicing. </PARA>
<PARA>  Bulkbilling has, of course, been the key to Australia controlling health costs and making Medicare work. Deeble's expert view is that only the 24-hour clinics can sustain the almost 20 per cent reduction in fees without collecting the $3.50 and predicts that the rest will abandon bulkbilling altogether. That is a frightening prospect for the tens of thousands of pensioners and beneficiaries in my electorate. Even at the scheduled fee levels, the gap for patient billed services ranges from $7 to $12. The spectre of gap insurance immediately raises its ugly head. The aspect of the proposal, however, that most sticks in my craw is the arguments proffered to justify the decision. </PARA>
<PARA>  The problem the Minister is seeking to address is a potential blow-out in the cost--and I emphasise `potential' because there has been no blow-out in the cost of the scheme to this point in time--created by an oversupply of doctors, some 5,000 more doctors than are required at this very moment, with more coming out of the universities every day. In other words, it is the supply, not the demand, side of the Medicare economy that is in crisis. Doctors' fees are not capped and doctors can maintain their incomes against the natural market forces in an oversupply situation by either increasing fees or overservicing their patients. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister's solution is a package which starts out by doing what Professor Richardson said should not be done, and that is punishing patients by imposing the $3.50 fee. Why should the sick pay for the sins of the medical profession? The Minister says, of course, that we should look at the whole package, and that includes future negotiations with the AMA to alter practice patterns and fee structures. The AMA has already rejected that proposal, and it is looking as though the Minister will be left with a one-legged program. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister rejects the ACTU suggestion that if savings need to be made then the levy should be increased. He argues forcefully that this does not address the fundamental problem of oversupply of doctors. He also rejects the option of capping doctors' fees and licensing the supply of doctors as unconstitutional. There would be no sticky constitutional problems if the States cooperated in a price fixing and practice rationalisation scheme. New South Wales, of course, would present a difficulty for any Federal-State cooperative scheme. However, the attitude of the High Court has changed a great deal since the old civil conscription cases, and it may well be that the Minister's legal advice is based on outdated legal thinking. </PARA>
<PARA>  Like John Deeble, I take no pleasure in criticising the Minister. I am glad that my Caucus has seen fit to have the issue reviewed by a special committee. I know that that committee will explore alternative means of achieving savings which will save Medicare and come to grips with the real problem of the supply of doctors and their fee structures. </PARA>
<PARA>  The only other matter that I wish to comment on in this Medicare context is the Minister's vociferous denial that the $3.50 patient charge has been introduced to pay for the better cities program. The credibility problem for the Deputy Prime Minister is, of course, created by the well-publicised mechanism to maintain the underlying integrity of the Budget. It is no secret that all Ministers were told that the revenue for new programs had to be found within the existing portfolios budget. That meant either cutting existing programs or raising fees and charges. </PARA>
<PARA>  Looking at the measures table at page 3.62 of the Budget Papers we see the effect on outlays of the revised Medicare arrangement as a reduction of $164m rising to $700m by 1994. It is the only substantial reduction other than pathology benefits of $134m, a total of $834m. The only substantial increase in outlays in the Minister's portfolio is the better cities program, which is estimated to cost $800m over five years. In other words, the major cut in outlays just happens to equal the major increase in outlays and fiscal integrity is thereby maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>  To complete my contribution, I would like to make a few remarks about the better cities program itself. The major criticisms that have been directed at it are, firstly, that the funding is inadequate and, secondly, that there is absolutely no detail of the projects it is proposed to fund. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister quite properly points out that there is always a substantial lead time in launching such a scheme and $56m is a reasonable sum to get the program under way. However, the funding for the scheme is still only $800m over five years or about $160m per year. The Government's vision for the scheme is to form a partnership between State, local and Federal governments to change the cities of our nation by making capital grants to improve their infrastructure. We are talking about things like better roads, hospitals, housing and community facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not want to sound like a dog in the manger but in city infrastructure terms $160m around Australia is peanuts. That is the cost of the new Glebe Island Bridge in Sydney--a relatively minor Sydney road project. It is about the same cost as the Gore Hill diversion on the Warringah freeway and is but a drop in the bucket of many other road projects. It would not build one modern city hospital; it would build about 800 new houses in the inner city of Sydney--only 800. I point out here that this Government has cut funding to the States for housing purposes by 47 per cent since I was Minister for Housing in New South Wales. The new program goes nowhere near redressing that loss. I passionately believe that such a program should exist but we should be looking at a much larger infusion of capital into infrastructure if it is to be meaningful. </PARA>
<PARA>  In summary, it is fair to say that I am disappointed that the Government did not take the advice of our national conference and give unemployment the priority it so obviously deserved in the Budget. That omission has unfortunately given the talentless, policy bereft Opposition a powerful issue with which to beat the Government about the head. The way forward seems to be the evolution of an exciting, progressive yet economically responsible industry policy that will give the jobless hope for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish to raise the issue of funding and the future of the ABC as indicated by the Budget. The 1991-92 Budget provides total outlays for the ABC of $502m. This is significantly less than the previous year's actual outlays for the ABC totalling $513.5m, even taking into account the fact that the ABC will not be required to pay the efficiency dividend of 1.25 per cent of allocation which the Government is requiring from its other agencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  For a decade and a half the ABC has been subject to a continued round of funding restrictions, staff cuts, rationalisations and reorganisations. The decline of the ABC began under the Fraser Government and, except for the first two Hawke Budgets, it has continued ever since. In 1988 the ABC's funding was below its 1975 level in real terms and also as a proportion of total government outlays. </PARA>
<PARA>  The move to triennial funding of the ABC from 1988 was expected to improve the organisation's position. But due to political sleight of hand by the Department of Finance and by Treasury, increases in annual funding were not fully indexed. As a result, the ABC lost about $32m in real terms in the first two years of triennial funding. </PARA>
<PARA>  The ABC is one of our country's most important public institutions and perhaps the most significant Australian cultural organisation. It began operating in 1932 and within a year the country was benefiting from a touring ABC band and ABC schools broadcasts. Drama and music programs followed. The overseas service opened in 1939 and later developed into Radio Australia, with an audience three times greater than our whole population. </PARA>
<PARA>  ABC correspondents reported the Second World War from battle zones and by 1945 Australia's farmers were benefiting from the ABC's rural broadcasts. The ABC gave us the Argonauts, the symphony orchestras, Blue Hills and Four Corners. More recently it gave us a blow by blow reporting, unmatched by any Australian commercial network, of the momentous changes in the USSR. More importantly, the ABC, through its national radio and television broadcasts, has provided a distinctive Australian voice heard throughout the country and is helping to build national unity and identity. </PARA>
<PARA>  Criticisms can be levelled at any organisation, and the ABC is not immune. For example, during my recent visits to Tasmania, Queensland and Western Australia, I could not help noticing the tendency of the ABC to play up to the parochial sentiment that seems to be rampant in those States. </PARA>
<PARA>  The ABC is also vulnerable to criticism on the question of accountability. There have been calls for the organisation to be made more accountable to an independent watchdog. Commercial broadcasters have complained that, while they are subject to the discipline of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, the ABC is not. There may be a case for bringing ABC television and radio under the same regulatory regime as the commercials as far as broadcasting standards are concerned, although the ABC, for obvious reasons, could not be required to meet the same media ownership requirements as private interests and it could not be subject to the ultimate sanction of licence forfeiture. </PARA>
<PARA>  It needs to be conceded that the ABC already has a form of independent watchdog in its board. Of the nine members of the board, seven are independent of the organisation and free to take an objective and critical view of its activities. However, I share the view of the majority of Australians who have a high regard for its services, both radio and television. I also agree with Tom Molomby when he says in his recent book on the ABC Is there a Moderate on the Roof? that the ABC is now suffering from `the deprecation of public institutions which have been so fashionable in recent times'. I think that the ABC is far too important to become another victim of the extremists and the nineteenth century free market fundamentalists who are laying siege to much of Australian society at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  A 1990 ANOP survey of community attitudes to the ABC's role, image and position showed that, despite the unrelenting attacks on it by its competitors, politicians and interest groups, the organisation continues to be well regarded and its services highly valued. The survey found that the ABC enjoys widespread goodwill, with 63 per cent seeing a need for its radio and 83 per cent believing that its television provides programs needed by the community. It found that the ABC is seen as quite distinct from commercial stations and that the main perceived differences are its non-commercial style and absence of advertising, and its strength as a news and information provider. </PARA>
<PARA>  The ANOP survey exploded the myth that the ABC has a narrowly based, elitist audience, finding that in any week it reaches 50 per cent of radio listeners and 83 per cent of television viewers. Most Australians in all demographic groups and in all parts of the country listen to ABC radio or watch ABC television for some period every week. </PARA>
<PARA>  The erosion of the ABC's funding has forced obvious cuts in services. From 1985 to 1989 staffing levels fell by 10 per cent. In 1989 transmissions by television on Saturday and Sunday mornings were cut, there were cuts to the second regional radio network affecting country centres, particularly in New South Wales, and restrictions on the proposed expansion of JJJ FM youth radio station. Not so obvious was the redirection of ABC staff and resources from production and services into commercial activities in order to make up income shortfalls. </PARA>
<PARA>  Cuts in ABC funding forced it in 1990 to reduce its schools programs, which have been a valuable resource for teachers. The children's TV department is now looking to State education departments to fund its continued operation. More recently, we have seen wholesale retrenchments of ABC program makers. Managing Director David Hill said on a recent morning program that a further 161 program makers were to go. As the ranks of the program makers are being mercilessly thinned, the ABC is dramatically increasing the ranks of its senior management. We have had a 48 per cent increase in managers over the last three years, and no doubt massive salary increases. </PARA>
<PARA>  In another move against program makers, management has announced its intention to put them on short term contracts, which seem to be designed to encourage creative staff to find another line of work. How many people in the work force would accept 12-month contracts?  Those who support cutting back its funding argue that it is inefficient. Credible conclusions were able to be drawn from studies carried out in 1988 by media analysts Mervin Smyth and Associates. These studies showed that the cost of ABC TV per viewer was in line with the costs of commercial broadcasters. The ABC Radio National daily cost per listener was then about 10c, and this was for a service providing a range and quantity of information comparable with a metropolitan newspaper which, at the time, cost about 70c per reader per day to produce. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is hard to escape the conclusion that the Government--or at least influential sections of it--hopes that by cutting the ABC's budget the organisation will have to turn to commercial advertising and program sponsorship to survive. While this is at present excluded by its charter, legislation of course to allow advertising and sponsorship could no doubt be introduced in the right political climate. In 1989, the then media spokesman for the Opposition, Senator Alston, confirmed that Opposition policy favoured program sponsorship. The Opposition's current spokesman on communications, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), has been a little more circumspect. However, in July this year he spoke approvingly of the Government's cutting back ABC funding. The honourable member for Bass suspects that a public broadcaster's role in the future may be more limited than now and that some element of privatisation is possible. </PARA>
<PARA>  Champions of the ABC's commercialisation are also to be found in its senior management. Michael Shrimpton of ABC TV in May last year suggested to a meeting of the Pacific Rim Co-production Association that the ABC was moving in a more commercial direction similar to TV New Zealand and was considering spot advertising. He said that the principal avenue for survival of public broadcasters would be international co-productions. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is some evidence that ABC management is introducing commercial sponsorship by stealth. A good example was the ABC TV broadcast on 14 April 1990 of its regular Horizon program. This one dealt with an expedition financed by the Australian Geographic magazine to restore Mawson's hut in the Antarctic. It included sequences showing an interminably long chase through ice floes by men in two rubber inflatables. The camera was mounted on the rear boat in such a way that as it filmed the front boat--which was so far away as to be barely visible--viewers were able to study at leisure the Esso and BBC Hardware logos prominently displayed on the bow of the rear boat. The credits at the end of the program dwelt on the 14 sponsors. Errol Simper, a journalist with the Australian who contacted management for a comment was told that the program had not broken any guidelines concerning advertising and sponsorship because Esso, BBC Hardware and other companies mentioned were Australian Geographic sponsors, not the ABC's. This shows a readiness on the part of management to flout its own Act of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  The introduction of commercial advertising to the ABC must be opposed. It is a little like, I suppose, airline interests expressing sympathy for the residents around Kingsford-Smith Airport, but even Senator Alston, after a visit to New Zealand, described the introduction of advertising to the national broadcaster as a disaster. Barnett and Docherty, authors of Public Broadcasting in Transition, confirm that dependence on advertising has resulted in a narrowing of the range and type of programming from New Zealand's public broadcaster. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sponsorship involves a much closer identification with the program on the part of the sponsor than does advertising. The sponsor pays over a substantial amount of money to support the production and presentation of a particular program. In return, the sponsor's support is acknowledged in the credits. The influence of sponsorship on programming could be more insidious than advertising;  it provides the opportunity to influence in a direct way the programs that would be made, when they are shown and editorial judgments. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sudden and capricious withdrawals of sponsorship occur in the United States as a routine matter, such as when General Electric ditched Inside Story, an Emmy award winning current affairs program. A major problem with sponsorship would be the programs that are not made because they present ideas that corporate sponsors find unattractive. Unsponsored programs would remain as no more than a good idea or, if made, would be relegated to marginal viewing times so as not to affect revenue. Sponsorship cannot be seen as an inoffensive compromise which the ABC and its audience would be churlish to reject. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has been suggested that sensitive areas of broadcasting such as news and current affairs could be exempted from sponsorship schemes. This was the thrust of the Evans paper in 1987. But it would be impossible to insulate these programs from sponsor influence. If large corporations are major sponsors of the arts and sports programs, how could their influence on the organisation fail to spread to the current affairs area if, say, The Investigators or Four Corners embarked on a damaging investigation of one of the sponsor corporation's dealings?  We cannot fence off these essential activities of the ABC from influence. Pressure would be felt by the producers of these programs, from others or self-imposed, from inside the organisation or outside, direct or indirect, subtle and otherwise, to alter their editorial stance to be realistic or even to abandon some aspect of their investigations.</PARA>
<PARA>  Pressure on the ABC to take a particular line in public affairs has always been a serious problem. During the 1960s and 1970s there were repeated political attacks on Four Corners. Even when outsiders have not intervened, middle level ABC managers, anticipating trouble, have tried to impose a form of self-censorship. Allan Ashbolt coined the term `the pre-emptive buckle' for it. How much more pre-emptive buckling will there be within the ABC's management when the pressure is closely linked to the organisation's funding through corporate sponsorships?</PARA>
<PARA>  The 1990 ANOP survey of public opinion, which I referred to earlier, found that the Australian community is opposed to both sponsorship and advertising. It found that 47 per cent were opposed to sponsorship as against 39 per cent in favour, while advertising was opposed by an overwhelming 81 per cent. Opposition to sponsorship and advertising was found to have increased in the 10 years since ANOP conducted a similar survey for the Dix Committee of Review of the ABC in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>  What financial benefit can the ABC hope for in return for running the risks of corporate sponsorship?  On the basis of an ABC estimate--made before the recession--it would be about $20m a year. That is hardly a worthwhile amount in an annual budget of $500m when  compared  with  the  massive disadvantages.</PARA>
<PARA>  Commercial broadcasters' program policies are necessarily built on maximising audiences in order to attract the maximum advertising revenue. Commercial broadcasters have no choice but to concentrate on programs which, regardless of their quality, cultural or artistic values and merit, have a strong appeal to mass audiences. Public broadcasting is necessary and desirable precisely because it does not need to compromise on quality and range the way the commercial broadcasters must. The existence of public broadcasting requires that broadcasting be more than a commercial commodity. The ABC, because it does not rely on advertising revenue for its existence, can and does produce programs that are innovative, entertaining, educational, controversial and analytical--programs that explore those areas of our experience that are of special interest, that are important, but which may not in all cases be commercial. </PARA>
<PARA>  The trend to co-productions is also a great concern. A significant part of the programming is already made under co-production agreements where the ABC either buys the program from the makers or enters into an arrangement to make the program jointly, with the ABC taking rights to broadcast it under licence. With licence fees around $50,000 and the production cost of a one-hour documentary at $250,000, co-productions offer the ABC a way out of its financial difficulties, and some fine material has been broadcast under this system. But as the current management policies of the ABC are reducing the number of in-house program makers, the ABC will rely increasingly on co- productions. Australia is a small market and the makers of co-productions will have to market their products overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>  The ABC will be broadcasting fewer and fewer programs with Australian themes and more with either a transnational or mainly overseas appeal. The organisation will then find it difficult to honour one of the most important commitments in its statutory charter, which is to provide broadcasting programs and television programs that contribute to a sense of national identity. </PARA>
<PARA>  The importance of public broadcasting has been reaffirmed in the United Kingdom.  Even under Margaret Thatcher, England's answer to Genghis Khan, BBC funding has increased and the Peacock inquiry into the future of the BBC concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>  We are not persuaded by the claim of advertisers that it would never be in their interest to influence program content. There would certainly be a risk that controversial drama, critical consumer programs, current affairs programs and satirical programs which challenge conventional attitudes and prejudice would not be supported by them. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope we never go down the road of public broadcasting in the United States, where in 1979 the Carnegie Commission said that corporate sponsorship had undoubtedly skewed the whole total schedule and where even the best public broadcasting services are battling to survive. In Boston, one of the USA's leading public broadcasters, WGBH, has had to constantly beg the public for money just to stay afloat. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a depressing irony that at a time when commercial broadcasting is in total disarray the ABC is being urged to follow its example. Commercial stations, both radio and television, have been grossly overvalued, owners are deeply in debt and the prospects for some organisations are gloomy. The crisis has spilled over into the advertising industry, producing instability there. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the current shambles that is the broadcasting industry, the ABC is continuing to do its job, providing a trusted news and information service, reflecting on many aspects of Australian life and culture and doing it intelligently and with style. Australians overwhelmingly want to keep it. They want it to continue as an identifiable broadcasting voice for the nation and not just as another commercial station. They want it strong and independent, but they will not have it if the ABC becomes dependent on commercial advertising or sponsorship for its continued existence; nor will they have it if it is allowed to degenerate into an organisation with no creative capacity, an organisation peopled by administrators buying in programs from outside. </PARA>
<PARA>  With no public mandate, great efforts appear to have been made to change the role and nature of the ABC. Funds have been cut. School programs, rural services, local sport and other services have steadily disappeared. Australian content has been inexorably reduced. Increases in joint productions and a relentless drive to corporate sponsorships and advertising have resulted in a steady attrition of independence and integrity. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Hawke Government has established a pattern of censorship by political pressure, which does not bode well for the future. The ABC is one of Australia's most important national institutions and providers of information. Radical change of the sort now under way should not happen without a public mandate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Almost imperceptibly within the community of debate there is a slowly changing attitude to issues that affect our economic future. This has to be seen against the background of the 1980s which saw the worldwide ascendancy of neo- conservatism. Springing essentially from populist anti-big government groups and explicitly in favour of nurturing wealth, neo- conservatism found its most powerful intellectual voice in George Gilder when he said in Wealth and Poverty:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  To help the poor and the middle classes, one must cut the taxes of the rich.</PARA>
<PARA>It was also found in Wanniski, who in The Way the World Works popularised the Laffer curve and the notion that tax cuts were essential for economic progress. By the mid 1980s, neo-laissez faire leaders dominated the major First World governments: Reagan in the United States, Thatcher in the United Kingdom and Nakasone in Japan, each implementing the politics of deregulation, privatisation and smaller government. Predictably, the rich got richer and inequality grew. </PARA>
<PARA>  The wealth shift represented by the 1980s has only recently begun to be comprehensively documented, most vividly and controversially in the United States by Kevin Phillips, whose work The Politics of Rich and Poor, subtitled Wealth in the American Electorate in the Reagan Aftermath, reached second place in the New York Times national best seller list in August of 1990. Phillips said that by the middle of Reagan's second term, official data had begun to show that America's broadly defined rich, the top half of one per cent of the US population, had never been richer. Even adjusted for inflation, the number of millionaires had doubled between the late 70s and the late 80s. Meanwhile the number of billionaires, according to Forbes Magazine, went from a handful in 1981 to 26 in 1986 and 49 in 1987. No parallel upsurge of riches has ever been seen since the late nineteenth century, the era of the Vanderbilts, Morgans and Rockefellers. This was at a time when the Census Bureau in the United States reported in the 1984-88 period that the median net worth of US households--that is, assets minus debts--had decreased by 4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Phillips concluded that, when one remembers that the Forbes 400 had greatly increased their net worth during this period, pulling up the national total, and with the top one per cent not far behind, this only underscored what was happening to the average family. A `liberal' in the United States sense of the word would probably say, `Trickle down wasn't trickling'. </PARA>
<PARA>  There have been similar processes at work in our own country. I would not accept that Labor deserves Phillips' cruel gibe at the Democrats in the United States that, `When wealth is in fashion, National Democrats have gone along', but there is no doubt that the Hawke Labor Government and the governments that immediately preceded it were themselves influenced very strongly by the neo-conservatism that was so fashionable amongst world leaders and all First World economies. We saw implemented in this country a number of programs, supported by the Opposition, similar to policies as implemented in the United States. Rates of tax fell dramatically and were followed by a shift of wealth from those on middle and low incomes to the rich. One should simply note the following as facts: the top rate of tax has fallen from 65c to 49c, company tax has fallen from 65c to 37c and, coupled with this, we have introduced dividend imputation, which has concentrated the share of wealth held by that small proportion of the community which participates in the stock market. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, we implemented the policies of deregulation although, in our case I think it is fair to say, with a far greater degree of care than was evidenced in the United States, where there was a near-fatal collapse of the `thrifts' banking which were the repositories of large amounts of national banking deposits. In Australia's case, we also saw major difficulties with some of our financial institutions, partly attributable to the difficulties of management unused to the kind of deregulatory pressures that were then being placed upon them. </PARA>
<PARA>  Continuing through the period of the 1980s were intellectual attacks upon the very fundamental nature of equity, on the progressive tax system--arguments that are still being currently advanced by the Opposition such as that we should move further away from principle, that is, of equitable distribution of the resources of our community, and down the track of a consumption tax. Anyone with any sympathy for Labor and its traditions finds himself crying out with Peter Walsh, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>I may be, as David Clarke alleged, an old socialist, but for many decades vast numbers of people who were not socialists or even Labor voters believed in a progressive income tax. Has our society become so morally corrupted by Gordon Gekkos that it can no longer believe that?</PARA>
<PARA>  I will leave that question hanging in the air because essentially at the next election that will be an issue that the Australian public will have to resolve:  has our society been so corrupted by the attitudes of Gordon Gekko that it would fall for what the Opposition is putting forward by way of a further redistribution downwards from those on middle income to the rich?</PARA>
<PARA>  In my contribution to the Budget debate I now want to look briefly at a number of issues which need to attract the attention of our government which is facing a difficult economic period. I believe that there is a need for a paradigm shift. There is no doubt that there has been a concentration of inequality in Australia similar to that which has happened in the United States. I have on the Notice Paper a motion asking that there be established an inquiry into wealth in this country to give us the raw data we need to be able to make some definitive judgments in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are one of the few countries which does not have such information available to its policy makers. The United States does and so does Britain and most European countries--but not Australia. The best evidence that we have about the pattern of wealth distribution is the work of Professor Dilnot, who estimated, that if we look at the distribution of household wealth in our country--he was estimating it in 1986--the bottom 30 per cent of wealth holders have negative wealth. In other words, they owe more than they own. The top one per cent of wealth holders in this country--that is, the percentile 99 to 100--have in their hands 19.7 per cent of Australia's net wealth. The top 10 per cent have 55.2 per cent. We thus have a concentration of wealth in this country which parallels that which has developed in the United States through the implementation of neo-conservatist politics. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, there is a substantial difference between the implementation of Reagan's politics in the United States and the course pursued by the Australian Government. The difference is that, even with the dominance of the neo-conservatist view of economic imperatives, the Hawke Government never abandoned a fundamental commitment to fairness. </PARA>
<PARA>   By contrast the previous speaker, the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), pointed out some of the detrimental effects that occurred in Great Britain at the same time as these macro-economic policies were being implemented by Margaret Thatcher. We heard earlier in Question Time of the way in which unemployment rose in Great Britain from one million to three million. The GDP of Great Britain was dramatically slashed as a result of these policies, at the same time benefiting the rich and the wealth holders. </PARA>
<PARA>  In Australia however, we introduced novel policies which held back the worst features of neo-conservatism, Thatcherism and Reaganism. For example, Labor introduced the family allowance supplement, a program which provides vital income support for low wage working Australians. We were the first government ever to recognise that our responsibility does not end with those who are direct beneficiaries of government pensions and benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>  We looked beyond that to ensure that those who get only low incomes, who earn relatively small wages, yet have families to support, can get a share of the Government's support.</PARA>
<PARA>  I believe the family allowance supplement will be seen in decades to come as one of the landmark social policy initiatives of the last 25 years. At the same time, Labor maintained a national health scheme--Medicare--which was fair and universal. None of the other First World countries that we have spoken of were able to do that. For example there are some 30 million Americans uninsured at the moment, including, paradoxically, some of the middle class. They are finding the burden of household insurance for health to be almost unbearable unless they have it paid for by their employers. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the same time, as well as the family allowance supplement and Medicare, Labor introduced policies to ensure the burden of old age could be supported. We have altered a scheme which was previously only taxpayer supported to one which will be largely paid for through superannuation--necessary given the fact that, in the future, instead of five working Australians supporting one retiree there will be only three. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have recognised the need for greater self-reliance in terms of superannuation. That has been built into Labor Budgets, not just on this occasion, but in accord arrangements that we have made with the trade unions in the past five years. That is a further major difference between this Government and those that I have mentioned--the Reagan, Thatcher and Nakasone governments. This Government worked out arrangements with the trade union movement, designed to facilitate the maintenance of real living standards--not real wages, but real living standards--of all in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, Labor has maintained and increased the value of pensions to those who are in most need. Today, the value of the Australian pension is 26.4 per cent of gross male average weekly earnings which is at the highest real level since 1949. These are very substantial achievements at a time when almost every government was dominated by what I believe was an over-reaction to the winds of the economic imperatives which were so strongly advanced by the neo-conservatives. There is a real mood now for a paradigm shift. Indeed some of the theories which drove policy making in the United States, Great Britain and in our own country are now almost a cheap joke. </PARA>
<PARA>  Who will remember the Laffer curve--the argument that reducing taxes would mean greater returns to Treasury?  Laffer simply was proved incorrect. Who now recalls the `double deficit' theory--the argument that slashing government expenditure would improve our balance of trade? It is a late, unlamented theory. Who now remembers the J-curve? One by one the elements of the neo- conservative ideology have been discredited. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our Government was caught up to a degree with some of those ideas. What government of its time could not have been? It was simply the mood of the times. Governments which resisted were swept from office. There is no doubt that there was a huge populist demand for lower taxes and less government. The argument that government was not the answer, but was the problem, was persuasive and attractive. Our Government was drawn into a number of measures which one might describe as neo-conservative. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the same time, as many commentators have properly noted, we tamed the worst excesses of Thatcherism and Reaganism. We drew some of the strengths from it, we implemented elements of it--not all to the great benefit of the Australian economy, as things transpired--but we also consistently sought to act to protect the best interests of Australian working people. </PARA>

<PARA>  The crucial issues for us now are to confront what have always been the fundamentals--not the theories, but the real question of what Australia makes and sells, what Australia can export, manufacture and sustain. What services, what opportunities, what intellectual opportunities do we have for growth in this country? We must be continually reminded of that. We have the strength of Barry Jones in his work in both the Ministry and in the back bench committee which he now chairs so well to remind us. </PARA>
<PARA>  In contrast to this, the Opposition is still stuck in the past mouthing the rhetoric of the 1980s. It is still in `slash and burn' mode. It is still advocating less government and the reduction of services to the community. It is still in a mode which would take more from the community and transfer the benefits to the rich. One can see this in the Opposition's commitment to abolishing capital gains taxes and its commitment to a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.   Mr KERR--So at this crucial point in time we face a paradigm shift. One only needs to look at the literature emerging from the United States and Great Britain. Everywhere now we see revisionism, apostasy and a recognition that the events of the 1980s, the bonfire of the vanities, the period of greed and bust, must be repudiated and a new language of politics developed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Labor in Australia has never been a victim of ideology. We were influenced, certainly through the 1980s, by the dominant views which were current in all First World economies, but were never totally the prisoner of those views. I made the point earlier about the way in which Labor protected fundamental values and fairness throughout that decade, notwithstanding the dominance of neo-conservatism. </PARA>
<PARA>  We do however face an ideological turning point now. The Liberal Party on the Opposition benches is seeking to put before the public its prescriptions for a repeat of the 1980s. On the other hand, Labor is seeking to move forward, unblinkered by neo-conservative, new right ideological prescription, looking instead to building on the fundamentals, looking to make sure that our economy can revitalise its manufacturing base, provide properly for the retirement of its elderly, and ensure that its sick can be cared for and its needy protected. </PARA>
<PARA>  I conclude by saying that the next election will certainly be the first time for many years that such a clear ideological gulf will be apparent, because the Opposition is still locked firmly into policies which increasingly throughout the world have been discredited and abandoned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to participate in what is commonly known as the Budget debate. The matter that I am raising again tonight is one that I am forced to raise because I have a private member's Bill before the House with very distinct provisions in it to come to grips with an industry that is out of control. I am talking about the abortion industry in this country. Therefore, I am devoting the majority of my speech to this very concerning aspect of an allocation in the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Abortion has been one of the most controversial moral, social, political, legal and medical issues of the 1970s and the 1980s, not just in Australia but in other developed countries with which we often compare ourselves, for example, Canada, New Zealand, Great Britain and the United States. It is impossible to go through life without establishing an attitude on the subject at a personal level, either in our own human relationships between husband and wife or in the attitudes that we as mothers and fathers convey to our children in their formative years. For many people abortion is the major issue of public importance facing Australia today. Yet, surprisingly, if we look at abortion as a major issue of public policy in Australia, it has been virtually neglected by us in our capacity as national legislators. </PARA>
<PARA>  It seems as if we have invested all our energy in attempts, important as they may be, to solve problems involving such subjects as interest rates, imports, whales, the Antarctic, woodchipping, tertiary amalgamations or the ozone layer but have run out of energy and compassion for the unborn human life destroyed in the abortion process. </PARA>
<PARA>  No-one can suggest that our Parliament has devoted an excess of its time to the subject of abortion. Quite the contrary. Of all the current issues of community concern, abortion must be the most neglected. On the other hand, not one year passes in the United States Congress or Senate without a major debate on some aspect of the abortion subject. There are also debates in congressional committees about public funding of abortion, international aid schemes which might involve support for abortion, and family planning projects which might be interwoven with abortion. Even the views about life issues expressed by nominees for vacancies on the United States Supreme Court are canvassed. The same capacity for debate on abortion, but certainly not the same opportunity, exists in this, our Australian Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  When are we going to debate the fact that the draft United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Australia signed in August 1990, has reduced the importance of its application to the child before birth, in contrast to the 1959 Declaration on the Rights of the Child? When are we going to debate the fact that Australian aid grants are funding international projects, the purpose of which is to develop the new RU-486 abortifacient drug and the new anti-hCG abortifacient vaccine? When are we going to have a say on Australia's continuing funding of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities which, by way of contrast, the United States Government has refused to fund since September 1985 because of its involvement in the Chinese population program, which includes forced abortions?</PARA>
<PARA>  When are we going to examine the Commonwealth's indirect subsidisation of abortions performed on public patients in State hospitals through its general underpinning of hospital finances through section 23 of the Health Insurance Act? How can any Federal parliamentarian, in the face of just these few examples, roll out the catchcry `But abortion is a State matter' or that other totally irrelevant abdication of responsibility, `Leave it to the courts'?</PARA>
<PARA>  Of all the ways in which the subject of abortion demands scrutiny by the national Parliament, that aspect which is most urgent, involves the greatest expenditure of money and is vehemently opposed by a significant section of the community is the continued funding of abortions through Medicare. Federal Parliament was never asked to vote on the original introduction of the abortion items into the medical benefits schedule. They were slipped into administrative practice under the cover of darkness. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill that I have put before Parliament on an earlier occasion represents the first legislative attempt in years to correct this wrong. The main abortion item--No. 6469--was originally identified as item 5570. It was introduced into the medical benefits schedule on 10 April 1974 by way of statutory rule No. 53 of 1974. It seems almost as if it sponsors one of the statutory rules which contained the specific abortion provision in place before the next election. Either by coincidence or design they were signed into effect by the Governor-General on the same day--10 April 1974--that the Prime Minister announced a double dissolution election. The next day Parliament was dissolved. A double dissolution had been in the offing publicly since at least 4 April, when the Prime Minister had threatened one. </PARA>
<PARA>  The important statutory rules were not tabled in Federal Parliament until three months later, on 9 July 1974, which was the first sitting day of the new Parliament after the double dissolution election held on 18 May 1974. This method of introducing a significant policy change, hidden within an administrative law change on the eve of an election, produced the practical effect of ensuring that it escaped effective legislative scrutiny. Neither its initial introduction, nor the later renumbering of item 5570 to 6469 by way of statutory rules No. 48 of 1975 and the introduction of items 274 and 275 on 1 October 1976, were debated or subject to a vote in either House of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no record of any public announcement, either in the Parliament or outside about this most significant development in 1974. There is no mention of it in the index to Hansard for that year, for either House. There is only one reference in the clippings and press statement files held by the Parliamentary Library for the subject headings of `Abortion', `Health Australia', `Department of Health', and `Minister for Health', or among the Department of Social Security set of clippings. At that time the health function was divided between two Ministers. The sole reference is in an article by a prominent New South Wales pro-abortionist that was published one month after the regulations had been promulgated. It indicates, in retrospect, that at least she knew that abortion had been listed as a distinct item for the first time, and I quote what she said:</PARA>
<PARA>The question of the payment of medical benefits for abortions was debated in Federal Parliament in March 1979 and, as a result of the vote taken, medical benefits continue to be payable for abortions performed in accordance with the law of a State or Territory. The Federal Government has no role in the enforcement of State laws. It is the responsibility of the States to ensure that the State laws covering abortions are enforced. The legal and ethical responsibility for determining medical need for any service rests with the individual medical practitioner operating within the framework or the relevant State or Territory law. </PARA>
<PARA>One could talk about extrinsic aids to interpretation--that is one of the best we have heard in a long while. The original Lusher motion was not a motion to amend statutory regulations, nor did it represent a piece of legislation of any form--even less so did the Simon amendment to the Lusher motion represent legislation as we know it. They were declaratory resolutions of the House. Had the Lusher motion been adopted, I am sure that its supporters would have then found it necessary to follow up with a specific item of legislation to implement the measure. But the result of the vote was good enough for the purpose of those bureaucrats who wanted to justify continued funding of abortions. </PARA>
<PARA>  Despite the many occasions when bureaucrats have completely ignored declaratory motions adopted by the Parliament, on this occasion they clothed the successful Simon amendment with the aura of legislative permanence. Now that we know what has been the practical result of what happened 10 years ago in this House, inaction on our part will represent a de facto endorsement of the path chosen by the bureaucracy. There can be no danger involved in attempting, and even failing on this initial occasion, because failure will not introduce something new--I am referring, of course, to my private member's Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even if one adopts the interpretation of the bureaucrats, purely for the purposes of analysis, one reaches the inevitable conclusion that the Commonwealth has a responsibility to act. It is as clear as crystal. The bureaucrats say that it is the responsibility of the States to ensure that the State laws covering abortions are enforced. But most of the States are not enforcing their own laws on abortion. In the largest State, New South Wales, abortion prosecutions were repeatedly `no billed' by successive State Attorneys-General until the Crown Solicitors got the message: `Don't bother us with initiating cases in that sphere'. </PARA>
<PARA>  When a community group attempted to obtain access to Medicare statistics as they related to individual doctors in New South Wales, so as to avoid initiating a stressful legal case based on an individual patient, and in order to prove that the very volume of abortions performed indicated that the doctors were abusing the law, the group was met with determined opposition before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court in a case which was spread over five years. They were opposed by the AMA, six doctors and two Sydney abortion clinics. The only ones who benefited was the phalanx of barristers and solicitors. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some people say that it should be left to the courts, but the courts have been tried in this and in other instances and they do not provide a suitable opportunity for achieving human rights for the smallest and most defenceless human beings in our community. The law on abortion must be one of the last remaining subjects not to have been scrutinised by the High Court. In 1983 the de facto husband of a woman who was about to abort their baby applied to the High Court in Canberra for special leave to appeal but the application was dismissed by the Chief Justice Sir Harry Gibbs on 30 March 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>  The very number of abortions subsidised by Medicare indicates that, contrary to the non- existence of any abortion on demand statute in Australia, Commonwealth funds are being used to underpin an abortion on demand industry in Australia. During 1990-91, abortionists were directly subsidised by the taxpayer for over 70,000 abortions, at a cost of $8.2m. This number was made up of 69,378 item 6469 abortions and 950 late term abortions--an increase of 10 per cent over the previous year--identified as item 274 and 275 claims. As well, there were other associated payments which netted the abortionists several million dollars more. </PARA>
<PARA>  The latest figures, which were released to a Senate Estimates Committee, represent an increase of 4,800 over the previous year and an increase of 7,600 over the past two years. Any increase in the number of births has been almost offset by an increase in subsidised abortions. Abortions are increasing at a proportionately higher rate than births, which is a most disturbing development. In the years that the abortion items have been in the medical benefits schedule, the Australian taxpayer has subsidised in excess of 800,000 deliberate abortions, at a total cost of $50m which, when adjusted to constant prices, is equivalent to over $80m at today's values. The cumulative volume is so high that it is having an adverse effect on the age structure of our population. The ready availability of Commonwealth subsidised abortions has contributed to the projection that in the year 2031 the percentage of people over 50 years of age will reach almost 40 per cent, compared to 24.5 per cent today. </PARA>
<PARA>  Medicare abortion funding is not just a one- off, occasional payment by the Commonwealth to underpin the Australian abortion industry in its provision of abortion on demand, which, as demonstrated by the volume alone, must represent a flagrant violation of the very precise and limited provisions of the abortion statutes in most States. The attitude of the medical abortionists is that the very act of asking for an abortion is sufficient reason for its performance by them. This is abortion on demand, and yet there is no statute in Australia of which I am aware that provides for abortion on demand. </PARA>
<PARA>  This has led to the de facto implementation in the States--and its availability to ACT residents--of that which the McKenzie-Lamb Bill of 1973 sought to achieve, despite the overwhelming rejection of that Bill by this House 16 years ago, to the tune of 98 votes to 23 in a cross-Party vote. Federal Parliament, which then had responsibility for the ACT, quite unambiguously said that it did not want abortion on demand in the ACT, which is what that Bill was all about. </PARA>
<PARA>  What resulted from the introduction of the Medicare abortion item less than 12 months after that decisive vote is that ACT residents were able to participate in abortion on demand, through Medicare's underpinning of the abortion industry, by just going into neighbouring New South Wales. How ironic that during the period 1973-75, when abortion on demand was being entrenched in the Australian community through its underwriting by the Medicare system, successful moves were being introduced in the Northern Territory, the ACT and in Victoria to abolish the death penalty. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is the background to the private member's Bill that has been introduced under my name and which is called the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 1990. It is a very short Bill. Its essential purpose is to remove the current entitlement to payment of Medicare benefit in respect of certain medical services which result in an abortion. While it removes the current abortion on demand entitlement, it does not remove the relevant items from the medical benefits schedule on which the Medicare benefits are based. The Bill preserves an entitlement to the benefit where the procedure resulting in the abortion has been carried out to avert the death of the pregnant woman, and also in the case where it was carried out for a different purpose entirely and the doctor did not know and had no reasonable expectation that an abortion would occur. </PARA>
<PARA>  There could be no other item numbers in the schedule under which benefits for abortion were claimed, but if that occurred it would have to involve illegality, deception or just plain confusion which, hopefully, would be identified by investigating officers in the Medicare fraud area. To specifically nominate these items in my Bill simply because they have a gynaecological connection could lead to unnecessary paperwork for claimants and doctors. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are no punitive fines in the Bill that I have proposed.  False certification in relation to any Medicare claims is already covered by existing section 128A of the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  On advice, I have allowed for an ample lead-in time of six months before the provisions of the Bill would come into effect. The general intention of the Bill has been known for months, since early May 1989 when it received nationwide publicity. The text of the Bill and the explanatory memorandum were also made available for public scrutiny before its first reading in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  Legislators have both a representative and a leadership role to undertake. We have to discern what is in the best interests of our nation, its people and its future generations. On some occasions we must lean heavily in the direction of those who can least afford to protect themselves. That is why we have a range of social benefits to support people in disadvantaged, crisis and emergency situations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia's unborn lack a strong voice or voices with courage to act. They are under threat from interests that are loud and articulate and supported by powerful voices in the community and even in this Parliament. Australia's unborn are in an emergency situation. Somebody said that the most dangerous place for any individual to be in the world today is in its mother's womb--and that is pretty right. It is not their quality of life that is being threatened; it is their very right to existence. Representatives and leaders in the community and in this Parliament must lean heavily in the direction of those threatened, small, innocent, defenceless human beings before it is too late because this practice that we are engaged in allowing to take place in this country, and to which we are seemingly turning a blind eye, has the capacity to destroy this nation, no matter what else we do in other areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- I would like to use the opportunity of this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) to discuss the Commonwealth Government's financial commitment to the citizens of the Northern Territory. At the same time I want to expose the speciousness of the Opposition's claims in relation to its policies, particularly its intentions for fiscal policy and the proposition that it would cut government expenditure by around $3 billion, and the conundrum in which the Opposition, and indeed the Northern Territory Government, find themselves in supporting such a policy while at the same time supporting a consumption tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Opposition masquerades as being caring and compassionate when its real intention--this was manifestly obvious from the presentations at Question Time yesterday and today of the various Ministers--is to boot the poor and the most disadvantaged people in our community. Of course, in many respects the people who are most disadvantaged in our community are some Northern Territory residents. As I have said, in the course of my address I will seek to expose the speciousness of the Opposition and the contradictions evident in the policies of the Opposition and the position that has been adopted by the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>  Before preparing this speech, I consulted an atlas and found that my electorate office in Darwin is further from Canberra than the electorate office of any other member. The distance of the Northern Territory from Canberra and the southern cities has encouraged a tendency for some members of the Northern Territory community, especially those in the CLP Northern Territory Government, to approach the whole issue of the Northern Territory's relationship with the rest of Australia in terms of a hairy-chested `we can do without you' mentality. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the Northern Territory, Canberra bashing has become an accepted part of the political debate; indeed, some people in the Northern Territory community have refined it to an art form. There is an extreme unwillingness on the part of the CLP Government, and indeed, I believe, the coalition parties, to accept that the Northern Territory economy is underpinned by the Commonwealth's financial commitment to Territorians. In its most absurd manifestation we even saw at the Premiers Conference earlier this year the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory say to other heads of government that he would be quite happy for the Northern Territory to cut off its dealings with southerners and join ASEAN. He may have said it tongue in cheek but I think it underscores the attitude that dominates the Northern Territory conservative parties. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am a staunch believer in the need for Australia generally, and for the Northern Territory in particular, to strengthen its ties with South East Asia; but this kind of statement indicates a clear failure to come to grips with the economic environment that faces the Northern Territory. I suggest that what is needed for the Northern Territory political culture is for it to receive a touch of glasnost when it comes to discussing the Territory's financial relations with the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Northern Territory Government would have us believe that the Northern Territory has been victimised in funding from the Commonwealth. This argument, used perennially by Northern Territory Ministers to explain the latest round of Northern Territory Government spending cuts or blow-outs in debt, masks the true position of the Commonwealth-Northern Territory financial relations. Firstly, it needs to be recognised that, in spite of stagnant population growth, Commonwealth payments to the Northern Territory Government will rise in real terms in 1991-92. According to the Northern Territory Government's own Budget papers, total Commonwealth gross payments to the Northern Territory will be $1.066 billion this financial year--an increase of some 4.6 per cent. With the assumption of an inflation rate of 3 per cent, this represents a very good result for the Northern Territory in a time of economic restraint and it contrasts with what is being promised in policy prescriptions from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is not the full story. General purpose funds to the Northern Territory will rise by 5.8 per cent to $817.6m, representing the Commonwealth's continuing commitment to the principles of fiscal equalisation. This formula represents a per capita allocation to the Northern Territory of $5,091 compared with a national average of $813--or 6.3 times that average. I understand that the Victorian and New South Wales governments--indeed, I have had some cause to make public comment about this--have some difficulties with the application of the principles of fiscal equalisation on the basis that they allege it discriminates against their own revenue needs. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is my firm belief that for Federal relations in Australia to be equitable the principle of fiscal equalisation must be retained and I hope and expect that officials of the Northern Territory Government, currently in discussions with the States and the Commonwealth leading up to the November Special Premiers Conference, are actively promoting this view. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another aspect of the ledger is the question of specific purpose funds. According to the bottom line of the Commonwealth Budget Papers, specific purpose payments to the Northern Territory will fall by 13.3 per cent to $249.1m in 1991-92. Rather predictably, the Northern Territory Government has latched on to this as evidence, apparently, of the Commonwealth's alleged lack of commitment to the Northern Territory. But the figures themselves tell a very different story and it is quite clear that, whilst there has been an overall reduction in the size of payments, there are extremely good reasons for it, and the Northern Territory Government understands that because it was directly involved in negotiations with the Commonwealth which led to those reductions. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fall in specific purpose payments to the Territory is accounted for by four separate payments. BTEC funding is down from $24m to $15.5m as a result of the phasing down of a long term agreement with the Northern Territory involving the finalisation of the BTEC program. The power and water authority electricity subsidy is reduced by $10m from $30m to $20m--again as part of the phasing down of an agreement made with the Northern Territory Government which became operational from the 1989-90 Budget--all very predictable and all understood by the Northern Territory Government. The Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement moneys were reduced from $40m to $26m--again as agreed to at the last CSHA meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>  Road funding money in the amount of $15m now appears in another part of the Budget as a result of the Special Premiers Conference agreement to untie local road moneys. This demonstrates that the Northern Territory Government, despite its rhetoric, fully appreciates, does understand and was party to agreements with the Commonwealth Government which it understood and knew would lead to a reduction in specific purpose payments to the Northern Territory. If these planned and agreed changes are taken out of the funding equations--that is, if we look at the size of funds actually negotiated in this year's Special Premiers Conference and aggregated in the Commonwealth Budget Papers--we see that the Northern Territory position is actually quite healthy. </PARA>
<PARA>  In fact, specific purpose payments to the Northern Territory, excluding these four types of payments--which, as I reiterate, were agreed to and understood certainly in the case of the CSHA and the PAWA money and the BTEC money--were parts of agreements made with the Northern Territory Government and were fully understood by it, as was, I might say, the decision by the Special Premiers Conference on road funding. In fact, specific purpose payments, as I have said, will rise by 5.2 per cent this financial year, if we exclude those four items. That is a very healthy situation, I am sure honourable members will agree. </PARA>
<PARA>  As to per capita payments, in overall terms, Commonwealth net per capita payments to the Northern Territory in 1991-92 will be $6,086. This is four times higher than the national average of $1,545. </PARA>
<PARA>  The point that needs to be understood from all of this is not just that the Northern Territory Government and the Northern Territory community have had the tangible support of this Government demonstrated through real budgetary outlays, but that this continues a long established pattern of support from the Hawke Labor Government. The Northern Territory has special needs dictated by distance, environment, a small population, and historical reality which have left many of its citizens, particularly Aboriginal people, amongst the poorest of the poor in our country and the people who would suffer most at the hands of a coalition government if, God forbid, one was ever elected into office. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Hawke Labor Government has responded by recognising the realities of the Northern Territory and also the huge opportunities, by investing in the growth and future of the Territory. In 1982-83, the Commonwealth provided the Northern Territory Government with a level of approved funding that was 273 per cent higher per person than the national average. By 1990-91 under the Hawke Government, this figure had grown to be 293 per cent higher than the national average. </PARA>
<PARA>  In indicating this support for the Hawke Government's financial support for the Northern Territory, I am not suggesting that the Government can rest on its laurels. Far from it. There remains a battle to be fought to ensure that the Northern Territory remains well funded, particularly as we enter crucial negotiations in future months regarding the future of federalism in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>  In addition to Commonwealth funding of the Northern Territory Government, it has especially in recent years made a number of large investment decisions in the Northern Territory for its own purposes that have greatly assisted the Northern Territory economy. In the 1990-91 Budget, expenditures which will assist the Northern Territory economy include $47m of defence capital works. The following is a list of some of the major items: $30m for the 2nd Cavalry Regiment deployment; $8m for the Tindal stage 2 development; and $1.7m for the first two phases of Tindal stage 3. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, the Defence Force Housing Authority is likely to make significant expenditures in the Territory as more Defence personnel are relocated north. By 1998, it is planned that 5,000 more Defence personnel and their families will be stationed in the Northern Territory than are currently stationed there. This will create a demand for in excess of 1,000 homes and have significant long term multiplier effects providing opportunities for industry and jobs for Territorians. </PARA>
<PARA>  In terms of the environment, the Budget announced two very significant initiatives for the Northern Territory: $2m for the control of mimosa pigra to stop its encroachment on Kakadu, and $7.2m for the Office of the Supervising Scientist and the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute. I would have liked to spend some time talking about the importance of these moneys, particularly in relation to mimosa pigra, but unfortunately time does not permit it, at least tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>  The factors I have outlined indicate that the Commonwealth Budget will bring substantial benefits to the Northern Territory economy. I have not addressed in my remarks so far the money which is coming in terms of specific programs to the Northern Territory quite separately from the specific purpose payments to the Northern Territory Government by the Commonwealth Government GBEs, such as Telecom and the ABC. The factors I have outlined should indicate that this Government has committed itself to sustaining a level of funding to the Northern Territory Government which has promoted growth. This is far different from the sort of approach which is being promoted by the Opposition parties. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I mentioned earlier, there needs to be a touch of glasnost in the political culture of the Northern Territory--including amongst some of its media. One commentator, Frank Alcorta, who writes for the Northern Territory News, and assumes, I might say, knowledge and expertise on subjects of which often, unfortunately, he clearly has little knowledge, wrote an article on 3 September which cannot be taken without comment. Mr Alcorta, in reference to the projected Commonwealth Budget deficit, said:</PARA>
<PARA>This blow-out will inevitably require that private sector spending and employment continue to be stifled. </PARA>
<PARA>For a person with even a passing knowledge of economics, this sort of analysis is unmitigated rubbish. As the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) clearly identified in his Budget Speech, the Budget remains in structural surplus when cyclical effects of the recession are taken into account. Far from providing a deficit blow-out, the Budget has been framed with sufficient flexibility to meet the effects of the recession. The assumed preference of Mr Alcorta would apparently be a scorched earth policy of slashing government expenditure at a time of recessed demand, the sort of proposition which is being promoted by the Opposition. This of course would have a devastating impact on the private investment which Mr Alcorta and others accuse the Government of holding back. </PARA>
<PARA>  According to the same economic model which the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), has been quoting extensively in recent times, expenditure cuts to bring the Budget into balance would reduce economic growth this year from the expected 1.5 per cent to 0.6 per cent and would cause an additional loss of jobs of 46,000. So on the one hand, Mr Alcorta is accusing the Commonwealth of putting private investment at risk and, on the other, is advocating a position which would damage the economy's recovery from the recession. Perhaps it is not surprising that it is a position similar to that which, after tortuous policy contortions, the Federal Opposition finds itself in. The absurdity of those propositions is self- evident. The argument is quite obviously contradictory and says a great deal about the absolute lack of economic understanding by those who promote it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I might also say that Mr Alcorta's vigorous and unjustified attack on the Commonwealth Budget deficit this year is complemented by his silence on the question of the Northern Territory Government's own deficit. Unlike the Commonwealth, which has a structural surplus when cyclical factors are taken into account, the Northern Territory Government has a deficit which has no explanation but economic mismanagement over a number of years. If I have time, I will come briefly to the issue of Northern Territory debt. Unfortunately, Mr Alcorta, a person whom I have known for many years and with whom, indeed, I would regard myself as being friendly, is not just economically illiterate. There is even a slight suspicion, I would think--just a hint, perhaps--of duplicity in his ill-informed observations and comment about these matters. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commonwealth expenditure continues to underpin the economy of the Northern Territory. It amazes me, therefore, that the CLP Government of the Territory persists in running economic policy along the lines of an economic myth--the myth being that, without the Commonwealth, the Territory might be a better place. In fact, Commonwealth allocations to the Northern Territory Government finance approximately 70 per cent of the Northern Territory Government's so-called inner budget sector--excluding, that is, GBEs and statutory authorities. Private capital is of growing importance to the Territory, especially in the tourism and mining sectors. While there is no doubt about the importance of this investment in stimulating private sector growth, the relative importance of the private sector as a source of employment or as a contributor to regional multiplier effects is sometimes poorly understood and, for some sectors, overstated. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this respect, I was interested to hear recently an interview with Mr Geoff Stewart, of Tanami Gold, on this matter. Mr Stewart replied to a question of whether a promising new find would create many new jobs by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>We employ less than 100 men. . . I think we move something like 7 million tonnes of earth a year and not many people do that. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, when Mr Stewart was asked what the impact for the Territory would be, he replied:</PARA>
<PARA>The chief beneficiary from gold mining at the moment is export income for Australia, not many jobs for Territorians, not much royalty for Territorians so as I say the chief beneficiary is export income to buy our Toyotas. </PARA>
<PARA>While mining is, of course, important for the nation, it may not have the regional importance that some might have us believe. </PARA>
<PARA>  I contrast this with the regional impact of expenditures by Aboriginal affairs. Expenditures to Aboriginal people have very strong and localised multipliers which can contribute significantly to local income generation. In 1988 a study of the central Australian region concluded that approximately one-third of all regional expenditure was attributable to Aboriginal people and their organisations. I stress that this is not just what some would call `welfare payments', or transfers as a result of Commonwealth appropriations; a considerable proportion--an estimated 20 per cent--was derived from the commercial activities of Aboriginal organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Furthermore, the contribution of Aboriginal peoples' cultural heritage would add significantly to tourism revenue in places like Kakadu and Uluru. This underlines the ever increasing importance of Commonwealth appropriations in terms of stabilising the Northern Territory and providing it with the basis on which it can grow. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commonwealth's contribution to the Northern Territory would be threatened by the election of a Liberal-National Party coalition with a policy not only of introducing a consumption tax but also with the twin evil of addressing the fiscal side of the Budget by cutting $3 billion from the Budget. A consumption tax would hit the Northern Territory hard because of its generally higher prices. </PARA>
<PARA>  We heard today from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) when he addressed the issue of a consumption tax and its impact on regional Australia. Aboriginal people in remote areas are the people who have most to lose and who would be dramatically affected. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have highlighted the conflict--the inherent contradictions--which exists in the Opposition's policies, a position which has been adopted and appropriated by the Northern Territory Government in supporting a proposition that not only would attack the weakest in our community but also would see cuts in government expenditure which would have a detrimental impact upon the Northern Territory economy. One estimate of the impact of a $3 billion cut in government outlays from the Federal sphere on the Northern Territory economy is a loss of between $200m and $250m--an enormous amount of money out of a Budget of just over $1 billion in terms of Commonwealth appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important to understand that those are the sorts of policies which have been advocated by the CLP, and by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) here in this House. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-For much of the time this House is justifiably preoccupied with debate about the course of the national economy. The attention of honourable members is focused on key economic indicators and the larger market related structural issues affecting rates of economic activity. In the time I have available I would like to bring some specificity to this debate in respect of the place of technological change in these wider issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In itself this is a complex issue, but my particular concern on this occasion is with the role of engineering in the national economy. Generally speaking, there is something of a debate amongst economic historians as to the causal status of technology and the growth, expansion and competitiveness of economics. This debate has become clouded ever since technologies and technological skills became more diffused across the global economy in the last 50 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since no-one owns or has exclusivity to appropriated technical knowledge, the issue of the technological intensity of a nation's industrial base reflects on the dynamism of the whole production process. That is to say, what determines the scope of technological advantages enjoyed by one nation's firms and companies over another's is not solely the possession of technology as such; it is, rather, the forces at work across their economies which prompt wide scale commitments to innovation and change. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the case of engineering it is difficult to verify empirically the benefits the profession brings to the performance of companies. This is not just because the extent to which industry is able to draw on engineering skills is dependent upon its commercial incentive and managerial disposition to do so; rather, it is because engineering impacts on such a broad range of manufacturing and industrial activities that any formal analysis of its role will never do it sufficient justice. </PARA>
<PARA>  Importantly, the Institution of Engineers placed these and other issues on the public agenda at its engineering summit held here in Canberra in July. The summit formed part of ongoing and prolific efforts by the Institution of Engineers to build a greater appreciation of the role of engineers within the community. More broadly, the summit also served to alert policy makers to the role of technological restructuring in the wider economic debate. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has traditionally existed a narrow view of the role of engineering in the economy. At the risk of simplifying matters even more, engineers have conventionally been viewed as operating at the back end of the innovation process, that is, they apply available knowledge rather than create it. They have been more active in designing, installing and maintaining equipment essential to production processes rather than having a deeper role therein. This is a shallow analysis of the role of engineering in promoting innovation. Engineering now comprises much more than the conventionally understood fields of civil, mechanical, chemical, mining and metallurgical engineering. The skill base of engineering has both deepened and widened, as has its impact across the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  These conventional sub-disciplines now require even deeper immersion in core science disciplines, such as mathematics, chemistry, geology, physics and computer sciences. Moreover, engineers have integrated their skills into management processes, adding to the capacity of industry to oversee technological resources and use them effectively as instruments for achieving market advantages. I point out that Australia still does not make proper use of its engineers as do other countries. Australia has two management level engineers per 1,000 of the work force, whilst the United States of America has six and the United Kingdom, Germany and France have double Australia's rate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Regardless of this, the burgeoning information industry has also given birth to new sub-fields such as micro-electronic engineering. This relatively new sub-field of engineering integrates engineering design skills with developments in information technology. Its main focus is on sophisticated component design and it is at the forefront of developments in micro-chip technologies and integrated circuitry. Graduation rates in electronics and communications related engineering have jumped markedly over the decade, surpassing growth in traditional sub- fields such as civil engineering. </PARA>
<PARA>  This House hears a great deal of claims that Australia must move into a post-industrial phase of its economy which emphasises value added manufacturing and knowledge intensive industrial activities. There is a great deal of talk about the necessity for Australian companies to incorporate advanced manufacturing technology, optimal design techniques and so forth. Capabilities of this sort are at the heart of successful exports of any elaborately transformed manufactured products. But in the absence of an industrial base which is capable of cutting it with the best in the global market, adapting to rapidly shifting consumer demands and technically flexible enough to swing resources into new areas of market opportunities, this will hardly come about. Notwithstanding this, when the structural impediments to competition which drive these changes have been swept away, it will be the engineers who will be at the forefront of the new industrial era of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>  Generally, the spill-over effect on the economy of engineering as a generic activity increases every year. Apart from its more obvious role in design, engineering has other more critical but less visible roles in the technology transfer process. In a broad sense, while commercial forces may well guide skill and capital formation processes across the economy, the diffusion of knowledge itself--a critical factor in the innovation process--is a key responsibility of engineers. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whether or not it is possible to transfer new techniques and processes across the economy will be a function of the existence of a suitably well-trained and available engineering capability. Engineering, then, is far from being of only marginal significance to the overall innovation process. It is not only a technological activity which applies knowledge in a rudimentary sense to create products or to make existing production processes more efficient, but product design skills and the capacity to build incremental improvements into existing production processes will also be very important, especially in respect to the general productivity gains they bring. </PARA>
<PARA>  But engineers also provide the means by which new knowledge is effectively diffused or transmitted across the economy. This is a critical matter to which too little attention has been paid. The competitiveness of industry is greatly retarded, therefore, if its technical competency to rapidly commercialise intellectual property is restricted. Even assuming a firm can reach a position to gain a foot in a newly emerged market, its capacity to hold that ground also largely bears on technical matters. Constant improvements in product design and reliability and the lowering of overall production costs also fall at the feet of engineers; in hand, of course, with a management which is capable and able to grasp the linkages of its technology strategies with its business plans. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would add that engineering also has an important role to play at the front end, if you like, of the innovation process. There is a great deal of untapped research potential amongst Australia's engineering community. There is a persistent belief that engineering research is poor science. That is because of its assumed exclusivity whereby its applied focus is more on design and product formation. There seems to be an assumption that engineering has no underlying research capability which could confer advantages on the community in the way that basic and strategic research does. </PARA>
<PARA>  More specifically, it is held by some that, as engineering research emphasises invention and innovation over discovery and explanation, it does not present the same publication or academic oriented profile as other sciences. Given its other roles, as I have outlined, it is important that engineering is not excluded from consideration in respect of its research potential. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is much higher quality engineering research carried out which is oriented to further explanation. Work on the application of mathematics and computing to solve problems in the properties of materials is a case in point. According to the 1990 ASTEC report entitled Government Funding of Academic and Related Research in Australia: An International Comparison, engineering research in Australia is seriously underfunded in comparison to research in other OECD countries. In fact, the report found that engineering related research in Australia received less than half the level of funding that it received in six other OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are idiosyncrasies of engineering related research which give it a profile which is difficult to reconcile within the guidelines governing the administrative bodies which allocate research grants. In some ways its positioning here is akin to the discipline of psychology which struggles to assert its research profile as being either a social science or a science. These apparent anomalies deserve attention. </PARA>
<PARA>  If administrative mechanisms are to determine the allocation of research resources, it ought to be transparent why some research is funded and not other research. Also, it ought to be explained, in considered terms, how the balance in the distribution of the research funds, for which there is a responsibility, is determined. </PARA>
<PARA>  In respect of the Australian Research Council, the subcommittee which has responsibility for the allocation of grants for engineering also has responsibility for grant allocations for earth sciences and applied sciences. I do not wish to take anything away from Australia's earth and applied sciences research effort, but as a percentage of available research funds under the control of the relevant committee, engineering receives little more than 16 per cent--16.3 per cent in 1990. Perhaps it is the case that there are too few researchers in the field of engineering design, or else there are too few who present appropriately high quality submissions for funding. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is, of course, an argument here, but I would be anxious to know what philosophy guides the ARC in respect of such arguments. How, for instance, do administrative mechanisms such as those which guide the ARC account for such matters as the relative paucity of Australia's engineering research capabilities?  Who determines what constitutes a suitable or appropriate level of research activity in a given field?  What scope is given to the definition of the advancement of knowledge which guides the distribution of ARC funds, and where is the cut-off line between basic and applied research?  I for one do appreciate the administrative difficulties associated with these matters; it is nevertheless a source of concern to me that Australia might well be failing to capture the benefits of what is presently a latent research capacity in respect of engineering. </PARA>
<PARA>  More important than this, however, is the more fundamental issue of locking engineering research into an expanding industrial base. Given its close industry linkages, engineering research should be centred within the private sector. This is certainly the case abroad. Business funded engineering research in such areas as aeronautical engineering and microelectronics dwarfs public sector funded research efforts in universities and other agencies. It is no wonder, then, that Australia has about one-third the number of engineering researchers as Japan, one-fifth as many as the United States of America and one-eighth as many as Germany. </PARA>
<PARA>  Yet once again significant changes in this regard will not come about in Australia until such time as it develops internationally competitive firms or industry sectors which are able to capture the commercial benefits of fundamental or strategic engineering research. Notwithstanding this, Australia does have one pocket of internationally recognised engineering research. That is in the subfield of chemical engineering, which has a significant scientific output. Here is the lesson. The chemicals industry in Australia is strong, despite its difficulties at present. The presence of such companies as ICI and Shell has provided the industrial strength, the market pull, to create an impressive and diverse research capacity in chemical engineering. </PARA>
<PARA>  Generally speaking, the correlation between the areas of competitive industrial activity and a nation's relative research capabilities is always strong, and it is even stronger in respect of its linkages with the education system generally. There is a real need to provide greater direction to the way in which Australia approaches the training and education of its engineers. On the basis of studies carried out by the Institution of Engineers, there are good reasons to be concerned about the future availability of sufficient engineers to meet national needs. At the moment Australia recruits from abroad about 3,000 engineers annually. But future international demand for engineers is such that these sources of engineering skills will soon dry up. </PARA>
<PARA>  The current number of qualified engineers in Australia amounts to a little more than one per cent of the work force, or some 92,000 appropriately trained individuals, which is half that of our trading rivals and half the targeted 2 per cent pursued by regional countries. The Australian figures are a little inflated. Only about 72,000 are actually part of the work force, so the number of engineers in employment as a percentage of the work force is more likely to be around 0.9 per cent. Though engineering's share of the total allocation of university enrolments has picked up from 6.9 per cent to 7.5 per cent over the decade, there is still inadequate momentum in the discipline to guarantee future supply. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said earlier, if this country is to elbow its way into the traded goods sector, it will not do so in the absence of a high level design and engineering capability. But this will not come about within the centralised framework of the existing higher education sector. The opportunities for close collaboration between universities and the engineering community are considerable. The major engineering professional society, the Institution of Engineers (Australia), has conducted its own close and detailed review of the educational requirements of the next generation of engineers. </PARA>
<PARA>  It stands ready to work with universities to restructure engineering courses which reflect changes in the disciplines and to provide a match-up between student demand and industry needs in both vocational and educational respects. The Institution of Engineers has devised a restructured approach to training and education which meets the diversity of industry needs while maintaining an eye on qualitative concerns. It is positioned to build bridges between industries with heavy interests in engineering to revitalise and bring direction to the engineering discipline. In so doing the Institution of Engineers has also provided its own industry based approach to work force restructuring by providing an articulated career structure for engineers who enter the profession at different levels and for different purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>  Initiatives such as these might sound novel in Australia but they are conventional wisdom abroad. Those countries which possess international renown and high level skill transfer capabilities are characterised by close linkages between educational institutions and industry sectors. Australia needs to provide for institutional flexibility to seize the opportunities that have come the way of our international competitors. But outcomes such as these will not be achieved within the structure of our existing higher education sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  By way of conclusion: it must be understood that Australia has much to gain from developing a stronger engineering capacity, but equally it must be appreciated that the extent to which the nation or an individual firm can capitalise on the engineering capabilities--as with technology as a whole--is itself dependent upon the efficiencies which can be won across the chain of production; that is, the degree to which Australia's industries take advantage of engineering and invest more heavily in technology acquisition, design and development programs is profoundly affected by other forces making for innovation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is with pleasure that I speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1). This Budget, as we are all aware, was one framed for difficult economic times, and some difficult economic decisions had to be taken. However, there were many beneficial outcomes in the Budget, benefits which will have a positive outcome on all Australians. This Budget has a strong vision for the future and contains a range of new initiatives which build a better Australia for all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It contains a number of significant initiatives such as the progressive enhancement of a comprehensive national superannuation scheme, additional resources for child-care, the expansion of the community cultural, sports and recreation facilities program, the enhancement of the capital works program in our tertiary institutions, considerable expansion of labour market programs, and the establishment of the building better cities program, to name just some of the visionary new projects. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget is about providing restraint with equity. It is not, as some have argued for, full of pump-priming measures to stimulate the economy, nor is it, as those opposite have argued for, a balanced Budget, in which reduced Commonwealth outlays would have worsened our unemployment situation--as the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) pointed out yesterday--and reduced GDP by about one per cent. This Budget is a responsible one for difficult times which has produced many pluses. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the major features of the Budget was the announcement of an additional $30m to be spent over three years for the community cultural, sports and recreation facilities program. This comes on top of the $20m which has been distributed over the past three years. I take great pleasure in seeing this program extended, as earlier this year, on 18 April, I moved a motion in this House seeking an expansion of the community cultural, sports and recreation facilities program. The reason I moved that motion was to ensure that the Government had time to develop an extension of the program and incorporate it into the budgetary process, and to highlight the importance of this financial assistance in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>  This program will assist local sporting groups to build new facilities and to upgrade existing facilities. This is welcome news to groups in my electorate such as the Brisbane Metropolitan Touch Football Association, which has recently decided to build a new clubhouse at its playing fields in the suburb of Whites Hill. I was pleased to be invited to the trophy presentation night of the Association which was held last Saturday. At the presentation night all were strongly in support of the new program. This program forms only part of the sports funding component of the Budget and that is only a small part of the overall Budget package. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government also announced substantial assistance for families. It has allocated an additional $124m in the next financial year and $186m in 1993-94 to family allowances. From 1 April next year the family allowance supplement income threshold will rise a further $1,300 to $19,300. This base will then be indexed from January the following year. This will provide increased assistance to more than 100,000 families in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Similarly, child-care was another big winner from the Budget. Child-care is an issue on which the Government campaigned quite heavily in the last election and it is one on which this Labor Government has delivered consistently. I know that in my own electorate of Moreton, since becoming its member some 18 months ago, I have seen the number of child-care places dramatically expand. Child- care is a major part of the Government's commitment to social justice. By providing affordable and accessible child-care, the Government is committed to maximising the opportunity for people seeking training and employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has increased fee relief for working parents by extending long day care fee relief for those using child-care for work related purposes. The advances in child-care will have a significant effect on employment opportunities which are available for women by encouraging greater mobility within the work force. In doing so, however, the Government still recognises the family as the principal provider of child-care. Child-care will be more generous for families in receipt of family allowance supplement, as well as for working families on higher incomes. In this Budget the Government has reaffirmed its 1990 election promise of affordability of child-care with quality programs, and for this it must be highly commended. </PARA>
<PARA>  Students receiving financial support will also benefit from the Budget. It has always been the aim of this Government to increase educational opportunities for all Australians and improved educational outcomes for disadvantaged students. The Budget has assisted in this process by improving and simplifying Austudy. With school retention rates now much higher than they were a decade ago, there is also an increasing number of people going on to higher education. These are people who previously, because of financial or social disadvantage, would not have had the opportunity or access to tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this Budget we have seen the raising of the personal income threshold from $4,000 to $5,000, an increase of 25 per cent. This is a measure which is welcomed by all students on Austudy. Earlier this year, as a member of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training inquiring into the provision and effectiveness of student financial assistance schemes, I met with student representatives from all over Australia who came before the Committee. They were unanimous in their view that the allowable personal income limit was insufficient and that it had to be increased. I am pleased to see that the Government has decided to follow through by increasing the personal income limit. </PARA>
<PARA>  Within the Employment, Education and Training portfolio, $420m was allocated to the TAFE system. This represents an increase in real terms of 5 per cent. The area of vocational training is one which clearly separates the Government from those opposite. This Government is committed to providing substantial training opportunities for people so that when the economy recovers younger people in particular will have greater access to jobs. This contrasts markedly with the position of our conservative opponents, who, in the lead-up to the last election, had a policy of abolishing Skillshare and a host of other Labor market programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the same time as they had this policy, many Liberal members who had Skillshare centres in their electorates were deliberately misleading the management committees of those Skillshare programs by telling them they would be retained in their electorates. I am fortunate to have an exceptional Skillshare centre in my electorate at Mount Gravatt, managed by Mr Ross Garnett. Even in these difficult economic times Mount Gravatt Skillshare has achieved a 70 per cent job placement rate. This is an outstanding performance due to the excellence of the training and the successful partnership between local employers and the Skillshare committee. </PARA>
<PARA>  National superannuation was perhaps the most significant long term feature announced in the Budget. The right to a guaranteed retirement income is a major priority of this Government. The Government has been concerned that low and middle income earners have been missing out on superannuation, which for a long time has been the sole preserve of the wealthy. The Government committed itself to the process of guaranteed superannuation when, in 1986, through the accord process, workers on awards were granted a 3 per cent pay rise to be taken in the form of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The problem with a superannuation contribution of only 3 per cent is that it is not enough to provide completely for adequate retirement incomes. This, in combination with non-compliance by some employers, has resulted in the Government's decision to legislate for guaranteed superannuation. This legislation is a necessary and visionary step taken by this Government. With an ageing population and taxation receipts as a share of GDP reducing, it is essential that as many people as possible are covered by a superannuation program. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the Government's most positive and beneficial Budget decisions was to address the crisis facing our cities through the building better cities program. This program demonstrates vision and foresight and addresses social and physical problems of our cities and not simply the economic problems of their inhabitants. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our cities are in crisis and, if left unaddressed, the problems will exacerbate. There are immense challenges facing all levels of government in reshaping urban environments. If we maintain our existing processes, these problems would increase and result in greater social dislocation and the resultant social problems. </PARA>
<PARA>  During the coming decade, Australia will require substantial investment in new urban infrastructure. This infrastructure is required to enable land to be brought into urban use, to facilitate redevelopment and to replace and improve outworn infrastructure. New investment and replacement will be required if governments give more emphasis to urban consolidation and to increasing the density of land use within existing built-up areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under any assumptions, a substantial amount of land will have to be newly serviced to bring it into urban use to meet the needs of the forecast growth in Australia's population. At present, approximately 60 per cent of our nation's population live in five cities. Over the next decade, Australia will need more than 1.2 million dwellings, of which 700,000 will be built on the fringes of our major cities, if the trend continues. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the coming decade, new urban settlement and redevelopment of existing areas will be required both in large metropolitan areas of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane and in the smaller provincial towns. The financing of urban infrastructure is becoming more difficult as a consequence of the restrictions placed on public spending and borrowing at all levels of government. As a consequence, attention is being directed at the efficiency and equity of alternative methods of financing. </PARA>
<PARA>  Efficiency means making sure that resources are devoted to socially most valuable ends, and at the same time using as few resources as possible. This involves taking account of the external effects of decisions as well as the needs and demands of users. The Economic Planning and Advisory Council estimates that it costs nearly $70,000 to provide infrastructure for each new housing block in outer Sydney. In Victoria, for 1989- 90, $200m was spent on water and sewerage in fringe areas, as was $80m on each of education and roads, and $45m on health facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  Although Australia is one of the most urbanised nations in the world, up to this time there has been only sporadic debate about the quality of our urbanisation and its future. The building better cities program in this Budget changes that. The last major debate on this issue occurred in the 1970s during the period of the Whitlam Government. Although efforts by Whitlam to get the issue of urban equality were debated, there is little in the way of a remaining legacy. The question should not be therefore, `Why persist with a program such as building better cities?', but, `Why has it taken so long to do something like this?'. </PARA>
<PARA>  While the Whitlam Government did attempt to comprehend the structure of our cities and did try to consider some aspects of it, it did not change the fundamental nature of our urban environment. Australian towns and cities are facing a real crisis. With housing and land in short supply and prices for those social goods escalating, more and more people are living on the fringes of cities. The provision of jobs, services and other infrastructure is not keeping pace with the rapid growth of such communities. Even in more established areas, infrastructure is becoming more run down and has become inadequate for the needs of people. These factors have combined with high levels of social dislocation stemming from limited economic opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commonwealth Government, in conjunction with the States, has begun the task of rebuilding Australia's national infrastructure in areas such as road and rail networks and electricity generation and distribution. There is also at present a major restructure of our telecommunications services and the overhaul of our ports. The restructuring of industry, and with it changes in the location and type of employment, is accelerating in cities. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the objectives of the better cities program is to reduce the cost of infrastructure, and that would be of benefit to industry, governments and households. There is a need for urban consolidation and for a more efficient and equitable approach to the provision and financing of urban infrastructure. The growth of major cities in the past few decades has left us with under-used resources in established areas and huge costs in providing for unchecked growth at the fringes. </PARA>
<PARA>  The continued spread at the fringes means that there is almost total dependency on the use of private cars. This results in a car oriented community with long journeys to work, education or training. Fuel consumption in Australian cities is at least double that of an average European city. The resultant high level of greenhouse gases and other pollutants has degraded our living environment and is contributing to global problems in atmospheric warming and efficient use of energy resources. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under the building better cities program, the Commonwealth will work with State and local governments to improve access to work and services, to seek to reduce pollution and congestion with better transport systems, as well as providing innovative housing styles which better suit the changing needs of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  As most Australians live in urban areas, the crisis must be addressed. The Brundtland Commission report, Our Common Future, reported that the majority of our environmental problems in the future will be urban problems. These problems must be addressed now if major social dislocation and the resultant problems are to be avoided in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government will carry through the process of reform that will make a great difference to the quality of life in Australian cities and will help to achieve, on the basis of both new and existing infrastructure, very significant reforms in the efficiency of Australian cities which will benefit all Australians. This Budget provides the basis for allowing a sustained economic recovery, while providing new, innovative and positive programs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I welcome the opportunity to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1991-92. I briefly want to reflect on the traumatic events of the week of 20 August 1991. We saw then red hot emotions in Moscow, a huge chemical fire in Melbourne and a Budget which went up in smoke in Canberra. The Budget has been panned by every leading editorial writer throughout this country. It does nothing to address the major problems confronting Australia at this moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Budget has the imprimatur of the Hawke-Keating-Kerin forces over the top of it. No-one could truly describe it as a Hawke- Keating Budget, nor could anyone describe it as being a Hawke-Kerin Budget. There are elements of both policies pervading the whole of this Budget document. What started out as a forecast 1990-91 surplus of over $8 billion has deteriorated in just one year to a proposed forecast deficit of $4.7 billion, which leads us to conclude that almost $13 billion has been turned around on the Budget in just one year.</PARA>
<PARA>  The major issue which has not been confronted by the Hawke-Keating-Kerin Budget, particularly, is unemployment. Unemployment in this country is a national tragedy. The unemployed are the casualties of this failed policy, this failed Government. There are now 831,900 Australians officially out of work. On the Government's own estimates, this figure is expected to rise to over one million. Unemployment is now at 9.8 per cent and is predicted by the Government to rise to 10.75 per cent. In July, 44,000 Australians gave up the task of looking for a job because there were no jobs available for them. Since the last election, in March 1990, 322,000 Australians have lost their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to put that into context because in my own electorate of Bendigo there are extremely high unemployment levels. In the city of Bendigo, over 15 per cent of the population is unemployed and in the city of Maryborough, it is over 18 per cent. But the figure of 322,000 Australians who have lost their jobs in just over one year represents the total population of the city of Geelong, the city of Bendigo, the city of Ballarat, the city of Maryborough and the town of Kyneton. These are all major population centres in the State of Victoria, and this figure represents every man, woman and child--the total population--of all of those areas. That is what the figure of 322,000 represents. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we want another example of what 322,000 unemployed people look like, it is more than three times the number of people who attended the AFL grand final last year, and maybe four times more than will attend the grand final at Waverley this year. We should have a look at those people on grand final day and remember that four times that number have lost their jobs since the last election. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nearly two million Australians are unable to work as much or as often as they wish to work. More than 160,000 Australian households now have the breadwinner unemployed--an increase of 50,000, or 45 per cent, in a single year. Today at Question Time, I raised just one example of the impact that unemployment is having in my electorate. I detailed the instance of Raymond, the 45- year-old office manager who lost his job more than 12 months ago and now applies for positions all throughout the area, and right throughout Victoria, and often is told that he is too old or overskilled for the positions for which he applies. </PARA>
<PARA>  These are the human costs of unemployment for many thousands in my own electorate, throughout Victoria and throughout Australia--and the number is heading towards well over one million. Who can say where it will end?  In response to many questions on financial and economic management, the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) has said, `Your guess is as good as mine'. There is a lack of direction and no attempt in this Budget whatsoever to do something to get the economy right and to assist people who are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the major thrusts of the Budget has been the decision by the Government to divert more savings into superannuation in this nation. We will see a gradual progression of funds moving into the superannuation field and under a proposed superannuation guarantee levy, all employers with an annual payroll exceeding $500,000 will be required to pay 5 per cent of each employee's salary as superannuation. Smaller employers will be required to pay 3 per cent. That will transfer more and more savings into areas of superannuation. That would be fine if this country could afford it; but we have to look at where it will take those savings from. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the areas that I believe those savings will be diverted from is the housing area. Everyone in this country at the moment recognises how difficult it is for young people to obtain the gap--the money that they can put down on a deposit to enable them to purchase their first home. It requires a tremendous effort by a young couple, generally with both in the work force and contributing to the repayments on that first home. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's proposal to divert funds more and more into the superannuation area will ultimately mean a 9 per cent employer contribution--which is its target--and almost matching contributions from the employee. That employee contribution will be directed away from the housing area and will make it more and more difficult for young people to obtain a home. They will also find that much of the available capital in this country will be going into superannuation funds and the fund managers, whoever they might be, will be attracted to higher rate investments than housing. Housing will be one of the funds' lower priorities;  it will not be their top priority. The fund managers will be looking for a greater rate of return for the people who have superannuation and who have investments with the funds. </PARA>
<PARA>  We will see an erosion in this country of savings and the capacity to divert those savings into the housing industry in Australia, and of the ability to provide homes for thousands and thousands of young Australians. We will probably be seeing in Australia that owning a home, instead of being the great Australian dream, will become a nightmare--particularly for the average workers trying to establish themselves in a home. </PARA>
<PARA>  In March 1983 when the Government came into office, the average monthly home loan repayment was $350, or 19 per cent of the median family income. By March 1991 the average monthly home loan repayment was $906 per month, or 31 per cent of the median family income. This is a 63 per cent increase in the cost of housing for the average family and is reflected in the housing affordability index--measuring house repayments and average incomes--which has declined by 30 per cent between 1984 and 1991, making the task of establishing a home and a haven for their family an absolute nightmare for average income earners. </PARA>
<PARA>  The transference of superannuation funds will have another impact as well because small business in this country is already reeling from the high interest rate policies which were adopted by the Hawke-Keating-Kerin Government, and the small business sector in this country has been on its knees. Now we are finding that the employers--many of them are small to medium size business owners--will be required to pay a 5 per cent superannuation contribution from 1 July this year. More and more funds will be transferred away from the small business operator who is already struggling to keep on top of the economic climate, with a downturn in sales, particularly reduced retail sales, month by month for the past 18 months. Now we see a diversion of further funds away from that business into superannuation. It will mean that many small business owners who are above the $500,000 cut-off point, where they go to the 5 per cent payment of superannuation, will reduce their annual payrolls by removing and eliminating some of their staff by retrenchments or offering them some alternative. They will move them out of the work force in a number of different ways so they can reduce that payroll and still contribute only 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  We will find a contraction of small business throughout this country by the elimination or retrenchments of staff to bring them down to below that limit so that they are only required to pay 3 per cent. I am sure that that will have an impact--it is almost a type of payroll tax--and will force employers to look very seriously at the level of work force that they employ. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other issue that I want to address is the matter that I understand was introduced into the Budget by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe)--that is, the building better cities program. The proposal to plough $800m over five years into a partnership with the States to improve the quality of life in Australian cities, especially through increased housing choices, better matching of housing with jobs and services and improved public transport has been attributed to the Deputy Prime Minister. If we use those criteria, the Government can only be talking about the major cities of Australia. It can only be talking about the likes of Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VT4">Mr REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There are a number of points related to this. The honourable member for Moreton raised this during his contribution to the appropriation debate and said it would assist small towns. I can tell him that there is no public transport in small towns so I do not know how the Government will improve the public transport in some of these areas because it does not even have a base to start from. The Labor Party policies in this area are generally directed--I am sure that this will prove to be no exception--to shoring up its support in marginal Labor held seats in city electorates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government has given out grand plans of spending $800m, with no details whatsoever. In fact, when the Deputy Prime Minister was asked to give some details, he could not provide any details. He said, `We'll leave that to the States and local government; they'll fix it all up'. The Government will put $800m into this program over five years. It has tremendous grand plans; it will build a couple of monuments in each of the major cities. None of the provincial cities or small country areas are likely to share in the program at all. I see that the honourable member for Moreton is shaking his head. I hope that I am wrong. I would like him to demonstrate over the next few years that provincial cities such as Bendigo, Ballarat, Geelong and smaller country centres benefit from this plan. I feel quite confident that that will not be the case. I have seen the grand plans that were laid by a former Minister in this House, Tom Uren. I am sure that the money will be spent in the capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is looking at more expensive infrastructure in city areas. It is about $30,000 per block more expensive to provide infrastructure in the city of Melbourne than it is in the city of Bendigo. The Government is intending to provide expensive infrastructure in the capital cities of Australia to provide opportunities for residents of those large city areas to have improved facilities. That is all very fine, but it is neglecting the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  When I come to that aspect of it, what better stimulus could the Government have given than ploughing some money into the rural sector of Australia? The general economy of Australia is dependent on three factors: rural production, which is one of our major export earners; resources, and our valued added products from those resources; and our manufacturing sector. They are the three main driving forces of the Australian economy. The rural sector has been neglected in this Budget yet again. Ignoring rural sector enterprise and the rural sector throughout Australia is becoming a common theme of the Hawke-Keating-Kerin policies. The rural sector is one of our greatest export earners but is in desperate trouble at the moment through lower prices for wool and wheat production. The rural sector would have been a great beneficiary if the Government could have found some assistance, even some of the $800m which is being put into the better cities program that the Government is contemplating. </PARA>
<PARA>   I would like to touch briefly on only one other topic. What is needed in Australia is the provision of incentive for people to get out and create enterprise. We will not be able to create any enterprise or any worthwhile business activity in this country unless we have a massive overhaul of the taxation system. I have been to a number of large public meetings recently where I have posed the question: are you happy with Australia's taxation system as it exists today? The universal answer to that is no. That is a very good point to start from. We need to do a complete overhaul of the taxation system in this country and provide some incentive for people to become enterprising again and employ people in this nation to create wealth for this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am pleased to speak on the Appropriation Bill. There has been quite a wide ranging debate and there have been many useful contributions. There has been much debate in the community and in this House about the Budget. I say at the outset that it is a realistic Budget, given the current economic situation. It is a Budget that not only takes account of the current situation but also is the basis for economic recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I listened with interest to what the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) said. He made a worthwhile contribution. It is unfortunate that he spoilt it at the end by his comment about taxation. I ask him: has he ever spoken to anyone who did not believe they were paying too much in taxation?  Of all the letters that I get and the comments that people make to me, it is a universal thing. It is the only thing that people are uniformly in agreement on in Australia. Everyone seems to believe that they pay too much in taxation. He should not be too surprised that he found that there was no-one who was happy with the tax system. It is a universal thing that we all have to live with. </PARA>
<PARA>  To hear some of the Opposition members speak and to read some of the newspaper comment about the Budget, one would think that Australia was the only country experiencing economic difficulties. Australia's current recession is part of a worldwide recession. Many of the causes are external and beyond Australia's control. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the outset I wish to congratulate the Government for its decision to rejoin the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation. Australia's decision to withdraw was wrong. The benefits to Australia in rejoining will be considerable, not only financially, in that Australian industry will be fully involved in the activities and projects promoted by UNIDO, but also politically, in that Australia will, once again, be able to participate fully in the decision making process and contribute to charting the course of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>  All our major partners have recognised the influential and profitable role that UNIDO is playing in promoting international cooperation in the industrial sector; indeed, it was quite abnormal that Australia should not be among the 150 member states of UNIDO. For those reasons, and for many others, I welcome Australia's rejoining. The decision has been taken with due regard to Australia's multilateral commitments and as part of an ongoing process to assess and evaluate Australia's contribution to United Nations organisations. It reflects the changes that have taken place in UNIDO over the past four years. As a major international forum for the consideration of issues relating to industrial development, UNIDO provides a unique channel of communication between developed and developing countries and the promotion of cooperation on industrialisation issues globally, regionally, and nationally, as well as by sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  I modestly claim that I may have played a small part in Australia's rejoining through my questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and to the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett). I have also made two speeches in this House on the topic of Australia rejoining and over the past year or so I have put numerous questions on the Notice Paper. Just before I left my office to come to the chamber this evening, in my mail there was a fax from the Director-General thanking me for the contribution I had made. However, I was only one of a number of members urging the Government to rejoin this important organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased that there has been a modest increase in Australia's overseas aid budget. I was amazed after the Budget to hear the comment from the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) that, had the conservatives framed the Budget, they would have cut our overseas aid. The overseas aid contribution was a modest increase, but a welcome one. Despite what many in the community claim, Australia obtains many long term benefits as well as short term benefits from our overseas aid. </PARA>
<PARA>  No member of this House, and most certainly no member on this side of the chamber, would dispute the fact that unemployment is a major social burden facing this country. It is a tragedy in economic and personal terms. I represent an area with an unacceptably high unemployment level, so no-one is more aware of this than I am. I see the unemployed and I talk with them. For too long the Illawarra has been basically a two industry area--steel and coal. The steelworks has gone from employing about 24,000 people in 1982 to 7,000 today, and that is to be reduced by another 2,000. Over recent years the coal industry work force in my area has more than halved. Then there is the flow-on impact to smaller enterprises supplying the major industries. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Illawarra Mercury has run two editorials--on 22 August and 3 September--that have  been critical of the Budget. It has taken both me and my colleague the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) to task regarding our support for the Budget. I resent the Mercury's claim that I have ignored the plight of the unemployed. Had the Mercury bothered to check with me it would have found that I have worked hard to achieve jobs in the Illawarra. One can always get a few headlines by making statements that are critical of the Government, especially if one is a member of the Government Party. The Mercury never looks at the work that is being carried out, nor does it bother to check on the deputations and other work that one does. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the major contributing factors to unemployment in the Illawarra is the job cuts made by the State Government. That same State Government could create work there by starting some of the important projects that have long been on the drawing board, projects such as the Maldon-Dombarton railway, which in an act of unprecedented stupidity it stopped immediately on coming to power. It could build the road that I have been pushing for for a long time, linking the highlands to the coast, as a replacement for the Macquarie Pass Road, namely, the Caloola Pass Road. Both those projects would not only generate employment in my area but would provide a long term stimulus to the economy of the area by giving better access to Port Kembla. </PARA>
<PARA>  No local member is complacent about the unemployment level in places such as the Illawarra. We accept that it is too high. We are aware of the personal tragedy it is for people. We are working collectively to create jobs in the Illawarra. Also the Illawarra Mercury does not always publish what one says. For example, in the Illawarra there is a quaint system that if one media outlet publishes a story the other media outlets will not use it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Only last week, for example, a firm called Heat Containment Pty Ltd of Unanderra retrenched 30 workers. The reason given was that it had lost an order to supply bricks to works at Tomaga to a French company. French bricks were being imported into Australia even though bricks were being produced in Australia. When the unions alerted me to the retrenchments at the Unanderra factory, I was concerned about a number of issues. First, more Illawarra workers were to be placed on the unemployment scrap heap. I was also concerned about information I had received that the French were engaging in dumping these bricks in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  We can and do compete successfully on the international market, selling similar kinds of bricks to overseas countries, yet we cannot win a contract in our own country. Imagine the outcry in France if a company retrenched its workers because Australian bricks were being imported into France. I have taken up this matter with both the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall). I also felt, from contact with the management of Heat Containment Pty Ltd, that the company was engaged in restructuring at the expense of the workers. Although I made several media statements about these issues, because one local television station had run with the story the Illawarra Mercury did not bother to run with it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I must say, though, that in regard to other matters that paper has been most supportive. At the Pioneer quarry at Bass Point, the company which made in excess of $150m profit last year--some have told me that it paid no tax on it because a lot of it was work from overseas--has indulged in one of the worst attacks on workers since the 1930s under the guise of restructuring. The company introduced new rosters, totally without any consultation with its staff, which it knew would be unacceptable. When the workers predictably refused to work the rosters, the company locked them out. The company deceitfully claimed that the quarry was closed and therefore sacked the workers. That was in April of this year. An Industrial Commission ruling found that the company had seriously breached the award in a number of areas and said that it was open to the workers to apply for reinstatement. The company has appealed against that decision. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bass Point quarry is an environmental disaster. It sits between two national parks and causes dust pollution in the nearby Shellharbour township. If an application were to be made today to establish a quarry there, it would be refused. The quarry exists because of the goodwill of the residents of Shellharbour township. They have tolerated it because it has created employment for 21 of its people. The quarry has abused and misused the concept of restructuring, to the detriment of its workers, and also my constituents in Shellharbour. This is the sort of industrial anarchy that would be the norm under the Opposition's industrial relations policies. </PARA>
<PARA>  When one looks at the Opposition's policies, one wonders whether it has fully investigated the models that it is using. It has used the discredited and failed Thatcher policies of the United Kingdom. Even the ads that it is plastering the country with today are lifted directly from Thatcher. But have the Thatcher policies delivered jobs? Have they lowered interest rates? Are the people in the United Kingdom better off? The answer to each question must be a resounding no. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition's policies have been tried in the United Kingdom and have failed. They have also had a trial run in New Zealand and failed. In both places they have failed. They have been tried in the United States and failed. If tried here, they will also fail. Does anyone believe that the Opposition's policies would work here? Of course they would not. They are a recipe not only for even higher unemployment but also for confrontation and a divided society. They are policies without vision, without compassion and policies that would help the well off at the expense of the workers. </PARA>
<PARA>  I particularly welcome in the Budget statement the announcement regarding superannuation. The introduction of universal superannuation will, I believe, be recognised as one of the great reforms of this Hawke Labor Government. It is aimed at guaranteeing the quality of life of those Australians who will retire in increasing numbers in the future. Of course, what is recognised by all--except, it seems, the Opposition--is that improvements in superannuation will be taken into account in future wage negotiations. That is why it is wrong to assume that increases in superannuation will be added to the wage costs of employers. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is known that in 1986 increases in superannuation were taken instead of a general wage increase. A general wage increase was directly traded off for an increase in superannuation. Through the accord, the Government and the ACTU continually delivered on the aggregate wage outcome. The relationship that has delivered these outcomes is as strong as ever. The Government and the ACTU understand that this country has to reap the benefits of low inflation. Equally, the Government and the ACTU understand that employment has to increase. Therefore, increases in total wages will be sensitive to these fundamental requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australians have to understand what is driving the Opposition on this issue. It is ideology at its worst; it is ideology at its most vicious. The Opposition believes that market failure never exists and that the choices made by individuals on savings through time obviate the need for universal superannuation. The basic bankruptcy of the Opposition's policy is revealed more fully by its spokesperson, Senator Alston, who reckons that Australians do not need superannuation for their retirement. Instead, he believes:</PARA>
<PARA>Low income earners would be much better off paying off their mortgages and their credit debts than being forced to pay another three per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the good senator believes that all Australians should buy a second house as well. Presumably then Australians would be doubly secure in their retirement. It is pathetic. In their hearts members of the Opposition believe that property speculation is a safe, sensible and viable way to secure the retirement incomes of aged Australians. It is pathetic, but I guess it is only to be expected. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government rejects the philosophy, the ideology and the bankruptcy of the Opposition. We remain committed to universal superannuation because it is an essential reform. The employers are complaining about the contribution they will make. But has anyone ever known the highly paid executives not to cry wolf? If we had listened to their cries of woe, today children would still be down the mines. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the time available to me I would like to concentrate on some of the very positive proposals in this Budget. Some extraordinary comments have been made about the Budget. Some people have suggested that it does not do anything for employment, that it does not do anything for the current account deficit and that it will not stimulate business. All of those things are untrue. The Budget contains policies which will make a difference to the level of employment, the skills of the work force, the level of exports and the extent of import replacement--and it does so in ways that are of long term benefit to the country. </PARA>
<PARA>  For example, in the area of education, which must be the most important contributor to improvements in the skills of the work force, the level of real outlays on education has risen by over 7 per cent at a time when the Budget was very constrained. That increase totals $790m and will be distributed to a whole series of areas. For example, there will be increased numbers of places at universities and $20m has been allocated for additional higher education capital funding. That is a very important component. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another centrally important area which contributes to enhancing the dynamism of the economy is increased expenditure on research and development. This financial year total expenditure on science and innovation will go up by 4.3 per cent in real terms--which is a very significant increase. This will be used in a whole series of areas. Some of it will go to the CSIRO, whose funding will go up 3 per cent in real terms. The Australian Research Council funding will go up substantially, as will funding for R&amp; in health. Rural R&amp; funding will go up by 23 per cent. A whole series of initiatives will be possible because of that increase in funding for science and technology. It is particularly satisfying to see that these priorities within the science budget are being addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  A third area of funding is infrastructure. It is not nearly as much as some of us would have liked. Nevertheless, there are some additional outlays, particularly for equity investment in the National Rail Corporation to increase the efficiency with which freight is moved around the country, and also in the better cities program. The initial $56m for the better cities program is an important new initiative that will contribute to all sorts of improvements in services in outer suburban areas--areas which have been neglected in the past--but also regional centres such as the Illawarra will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>  I heard what the honourable member for Bendigo said about this. He said that he wanted a checklist. I am very pleased to give him an undertaking that I will give him a running report on the better cities program money that goes into my area of the Illawarra. Although he will not be here after 1993, until that time I am more than happy to supply him with his checklist. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is also a series of important social programs, including the family assistance package, and a very striking increase in outlays for child-care of over $100m. The Opposition has criticised the Government for the level of unemployment. But, as Ross Gittins recently said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . so the Liberal Party pleads for the jobless--I think not. </PARA>
<PARA>That is true, Ross Gittins. The Opposition is trying to make political mileage out of unemployment, but what we have seen of its policies would do nothing for the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I suppose that, if each of us were framing the Budget, we would do different things. More must be done, especially in reducing unemployment. An important step was taken yesterday by reducing interest rates by 1 per cent. What was the reaction of the Opposition to this? It was a very cynical reaction. Those opposite were loud in their criticism of it. This lowering of interest rates will be passed on to the business community and indeed to those paying off their homes. There could well be scope in the near future for a further reduction in interest rates. Australia has had a sharp reduction in the level of inflation while interest rates have been coming down. That means that the real level of interest rates is still relatively high--too high by international standards. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the minute or so left for me to speak, I would like to touch briefly on the goods and services tax. There are many aspects of the Opposition's policies that should concern Australians, not least of which is the proposed goods and services tax--a tax on everything from haircuts to shoe laces to the soles of one's shoes. The tax will be inflationary and discriminatory as it will impact hardest on those least able to afford it. I read in a paper--I cannot find the cutting now or I would wave it over my head--a story that Senator Vanstone has put out a special booklet in which, apparently, all the Opposition members are asked for ideas on how to sell this unsaleable tax. This booklet has apparently found great favour; it has tanks, guns, rockets and everything on it. But let me say that the Opposition will need more than tanks, guns, rockets and all those things to sell this unsaleable tax and I wish Senator Vanstone well in her efforts. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA>  Mr Hollis interjecting--</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-`Don't you worry about that', as someone once said. I would like to start my comments about the Budget where the previous speaker left off--not as to his comments about the prospect of a sensible tax regime in this country, but on the matter of interest rates. One of the events that took place and has to be discussed in the context of the Budget is of course the interest rate decision that was made this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There particularly needs to be some focus on what the Governor of the Reserve Bank said today to the MTIA. I think it was quite revealing. In that speech, he conceded that the economy was weaker `than had been thought', and that the assumptions on which the economic recovery was foreshadowed in the Budget were highly suspect particularly in regard to business investment and the outlook, which he described as particularly worrying. That ought to be some cause for concern to honourable members on both sides, but particularly on the other side because, when we look more closely at the Budget figures, it is clear that business investment looks set to fall by about 20 per cent in 1991-92, and that is more than double the estimate in the Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is also important that the comments made about real interest rates be put into proper context because even in a deep recession, the Governor reports, our real long term interest rates--that is, the rates that are determined by the market, not the authorities--are close to double those of our major trading partners. That being the case, we have to ask the question: how many major projects will get off the ground with real long term interest rates of 7 per cent plus?</PARA>
<PARA>  But the other point that needs to be made is that there seems to be some differing of opinion within the Reserve Bank. The Deputy Governor, at his speech at the Australian Management College last week, said that management policy should be directed primarily to the medium term and operate in tandem with adjustments to the other arms of policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The emphasis needs to be on the medium term. The short term fix, pushing down interest rates that are controllable by the Reserve Bank, does not address the long term economic problems unless we make the other adjustments that are necessary in the broad economy. It is one of those other adjustments that I want to focus my remarks on tonight, and it relates of course to my area of responsibility--communications. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some other points from the Budget, though, are worth mentioning. There is an increase in Government spending of $5.5 billion to $101.5 billion. That is a 2.6 per cent increase in real terms and a total figure which represents a massive 25.7 per cent of gross domestic product. That is due mainly to the impact of the recession. There is a growing number of people dependent on pensions and unemployment benefits and as well, of course, there is the grand city plan, which we still do not have any detail about. The reason expenditure is not larger is that the Government is squeezing the States. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is also a decrease of $1.9 billion in Government tax revenue, from $93 billion in 1991 to $91.1 billion in 1991-92--a clear indication of a falling economy and a further continuation of the economic conditions brought about by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). He must not be able to escape blame. He will go down in history as the Dracula of Australian politics; he has sucked the blood out of the economy, and we are now living with a lifeless corpse of an economy. All ordinary Australians are certainly feeling it. They are responding to those signs and slogans that are appearing on our billboards around the country.  There are a million unemployed, but the interesting thing is that the problem involves more than the million unemployed. It is the underemployed who are not registered who ought to be the Government's concern as well. They are our concern. </PARA>
<PARA>  We ought not address the problems by dropping interest rates overnight. We must have a medium term policy that responds to the long term economic needs and restructuring priorities that are plain for outside commentators to see, but seem to come within the blind spot of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The coming years will bring with them some further pain. One of the areas which is indicative of that of course is the foreign debt level and the implications of that debt. A total foreign debt of about $165 billion requires $17 billion just to service that debt per year. Interest payments of $17 billion require about $8,000 from every man, woman and child in Australia. Every time a new baby is born, that baby is already $8,000 in debt and has to produce $800 a year just to service that debt. Clearly, that is a fundamental weakness in our economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The weaknesses in the Australian economy show that we have made little progress since the 1989-90 OECD economic survey of Australia, which outlined the major weaknesses as follows: we need to have improved competitiveness, higher productivity, improved industrial relations, and increased savings. The main long term difficulty is Australia's lack of international competitiveness. This is reflected in our falling share of world trade over the past two years, as the shadow Minister for trade, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), can, I am sure, testify when he has his opportunity to make some remarks in this place. </PARA>
<PARA>  That lack of competitiveness is a direct result of a rigid and inefficient economy which the Government has had a number of years now to address, and it has not addressed it. We are now worse off than we have ever been in the whole time that this Government has occupied the Treasury bench, yet Government members are contemplating putting back into the driver's seat the very man who has delivered this state of affairs to the community. If honourable members opposite think that that will give them a victory at the next election, they are crazy. Whoever is put forward by the Government will lose because the Australian people are tired of what it has delivered, because clearly it has failed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The thrust of the coalition's alternative policies is to break down these inefficiencies and rigidities by deregulation, competition, corporatisation and privatisation--that is, to put in place the structural reforms necessary to boost productivity, lower costs and reduce inflation in order to allow sustained reduction in interest rates. We want to take the medium term view. It is exactly as the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank said. Rigidities and inefficiencies are found in the persistence of work and management practices that protect people's jobs in the short term. There is no vision of future environment in which more and new jobs will be created, just a Luddite preoccupation with the present--`Long live the accord'. The accord is dead in the water. It has outlived its usefulness. </PARA>
<PARA>  Tariffs and other forms of industry protection also create inefficiencies. It will be interesting to see whether the Government will stick by its industry statement of 12 March last year in all respects. If it kowtows to the screams of the music industry, which it shows every indication of doing, what can we expect in the really hard areas?  Is the consumer forever to be put last?  What is the Government going to do with the telecommunications industry plan?  All forms of protection flow through to the rest of the community. Even where industries are domestically orientated, their levels of efficiency affect the competitiveness of our export orientated industries. </PARA>
<PARA>  Inefficiency is a disease that spreads its infection throughout the whole economy. No better example comes to mind than the telecommunications equipment industries in this country. Unless they are internationally competitive, there is little hope that their buyers, principally Telecom and the new AOTC, will become internationally competitive. The lack of competitiveness is a direct result of a rigid and inefficient economy. The thrust of our policies is to break down these inefficiencies and rigidities. Imports are bad, according to this Government, and that is why it has imposed such savage interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  We do have to worry about import levels while our export performance is too poor to generate the income necessary to pay for those imports. But this argument is carried too far. To suggest, for instance, that we cannot have pay television because of the impact on imports denies the fact that it will provide opportunities for Australian companies to cash in on exports abroad. Clearly, this is a false argument. </PARA>
<PARA>  Everyone knows what we ought to do to achieve a strengthened Australian economy. We must dramatically improve our productivity and we must become internationally competitive; and we all know why and how that should be done. The question is: when and where will these things be addressed?  The Government knows what must be done, but industry restructuring and micro-economic reform has been patchy and its pace snail-like. There is not one better example than the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government chose the waterfront to be its centrepiece for micro-economic reform and finally, honourable members opposite will recall, the Minister who said he would resign if he achieved nothing did not achieve anything and did not resign. I think that is an indication, quite clearly, of the hollowness of the Government's rhetoric. Let me talk about productivity. Increasing productivity means more can be produced from the same resources or less. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I know the honourable member for the Northern Territory is often excited by my remarks because of the rational nature of them. Increasing productivity means higher wage growth, it means an increase in the size of the economic cake and it means higher living standards. Raising productivity and improving our competitive position must be our aim. We need to free our rural and manufacturing service industries of excessive regulation. In broadcasting, for example, the mishmash of rules and regulations has been a disaster for much of the radio and television industry. Indeed, there are proposals to bring forward change, but that change is long overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We need to insist on a more competitive business and public sector culture. The present concentration of ownership of the print media during the 1980s--positively encouraged by Labor's policies--should not have happened, and no amount of inquiries will enlighten us further as to the cause. We know the cause. We want to know when those opposite are going to deliver the solution. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to encourage investment in productive enterprises, not in the high-flying entrepreneurial activities encouraged by a Labor government that did not have the vision to put in place the appropriate prudential controls. Coronation Hill, Wesley Vale and a dozen other shelved projects could not possibly have wreaked the havoc caused to so many Australians by those now discredited high fliers. Indeed, that damage has spread worldwide. They have a great deal to answer for. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to reform our work places. We need to move away from our traditional centralised wage fixing system to enterprise- focused employee relations. How long have we argued that in this place?  I remember being acting shadow Minister for industrial relations nearly five years ago, when we were putting that view forward and were ridiculed. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the current shadow Minister for industrial relations, put that view forward then and he was ridiculed. Now we see the Industrial Relations Commission in part embracing it--not in the form that we want by any means, but the argument has finally been accepted. It has taken a depression and our slipping in the world economic order for people to realise the sense of that argument. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to resist any moves by the Telecom unions to have industrial coverage over both telecommunications carriers. That matter is the subject of some controversy at the present time. As the new competitor should have the right to hire and fire in accordance with normal private sector practice, so too should Telecom if it is to operate on the same footing. </PARA>
<PARA>  What are some of the key areas for reform?  The key areas for reform in the Federal arena are agreed and, in some cases, are already under way. They clearly are: telecommunications, broadcasting, aviation, land transport, and sea transport. Privatisation is part of the reform agenda. In the area of my interest--transport and communications--capital expenditure is the largest capital outlay made in Australia, representing some 3.6 per cent of GDP, or 40 per cent of all capital outlays. Transport and communications services currently account for about 8 per cent of Australia's total gross domestic product and 7 per cent of total employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last year an Industries Assistance Commission submission to Cabinet estimated that structural reform in transport and communications and cuts in industry assistance could boost Australia's gross domestic product by $16 billion in 1988-89 dollars. In telecommunications alone the boost to GDP is estimated at some $1.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>  The potential of the telecommunications sector is enormous, as even the Chief Executive of Telecom, Mr Ward, pointed out in his National Press Club address. The 37 million lines in service today in the Asia-Pacific region will grow to more than 300 million in 50 years. In that region total expenditure on telecommunications over that period is expected to be more than $1 trillion. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reforms in telecommunications now under way are intended to break down the inefficiencies inherent in government monopolies. We have a total government monopoly of telecommunications in this country. We must introduce competition, albeit in the limited form of a duopoly, to drive down prices, to improve service to customers and to enhance the opportunities for increased telecommunications exports. </PARA>
<PARA>  The irony is that to ensure that competition is real the Government has had to put in place a strengthened regulatory authority, but one that still has to be very subservient to the Minister. The questions are:  has he got the legislation right and will he get the myriad of other matters outside the legislation--interconnect charges, licence conditions, pay TV delivery, industry policy, et cetera--all right?  They are complicated issues certainly, but they are absolutely fundamental when one looks at the size of this industry and recognises that industry policy now in this country is not about setting up prescriptive barriers but is about lowering the input costs to businesses and visiting upon consumers savings. That is the only way we will address that fundamental requirement that our economy has to achieve, that is, far greater productivity in international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>  Also on the telecommunications side, one can only agree with a speech, interestingly, by the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Communications, Graham Evans, when he said in July:</PARA>
<PARA>  In the end, of course, the relative quality of the new regulatory arrangements will have to be judged in terms of what it brings in terms of both the price of and the quality and reliability of telecommunications services in Australia, and by whether the industry is sufficiently strengthened by its domestic environment to be more internationally competitive in the provision of services and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said, `For a significant period the major benefits of competition to the broader community and economy will come from the performance of the new amalgamated Telecom and OTC'. That is very true, but I would certainly say this:  all of us need to commit ourselves to ensuring that we do see the changes within the new organisation. We must recognise that it will be a new organisation;  that it must be possessed of a new culture;  that it must be possessed of a new vigour; and that once the board and the Chief Executive are appointed--and I understand that there is some discussion on that matter now, and the sooner that decision is made the better--they must focus on building a competitive telecommunications service and dedicate themselves to that task. It must be up to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) to ensure that that happens or else his whole policy will have failed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was going to talk about the wholesale sales tax, but I think it is important in the telecommunications area to point out some of the data that has been provided to me by the tax reform group that is looking at all of these matters within the coalition. They produced some very interesting figures which showed that there is now about $375m tax on telephone calls in this country through the wholesale sales tax. Sales tax on capital equipment alone averages out to an additional cost of almost $50 on the yearly phone bill of each of Telecom's eight million-plus subscribers. That is what the existing ramshackle wholesale tax base is doing to all of those telephone subscribers right around the nation. We have not heard much from the Government about that. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, I should make the point that, whilst the Government is spending around $60m on television aggregation, it has had to forgo $117m in the form of sales tax and licence fee relief to help the stations pay the enormous sums necessary for aggregation. This is the worst possible time in the worst recession this century for television stations to have to spend the large sums necessary for aggregation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Aggregation is a flagship issue to indicate how they have not got it right in telecommunications. They have forwarded a policy; they have started on a track; they have got halfway down; they cannot go back; to go forward only makes it worse. And what happens?  A whole industry is now verging on collapse and it is right in the middle of what looks to be a long term recession. If one talks to people in the television and radio industries, one finds that their major preoccupation is to get the message through to the Government that they are under siege and that diversity and choice in programming are all suffering because of the policies that this Government has put in place--its broader macro policy settings and its specific broadcasting policy settings. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even tonight--and I finish with these last few words--the Cabinet is meeting to discuss the whole question of additional powers that might be given to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to deal with the selling of the two largest newspapers in this country--the Fairfax newspapers, the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald. That whole matter is in the position that it is because those papers are in receivership. They cannot reach a decision tonight, I understand--the matter is still going on--because the Government again is in confusion and again is in debate. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is happening, of course, is that the people who are employed in these enterprises, the people who are wanting to bid for these enterprises, need to know what the rules of the game are and what is going to happen. What is Minister Beazley's view?  We have had three views from him over the last two weeks. There is no clear view coming from the Government. It is simply not good enough for it to persist in creating this confusion when one is talking about dealing with some of the largest newspaper assets in this country. Setting up a print media inquiry, on which I now sit, is not going to give us the answers, because that is going to happen well after the event anyway. </PARA>
<PARA>  So the whole thing is looking very much like a charade and a nonsense. Clearly, it is time that the Minister took control of communications and focused his attentions on the needs of the communications industry in this country, for if he continues to do so, we will add further to the disasters, further to the receiverships and further to the total lack of confidence of the business community, the communications industry in this industry----</PARA>

<PARA>  This House is the place where issues are considered and debated in the full glare of the democratic process, where hyperbole and distortion can be uncovered and shown to be what they are. Certainly in that regard I would have to take issue with some of the points made by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) in his speech on this Appropriation Bill. One of the things he seems to have left out when haranguing the Government for its supposed lack of action in regard to this Bill was improved competitiveness. He managed to slag the Government for the supposedly poor figures shown in the Bill. He seems to have very conveniently forgotten the increased exports, which are there for him to see. Perhaps, like some of his colleagues, he has a little trouble reading the figures. </PARA>
<PARA>  He harangued the Government on the overseas debt and cried crocodile tears over the newly born person having so much debt that he will be in debt for the rest of his life. He will have to join the Liberal Party to get out of it! The overseas debt is not owed by every man, woman and child in this country; it is owed by the industries that created that debt. It is not the responsibility of the taxpayer; it is the responsibility of those companies and the rich mates who went ahead and ran up those bills and went into debt or went broke. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other aspect the honourable member for Bass ran past as an issue was industrial relations. He seems to forget that over the past few years industrial relations has been a concern of the Hawke Government, whether through the accord or in other ways. It has worked. It has functioned well. He also managed to neglect the fact there are many shopfloor agreements that have been in place. They have been in place with the protection of the court. Perhaps we could say that the honourable member for Bass is proposing that we should withdraw the protection of the court from the people's workplace and let them be at the mercy of those who might take advantage of them. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is certainly with a recognition and an acknowledgment that many people were hurting as a result of the restructuring of the Australian economy that the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) referred to the 1991-92 Budget as one which was about people. It is predictable that those honourable members on the other side of the House would dismiss any approach to the economy which embraces the concept of compassion as a fundamental responsibility of government in our democracy. That is the fundamental difference in approach which highlights the division between the Government and the Opposition parties in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to underline the fact that this Budget, even in these difficult times for the Australian nation, tempers economic responsibility with compassion and understanding. The measures adopted in this Budget clearly demonstrate that this Government has compassion, that it is not simply prepared to react in a way to gain short term political advantage. </PARA>
<PARA>  The electorate of Richmond, which I represent, and the problems it faces are the background against which I must continually measure the policies of this Government. It is against that background that I welcome not only the initiatives of this Budget but also the readiness of Ministers to respond to the needs of provincial Australia. The electorate of Richmond has by far the highest rate of unemployment in New South Wales. It also has the highest incidence of single parents and one of the lowest participation rates in the labour market in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  In case honourable members think that this Government brought about that state of affairs or that matters have deteriorated significantly since the days when Doug Anthony and Charles Blunt were in this House, let me assure honourable members that even in the 1920s governments were aware of what was called the hidden unemployment of the far north coast of New South Wales. That position has not changed, except that what was once hidden unemployment, hidden in the sense that family members kept the farm going for little or no pay, is now obvious to all. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members should be aware that while the nation reels at unemployment figures of 10 per cent, even when the good times return in the capital cities of Australia unemployment in the Richmond electorate is unlikely ever to be lower than 10 per cent. At the moment it has passed the 15 per cent mark, and the participation rate in the work force stands at scarcely more than 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  That unemployment rate has not been a cause for very much comment under past regimes. People just accepted that northern New South Wales was a desirable place to live. However, with a very small industry base, the rapidly increasing population will continue to seek employment in vain. There is little to be had. While people have been keen to relocate to what we modestly call Australia's best address, industry has not been so quick to see the benefits of relocation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Given that background, I now wish to identify and comment on some aspects of the Budget which are set to impact positively on the quality of life of people in the electorate of Richmond as an example of what this Government is about. The first is changes to the family income package by which this Government has both recognised and acknowledged that, while people might be asset rich, they may have very little disposable income. That is true for many folk who are struggling to keep the family farm together or who operate in the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  Provision in the Budget of measures which will address this problem for the first time will prove to be of particular help to farmers in the Richmond electorate and, I am sure, in other parts of rural Australia. Honourable members know that many farmers are facing a tough time, with many of them making little or nothing this financial year. Access to family allowance and family allowance supplement under this Budget reverses the situation where farming families were ineligible for full family payments because of their high assets in spite of low or even negative incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>  While drought is hurting many parts of this country, honourable members do not need to have a long memory to recall that, in other times, flooding rains wreaked havoc which often, with the precision that comes from years of analysis, can be predicted accurately. In the present Budget funds under the Federal water resources assistance program have once again been provided. Honourable members who do not know at first hand the ravages of floodwaters cannot really comprehend the impact on people's lives of the regular flooding which takes place in towns along the eastern seaboard. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my first speech to this House, I referred to the levee banks which were erected in Murwillumbah on the Tweed River in the Richmond electorate. Those levees, under the Federal water resources assistance program, have kept floodwaters from the central business district during flooding of the Tweed River on all occasions except one in the last 20 years. Money allocated this year will allow the completion of the levee and compensatory house-raising for a number of properties adversely affected by the levee works.  The flooding problems at Lismore, which is recognised as the regional capital of the far north coast, are acknowledged as being among the worst in New South Wales. The geography of the catchments causes a concentration of run-off at Lismore, and flooding is often compounded by water backing up into the central business district from the Wilson River. In my initial speech to this House, I urged the Minister to examine closely the study of the Wilson and Richmond Rivers which was being carried out by a firm of engineers. I said at the time:</PARA>
<PARA>If it can be established that a flood mitigation scheme could give a measure of flood protection to Lismore without increasing flooding in the rest of the valley, then agreement might be able to be reached among the three tiers of government for implementing the plan . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is pleasing that a public airing of this matter as my No. 1 priority for the city of Lismore has brought agreement from the New South Wales Government to raise the order of priority for Lismore in submissions under the Federal waters resources assistance program for matching funds from Commonwealth, State and local government in the usual ratio of 40 per cent, 40 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. In the present State submission, Lismore was No. 3 priority after failing to reach the requirements in 1990-91. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Tonight I want to raise the question of the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Act 1989 which, as all honourable members of this House will know, under section 5(1) says that no advertisements for smoking will be allowed in published material in Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(a) for smoking; or</PARA>
<PARA>(b) for, or for the use of:</PARA>
<PARA>  (i) cigarettes; or</PARA>
<PARA>  (ii) cigarette tobacco; or</PARA>
<PARA>  (iii) other tobacco products. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 6 then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Subsection 5(1) does not apply to a print medium:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) printed outside Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) not principally intended for distribution or use in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of that is that magazines printed within Australia cannot carry tobacco advertising--and that costs them a very great deal of revenue--but magazines printed outside of</PARA>
<PARA>Australia can carry the tobacco advertising. One has to wonder why it would be such a disadvantage for Australians to see tobacco advertising in magazines printed in Australia and yet if the advertisements are in overseas magazines it is perfectly all right to do so. This puts the Australian magazines at a very grave disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has been made aware of the problem but it has said that it is impractical to amend the Act, that there is only a limited distribution of overseas publications, and that if these do not affect the issue other nations will eventually catch up and ban cigarette advertising in magazines produced overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at those excuses given by the present Government. First, let us look at practicality. We can ban advertising of cigarette products in magazines printed overseas and not allow magazines with such advertising to come into Australia. It has been done by other countries; I only have to instance Singapore. It is quite easy in the production of magazines to drop out particular pages so that tobacco advertising does not appear. The practicality of this simply is not in question. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second argument relates to limited distribution of overseas magazines in Australia. In the year to June 1990, over 80 million magazines were imported--well above the Australian publication figures. To suggest there is only a limited distribution of magazines containing tobacco advertising is simply not shown by the facts. Most magazines that are imported come from the United Kingdom or the USA, where tobacco advertising is legal. One only has to pick up these overseas produced magazines to see the extent of the tobacco advertising they contain. </PARA>
<PARA>  The result of the present situation, and what I regard as an anomaly within the Act, is to force Australian producers of magazines to go offshore. The simplest way to get over the problem is to print the magazines outside Australia, get hold of the tobacco advertising revenue, and import the magazines into Australia. Obviously that is a nonsense. It results in losses of Australian jobs; it puts Australian publishers at a disadvantage; and it puts a whole lot of people who contribute to the production of magazines at a very grave disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to have a situation where this anomaly is reversed because the magazine production industry in Australia is a very significant one. It is very significant not only directly, for the jobs it produces, but also indirectly, for writers, photographers, and those artisans concerned with the compiling and production of high quality magazines in Australia who need the protection of a level playing field, which we all hear about when people are talking about trade and international trading relationships. Quite simply, this Government has not provided a level playing field for the Australian magazine publishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a straightforward case which should be addressed directly. If this was done then a whole lot of Australian magazine publishers would be advantaged and a great number of Australians who are concerned in this industry would be protected from unfair overseas competition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It may surprise some honourable members on this side of the House, but I speak frequently to honourable members from the other side of the House. I speak to them because, as a Federal member, I always feel that I should be sufficiently dedicated and conscientious to listen to people who come to me with their concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Quite a number of those opposite come to me with their concerns. Perhaps they see me as a father figure. They know that my advice is of great value. It so happens that an honourable member came to see me the other night after I had made reference to Canada in a  speech. I listened to him because I could see he was frightened. He had good cause to be frightened because he felt he was going to lose his seat because of his Party's madness in pursuing a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  He said to me, `Look, I cannot speak against this tax, but maybe I can give you some ammunition which will help you change the attitude and minds of my colleagues on my side of the House'. He said to me, `Do you know how this tax came to be introduced in Canada?'. I said that I had not heard anything about that. He told me what happened. It was party brute strength. When the Government decided to introduce a goods and services tax it met so much resistance in the lower House that it had to use bully boy tactics. It had to threaten all sorts of dire measures against members if they did not toe the party line. So, cowed and beaten, all the members of the Government parties fronted up and supported the legislation. The goods and services tax passed through the lower House in the Canadian Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  But it met stronger resistance in the upper House because there the members are elected for life and nobody can threaten them with loss of preselection. The members of the upper House told their party bully boys that they could go and jump in the lake because there was no way that they would vote for a goods and services tax. Then the Government party, including the Prime Minister, who could not get the goods and services Bill through the upper House, went to the powers that be. Under the Canadian Constitution it is possible--of course, it cannot happen here with our Constitution--for additional members to be appointed to the upper House, just as the kings of England did in the early days of democracy. Additional members were appointed to the upper House in Canada so that the Government could get its loathsome legislation passed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to commend our father figure, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), for telling us that fairy story as we wend our way off to bed tonight. I think most honourable members would prefer Goldilocks and the Three Bears; nevertheless, it was a good story and taken in good humour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  On a more serious matter, over the past few years the present Federal Government has made a number of changes to the way in which pharmacies are able to operate, to the detriment of many of them, particularly those pharmacies in isolated areas. I will read a letter from a pharmacist in my electorate which will explain the situation much better than I can. This letter was sent to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples). It states:</PARA>
<PARA>  Dear Mr Staples,</PARA>
<PARA>  I wish to bring to your attention the unfair treatment I have received from the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority. (pra)</PARA>
<PARA>  I was accepted as an Essential Pharmacy in 1990 and received the EP allowance. (EPA)</PARA>
<PARA>That is because this man has the only pharmacy in this particular part of my electorate. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>  When the EHPA successfully appealed to the High Court against the Government, the HIC was very quick to confirm that the EPA paid for November and December 1990 would be deducted from monies due to me for November and December 1990. This has been deducted. </PARA>
<PARA>  With the formation of the PRA however, I was informed that I would have to reapply to be designated an Essential Pharmacy, although all the criteria for this designation had not altered. </PARA>
<PARA>  I therefore applied to the PRT for recognition as an essential pharmacy and received back a card from the PRT giving me a ref No . . . and acknowledged my application of 15 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  After a lapse of 4 months, my application to the PRT was accepted in a letter dated 15 May 1991 and . . . I have since received EPA payment from the HIC for May and June 1991 only. </PARA>
<PARA>  What has happened to the payments I am due from January to April inclusive? It is certainly not my fault that the PRT procrastinated for 4 months over my application, which exactly fitted the same qualifying criteria in the previous year. Why should I have to suffer financial loss because of the laggardliness or seeming incompetence of the PRA?  This is certainly not within the spirit of the historic two part agreement struck between you, the Minister, and the Pharmacy Guild. . .</PARA>
<PARA>  What happens next year when I have to reapply, on an annual basis, to be recognised as an Essential Pharmacy. Will I once again lose another 4 months remuneration due?</PARA>
<PARA>  Is this another example of the Governments cost saving exercises, or perhaps another example of, one cannot trust the Hawke Government to keep its word. </PARA>
<PARA>  A coherent and detailed explanation of the PRT actions is asked for and really demanded. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am most disenchanted. It seems that the present government cannot be trusted to keep its word, let alone a solemn agreement entered into with a highly respected professional body. </PARA>
<PARA>All honourable members are aware of the problems faced by pharmacies in outback Australia. If someone within the Department is listening to this debate, I wonder whether he could let us know what is happening in that area. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another matter that I wish to draw to the attention of the House relates to Medibank Private. I have received a letter from a gentleman who is in Medibank Private. He assures me that recently his payments to Medibank Private have increased by 40 per cent. He stated that over the past 10 months his contributions had risen an estimated 40 per cent--from $692 per year to $810 per year on 1 October 1990 and to $987 per year on 1 August 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  This gentleman receives a part pension. He is entitled to a pension from the British Navy. He has never claimed as he preferred to arrange his own cover for his wife and himself. What is getting him down is that he now realises he can no longer afford Medibank Private. I know that the Government has problems with Medicare. I think the $3.50 charge is an indication that it definitely is not working. This is another example of these increased costs. This gentleman has found that he will not be able to maintain himself in Medibank Private. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise in the adjournment debate tonight to bring to the notice of the House what I believe is a wonderful achievement by people within the boundaries of my electorate. Day after day we hear about the problems that are occurring in Yugoslavia. My electorate contains a group of people from Croatia who were born over there and whose parents were born over there. They have settled in this country and have certainly contributed to the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Some 10 years ago, they saw a need to build a church. They acquired the land and built the church, which can clearly be called a cathedral. They realised that their people were getting older. They did not want the Federal Government to have the responsibility of looking after their elderly people, so they applied for a grant to build an aged persons village. This grant came from the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  They had a dream of where they were going to build that village. They desired to have it near their church but, unfortunately, they did not have the land. Under the Unsworth Labor Government, they applied to take over something like two hectares of land, which was given to them at a reasonable price, and over the years they endeavoured to pay it off. Since then they have built the aged persons village. Last Sunday I had the opportunity to go and physically inspect that village. </PARA>
<PARA>  We in Australia have a lot to learn from our settlers who have made this country their home. We have a lot to learn about their love not only of their heritage but also of their families, particularly their aged. We also have a lot to learn about what we read in the media over the conflicts that are occurring in another part of the world. It particularly affects them because it is part of their heritage, but it does not necessarily reflect on them as individuals or as Australians of Yugoslavian extraction and, most particularly, of Croatian extraction. </PARA>
<PARA>  I can very proudly stand in this House and state that what those people have achieved in such a short time is something that no-one else would have expected of them. They have had many trials and tribulations associated with the building of that aged persons village. Many people have been able to give financial assistance and help. Surprisingly, people who have not been rich in dollars have given of their time. They have achieved a village that all of us could go through and say, `I wish we had been involved in building part of that'. </PARA>
<PARA>  They have built an environment in which their elderly people know they are going to be looked after with a certain amount of serenity in their later life but, more particularly, they can remain with their close family contacts and the people of Croatian extraction can remain with their church. I say this because sometimes people do not realise what these people have contributed to our country. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I speak of the Croatian people who have now settled in Australia, and as I relate what I know first-hand of how they have built and achieved such a wonderful environment with their aged persons village and their church, so too I can talk of the Serbian people who have settled in this area and have not only built their church but have also built their aged persons village. I think these people have come together united in the fact that they care for the people whom they realise will need assistance and help in later life, but who may not have immediate family to give that care. They have also come to realise that they cannot always say to the Government that they need help now.</PARA>
<PARA>  They have been able to use their initiative and their drive and pool their resources, both financially and physically, to build facilities which everyone would be proud to have in their own electorates. I raised this matter because I want honourable members of this Parliament to realise and understand that what is happening overseas is a tragedy. It is dividing a country but, more particularly, we do not want to see it divide Australia. We do not want to see it divide Australians of Yugoslav, Croatian, Serbian or Slovenian families. I do not believe it will come to that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that what those people have achieved in the short time that they have made Australia their home has contributed not only to the growth of this country but to the growth of their own areas, their church, their aged people and their families. They have contributed their culture and their dance to their young people and as Australians of Yugoslav parents and as Australians of Croatian, Serbian or Slovenian parents they can truly say that they have been able to achieve and contribute back to this country that has offered them citizenship in friendship and given them stability to grow and prosper. </PARA>
<PARA>  Time and again when we read in the media about the relationship that occurs at times in areas of trouble, we must also realise the contributions that this country has had from the people I have referred to, who reside within my area and have contributed not only to my electorate and the electorate of the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace), but also to this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Tonight, sadly, I bring to the notice of the House, and especially the Attorney- General (Mr Duffy), an unethical and unprofessional approach by the Federal member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) to discredit the tendering process that was used by the Australian Securities Commission to locate its data processing centre in my electorate--a shady attempt to transfer 350 jobs into his own electorate. In my opinion, it is outrageous to request the Attorney-General to look at a new player after the tender has closed and the tender price is public. The ambit claim that $50m savings can be made is without foundation and totally discredited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I wish to put on record a brief chronological history of events leading to the data processing centre being placed in temporary premises in Morwell. In mid-1989 the Attorney-General called for registrations of interest from States for the data processing centre to be placed in regional Australia. Three States nominated, and the areas proposed were Hobart, Newcastle and the Latrobe Valley. In November of that year, an agreement was signed between the Victorian Government and the Attorney-General for the centre to be placed in the Latrobe Valley. In March 1990 the coalition shadow Minister gave his full support to the document centre being based in the Latrobe Valley. </PARA>
<PARA>  In April 1990 Traralgon was selected as the permanent site for the centre. In August 1990 the temporary home for the data processing centre was opened with 300 employees, whose productivity and expertise are now recognised as world class and second to none. In August 1990 the Esso building in Sale came onto the market. In November 1990 expressions of interest were made for the pre- committed lease building in Traralgon, as in the original terms and agreement signed by the Federal and State governments. In December of 1990 the project team recommended that five of those who responded should be short-listed and issued with a detailed brief and lease proposals returnable and closable by 8 March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  In May 1991, the ASC accepted the recommendation to continue negotiations with the preferred developer for Traralgon. On 25 July 1991 a letter was sent from the ASC Chairman to the Attorney-General seeking approval for the lease agreement for the new building. In August 1991 there was a media release by the National Party of Australia member for Gippsland suggesting that Sale be considered as an alternative for the data processing centre--two years after the horse had bolted. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 20 August 1991 the ASC Chairman responded to the honourable member for Gippsland, detailing that the costing of the Latrobe Valley proposal over 15 years was $700,000 cheaper than the Sale proposal--notwithstanding the relocation costs of several million dollars for the staff. On 30 August 1991 Baillieu Knight Frank's agent for Esso Australia submitted a second proposal with full knowledge of the Latrobe Valley's new building costs. The Attorney- General must reject this unethical predatory pricing. If the ASC is to be a watchdog for the Australian business sector, it is totally unacceptable for it to accept a horse trader. To put it another way: what price does the Attorney-General put on the integrity of the Australian Securities Commission?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House two organisations that work in the north of my electorate. I mention first the wonderful work done by the Challenge Foundation in the Tweed region. On Friday 30 August I had the pleasure of opening the Garden Service Centre, operated by the Wollumbin section of the Challenge Foundation in Murwillumbah. This particular garden service provides full time employment and training for 15 intellectually disabled people and three Foundation staff members. It is the first of a number of supported employment projects being established by the Foundation in the Tweed region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It certainly offers the intellectually disabled a wider choice of employment opportunities. I will outline some of the work that this particular garden service does. It has a team of mowers and a truck, and it does high quality contract work for the Tweed Shire Council. It does private contract gardening work and on top of that it also has a nursery which supplies retail and wholesale plants. It supplies plants to the Tweed Shire Council. That type of work is something which is ably done by the people there. </PARA>
<PARA>  The high quality work carried out helps to fund the whole centre and its ongoing projects. I pay tribute to Gary Tefflundie, the manager, and also to Richard Little, another of the workers at the centre, for the fine work they do. I also pay tribute to supporters of the Wollumbin Garden Service Centre section of the Challenge Foundation for the fine work they do in supporting that organisation. The Wollumbin Garden Service Centre has received Federal funds for its establishment, and I am pleased to report to the House that it is working so well. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second matter I would like to bring to the notice of the House occurs in the city of Murwillumbah--the annual Tweed Banana Festival. Last week the twenty-fifth Tweed Banana Festival was held and it was a great success. The activities ranged from the teen queens on the Friday night to musical items including orchestral presentations in the art centre. In particular, the centrepiece of the Tweed Banana Festival would have to be the presentation of the King Banana. I had the honour of announcing and presenting the award of King Banana this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That is all history. The King Banana, weighing in at 355 grams, was a fine Cavendish banana. It was presented by M. and P. Franks and Sons and it certainly deserved the accolade it received. By the way, the King Banana had the honour of leading the parade the next day. It was put on the front of a tractor. They are clever bananas up on the Tweed Coast, I point out to the honourable member for Mayo.  The other activities, which were all part of raising money for charity, were: the Miss Personality contest, which was won by Miss Fran Clancy; and the Queen of the Carnival, won by Margaret Watson, who was sponsored by the Tweed Shire Council. The runner up in the same contest was Simone Frost. Congratulations to all those people and to the other girls and the organisations that supported them in the one or two weeks of the carnival and also in the months leading up to it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish that the pretend Minister at the table could understand the importance of flowers to Australia. In my electorate of La Trobe, the flower industry is a major industry. We grow flowers and bulbs and we export those flowers. It is a major effort for Australia. On Friday morning we signed an agreement with Japan to increase our exports of flowers to Japan by a factor of 100 per cent in the next year. That is a very significant initiative undertaken by the flower growing industry. I think that all Australians would be delighted to hear that we have an industry which is indigenous, which is doing a terrific job of advertising Australia all over the world. It provides not only good visual products for Australia, but desperately needed export dollars for our economy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 4 June 1991:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) What does it cost to provide telephone services to persons in remote areas where these services are not commercially viable.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Under the new telecommunications arrangements, what cost will be borne by Telecom by being refused application of timed telephone calls in the city and by forcing it to bear the costs of duplicated equipment.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Are country residents to be charged on a timed basis but not city residents; if so, is this inequitable.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) Is the dominant obligation of the merged telecommunications carrier to ensure that the standard telephone service is available to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) Will the same obligation apply to a second carrier; if not, (a) why not and (b) does this give a second carrier an unfair competitive advantage.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) Has a second carrier been chosen yet.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) Are the resources of any of the potential second carriers more extensive than Telecom's.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="705" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KALGOORLIE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question, partly based on advice from Telecom, is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The provision of telephone services to persons in remote areas is a major component of Telecom's universal service obligation which requires standard telephone services to be reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis.</PARA>
<PARA>  As reported in Telecom's 1989-90 Annual Report, the avoidable cost of Telecom's universal service obligation was $237 million in that year.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Telecom will be obliged to offer residential customers, whether metropolitan or rural, the option of continued access to non-timed local calls under price capped formulas. The packaging of alternative customer options is a matter for Telecom's commercial judgement, and should not impose additional costs on Telecom. Providing timed and non-timed calls on modern exchange equipment would not require the duplication of equipment.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) No changes to current charging and zoning arrangements for residential customers are proposed. Calls within country areas which are currently charged on an non-timed basis will continue.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) The second carrier will not have any obligation to deliver universal service, unless nominated by the Minister to be the `universal service carrier' for particular areas.</PARA>
<PARA>  (a) Telecom/OTC will, in the first instance, be the only universal service carrier for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) No. The second carrier will be required to contribute towards the costs of delivering universal service on an equitable basis via the universal service levy.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) No, the process for selecting the second telecommunications carrier is still underway and is scheduled for completion by the end of 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) Expressions of interest were lodged by potential second carriers on a confidential basis. No details about prospective bidders have therefore been made available publicly.</PARA>
<PARA>  (8) The selection process for the second carrier will ensure that the second carrier has the necessary financial strength and management capabilities to establish and sustain effective competition and to achieve the planned rates of capital investment in facilities. I will announce details of the successful bidder once the selection has been made.</PARA>
