<TITLE>SBS: Indian Language Broadcasts</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>  The petition of certain residents of Australia draws to the attention of the house its deep disappointment and sadness at the decision of the SBS Board to virtually remove six Indian language programs, including the Tamil program from the new schedule for Radio 2EA.</PARA>
<PARA>  For fourteen years the Tamil program has catered to the cultural, educational and religious interests of the Tamil community. The homeland news on the program is eagerly listened to by Tamil speakers in Sydney, Wollongong and Newcastle. The Tamil community does not have a daily or even a weekly newspaper to serve its interests. Therefore it is essential that the Tamil program be continued on Radio 2EA.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Tamil community has grown dramatically in numbers since the last census of 1986. This fact has not been taken into account by the SBS Rescheduling Committee. In fact this move by the SBS Board is a retrograde step which will have serious repercussions in terms of the Community's support for the Federal Government's policy of multi-culturalism. In the light of what happened how can the Tamil community believe that the Federal Government is sincere in its commitment to multi-culturalism?</PARA>
<PARA>  Your petitioners therefore request the House to instruct the SBS Board to prepare a new schedule for Radio 2EA that gives regular air time to the Tamil program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On behalf of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory, I present the Committee's report entitled Proposal to amend the National Capital Plan--Draft Amendment No. 1 Sections 10 (part), 37 and 62 CITY together with the submissions received by the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This report is the result of a public inquiry into the proposal by the National Capital Planning Authority to amend the national capital plan. The amendment involves changes to the land use policy for part of sections 10, 37 and 62 City--and includes land occupied by the Civil Pool, the YMCA, the Olympic Bowl, the Army Training Centre and an ACT Government engineering depot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The amendment to the plan proposed that the schedule of permissible land uses be amended to permit up to 35,000 square metres of offices on section 10. At the same time, it was proposed to remove administrative use from the range of permissible uses on section 37, so protecting the area for recreational and other uses compatible with the Civic Pool. The proposed amendment takes the form of a series of development guidelines which illustrate the nature of development sought for the area. </PARA>
<PARA>  The proposed changes were prompted by specific redevelopment proposals and were put forward following a joint planning study by the National Capital Planning Authority and the ACT Planning Authority. The proposed redevelopments and the amendment prepared in response by the two planning authorities raise fundamental questions about the nature of the city we want for our national capital. They raise questions about the location and distribution of employment, the efficiency of the city's transport system, the quality of the air we breathe, and the value of the leasehold system in ensuring the proper and equitable management of the city. </PARA>
<PARA>  The proposal to allow 35,000 square metres of offices to be built in this part of the city is of more than just local significance. Development of this order represents somewhere between 1,400 and 1,750 jobs at current rates of occupation. Despite the potential size of office developments that could be allowed by the amendment, the Committee agrees that, in the longer term, offices would be an appropriate use in this part of Civic. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the short to medium term, however, the Committee is anxious to see the long standing principles of decentralisation of employment in Canberra confirmed. To this end it is essential that new national Commonwealth office employment be located in Belconnen, Woden, Tuggeranong or Parkes. The Government can, through rigorous application of the policies of the national capital plan and by issuing explicit directions to its departmental heads, ensure that this vital planning objective is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>  The benefits of decentralisation are only fully realised when the resulting employment distribution generates two way flows on the metropolitan transport system. To date, barely 20 per cent of all office floor space has been located in the other town centres. Much of the balance is in central Canberra. Rather than contributing to decentralisation this indicates a tendency towards a centralised city structure. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is of particular significance in terms of Canberra as the national capital. What spare capacity there is to absorb further employment in central Canberra, particularly in the parliamentary zone, needs to be conserved for uses which add to Canberra's status as the nation's capital. </PARA>
<PARA>  Similarly, what spare capacity exists in Civic needs to be reserved for, and priority given to, its occupation by the private sector and, as the centre of territorial and municipal administration, by the central offices of the ACT Administration. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee was advised of the environmental conditions in Civic and, in particular, of the effects on air quality through the traffic additional employment would generate. The Committee was both surprised and deeply concerned at the poverty of direct environmental monitoring undertaken in Civic, especially given the importance attached to the use of environmental assessment in regulating development and redevelopment in Civic. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee was advised that monitoring of each of the key air quality variables - carbon monoxide, lead and nitrogen oxide - was undertaken from a single station in each case, which gave results that show neither the full extent nor the extreme breaches of recognised environmental standards. </PARA>
<PARA>  The introduction of substantial new employment into this part of Civic would undoubtedly exacerbate existing air quality problems. If, as the Committee understands, the standards for lead are likely to become more stringent, it will be some years before safe and acceptable levels will be achieved in Civic, even if employment does not increase. </PARA>
<PARA>   A central issue for many was the retention of the Civic Pool. The Committee was impressed by the importance attached to the Civic Pool by various users as an outdoor recreation facility and by others because of the heritage value placed on both the pool buildings and their setting. </PARA>
<PARA>  The question of building heights and their contribution to a particular urban design solution for this part of the Parliamentary Triangle was also considered in some detail. In brief, the Committee recommends that less than six storeys be built wherever possible. We also recommend that a development plan be prepared for Constitution Avenue. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee expressed some concern at the quality of the pedestrian links between the city, Glebe Park and Commonwealth Park along Allara Street. The Committee believes that a four-storey maximum building height along Allara Street could produce a scale of development more appropriate to Allara Street's role as an important pedestrian link from the city to the lake. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee also heard evidence relating to the management of leases within the study area in recent years. The closure of the Olympic Bowl raises questions regarding the failure of the lessee to comply with the requirements of the lease. The failure of the YMCA to honour an undertaking to the former Commonwealth Minister for the Territory to redevelop recreation facilities raises questions regarding the distribution and application of increased land values derived from changes in land use policy and lease purpose clauses. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee acknowledges that with the advent of self-government, the Commonwealth's interest in leasing and land administration in the Territory is considerably reduced. However, the nexus between the lease-hold system and planning in the ACT is such that the Commonwealth's ability to give effect to its planning intentions within areas of national capital significance is dependent upon the leasehold system being administered in a consistent and rigorous manner. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee supports the key proposals of the amendment. It accepts that, in land use terms, the introduction of offices is a reasonable policy. The Committee accepts that the environmental assessment requirements in the amendment provide sufficient safeguards to assess individual applications on their merits at the time they are made. </PARA>
<PARA>  The principal advantage of the proposed amendment is that it removes any unnecessary impediment to a major development proposal proceeding in this part of the city, provided it fulfils other relevant policies of the national capital plan. In short, it enables the planning authorities to get ahead of the game. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee also supports the removal of administrative use from the schedule of permissible uses for section 37. This has the effect of reinforcing the recreational purpose of the Civic Pool and the area around it. The major qualification recommended by the Committee involves re-examining building heights and removing a provision of the amendment which seeks to establish a strong built edge to Constitution Avenue. </PARA>
<PARA>  With these reservations, the Committee has concluded that the amendment provides a basis for redevelopment within the area in a manner consistent with the heritage and recreational value of this important area of the National Capital. </PARA>
<PARA>  In concluding, I warmly thank the Committee staff--Grant Harrison and Marlene Lyons --for their usual excellent and efficient work and, in particular, David Wright, the adviser to the Committee for this inquiry, for his valuable help with the drafting of this report. I move:</PARA>

<PARA>  The report is the second by the Committee dealing with its inquiry into Australia as an information society. The two reports presented so far need to be taken as companion volumes. Together they raise some very significant issues. Full and critical consideration of these issues will greatly enhance Australia's prospects of becoming the clever country that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) suggests or, even better, the intelligent country. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the Chairman tabled the first report in June, he said that the weakness of our economy, compared, say, with that of Japan, is partly due to our failure to recognise the extent to which knowledge and skill have replaced raw materials and muscle power in driving modern successful economies. In this regard, libraries are a much neglected and under-used resource with the capacity, if properly encouraged, to make enormous contributions to society. </PARA>
<PARA>  The inscription above the library at Alexandria in ancient Egypt, soon to be restored in a UNESCO project, proclaimed that it was a `Hospital for the Mind' and an inscription on its sister institution at Thebes advised that it provided `Medicine for the Soul'. </PARA>
<PARA>  At a time of economic recession we put enormous emphasis on physical well-being, and this might seem an inappropriate time to reiterate the need for intellectual and spiritual stimulation. Although libraries are still well placed to cater for a wide range of needs, we have so far failed to make the most of what they can offer. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee's first report Australia as an Information Society: Grasping New Paradigms has received strong support from the professionals involved in information and some media interest. We are still some distance from having a broad community recognition that information is of central importance to our economy, our democratic institutions and our national well-being. The Committee waits for the Government's response the report and its adoption of a national information policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our second report deals with a particular aspect of information access referred to only briefly in the first report and in broad outline. Our second report, complementary to the first, is concerned particularly with the role and future development of libraries. Although our libraries have developed into an information network of great national significance, there is some danger that they will be seen as increasingly peripheral in the face of developing computer based information systems. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have been the first parliamentary committee to make a serious review of libraries. The first major national review was conducted by Ralph Munn and Ernest Pitt under the auspices of the Carnegie Foundation and the Australian Council for Educational Research in 1935. It found that we lagged well behind much of the rest of the developed world. Our library resources then consisted of State libraries; parliamentary libraries, including the Commonwealth Parliament Library, which in those days incorporated what later became the National Library; a handful of university libraries; and numerous, but by then decrepit, subscription libraries in Mechanics Institutes and the like.  We have fortunately come a long way since then and have developed an extensive, free public library system. But over the past twenty years, demands for library services have increased so much that we need to rethink the way we fund, support and use our networks. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1975, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam commissioned the then librarian of the University of New South Wales, Allan Horton, to head a committee of inquiry into public libraries in Australia. Some elements in the community have grasped already that Australia is an information society, but governments tend to lag behind and have yet to respond to the needs of that society and the potential it can achieve. The fate of the Horton report Public Libraries in Australia which we discussed at some length, reflects this problem. If the Horton report had been acted upon, our libraries would now be far better equipped to serve our information needs and to support information-based industries. </PARA>
<PARA>  Horton made 53 recommendations, several of which related directly to Commonwealth assistance to libraries, including expenditure of $20m per annum, in 1975 prices. Other recommendations referred to librarian training, planning and coordination of services, the range of services to be offered and the introduction of new technologies. The report also recommended nine broad guidelines as the basis for the program of assistance. The Committee reviewed these guidelines and endorsed them by adopting them, with a minor modification, as a recommendation of its own. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Horton report suffered from unfortunate timing. It took only 11 months to complete and was tabled on 1 April 1976, 5 months after Mr Whitlam's removal from office. Its fate therefore was fairly predictable.  It was quickly shunted off to an interdepartmental committee and 45 months after it was presented, the Government boldly made the momentous announcement that a second IDC was required. In September 1981, 67 months after the Horton report's presentation, the Government announced that based on the second IDC report virtually none of its major recommendations would be adopted by the Commonwealth. The IDC had cautiously confined itself to the limitations of Prime Minister Fraser's federalism policies. Unfortunately, little has changed since then. As Gough Whitlam neatly observed of the report: `The Fraser Government put it on the shelf; the Hawke Government has so far failed to take it down'. </PARA>
<PARA>  The press report has come just in time to remind the Commonwealth of the role it should be playing and to expose the neglect of the recent past. Our review finds libraries facing extraordinary demands with limited increase in resources. They have just about coped with the information explosion and the increasing demands for a wider range of services. We saw little evidence that libraries have become irrelevant or ineffective. They can no longer be seen as isolated institutions and the use of computers and telecommunications has led to the increase of an information network of great national significance. </PARA>
<PARA>  But libraries now face the following challenges: an exponential increase in information; increase in demands to interpret information and to transform it into knowledge; demands to provide a greater diversity of services, including some that are quite complex; increasing demands which result from failures in the education system; and the need to acquire and apply a bewildering array of new, complex and expensive information and communication technologies. There must be substantial rethinking of roles and attitudes and resources must be directed to libraries to enable them to develop the services and information networks essential to the intellectual, cultural and economic growth of our society. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn now briefly to the Committee's recommendations, the most important of which puts the Commonwealth responsibilities in clear focus. We find that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) should develop a national library policy and make a detailed statement to the Parliament about the adequacy of the existing library and information networks in meeting Australia's information needs. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also recommend that the Commonwealth Government put the development and provision of libraries and information services on the agenda of a forthcoming Special Premiers Conference at which local government is represented. We recommend, also, that the Commonwealth review the funding of public libraries and, as part of its national libraries policy, adopt a funding program to overcome the unevenness in library networks and facilitate the development of new services and the introduction of new technologies. </PARA>
<PARA>  In our first report on information we stressed the extraordinary fragmentation of information, with Commonwealth Ministers sharing responsibility, but with ill-defined boundaries. This situation is central to our second report. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has responsibility for the National Library of Australia. We can assume that if anyone should have responsibility for a national library policy it should be the Minister responsible for the National Library. But this responsibility has never been taken up. It has been divided between the States and local government, with the Commonwealth conspicuously failing to take up the national challenge. </PARA>
<PARA>  Other recommendations we make deal with the provision of specialist services; access to what has become known as the `distributed national collection'; the application of new technologies and the training of other measures needed to support such application; the general training of librarians; the development of value added commercial information services; and the funding of library services supporting the education system. The Chairman intends to deal with these recommendations in more detail when he speaks on this matter later. </PARA>
<PARA>  Before concluding I would like to thank those who have assisted the Committee to gather information and who assisted in its deliberations. Mr Allan Horton, of the Horton report, met with the Committee and gave us the benefit of his expertise and experience. Warren Horton, Director-General of the National Library--no relation to Allan Horton--provided valuable information. State librarians and others from the library profession also made detailed submissions. If you look at the back of the report, Mr Speaker, you will see listed the people who provided these submissions. It is very comforting to see such a long list and to realise that such a large number of people are interested in our library services. State librarians and others from the library profession also made detailed submissions, as did the Australian Library and Information Association and the Australian Council of Library and Information Services. I commend the report to the House. I move:</PARA>

<PARA>  That the House take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Eyes Have It is the report of the Select Committee on Televising of the House of Representatives which was tabled last month in this chamber. It is a review of the first trial period that we have had of televising the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia was one of the first countries in the world to in fact introduce the radio broadcasting of parliament, in 1946. I think we were beaten only by the New Zealanders. Surprisingly we were one of the last countries to introduce the televising of procedures. Members of this House and the general public alike, as well as representatives of media organisations, have been generally pleased with what has happened through this trial period. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note that something like 65,500 people watch the telecast of the House of Representatives Question Time every afternoon from this particular chamber, and about 50,000 watch it from the Senate on the alternate days. The other fascinating thing is that already the televising of the Commonwealth Parliament has created a great deal of interest within the general public. That was obvious from the ongoing telecasts of the Gulf war debates in January this year when the ABC indicated there was a definite surge in the number of people watching the Parliament. Of course, those figures only refer to those people who were watching in their homes and do not include consumption of the telecast in offices, hospitals, schools and educational institutions around Australia. So I think we have established telecasting now as part of Australian society, as well we should. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was a crazy situation when the people of Australia could sit at home and watch the proceedings of the House of Commons or the American Senate or the committee debates in the United States, or the parliaments of Germany and even of Spain, and yet could not see what was happening in their own Parliament. That has changed, and already the telecasting of the proceedings in this place has raised quite a deal of interest overseas. I understand one of the main cable networks in the United States, C-SPAN, is already inquiring how it can have access to the procedures in this place. </PARA>
<PARA>  I must say that the recommendations of this Committee do not really change the nature of the telecasts to any great degree from what we had during the trial period. However, there are a couple of innovations which are worthy of attention. The first one is the decision of the Committee to recommend that the committees of this Parliament can be telecast. As has happened in the United States, I think this will broaden the whole range of the appeal of the telecasting of Parliament to the news organisations, and in fact will give the people of Australia direct access into some of the major work that is undertaken in this chamber and in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second recommendation that has come through is that from tonight we would look at the telecasting of the adjournment debate. My late father had a most marvellous library, and when he died I inherited part of that library. Part of the material I gathered was a series of debates held on ABC radio just after the war on Sunday nights at 8.00; I think they were referred to as fireside chats. One particular transcript went through the pros and cons of broadcasting on radio the proceedings of the Commonwealth Parliament. It was quite fascinating to go through that and to see the arguments that were put up against the broadcasting of Parliament in 1946. They would seem to have been exactly the same arguments put up against the telecasting of Parliament in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the decisions made at that time was that, at the end of the parliamentary day, the adjournment debate was not to be broadcast. I have done some research on this. I went through these documents from the ABC, and the only reason I can find that the adjournment debate was not to be broadcast was that it was a financial consideration--there was no other reason whatsoever. At last this has been overcome. I think the adjournment debate is one of the most important parts of the day's proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>  Over my 16 years in this place there has been a decline in the quality of the adjournment debate. It does not have the fire and passion that we saw in the mid-1970s when I first entered this place. I would hope that the decision to telecast that debate will really bring the whole focus of private members' business back to the public. It is a most important part of the night, and this particular decision as a result of this report will be able to give great focus to private members to raise real issues in their electorates and, indeed, to get some publicity for those electorates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am very pleased to speak in support of the report of the Select Committee on the Televising of the House of Representatives. I fully endorse the comments made by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), and I believe that congratulations should go to all Committee members, that is, the Speaker of the House, the honourable member for Fadden, the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling), the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks), the Secretary, Phil Bergin; the inquiry staff, Sue Morton and executive assistant, Elizabeth Robertson. I am sure that both the honourable member for Stirling and the honourable member for Lilley regret that they are unable to be here today, because I am sure they would have taken part in this debate. On their behalf I wish to support the recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There are some 12 recommendations in all and, as the honourable member for Fadden said, two of the most important recommendations regard the televising of committees and the adjournment debate. This is important because many people do not understand the work that parliamentarians are involved in while in Canberra. We are expected--and rightfully so--to attend functions, fetes and many other appointments in our electorates, but much of the important work involves sitting on committees in this place as well as speaking in the adjournment debate, as the honourable member for Fadden said, on local issues. I believe that the more the general public is able to see the work that politicians do, the better appreciation it will have. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the honourable member for Fadden said, in some regards there is not as much passion in the debates today as there once was. The criticism is often levelled that politicians are too negative. I do not hold with that view. The greater proportion of legislation that goes through this House is supported by both sides of the House; however, because we represent the hopes and aspirations of the Australian people, we should have some passion in debate and we should disagree with each other and with each other's points of view. A strong Opposition means a strong Government, and there is nothing wrong with both sides of the House interchanging with tough ideas. It is the decisions that we make as representatives of the people that have a massive impact on all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  If more and more people take the opportunity to watch the televising of Parliament, they will have a better appreciation of it. Consequently, these recommendations should be supported by everyone. Prior to coming into the chamber today to speak on this matter, I noted that in Harry S. Truman's personal memoirs he made the comment that Thomas Jefferson took only 17 days to write the Declaration of Independence, which, along with the British tradition, is the very foundation upon which parliamentary democracy is based today. When one considers the challenges that politicians had to overcome in those days, it is not much to expect that we should have a little bit of passion here today. In closing I wish to quote from that work that was written so long ago in 1776, because it is as important today as it was at that time. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>We hold these truths to be self-evident--That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed--That, whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government. . .</PARA>
<PARA>That demonstrates what politics and this institution are all about. When we see what is happening in Yugoslavia and what has happened in the last 12 months in eastern Europe, we should pride ourselves that we have the opportunity in this place to show a bit of passion in debate. The televising of that debate will mean that the general public is the winner and will benefit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to speak in support of the report of the Select Committee on Televising of the House of Representatives, which was tabled last month. I support the comments made by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). They praised the work of the people who have taken part in this inquiry, particularly the staff who prepared the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As most people would know, the Parliament has been broadcast since 1946. It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Fadden talk about his father's book collection, which includes articles arguing for and against the broadcasting of Parliament, which arguments are almost the same as the arguments against the televising of the Parliament.  Certainly in my electorate, and in many electorates--particularly in rural Australia-- people look forward to these broadcasts. It has been a bit of a problem for members of parliament in that when we go out to those areas many of the people we speak to know more about what is happening in the Parliament than we do, because they listen to all the debates. It is unfortunate that some of those broadcasts have been curtailed. Many people have asked me what has happened to them----</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I think that is what it is--they like to see their members of parliament; and, in some instances, they like to know who they are. When I was a youngster at school, I learnt very little about the Federal Parliament--about any parliament, as a matter of fact--and it was not until I was in my thirties that I started to get some sort of understanding about how the Parliament worked, how important it was to me and how important it was that I had the vote. So I see the televising of the Parliament as a very important step in our democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Parliament has been televised occasionally since about 1974. The famous joint sitting of the Parliament in 1974 was televised. In 1984 the Budget debates started to be televised and they have been televised occasionally since then. As the honourable member for Fadden said, during the Gulf war many people were watching the Parliament to see what was going on during debates. </PARA>
<PARA>  Interestingly, a recent survey showed that about 68,000 people watch Question Time direct and that fewer people watch the repeat of it on television in the evening. Although that may not seem to be many, the numbers are growing. When something of important political interest occurs, more people watch. </PARA>
<PARA>  Earlier the honourable member for Hinkler said how important it was for people to have access to the Parliament to know what is going on. I firmly believe that some of the events that have happened in Russia over recent days were as a result of the televising of CNN into Russia. Many people in Russia knew what was happening from day to day. It is not like in the old days when people did not know what was happening, there was no communication and, therefore, there was doubt in their minds. A coup could have been carried out very efficiently and very effectively. Today that has changed. I believe that one of the factors would be that people are informed through the magnificent and very powerful medium of television. </PARA>
<PARA>  The conditions for the televising of the Parliament have been laid down. I think they are very good conditions. I think it is a shame that in the past people have used this Parliament as a medium to get their message across, even though they might be in the minority. Since I have been in this Parliament I, and certainly the honourable member for Fadden, have seen papers, daffodils, ping-pong balls, and all manner of things, thrown over from the gallery; in fact, a couple of people have hurled themselves over the balcony. I think it is a great idea that these people are not given the publicity that they seek. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) has said, the broadcasting of the Parliament is very pertinent particularly to people in rural and regional Australia, because they want to know what is happening in their Parliament. They are on the knife edge. They are the people producing the wealth of this country, and they really do like to know what their parliamentarians are doing for them. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was mentioned that the adjournment debate will be televised. The recommendation is there and from tonight that will be possible. I think this is a great advance, because I find--I know that most of my parliamentary colleagues would agree--that the members who are very keen are the ones who take part in the adjournment debate. They represent their electorates very well. In many cases this is the only opportunity they get to put a point of view for their electorate and for the wider Australian community. It is an opportunity for the members themselves. The only statement a male member of parliament can make is in the colour of his tie. A great increase in the number of colourful ties has occurred since Parliament has been televised. I am sure that our sartorial splendour will increase. We will see, as I think we have already, the parties starting to put their better looking members in front of the cameras. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I join with the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) in supporting the move to continue the live broadcast of the proceedings of this chamber on television. I would note that in the upper galleries today students are in attendance from the Yarramalong Public School, which is in my electorate. I am sure they will enjoy their visit to Parliament House. The fact that proceedings of this chamber are televised means that students, such as those who attend Yarramalong Public School and all the other schools in my electorate, have an opportunity to see Question Time and other activities that take place in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It was in 1946 when this House agreed to have its proceedings broadcast on the ABC's radio network, and that has worked well. It was not until 1974 that the next step was taken. I can recall when, as a year 12 student undergoing my trial HSC, I and others broke from our exams to watch the proceedings of the first joint sitting of the Australian Parliament, which took place in old Parliament House following the 1974 Federal election. I think the joint sitting had a great impact on me and on many Australians, who were able, for the first time, to gain an appreciation of not only the ability of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam but also, perhaps, the ability of Billy McMahon and some others when their performances in old Parliament House were telecast into the lounge rooms of Australian homes. </PARA>
<PARA>  Through the televising of Budget Speeches and debates on the Gulf war in this chamber, I believe Australians have been allowed to gain a better appreciation of proceedings in this place. Earlier this year, the House decided to extend the broadcasting rights of television stations by allowing them to take the live internal television monitoring service and use excerpts in news telecasts, and also to allow the ABC to broadcast Question Time from the Senate and House of Representatives. I understand audience research shows that an average of 68,000 people watch the live telecast of Question Time and about 50,000 people watch the delayed telecast. It seems there are members of the public who have greater tolerance of the behaviour of members of parliament than one might expect. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am concerned, however, about the impression people might gain of Parliament if they watch only the excerpts shown on news bulletins. Given that media stations have very limited time in which to telecast the news, naturally members of parliament cannot demand that each evening's news broadcast contain great slabs of speeches which on occasions may be boring or less interesting. However, I am concerned that certain events that are shown on the news each evening tend to be those that contain an element of conflict or aggression and that, therefore, there is a danger that members of the public will begin to believe that a great deal of misbehaviour occurs in this chamber and that it is very rare for members on both sides of the House to agree. </PARA>
<PARA>  While I accept that it is very difficult for the Parliament to force news programmers to provide a more balanced coverage of the debates that take place in this chamber, I am concerned about the tendency to believe that when Labor, Liberal and National members of this Parliament agree, it is not newsworthy; that the public is not interested; and that it is only when politicians disagree that it becomes newsworthy. As time goes by, I believe that position can be improved. The best way to improve that is to allow greater televising of the committee proceedings of this chamber, something which I think will not only provide for a more balanced coverage and a better informed public but also increase the power of  this  chamber  in  its  dealings  with  the Executive. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am sure that the students up in the gallery from Yarramalong public school, along with many other primary school students, probably know more about the operation of this chamber than their parents. By allowing the televising of this chamber and encouraging more students to learn about it, we can ensure that they will all benefit. I also see that students from Mater Dei are in the gallery behind me and, as I said before, it is excellent that they are in the chamber today and they might be able to watch this on television if it is on the news tonight.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- When Marshall McLuhan made his famous statement, `The medium is the message', he did not have in mind the televising of the House of Representatives in Australia. But nowhere is the accuracy of his message more true than in the broadcast of parliamentary proceedings. For it is here that we witness the confluence of two fundamental branches of democracy. A democracy is distinguished by the right of people to choose freely and decide on their own future and on the right of free speech. The broadcast of the forum in which the representatives of the people make decisions about the future of their nation can only enhance the democratic process. I therefore generally support the recommendations of the Select Committee on Televising of the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In doing so I note, as the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) did, that the average daily audience for live telecasts of Question Time is some 68,000 people. Whilst the ABC noted in its submission that the ratings overall were low, these figures represent one in 250 Australians. They become more staggering when it is considered that Question Time begins during the last half-hour of Days of our Lives and concludes during the first half-hour of The Young and the Restless. When replays of Question Time, the evening news bulletins and the school audiences are added, these figures show that the Australian people have certainly welcomed the television broadcasts from this place. Indeed, it is interesting and pleasing to note that some 53 per cent of students have viewed the telecast of Question Time since the commencement of the broadcasting of proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>  I noted with interest that Network 10 said in its submission that the need for morning doorstops just to get pictures became peripheral with the advent of broadcasts. In my first few days here, I noticed the presence of television crews each morning at the door of the House of Representatives. Whilst my arrival may have attracted some interest, I suspected after the second week that the crews were there for some other purpose. Indeed, not all that attracts interest in this place occurs in this chamber, as the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) continually reminds us and demonstrates. When I found myself pictured--inadvertently, I should add--leading the charge away from the Labor Caucus room, I wondered whether I had been counted in the 44. </PARA>
<PARA>  I endorse the recommendations about making available to the news media the debate on the adjournment, for the reality of the modern parliamentary system is that there are few occasions when backbenchers of any party can bring to the attention of the Ministry and the people matters which concern their constituents in a direct manner. However, the televising of committee proceedings requires more caution and ought to be done with discretion. For nowhere is parliament more like a court of law than when it is conducting an inquiry into which witnesses are called and required to give evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>  That having been said, I wish to register my dismay that the Committee report has not gone far enough. In recommending the retention of restrictions, such as no withdrawals or points of order to be shown in any replay of the broadcast after the live version has already been seen by the non-Days of our Lives watchers, the Committee seems to have fallen foul of the red tie syndrome. This is the idea that everything we do must be in line with the public relations advice as to how we as members should appear. This has everything to do with image and nothing to do with the truth. </PARA>
<PARA>  By seeing parliament as a vast public relations exercise to make the voters believe that we are earning our keep, we diminish the democratic process. We live in an instant age, as has been pointed out, when events from around the world can be seen. Why then should the Australian people not see, for example, the prevarication of a Minister who is unwilling to answer a question put to him or her?</PARA>
<PARA>  Why should the Australian people not have the right to see the prepared statement from a Minister in response to a dorothy dixer, or a waffling reply from a Minister or the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)--as we have seen in recent days--and the points of order and interjections made? I say:  let the Australian people judge for themselves. We should never lose sight of the fact that we are servants of the public and should be accountable to them. </PARA>
<PARA>  Only in this way can we win esteem for both the Parliament and its work. By sanitising the representation of Parliament we lay ourselves open to suspicion of negligence and wrongdoing. In doing so, we may be seen to be that which we most fear being--the middle aged and the restful. I say:  televise and be damned. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am pleased to speak on this report on the televising of Parliament. I welcome a number of the recommendations and the extent to which they extend the evolutionary process of the proceedings of this House using electronic media--in this case television, following on the 45 years we have had of radio broadcasts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As one who has not been in the chamber all that long but who had an interest in politics stimulated by the opportunity to hear parliamentary proceedings on radio and pursued that interest after leaving school and in an academic career, I believe the understanding of the political process through making this Parliament more relevant, more realistic and lifelike to the community at large is critical in the democratic process.  This report we are considering today represents a further stage of that process. The move to the new Parliament House and the televising of Question Time has helped to make the people aware of the investment they have made in this edifice. Hopefully, as time goes on, it will encourage more people to become well informed about the political process. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the education sector we have long been concerned to ensure that students particularly gain a comprehensive political awareness. It has been pleasing to note the many schools which come from around Australia to Canberra to observe what goes on in this Parliament. As well as that, there are the various information courses that the Electoral Commission operates; they have been particularly useful. The televising of Parliament is a very important part of that. Other speakers have made reference to the ratings that Question Time gets. I am always impressed when I go back to the electorate of Parramatta and hear people say, `We were able to watch Parliament this week. We were interested to see the way the proceedings went'. Or it may be that their local member asked a question. </PARA>
<PARA>  So a lot of people have had Parliament brought to them in a relevant way. I think particularly of the many senior citizens in the community who watch Question Time and who do find--as stated by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews)--that only half of Days of our Lives is necessary for them each day and that they are all the better for watching an hour of Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA>  A lot of people take the opportunity to watch. It is very important that we encourage that awareness because there are many issues discussed both at Question Time and in the broad range of parliamentary debates that people are interested in and would like to know more about. Certainly, from my observation, they are able to talk in a more informed way because they have had this chance to watch Question Time. They see things first-hand and also appreciate the life and vitality of Parliament. That is also very important if we are going to make this institution both contemporary and relevant to the average citizen. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am particularly pleased to see in the recommendations the reference to allowing the televising of the adjournment debate. I think that is an interesting and important part of the parliamentary proceedings. It is a pity this decision was not made yesterday because the very vigorous debate about the consumption tax that occurred in the adjournment debate last night was not televised. I am sure there are many areas in provincial Australia that would have been pleased to hear and observe the debate on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that there has been great merit in the discussion on the parliamentary committee process. The parliamentary banking inquiry evoked great interest because the proceedings of that particular inquiry have been televised. It has enabled people to make submissions and to start talking about banking issues. It has helped to put this Parliament and its parliamentary committee process very firmly in the public arena in a way that will make it stronger, more relevant and more useful for the future. I believe that the recommendations that will flow from that inquiry will be useful. In part, that has been because the proceedings have been televised and people who have concerns about banking issues have used that awareness to make further submissions; that will add greatly to the recommendations that the Joint Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration will bring forward. </PARA>
<PARA>  For those reasons, I believe we are taking a worthwhile step with this further report and I certainly welcome the televising of the Parliament in the fashion that has been outlined in the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- The Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act has resolved to address item (h) of its terms of reference relating to the retiring age of judges of the Family Court of Australia in its first report entitled The Retiring Age of Judges of the Family Court of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In a report by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in October 1976 it was recommended that steps be taken to amend section 72 of the Australian Constitution to provide that all justices of the High Court and other Federal courts have a maximum retiring age of 70 years. This proposal was endorsed by the Constitutional Convention and approved by the Australian voters at a referendum. The Constitution Alteration (Retirement of Judges) Act 1977 came into effect from 29 July 1977. Section 72 of the Constitution was amended to provide a maximum age of 70 years for justices of the High Court and to empower the Parliament to make laws to set a retiring age of less than 70 for justices of any court created by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  The only Federal court to have a maximum retiring age of less than 70 years was the Family Court of Australia. Section 23A, which established 65 as the maximum retiring age, was inserted into the Family Law Act in 1977 following the amendment to section 72 of the Constitution. Prior to this, judges of the Family Court of Australia were appointed for life. There was no subsequent amendment to the Federal Court Act to set the retiring age for other Federal courts at 65 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was felt at that time that the provision of the 65 year retiring age was a reflection of community concern. Due to the demanding and arduous nature of some of the disputes, it was considered that there was good reason for requiring judges of the Family Court to retire by the age recognised as the maximum retiring age for most other professions in the community. The major arguments advanced both for and against retaining the present retirement age of 65 years for Family Court judges have been examined. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee does not believe, in the light of the evidence available to it, that there would be any valid reason to consider lowering the maximum retiring age to less than 65 years. It is acknowledged that family law matters may cause a significant level of stress as a result of the often highly emotional issues involved. For example, access and custody disputes and the distribution of the assets of a marriage are very grave problems. However, the Committee believes that the issues dealt with in some of the other Federal courts where the retiring age is 70 years would be equally stressful. </PARA>
<PARA>  A number of judges hold dual commissions with the Federal Court and the Family Court. The Committee believes that it is an unusual situation to have a retiring age of 65 years for Family Court judges and 70 years for Federal Court judges where a dual commission is held. </PARA>
<PARA>  The importance of awareness of social values for Family Court judges was also considered by the Committee. The Committee believes that there would not be a substantial difference between the social values of judges who are 65 years of age and those who are 70 years of age. In coming to decisions in relation to matters before him or her, the judge would hear from solicitors, witnesses, counsellors and registrars. The judge's experience is then brought to bear in bringing all these threads together and reaching a conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA>  The issue of judicial burnout was raised as a concern by one Family Court judge.  It was suggested that, if the retiring age were to be extended, it should be subject to the provision that no judge should continue beyond 65 if he or she had more than 20 years service at that time. A judge who is suffering from stress or burnout has the option of retiring at age 60, but must have 10 years service to qualify for a judicial pension. The Committee believes that the issue of judicial burnout may warrant further consideration. The Committee also believes that there is no reason to assume that judges of the Family Court have a diminished capacity to make sound decisions after age 65, when all other Federal Court judges are considered competent to adjudicate up to the age of 70 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since the early days of the Family Court the processes of the Court have been refined. Routine and uncontested matters are now determined by registrars and judicial registrars, leaving the judges to preside and adjudicate in the more complex contested cases that come before the Court. Despite this refinement to the operation of the Court, the Committee has received many complaints relating to the length of time taken for particular cases to be heard. It has been suggested to the Committee that there is a need for more Family Court judges. By forcing judges to retire at age 65 the problem will simply increase. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee believes that valuable expertise is being lost to the Family Court through the early retirement of Family Court judges. In its early years the Family Court had a specialised jurisdiction, but this role has been considerably expanded to include not only property cases and issues relating to children but also matters previously dealt with by the Federal Court of Australia. Disputes about property in the Family Court can raise complex questions relating to such areas of the law as property, equity, taxation, contract, company, constitutional and conflict law. Similar questions may be raised in other superior courts, where the retiring age is 70 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  It would appear to the Committee that, if a judge of the Supreme Court up to the age of 70 is able to preside over a matter relating to children, there is no logical reason why a Family Court judge would be any less able to do so beyond the age of 65 years. The same can be said of the appeal processes in the Family Court. An appeal from the Family Court is first heard by the Full Court of the Family Court. Any subsequent appeal is heard by the High Court, whose judges have a maximum retiring age of 70 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  The jurisdiction of the Family Court has been increased. This increased jurisdiction can be seen in the provisions relating to cross-vesting. This legislation, introduced in 1977, has meant that the Family Court can exercise the jurisdiction of the Family Court and the States' Supreme Courts in a number of matters. The legislation allows disputes involving a third party to be determined by the Family Court. In exercising this jurisdiction, a Family Court is exercising jurisdiction that would otherwise come under the State Supreme Courts. The Family Court has often been treated as a poor relation compared with the Federal Court of Australia. It has generally lacked resources, and the conditions of service for judges have been thought to be unequal to those of the other Federal Courts. There have been difficulties in the past in attracting the most suitable candidate to the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee believes that an increase in the maximum retiring age for Family Court judges would make the Family Court a more attractive option for many experienced legal practitioners and, by extending the retiring age, the opportunity would be created for new judicial appointments to obtain the necessary experience under the guidance of senior Family Court judges who may wish to continue past 65 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  With 10 of the current judges of the Family Court who have tenure until 65 due to retire in the next five years, an extension of the maximum retiring age to 70 would allow greater time to attract the most appropriate people to the Bench. The Committee was informed by the Chief Justice of the Family Court, the Hon. Alastair Nicholson, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The present retiring age acts as a deterrent to younger persons who do not necessarily wish to face compulsory retirement at 65, particularly if they feel that there is a reasonable prospect of appointment to another court which does not have such a limitation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Chief Justice also noted that a retiring age of 65 years acts as a deterrent to existing judges of the court who might have been prepared to continue on past the present retiring age of 60 but believe their prospects of commencing a fresh career are better at 60 than at 65. The Committee believes that extending the retiring age for Family Court judges to 70 would be consistent with other superior courts;  make optimum use of the skills and abilities of current judges; prevent loss of human capital; have the potential to save taxpayers' funds; and encourage the development of consistent principles and guidelines through precedents. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee believes the reasons for fixing a retiring age of 65 years for the Family Court are no longer valid. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that, as a matter of priority, the Family Law Act be amended to fix a maximum retiring age of 70 years for Family Court judges. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, at this early stage of the report, I would like to place on the record the Committee's appreciation to the secretary of the Committee, Mr John Stanhope; to Ms Bronwen Worthington and Mrs Lesley Cowan for the tremendous assistance they have already given to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Last month the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inspected defence facilities in north Queensland and the Torres Strait. This was an important visit because it was in line with the Dibb report, the defence White Paper, Defence of Australia, which was published in 1987, and the force structure review announced by the Government early this year. The trip was also significant because it is the first time that the Defence Subcommittee has visited Torres Strait since the Subcommittee --or a version of it--came into existence in 1973.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It may be opportune for me to record in the Hansard the debt of the Joint Committee to former Senator David Hamer, one of the earlier chairmen of a committee of the Joint Committee known as Subcommittee C which dealt with defence issues, his successor, the late Hon. Bob Katter, the former member for Kennedy, and Mr Manfred Cross--who were both stalwarts of the defence debate in this Parliament and also good friends of many members and former members of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since 1973, familiarisation visits and inspections have been considered an essential part of the Subcommittee's activities. I know that Mr Katter, Mr Cross and I, during my term as chairman of the Defence Subcommittee, have encouraged Committee members to visit defence facilities around Australia. In this regard we have had inspections and discussions with personnel at the First Military District, the Second Military District, land force command, naval and air force facilities in those regions, the Third Military District in Victoria, defence facilities in Tasmania and also defence facilities in South Australia. The Defence Subcommittee has a very busy itinerary in that regard. We have visited the defence facilities across the northern part of the continent annually and this year the Committee proposes to again visit defence facilities in the northern part of the continent in October. All of this is designed to inculcate in members of the Defence Subcommittee an educated awareness of, and interest in, defence issues so that they may contribute to the debate more meaningfully and forcefully, I hope, both at Subcommittee level and also within this House but, more importantly, in the wider Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Defence Subcommittee has conducted rigorous inquiries into several defence issues--for example, the management of Australia's defence, personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force and, now, the Australian Defence Force Reserve. The report of that latter inquiry is well under way. I have had a good look at some of the initial drafts and I am most impressed with the way that it is coming along. But I just repeat: information gained during inspections of defence facilities across wider Australia complements the awareness of members in that they are able to make a very positive contribution towards improving defence awareness, improving the defence debate and, hopefully in that regard, ensuring that the people of Australia are aware of the absolute and fundamental need for an adequate defence force in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  On this visit we visited an Army Reserve formation at Townsville, the 11th Brigade, which is one of the finest Army Reserve brigades in the country. It has three battalions. The 31st Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment, is a standard Army Reserve infantry battalion, which was raised in late 1986 from the 31st Independent Rifle Company and is headquartered in Townsville. It was originally raised nearly 105 years ago and its battle honours include most of the major campaigns in which Australia has participated. </PARA>
<PARA>  The 42nd Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment, is also a standard Army Reserve infantry battalion which has its headquarters in Rockhampton. That battalion is one of the best Army Reserve infantry battalions in the Australian Army and has a long tradition of having almost a full complement of reservists year after year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third battalion is the 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment, which is one of the Australian Army's three regional force surveillance units and is headquartered in Cairns. The brigade is commanded by Colonel John Crocker, AM, a distinguished Australian soldier who was a leader of the Australian military contingent to Namibia. He is very highly regarded for his military skills and leadership as an Army officer. The area of operations of the 11th Brigade is very wide. In line with the task given to it in 1987 by the Defence of Australia White Paper, it is charged, within the limitations of time and resources, with ensuring that there is individual and collective training at the sub-unit, that is, at the company level. More importantly, it is charged with the protection and defence of vital assets--in this case, the Comalco facilities at Weipa. </PARA>
<PARA>  One issue of serious concern to me is the small number of training days that have been allocated to 11th Brigade. It is an issue which will be taken up with great vigour with the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). We find that individual soldiers are now receiving about 30 days training per year, which in my view is totally insufficient to develop battle craft and military skills of the kind that are required if the brigade is to deploy in a fighting capability within 90 days of call out, which is the period that has been set by the commander as the optimum objective of the brigade. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee also visited the 3rd Brigade, which is a Regular Army brigade. As at 30 June 1991, it had 3,169 personnel. It is the major combat component of the Australian Defence Force's operational deployment force and is the brigade which is the cutting edge, so to speak, of the Australian Army. The other day I asked a question about the development of democracy in Vanuatu. That had particular relevance to the soldiers of 3rd Brigade, who not long ago were ready to deploy to Vanuatu to protect the legitimate government in Vanuatu and also civilian personnel in that area. </PARA>
<PARA>  So 3rd Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Michael Keating, a former commander of the land warfare centre at Canungra, is the prime combat organisation of the Australian Army and is very important in the order of battle of the Australian Defence Force. The Subcommittee visited the 5th Aviation Regiment where the Black Hawk helicopters are located, the operation support group at RAAF Townsville, defence reserve facilities in Cairns, HMAS Cairns, defence reserve facilities in the Torres Strait and also at Weipa. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the short time allotted, two other speakers will have more to say in relation to those particular issues. I would like to join with other members of the Subcommittee in enjoining the Government to ensure that action is taken to develop an all-weather road capability from Cairns to Weipa as part of our defence assets, to commence construction of the bare base facilities at RAAF Scherger, to improve training days for the Army reservists in that area, and to ensure that there is greater consultation with the Torres Strait community and the Army Reserve.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- As a member of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I have over the past few years participated in numerous inspections of defence and associated facilities throughout Australia. These familiarisation visits and inspections are an important part of our Subcommittee's activities and provide members with invaluable information and first-hand experience to assist us to develop a greater knowledge and a better understanding of the many issues that come before us for consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In this regard the recent visit to north Queensland and the Torres Strait was undoubtedly one of the most interesting, useful and successful we have so far undertaken. Although this area has long been acknowledged as one of the most strategically important for Australia's defence, it is the first time the Defence Subcommittee has visited the region, and the itinerary was rather formidable. </PARA>
<PARA>  During the visit considerable emphasis was placed on providing opportunities for direct contact between Subcommittee members and service personnel, both regulars and reservists, of all ranks. This was one of the most satisfactory aspects of the program. One can learn a great deal about operational and personnel matters from the men in the field. In addition, we met with representatives of several civilian organisations and local authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>  From a personal viewpoint, perhaps the highlight of the four days was being able to participate as an observer in Exercise Puk Puk at High Range in Townsville. Witnessing the various stages of the air mobile assault and the live firing attack at such close quarters was a unique and most interesting experience, as was the opportunity of flying in Black Hawk assault helicopters with combat soldiers, and joining the officers and men in the field for lunch.</PARA>
<PARA>  Throughout our visit we were provided with excellent and comprehensive briefings by senior Navy, Army and Air Force officers. These discussions were often conducted on an informal basis and, amongst other things, gave the Subcommittee members an opportunity to gain new and valuable perspectives on the roles and operations of an Army Reserve land command formation, a major combat component of the Australian Defence Force's operational deployment force, otherwise known as the ready reaction force, an air mobile and battlefield support aviation regiment, and the surveillance operations, including fisheries surveillance, of a Fremantle class patrol boat fleet. </PARA>
<PARA>  Responsibility for the surveillance of Australia's vast and remote northern region is not limited to the Defence Force and, accordingly, when the Subcommittee visited Cairns it was briefed on the work of the Australian Customs Service and Coastwatch, and the important role they play in monitoring our extensive northern coastline and waters for illegal activities such as the trade in drugs and weapons, the export of native fauna, foreign fishing incursions and the detection of illegal immigrants. Members of the Subcommittee also visited Weipa and, whilst there, spent an enjoyable, interesting and informative few hours with the manager and staff of the Comalco bauxite mine. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am aware that my good friend the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) will be recommending that the 762 kilometre northern development road that links Cairns and Weipa be upgraded to all-weather status. The Chairman of the Subcommittee, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) has already alluded to this very important road. I unhesitatingly endorse the comments made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Herbert, and I certainly welcome the comments that the right honourable member for New England will make. </PARA>
<PARA>  During this visit I was continually impressed by the high levels of skill, commitment and dedication demonstrated by our Defence Force personnel, and the cooperation and assistance provided by other government authorities and civilian organisations and individuals. It is an excellent reflection on the organisational skills of the Subcommittee secretariat that we managed to achieve so much in such a relatively short period. We covered a lot of territory in the four days available, and we certainly learned a lot. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank everyone who contributed in any way to ensuring this visit was such a worthwhile and successful exercise. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Mr Deputy Speaker, in opening, I seek your indulgence to make two remarks apart from the report. Firstly, I express through you, to Mr Speaker, my thanks for the good wishes of the Speaker and honourable members for my recovery after my recent hospitalisation. I can assure all honourable members that it is a damned sight better than the alternative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Secondly, the former Prime Minister Sir John Gorton this week celebrated his eightieth birthday. This will probably be the only occasion I will have a chance to pass on to him, on behalf I am sure of all members of the House, my best wishes for that auspicious occasion. He marked a very interesting phase in the change in perspective of Australian members of parliament. I regarded him as a great Australian--I still regard him as a great Australian--and certainly as an excellent Prime Minister and colleague. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to make a few comments on the report of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I totally endorse the remarks made by the Chairman of the Subcommittee, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) and by my colleague the coalition Whip, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson). </PARA>
<PARA>  In particular I want to pick up a few areas which I think are of great concern. At a time when we have had, in this Parliament, some debate about what is said to be the crass politics of the new federalism, I think it is important that Australians understand that in some of those policies of the past there are funding proposals and aspects of policy development we could well revert to. In particular I refer to the program of beef roads or development roads which was initiated some years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>   As we move to the year 2000, I find it totally objectionable that there will be an area of Australia, significantly larger than Victoria, which will not be trafficable by road for more than seven months. Indeed, when we visited and talked to those responsible for the 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment, they told us that there is not only the problem with the central link road. The difficulty of moving between any of the points on either the eastern coast or the western coast of Cape York is that one essentially has to move inland to go down that spine in order to come back to the coast again. Yet for about seven months of the year through the wet that road is totally impassable. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend to the Government, therefore, the idea of developing a new program which should specifically provide for the Cooktown to Bamaga road. That program might well entail $40m or $50m over a five-year period. The initial program would require a survey and some design of bridges. There would then be a funding program which could be encompassed by providing for outside contractors. The road is not just for strategic purposes; it is for development purposes and also for tourist purposes. I believe it is absolutely critical that we proceed on that line. It is something that should appeal to governments seeking work opportunities and, certainly, as we move to the year 2000, it would provide a well worth while adjunct to the future development of Cape York. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a number of other minor recommendations I wish to make. Time does not allow me to deal with them in detail. The second involves the Royal Australian Navy. The Navy has to learn that it can no longer move in a gold plated environment. It is essential that we start looking at multiple use of commercial ships and commercial facilities. For example, I do not find it acceptable that we should only develop exclusively naval use wharves at Cairns. The Navy should be prepared to help the Cairns Harbour Board develop multiple use wharves so that there is a capacity for naval ships to be handled there. Similarly that might apply in Weipa. I am concerned about the development of the HMAS Cairns facility. It can only handle patrol boats at this stage and I do not think that is adequate. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a few little things that struck me. In the report there is reference to the breakdown of the air-conditioning in the communications system during a cyclone shutdown because of lack of access to the town water supply. To my mind that can be overcome simply by putting in a tank and a firefighting unit and recirculating the water from the tank. There are a number of things that can be done. </PARA>
<PARA>  In regard to Far North Queensland Rifles I wanted to make three recommendations in particular. I think that every recruit should complete a first aid certificate course, a course in basic motor mechanics, and a course in stationary engines, particularly outboard motors, and small boat operation and maintenance. Mr Getano Lui said to us that there is a real requirement to give something to those island communities, as there is to the Aboriginal communities. If we gave to every one of those soldiers training in those three areas, they would have something they could take back to their communities. It would not only enable them to enhance the community from which they come, but also they would then be better able to contribute as Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend the report and say to all honourable members that this is a part of Australia that needs to be assisted, and I hope that the Government will look at that special project of the Cooktown to Bamaga road. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Today I re-present the private mem- ber's Bill proposing amendments to the Disability Services Act that I laid before the Parliament at end of last year, but with an important addition. The amendments provide for the extension of the transition date of 1992 to 1995; an appeals procedure; security of contracts between the Government and service providers; and the tabling in Parliament of principles, objectives and guidelines for debate, amendment if necessary, and approval. We also suggest that two new service types be approved for funding under section 9 of the Act, that is, staff training services and vocational services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In the Bill tabled last year we had included attendant care services as an additional service type. I am very pleased to report that, as a result of continued pressure from the Opposition, the Government agreed to include attendant care services in the definition of `supported accommodation services' and has amended the Disability Services Act accordingly. In addition to these amendments, we propose that the service type `supported employment services' be amended to include specifically work crews, small businesses, enclaves, individual supported jobs and sheltered workshops. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) and his Department have made it clear outside the Parliament that all existing sheltered workshops, regardless of the excellence of their consumer outcomes, must re-profile if continuing Government funding is to be expected after 30 June 1992. The Government insists that people with disabilities must be integrated into the open workplace. This is regardless of whether they wish to, or indeed can, be placed in open employment and regardless of the fact that, in this Government-induced recession with unemployment rising weekly, they will almost certainly not be the first in line for the jobs which are available. If this Labor Government proceeds on this course to close sheltered workshops by next June, it will be denying many people with disabilities the right to work, the right to training, the right to gain living skills and the right to a choice, simply to satisfy its own socialist ideologies--and it will be sentencing them to an existence of boredom and frustration at home with the consequent stresses on their families and carers. </PARA>
<PARA>  Parents of disabled children are desperately worried about what will happen to their children after 30 June next year. They need the Minister to spell out clearly whether he intends to continue to fund sheltered workshops. Some have already been forced to close down because of lack of commitment and assistance from the Government, even though the Government has promised repeatedly that no service will be closed. One such sheltered workshop which is operated by the Nambucca and District Branch of the Challenge Foundation of New South Wales has just suspended its services because it is unable to meet its growing debts. Although the Department was closely involved in the establishment of these services, it has been reluctant to advise on restructuring, let alone give financial assistance. Although the branch had communicated its financial position and the possibility of its closure to the Department over a lengthy period, the Department not once offered any solution by way of approval of the service or its funding. It said it was not interested in a bail out. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is the position in which sheltered workshops around the country find themselves. The Government is cutting down on funding and backfilling, thus making workshops non-viable. In the case of Nambucca, the Department then had the gall to express concern about the impact of the suspension of operations on the clients and the apparent lack of opportunity for them to make decisions and choices in areas which affect their lives. There are many such sheltered workshops around Australia encountering the same treatment from this Government and the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Labor Government is just not giving people the choice. It is closing down sheltered workshops and depriving people with disabilities of the right to work, the right to training and the right to gain living skills. It has refined into an art form procrastination, changing the goalposts, reallocating officers within the Department so one cannot get the same person twice, and debilitating delays. We ask the Government yet again to extend the transition date to 1995 to give existing services more time to adapt to the requirements of the Disability Services Act and to include sheltered workshops as an approved service for funding under the Disability Services Act--and, of course, to lay the principles and guidelines before Parliament so that departmental interpretations and attitudes can be debated in this House. An appeals procedure is a means by which proper social justice can be delivered to those Australians with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, may I stress that any government--and the coalition promises to do so when it is in government--must listen to people with disabilities and their advocates and must listen particularly to the concerns of parents and to the voluntary and charitable organisations who provide the services. This is what proper social justice is all about. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.(Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --I am privileged to be able to continue my remarks in support of the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill, which was introduced into the House by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster). There are many important things that happen in this place, but I venture to suggest that this Bill is one of the most important to come before this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If successful, this Bill would prohibit the public funding of abortion except in cases where the procedure is to avert the death of the mother or where it was carried out inadvertently by a doctor in the course of another procedure.I pray that this Bill will be successful. If it is, the demand for abortion will decline--contrary to what the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) said in his contribution earlier in the debate. Clearly, since the main Medicare abortion item was included in 1974 there has been a substantial increase in abortion. For many women accessing a bulkbilling abortion clinic abortion is seen as a free service. In this sense it is a further symptom of the great Medicare lie which gives us all the wrong messages about the cost of health care in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since the beginning of 1975 there have been 750,000 Government-subsidised abortions at a cost of around $80m to the Australian taxpayer. I want to underline that figure. I am not talking about one or two or even a few; I am talking about 750,000 Government-subsidised abortions since the beginning of 1975. I believe that, if Medicare funding had not been available for this purpose, many of those 750,000 unborn children would be alive and well today. The cost of an abortion ranges from $215 to $500, with the Medicare rebate set at $120. I am prepared to concede that there is an argument that without Medicare funding the rich might still have access to abortion but the poor would be denied it--or, worse, would be forced to seek out backyard abortionists. This need not be the case. </PARA>
<PARA>  The ready availability of abortion actually promotes it.  If it is free, or seen to be free, people will want it. If it is an easy option, some people will take it. But there are better alternatives. I do not believe that it should be an option at all--except, of course, in those few exceptional circumstances that I mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill indirectly addresses the whole question of pregnancy termination. This issue is a fundamental question in any society. In many respects the attitude of society to abortion is an indication of the state of health of that society. I believe that in many ways our society is sick. There are many indicators that the assaults on traditional family values which are prevalent today will lead eventually to the destruction of our society, as has happened to other societies in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>  The prevalence of abortion, the ready acceptance of it as a convenient form of birth control, has enormous ethical implications, because it makes children, at some point of time, disposable. I think that is deplorable. I could never condone such an attitude towards the unborn child. It horrifies me to consider that Australia could have as many as 750,000 more young Australians alive today were it not for the termination of their lives so early. The potential of those children to Australia is lost. This is a time at which many economists suggest that we should be populating Australia more rapidly in order to partially address our economic malaise, to ensure future prosperity, and, in particular, to reverse the growing trend towards an ageing population. </PARA>
<PARA>   However, supporters of this Bill--and I would hope that there will be many on both sides of the House--are not primarily or predominantly concerned with economics. We would gladly support a move to reallocate every cent expended by the Government on abortion into programs which would address the real problems--programs which aim to educate couples on the prevention of unwanted pregnancies and programs which will fully support those women who find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy. Money spent in this way will be repaid many times to society by those whose lives are saved, who have a lifetime of productivity ahead of them. </PARA>
<PARA>  Abortion, ironically, is usually a man's solution. Women often have no choice. They are faced with the prospect of financial hardship. They have to contend with the serious psychological complications which result from the taking of an unborn baby's life. This is deplorable. But the important thing is that because of this Bill members of parliament have the opportunity to make a vital choice; we, as members in this place, can choose to be pro-life or pro-death. I choose to be pro-life. For many members this is not an easy choice. Many may not even wish to have to make that choice. But I am privileged indeed to plead for the lives of thousands of unborn Australians, and I urge all other members to support this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- The logic underlying the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill is fatally flawed; unfortunately, so is the logic of the previous speaker, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford). The logic underlying the Bill is based on at least three false premises which do not stand up under scrutiny. As a consequence, its real motives are extremely suspect. While I say that, I do not think that the motives of the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), who introduced the Bill, are suspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I rise today to put these points to rest. I do so as a woman who has never had, and could not contemplate having, an abortion. I do not speak as a man, which is the case with many who have spoken in the debate to date, or because my life has been nicely organised, arranged or compartmentalised, or has been devoid of the circumstances which require such a decision to be made one way or the other, but because I believe I am incapable of deliberately terminating a pregnancy. My conscience would not allow me to do so, nor would my conscience allow me to dictate to other women what they should or should not do in such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>  That statement itself highlights the dilemma which confronts women in their child-bearing years, irrespective of their nationality, their religion, their health, their income or their status in society. Every pregnancy makes demands upon a woman and her family. It makes demands upon her life and the life of her other children. It makes demands upon her husband or the father of her child. These demands cannot always be met. That is the simple truth. Unfortunately, this Bill ignores that truth and attempts to proscribe for a section of society an avenue of assistance which generally is accessed only as a last resort by people--women--who are desperate. </PARA>
<PARA>  If this Bill were to succeed in its passage through the Parliament, abortions would continue to occur in Australia; however, in many instances, they would occur in a completely different context than they do at present, and their consequences would be dire indeed for many women. Rather than reducing the trauma amongst women who resort to abortions--which I accept some people in the debate do wish to do--this Bill would increase the trauma manyfold. The Bill attempts to reduce the decision making framework within which women currently conduct their lives, and it implies that a woman's struggles with her conscience are not worthy of proper respect and consideration by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  The first incorrect premise on which the Bill is based is the assumption that the availability of public funding has changed the status of abortion and rendered it a common form of birth control. This assumption appears to stem from the mistaken belief that women who decide to abort a pregnancy do so without thought to the consequences, and without agonising over the decision both before and after the event. It neatly sidesteps the complex circumstances which can confront women and their families upon realisation of pregnancy, and it dismisses the soul-searching which inevitably precedes the decision to abort. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am certain that no woman in her right mind would elect to have an abortion as a normal means of contraception. Abortions usually occur when contraception has failed or was not available at the time of impregnation. Abortion also occurs when the circumstances in which a woman became pregnant alter radically--when she is not able to cope with her life in the context of a pregnancy, when her personal support system fragments, and/or when our society fails to support her. </PARA>
<PARA>  While I agree that abortions sometimes may be undertaken for the wrong reasons--that is, that better counselling support and assistance may reduce the number of abortions--I do not agree that individual women have not properly assessed their own positions and their own capacity to bear and raise a child in the circumstances they confront at the time of their decision to terminate a pregnancy. To say this is to trivialise the thinking processes of women. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second incorrect premise which underwrites this Bill is the belief that women who currently have abortions would carry their child to full term if public funding or assistance was not available. This assumption is dangerous in the extreme. It stems from a failure or an unwillingness to understand the desperation which frequently accompanies an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and it ignores the fact that women have been interrupting their pregnancies, with or without medical help or society's sanction, since time began. Rightly or wrongly, they will continue to do so with whatever means are available. Unfortunately, the circumstances in which abortions occur would be less controlled and less safe, and the trauma associated with an abortion would be more destructive to the individual concerned if this Bill were passed. Abortions may be less accessible as a consequence of this Bill, but they would take place nonetheless. </PARA>
<PARA>  This leads me to the third incorrect premise supporting the Bill - that all women will be equally affected by it. This is clearly not the case. This Bill would deny a whole group of the most powerless and resourceless women in society access to safe, affordable abortions when their circumstances demand it, or when they determine it to be necessary. Women who can afford a legal abortion without the assistance of public funding would avail themselves of that opportunity. Women who cannot afford a legal abortion would avail themselves of whatever opportunities existed. Backyard abortions would return to haunt Australia and the members of this House. Many women would die as a consequence of bad abortions and many more would be rendered sterile from ensuing infections. I for one am not prepared to have that situation on my conscience. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill also overlooks a basic fact in our nation's history. As can be seen from the historical database provided by the Irish Government on the occasion of Australia's bicentenary, many of the women and girls who were transported to this country from Ireland were the products of very poor families. The crime which frequently triggered their deportation was infanticide--that is, they were accused and convicted of murdering their babies at or after birth. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reasons for infanticide are many and varied. Thankfully, it is a crime that does not occur to any great extent in modern society today--Australian society, in particular. However, the fact remains that, in an era when abortion was illegal, unsafe and difficult to obtain, infanticide was one method by which desperate women could escape the continuing consequences of an unwanted pregnancy. Of course, it may not have always been the woman who actually committed the crime. Perhaps another member of the family was shamed or inconvenienced by her fecundity--a father, a brother, a sister, a mother, a lover, a husband--nevertheless, the woman bore the penalty. </PARA>
<PARA>  Undoubtedly, one of the most compelling reasons for infanticide was poverty. Without financial support or protection, a woman with a child could not survive, and that is still the case. What strikes me as particularly sad about the Bill before the House is that many of the people who condone it with the best of intentions also condemn the support mechanisms currently available to women who decide to carry their babies full term and raise them alone. </PARA>
<PARA>  If this Bill was passed and abortion funding was curtailed, how long would it be before those same people would be pressing for legislation to remove the supporting parent benefit for single women who had persisted with their pregnancy but maintained the right to keep their child? `Why should society continue to pay for these women to have their children out of wedlock and keep them?', these people would say. Why not deny them access to the supporting parent benefit? Why not, indeed? After all, there are plenty of childless couples around who would willingly adopt the child. </PARA>
<PARA>  Much has been said in the course of this debate about the trauma associated with undergoing an abortion. How much greater is the trauma occasioned by giving up a child who has been nurtured nine months in the mother's womb? Our society is just beginning to recognise the costs of maternal relinquishment at birth. It is also grappling with the morality and ethics of surrogacy. Surely we, as members of this Parliament, do not want to be accused of perpetuating those psychological and social costs and that indeterminate sense of loss. Surely we do not want to be seen to be removing one alternative to make another equally unsatisfactory one more attractive to the women confronting unwanted pregnancies. I urge all honourable members to oppose this Bill. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Abortion Funding Abolition Bill is just dressed-up discrimination against women, and it is a put down of women in society. I recall the words uttered during this debate by my colleague the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) just before he resumed his seat, when he decried the operation of this Bill because it would be a cost on taxpayers. Can anyone imagine this basically male society adopting that attitude? I ask the honourable member:  are not women taxpayers?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This Bill is simply a put down of females. I ask the people who brought this Bill forward to be honest, to go to the women in the community and say, `We don't believe you should control your bodies. We believe the state should control your bodies. This House should pass a Bill and it should put an overriding law above your personal requirements and your personal health'. This Bill is the greatest instrument of discrimination I have heard of in my parliamentary career. </PARA>
<PARA>  The abortion issue encourages and creates a great deal of public debate. This morning's Sydney Morning Herald carries the headline, `Churches urge MPs to support abortion bill'. What a false headline that is! At the bottom of the article, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>However, 24 women ministers of the Uniting Church have called on Upper House MPs to reject the bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Who wrote that headline? It should read, `Churches divided on the MPs Bill'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Who is in favour of the Bill? The article states that those in favour of it are the Anglican Archbishop, the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney and the Presbyterian Church. How many women are there at the top of those organisations? Is there any discrimination in those organisations? Does one find any women priests? Over the last few days, even the Presbyterian Church has begun to withdraw the right it had previously given to women to be appointed to top positions in the church. The whole campaign is a put down of women, and those who support it make no bones about it. The article states that the Anglican Archbishop said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not an issue of women's rights to control women's bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>He actually says it. We take away the right, but it is not an issue for women. They are to be subjugated in basically male societies, and they are to be told what they can do with their bodies. If that is the case, why does the honourable member not bring in a Bill to prevent men from having vasectomies? Why does he not take vasectomies off the Medicare list? The answer is that he wants to discriminate--that is the reason. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, churches, the Right to Life Organisation and others campaign actively in the community, and I defend their right to do so. I defend their right to campaign and importune members of parliament, to get out into the community and, if they wish, influence electoral results. But they cannot expect to extend their sectarian views, which are distinctly minority views, by having a majority of members of the Federal Parliament provide a dictatorial rule and statute on abortion that applies to the women of Australia. Let these organisations and people fight the issue out on a fair basis. Let them not come to this Parliament on an unfair basis and ask us to provide them with a dictatorial display of power. Indeed, it could be shown to be dictatorial, because the polls show that well in excess of 80 per cent of the people who participate in well-conducted surveys on abortion believe that it should be a matter for a woman and her doctor. How dare the people from those organisations ask us to take away that right from the women of Australia!</PARA>
<PARA>  The people who propose this Bill--the rabid supporters of the Right to Life Association and the intolerant church leaders--should understand that the more they protest, the stronger the cause for abortion will grow because their intolerance is well recognised by over 80 per cent of Australians. These people and organisations should consider carefully the steps they take if they want to further their cause. They should resile from the dictatorial attitude they are adopting on this issue. I oppose the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I oppose the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill. My views are clear: while ever abortions are performed by medical practitioners in this country, Medicare should continue to cover that procedure. This Bill attempts to have a harsher interpretation of abortion laws apply in the States of Australia. The people who present the Bill want to impose a harsher set of rules than those that are currently accepted in the States of Australia--and let us remember that this is a debate about State law. People should not try to have that debate by proxy, by discussing whether Medicare should cover a particular medical procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I might just enter briefly the debate about the question of abortion itself and its legality. The very trauma that a woman must go through when she seeks and has a abortion is for me sufficient grounds to call that abortion legal. A woman taking such an enormously difficult decision is surely demonstrating that she believes that her general well-being is at risk. We have no more hope of banning abortions than we have of banning sex itself. There will always be abortions. The only question is: who is the one who should decide its legality?</PARA>
<PARA>  The decision for a woman to have an abortion is very traumatic. Who are we to decide whether she, herself, is morally worthy to make that decision? The point is that if it is traumatic she alone makes the decision and she is the one who should make the decision. I think that the fact that she has made the decision brings weight to the argument that says the law should not interfere. Certainly this chamber, this legislature, should not seek to interfere at arm's length by cutting off the public funding of such procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>  It seems to me that the argument that a woman's anguish at the trauma of an abortion does not constitute sufficient grounds alone for a legal abortion requires that someone else make a moral judgment about that woman's moral worth or her ability to make a reasoned decision. I am not prepared to make a moral judgment on that other person and I understand that State laws, as they are presently interpreted in this country, also tend to say that we do not make a moral judgment about those women who seek abortions. They seek their own counsel--and, hopefully, those are friends. Having sought that counsel, they alone should be free to make the decision. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to briefly quote from an American judge, Blackmun J., who had to wrestle with these sorts of issues in the famous case of Roe v. Wade and the subsequent case of Webster:</PARA>
<PARA>  Today, Roe v. Wade and the fundamental constitutional right of women to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy survive but are not secure. . . . Although today, no less than yesterday, the Constitution and the decisions of this Court--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Supreme Court of the USA--</PARA>
<PARA>prohibit a State from enacting laws that inhibit women from the meaningful exercise of that right, a plurality of this Court implicitly invites every state legislature to enact more and more restrictive abortion regulations in order to provoke more and more test cases, in the hope that sometime down the line the Court will return the law of procreative freedom to the severe limitations that generally prevailed in this country before [Roe v. Wade]. </PARA>
<PARA>  I fear for the future. I fear for the liberty and equality of the millions of women who have lived and come of age in the 16 years since Roe was decided. I fear for the integrity of, and the public esteem of this Court. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is also trying to close off an option for women to make their own decisions. It is not a sensible Bill. It is not a healthy debate. I say to those honourable members who support this Bill: hands off; leave well enough alone; leave those decisions to the States and to the broader community. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This is an extremely complex and difficult issue. Like my colleague the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), I have no doubt in my mind that abortion is wrong--that it constitutes the destruction of innocents. But, as put by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), who has just spoken, it is a fact that like stealing, being consumed with envy or committing adultery, people do it. The issue before us is: what is the correct line for public policy in these circumstances? We have to consider this in a context where, increasingly, abortion is being used as a means of birth control. In my view, it is a dangerous, expensive, often traumatic--no-one doubts that--experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The evidence shows the extent of abortion in Australia. It is a fact that the number of abortions is touching the appalling figure of 70,000 to 80,000 a year. As my colleague the honourable member for McPherson pointed out earlier, the cumulative total since the introduction of the Medicare support is of the order of 750,000. I would suggest that that is so vastly in excess of anything that would come anywhere near the criteria for legality under State law, reasonably interpreted, or anywhere near the number of abortions that would be sought in the circumstances set out by the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen), that abortion is, in fact, being utilised as birth control. I would contend, therefore, that there is a strong case for the purpose of the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill now before us, which is that the Medicare funding of abortion be abolished.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On behalf of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That this House:</PARA>
<PARA>(1)  deplores the violence, loss of life and destruction of property that has taken place in Slovenia and Croatia, where more than 30 civilians are reported to have been killed, largely as a result of the attacks of terrorists supplied by the communist-led federal army and attacks by the army itself;</PARA>
<PARA>(2)  notes the potential for further conflict if aspirations for self-determination expressed through democratic plebiscites in the Yugoslav republics are confronted by military force;</PARA>
<PARA>(3)  welcomes the efforts of the European Community to act as a mediator to prevent further conflict;</PARA>
<PARA>(4)  calls on the Australian Government to support international efforts for a negotiated settlement between the Yugoslav republics which will avoid conflict, achieve the independence which the people of Croatia and Slovenia demand and protect the interests of ethnic and religious minorities; and</PARA>
<PARA>(5)  further calls upon the Australian Government to recall its Ambassador to Yugoslavia for consultations on how Australia might, consistent with a desire to preserve peace, support the newly evolving, independent states, including the most appropriate time to give diplomatic recognition. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like at the outset to make an important point. The motion is not making a judgment as to the long held differences between the various groups that have until recently made up the federation of Yugoslavia. There is no intention or desire on the part of those supporting this motion to say that one national group is better or worse than any of the others. Behind this motion is the inherent support that Australians traditionally give to the encouragement of freedom, democracy, self-determination and, most importantly, the right to be able to live in peace throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  These are principles to which Australians have willingly devoted their support not only in word but also in deed in the past. This motion reflects those principles by applying them to the most unfortunate situation that prevails in the republics which until recently used to form part of Yugoslavia, Croatia and Slovenia. I have deliberately used the past tense because there is little doubt that the former Yugoslav Federation has broken up and will never return to its former political and geographical status. That its time has come and gone is no longer a matter for serious debate. However, what is deplorable is the attempt in the first instance to hold the republics together at the point of a gun and then to use the enormous armed resources of the former Federal Government to attack Slovenia and Croatia and to support irregular terrorist attacks on the town and citizens in the latter republic. </PARA>
<PARA>  These are dangerous times. This is the first outbreak of serious armed conflict in Europe since the Second World War. The Balkans have played an enormously influential role in the continent in modern history. One only has to look to the events that occurred at Sarajevo in 1914, an event which triggered the first great war, a war that resulted in terrible destruction and the loss of the flower of Europe's younger generation. </PARA>
<PARA>  What are the issues at stake in the conflict in the Balkans? The principle of self-determination is foremost in our minds when considering the desire for Croatia, Slovenia and, more recently, Macedonia, to live in their own free nations rather than participate further in the artificial federation that for so many years of post-war history was held together by the iron-fisted rule of President Tito. </PARA>
<PARA>  Why should Australia take a leading role and commence the process of recognising the independence of Croatia and Slovenia after finally acknowledging that the process is inevitable? And what are the criteria for recognition of independence that are making Australia's movement towards recognition so painfully slow? The principles for recognition of independence revolve around full control of the territory by the government, support of the majority of the population, and clear signs that the new state has reasonable prospects of permanence. If we were to apply even the most conservative application of these principles to Slovenia, there is no doubt at all that the republic meets those standards and should be recognised immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>  The case for Croatia under these criteria is as strong in that its lack of control of part of its own territory is being perpetuated by the combination of the Federal Yugoslav army, which is operating illegally, and forces which have invaded and occupied large sections of eastern Croatia. Thus Croatia's ability to control its own territory will not happen until there is a stable peace and those forces are withdrawn. Cease-fire after negotiated cease-fire has been flagrantly violated by the Yugoslav army and those forces that are occupying Croatia and has effectively prevented the peaceful resolution of the crisis and delayed the recognition of the independence of Croatia and Slovenia. </PARA>
<PARA>  In both cases, their declarations of independence have followed plebiscites which have overwhelmingly supported self-determination and independence. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his statement on 23 August said:</PARA>
<PARA>  The peoples of Croatia and Slovenia have freely and democratically expressed their desire for independence. Their aspirations must be satisfied in a just, peaceful and democratic manner. For our part, Australia will be among the first countries to recognise Croatia and Slovenia when they satisfy the attributes of statehood. </PARA>
<PARA>This is just not good enough. What is Australia really waiting for? Is it a desire to be in good company or does our reticence reflect an intent to let the decision be made for us by other nations? Australia has, in reality, all but acknowledged that the basic criteria to be satisfied for recognition of independence are only awaiting the outbreak of peace in Croatia. In that case, Australia can make a valuable contribution to promote an early peace by commencing the recognition process now, hence the need for the Government to recall our Ambassador to Yugoslavia for consultations as to the most appropriate time for recognition. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister, in his statement of 23 August, acknowledged that the dramatic collapse of the coup d'etat in the Soviet Union has brought the tragic situation in Yugoslavia into sharp focus. Despite his self- promotion as being some kind of diplomatic hero, the Prime Minister has in reality allowed our foreign policy to lag behind rather than ahead of events. The Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are now enjoying the benefit of Australia's and the rest of the world's recognition of their independence. However, it was not that long ago when the Government of former Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam recognised their incorporation into the Soviet Union--a disgraceful act that will undoubtedly long rankle in the minds of the Baltic communities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I said at the beginning of my speech that this is not a case of taking sides in the historical feud between the nationalities in the Balkan region--this is a matter of supporting the desire for people who have so chosen to live in a free and democratic society in their own nation. As Des Moore commented in his article in the IPA Review on 22 July:</PARA>
<PARA>  The 1974 constitution of Yugoslavia provides specifically for the rights of republics to withdraw from the federation, and overwhelming majorities in Croatia and Slovenia have recently voted in referendums for independence. Both republics have governments elected in free and democratic elections. The republics have their own administrative structures, public services, armed forces and police. </PARA>
<PARA>  . . . at this point in world history, continued dominance of the democracies in Slovenia and Croatia by a hardline Communist establishment in Serbia would clearly be an anachronism. </PARA>
<PARA>In this motion we recognise the efforts of the European Community to bring peace to the region and fervently hope that, despite its lack of success in recent weeks to have a secure cease-fire, peace will come quickly and further losses of life and destruction of property will be prevented. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, I draw the attention of the House to the formation of the friendship group, Parliamentarians for Croatia and Slovenia, which was formed on 22 August. This group now has 34 members and senators and is chaired by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). It has indicated its support for the recognition of the independence of the two republics by way of a communique to the parliaments in Zagreb and Ljubjana--the two capitals. </PARA>
<PARA>  The parliamentary friendship group is a multipartisan group which seeks to achieve recognition of independence, that ultimate goal. I thank those honourable members who have shown their support for the group by joining and participating. As secretary of the Parliamentarians for Croatia and Slovenia, I received a letter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Croatia, Dr Separovic, who said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is a great pleasure to be able to speak to this motion. I am happy to be associated with the formation of the group, Parliamentarians for Croatia and Slovenia. I have the honour of being elected chairman of that group. It is clear that the situation in Yugoslavia has become one where we have a disintegrating state. There is no doubt that the former state of Yugoslavia has fallen apart very dramatically. Anyone who does not accept or recognise that just does not understand international realities. Indeed, it is clear that what is happening there is an attempt, especially by the Serbian Prime Minister, Mr Milosevic, to create the fiction that a federated Yugoslavia still exists and to try to force the various republics into the one structure, which is what he wishes to impose. That is quite wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The international community has condemned that move. In particular, the international community, especially the European Community and Australia, has condemned the outrageous use of the Yugoslav armed forces contrary to the determinations of the Federal presidency and contrary to the determinations of the Constitution. We can imagine what is happening there. There is an Army controlled by a group of generals that is disobeying the official constitutional orders of the Federal presidency. What is it doing? It is trying to make this into an issue between the Serbian people and the Croatian people. For what end? It is trying to keep in power certain dictators--that is what they must be called--such as Mr Milosevic, who, obviously recognising that the Serbian people are about to rebel and throw him out of power, decided that he would try to make this issue one of ethnic conflict and bring back rivalries that existed 50 years ago. We even hear stories about the Second World War era, as if that has something to do with the real issues in question in this particular period of history. </PARA>
<PARA>  This misuse of the Yugoslav Army ought to be condemned by the international community. If we had a proper set of principles and powers in the international order, we should have been able to enforce a cease-fire. Instead, the President of Croatia has, on at least five occasions that I have counted, accepted the European Community's declaration of a cease-fire. President Tudjman has accepted the cease-fire agreements. On every occasion the Yugoslav armed forces, without the authority of the national presidency, have broken those agreements. </PARA>
<PARA>  How long can this situation continue? It was only because of the threat that was made by a number of countries that they would immediately recognise Slovenia and Croatia that Mr Milosevic agreed to the latest European initiative to try to negotiate a solution. Honourable members might remember that prior to that time he had either been rejecting such approaches or had accepted various formulas and immediately proceeded to break them. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has to be some sense of honour and morality in international affairs. If we make agreements, as were made earlier, and break them and continue to break them, something has to be done. Since the last European initiative there have been more than 100 breaches of the cease-fire. That is the situation we are facing. One has to ask: how long can the people of Croatia and the people of Slovenia be expected to wait for the international community in the light of what is going on?</PARA>
<PARA>  While the Yugoslav armed forces are penetrating further and further into Croatia, taking towns and killing people indiscriminately, they are also supposed to be at a negotiating table under supposedly cease-fire terms. What will happen at these negotiations? We welcome these negotiations. Is Mr Milosevic serious? Does he really want to negotiate over the serious issue, which is that 95 per cent of the people of Croatia and, indeed, of Slovenia have voted for independence--something which was provided for within the Yugoslav Constitution itself, namely, that each republic can vote for independence if it so wishes? Once the vote was taken it was felt by certain Yugoslav Army leaders that this was not good enough and instead they would march in and try to enforce their will over the people of Croatia and Slovenia. </PARA>
<PARA>  A lot of people, when looking at this debate, try to represent it as an argument between ethnic groups. They say, `There are the Serbians and there are the Croatians, and who's to know who is right and who is wrong? After all, if you go back into history' --and all of that stuff. This is not what the issue is about at all. Fundamentally, the question relates to the attempt to impose and to keep in power a particular regime and therefore refuse to acknowledge the expressions of the will of the Croatian and Slovenian people. One cannot be forced into a brotherhood. One cannot be forced into a marriage. If the people of Croatia and Slovenia wish to depart from the Federation, that is their right. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have heard smear campaigns against the people of Croatia, in particular. I remind honourable members that the Government that was elected under President Tudjman is a democratic government across political parties. A number of different political parties were elected to the Parliament, including a number of Serbian representatives. Furthermore, the new Constitution of Croatia guarantees the rights of all minorities in the Constitution, including the right to maintain their culture, and actually specifies the Serbian people as having a specific right to maintain their culture within Croatia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes. The honourable member talks about comparing that to Kosovo. The Yugoslav Armed Forces marched into Kosovo and annexed Kosovo, contrary to the understandings and prescriptions of the Constitution of Yugoslavia, and tried to incorporate the Albanian people of Kosovo into this concept--whatever concept these people have of domination, whether it is greater Serbia or domination by a dictatorship. That is what they have been trying to do in Kosovo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The situation is quite clear. The Government of Croatia has proceeded on a democratic and fair basis. I point out to honourable members that at the first public rally in relation to this matter I said that President Tudjman had offered a confederation of the various States of Yugoslavia. But I said that, if the bloodshed continues and if the Yugoslav Army continues to behave in the way that it has, that confederation may break down. The real possibility of a confederation has probably broken down as a result of the continuous killings and misbehaviour of the Yugoslav Army. We will continue the work of this group until we achieve the just goal of recognition for the people of Croatia. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have regard for the seriousness of this motion concerning Yugoslavia and I accept it as moved by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). I support him when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the inherent support that Australians traditionally give to the encouragement of freedom, democracy, self-determination and, most importantly, the right to be able to live in peace throughout the world. These are principles to which Australians have willingly devoted their support, not only in word but also in deed. </PARA>
<PARA>I support that statement by the honourable member for Moore, but I know that when I go back to my office in a few minutes a fax will come through criticising part of the honourable member for Moore's comments. There will be a fax making me aware of what has been said by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). On this issue there are as many views as there are on any issue that has faced this House. </PARA>
<PARA>  I stress the importance of this because it involves thousands upon thousands of households right across Australia. They may be people who have come to this nation after the war. Perhaps, like me, they are friends of Yugoslavian families and the issue has entered into conversation. In my case this has happened between my wife and me because we have friends who are Serbian. It may happen through Maria who is in here today. She came to hear the debate in the House on the matter. She is Croatian, she works in the House and she actually spends time in my office. We discuss the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  I plead with the House that it is time to take a step back, because the demand for peace is crucial. We are asking that there be peace in that nation. The terror that is experienced by people in Yugoslavia filters through to many households, and is it for any of us to stand and make decisions, or even proffer judgment, or even take a side? I put it to this House: no, it is not. It is 12,000 miles away, and the conflict is a thousand years old. How are we to be sure that whatever information comes to honourable members in this House is correct? We need peace and democracy to prevail. It is our plea that this happen in the area of Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA>  From all sides of the argument, no matter who supplies the information, we feel for those people. I have heard in the voices of people on the phone this week and I have seen in the eyes of people the concern that they have for their relatives in that country. Who is a terrorist, if we should ever use that word--and I say we should not: the man defending his home or the man aggressively attacking another person? Who you call a terrorist depends on which side of the fence you are standing. Let us not enter into their situation, but rather call on the peoples who live here to reach resolutions amongst themselves that would support a return to peace in that nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  We should recognise, as the national government is doing today in support of its Prime Minister, that the Government is saying there should be absolutely no distinction between Serbs and Croatians--it recognises no distinction. In fact it has encouraged people to apply for visitors visas, and in that process it says there is absolutely no distinction between any persons, be they Serbian or Croatian, applying for those visas. </PARA>
<PARA>  We must do everything we can in this House to make sure we never import division into this great country. These people, who have the same ethnic background and who come from the same part of Europe, have the same flesh and blood. The principle challenge now is to ensure that the future of Yugosla- via's constituent republics can evolve peacefully and with proper acknowledgment of the rights and the interests of minorities in those areas. Against this background, I strongly condemn the use of force between Serbians and Croatians in Croatia, in particular the unwarranted actions of the Yugoslav Army against Croatia.(Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I cannot help but agree with comments that suggest that we ought not take sides in our domestic community, but that does surely not mean that we suspend all judgment. I support this motion without reservation, and I do so without any hesitation about having to draw some conclusions from the events that are occurring in Europe at the present time. It is clear, as the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) said, that we are seeing the disintegration of the former state of Yugoslavia. What emerges from that disintegration is less certain. It may be a series of independent nations, it may be still a confederation or a group of states linked by some form of economic union, or it may be one or two independent states and a rump that is formed from other elements which do stay together. But whatever happens, there is no doubt that Yugoslavia will not be put together in the form it was before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There is also no doubt about where appropriately to lay the blame for the most recent violence and tragedies that have occurred. Essentially, as was said today by the collective presidency, an armed coup has occurred in Yugoslavia. The federal Army is no longer the federal Army; it is operating beyond the control of the federal presidency and against its direct orders. The federal presidency is still trying to sustain some collective form of government. That aspiration is being thwarted by the actions of armed forces beyond its control. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is also no doubt, if one looks at the circumstances in Croatia, that many of the incidents that have occurred have occurred essentially as a result of partisans supported by the Yugoslav Army under Serbian control. That is a tragedy, because in recent times the Serbian minorities in Yugoslavia have not been discriminated against and have been able to participate in all free elections. They are represented in the Croatian legislature in a democratically elected parliament. That is not the case, tragically, for Kosovo, for example, which as the honourable member for Calwell indicated is having its cultural traditions, its language and its separate educational facilities all stamped out by Serbia, following essentially its integration into that State. </PARA>
<PARA>  So although I agree that it is a thousand miles away and we should not in this country import those tensions, it is impossible to see what is happening without drawing some judgments about those events, and those judgments go to support this motion which calls on the Australian Government to support international efforts for a negotiated settlement between the republics. Increasingly it is obvious that those representations also have to involve direct contact with the Yugoslav Army. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- On behalf of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That this House:</PARA>
<PARA>(1)  calls upon the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) of Burma to cede legal authority to a civilian government as mandated by the Burmese people in the elections of May 1990;</PARA>
<PARA>(2)  condemns the arrest and detention of Burmese citizens for the peaceful expression of their political views;</PARA>
<PARA>(3)  condemns the SLORC's disregard of human rights and fundamental freedoms; and</PARA>
<PARA>(4)  urges the Australian Government to:</PARA>
<PARA>  (a)  call upon the UN Human Rights Commission to continue and expand its scrutiny and action over the human rights situation in Burma;</PARA>
<PARA>  (b)  affirm its support for the resettlement of genuine Burmese asylum seekers who are without other safe and reasonable alternatives; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (c)  call upon the Government of Thailand to accord Burmese refugees temporary safe haven and access to procedures for third country resettlement. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a very significant and important motion. It seeks not only to increase public awareness about but also to record Australia's condemnation of the current appalling and intolerable situation in Burma--a situation that can be quite legitimately, albeit somewhat inadequately, described as a real life horror story. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is a terrible and tragic story of a once proud and prosperous nation--one of the most productive in South East Asia--which in just 30 years has been brought to its knees by a tyrannical and totalitarian military regime, and now ranks behind Bangladesh as the fourth poorest country in the world. It is a nation which has been totally devastated--politically, economically and socially; where human rights violations of the most ghastly order are a daily occurrence; where so many atrocities have been perpetrated against the people over recent years that it is impossible even to start to adequately catalogue them in the very limited time available to me today. </PARA>
<PARA>  To fully understand the existing situation in Burma, it is necessary briefly to delve back into recent history. In 1962, 15 years after Burma had gained its independence from Britain, the democratically elected Burmese Prime Minister, U Nu, was overthrown in an army coup d'etat executed by General Ne Win. Ne Win suspended the constitution and instituted authoritarian military rule. During the 26 years the country was under his direct control, he subjected the Burmese people to a reign of torment and terror. In July 1988 he resigned in theory, but in practice he maintained his influence and continued to direct and manipulate the government from behind the scenes. </PARA>
<PARA>  By August 1988, the Burmese people had taken more than they could bear. Hundreds of thousands of Burmese citizens participated in peaceful street demonstrations to show their support for the pro-democracy cause and the restoration of human rights. The reaction of the military regime was swift and lethal. Thousands of unarmed protesters and innocent bystanders--including children--were killed or injured. Thousands more were arrested, assaulted, detained without trial and tortured. Many simply disappeared without trace. </PARA>
<PARA>  Despite the extent and brutality of the massacre, which began on 8 August and continued for several days, this ghastly incident was largely ignored by the rest of the world. In September of the same year, following a coup stage-managed by the Army, the State Law and Order Restoration Council was established. SLORC was headed by General Saw Maung and Secretary General Khin Nyunt. Martial law was reintroduced and civil courts were replaced by military tribunals. People were forbidden to demonstrate or gather together in groups of more than five; curfews were imposed; all forms of media and communication were taken over by the state; and it was forbidden to criticise publicly or privately the Government or the military. Those who did risked severe penalties, including death or detention, interrogation and torture. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is conservatively estimated that more than 10,000 Burmese citizens were slaughtered or subjected to the most dreadful atrocities as a result of the events leading to the August massacre and during its terrible aftermath. Another 10,000 students and members of the Burmese intelligentsia fled to malaria-ridden jungle camps along the Thai border. Countless numbers of civilians were abducted and placed in forced labour camps. In a country with a predominantly Buddhist tradition going back more than 2000 years, not even the most revered and respected section of the community--the Buddhist monks--were safe from the desperate and despicable activities of the Saw Maung regime. </PARA>
<PARA>  In accordance with their beliefs and teachings, the monks had adopted a non-violent, but nonetheless effective, role in their country's struggle for freedom. As part of SLORC's policy of retaliation and persecution, hundreds of monasteries were raided. More than 600 monks were killed and hundreds more--including five of the country's 10 highest ranking monks--were arrested and imprisoned. Almost one million citizens were forced to relocate into so-called `satellite villages', which are little better than concentration camps. </PARA>
<PARA>  Shortly after the coup in September 1988 and against the terrible background of unrestrained violence and brutality, SLORC announced that `free and fair' general elections would be held in May 1990--the first since the military took power in 1962. Any briefly held hopes that this would be a legitimate exercise in democracy were soon dashed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Throughout 1989, members of any political parties opposed to the existing regime were subjected to a constant barrage of harassment which continued unabated until the day of the election. Government edicts were issued which effectively limited any campaigning activities. Opposition party leaders and supporters were arrested and party premises were regularly raided by the military. Despite the attempts of the Government to restrict organised opposition activity, the National League for Democracy soon emerged as a strong political force with wide popular support throughout the country. It was led by chairman U Tin Oo and General Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of Burmese national hero Aung San. On 20 July 1989, both NLD leaders were placed under house arrest. Recent events suggest that Aung San Suu Kyi is unlikely to ever be released. </PARA>
<PARA>  Following the arrest and detention of the two party leaders, the SLORC regime attempted to wipe out completely the NLD campaign organisation by ordering troops to round up and arrest other known party leaders and thousands of party activists and supporters. Several thousand common criminals were released from gaol to make room for the new political prisoners. </PARA>
<PARA>  On election day, 27 May 1990, 70 per cent of eligible Burmese citizens turned out to cast their votes. Despite SLORC's determined and intensive efforts to undermine the opposition campaign and negatively influence the outcome of the elections, the NLD won more than 80 per cent of the vote and 396 of the 492 National Assembly seats. Only 10 seats were won by military candidates. Stunned by the resounding and conclusive NLD victory, SLORC reacted by refusing to hand over power to the new National Assembly and its democratically-elected civilian members. Instead, the leaders of the military regime proclaimed the result invalid, gaoled the acting leader of the NLD for seven years and declared the party unfit to govern--a position it has continued to maintain. </PARA>
<PARA>  In April this year an official SLORC spokesman stated publicly that there is no prospect of a civilian government taking over in Burma in the foreseeable future because no political party was capable of administering the country in a peaceful and stable manner. All but a few of the NLD representatives elected some 16 months ago have now gone into hiding or been killed, arrested, tortured or imprisoned by SLORC. The so-called free and fair elections are now recognised as a fraud, an attempt to defuse the mounting crisis at the time of the nationwide pro-democracy demonstrations and to help the military identify the leaders of the increasing opposition to the Saw Maung regime. </PARA>
<PARA>  In December 1990, the remaining NLD members, together with representatives of the Democratic Alliance of Burma, met at one of the jungle camps in Manerplaw and announced that an interim parallel government--to be known as the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma--had been formed. Dr Sein Win was elected as leader and Prime Minister of the new provisional government. The NCG has, for the first time, unified all parties--including the 21 ethnic minorities, students and expatriate organisations--which have been resisting the Burmese military regime for so many years. The interim government is committed to the introduction of democracy and the restoration of human rights in Burma and intends to govern only until new elections can be conducted. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 26 February 1991, the United Nations Human Rights Commission voted unanimously to condemn the military government of Burma for human rights violations. This decision was based on information contained in a report prepared by a United Nations inspector, Professor Sadako Ogata of Japan, who visited Burma in November 1990. Among other things, Mrs Ogata found that the Burmese military authorities continued to detain political opponents, had failed to answer serious and persistent allegations of torture and mistreatment of these prisoners, and had made no preparations for carrying out their promise to return the country to democratic civilian rule. </PARA>
<PARA>  Amnesty International has declared Burma to be one of the world's worst violators of human rights and is currently conducting a campaign to draw greater international attention to the plight of the Burmese people. However, this is not an easy task. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since 1966, when Ne Win expelled all foreign journalists from Burma, there has been almost no press coverage of the political and human rights abuses that have occurred and continue to occur. No doubt this is regarded as a very satisfactory situation by the reactionary and repressive Burmese regime, but it does little to advance the cause of freedom and justice for the Burmese people. The problem of nobody seeming to know very much and nobody seeming to care very much about the tragic and deteriorating Burmese situation has been further exacerbated by the country's lack of strategic or economic importance. For reasons which escape me, political issues and human rights abuses in Burma do not seem to be particularly newsworthy and receive little, if any, attention from the media. </PARA>
<PARA>  For 30 years the Burmese people have been denied the rights and freedom which we in Australia take for granted. They have been subjected to the most dreadful atrocities as a succession of despised, unwanted and tyrannical regimes have waged an ongoing war against their own defenceless citizens. Given a chance, Burma could still emerge successfully from the years of isolation, deprivation and ruin and once again take its place in the international community and play a constructive role in regional affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia has a vested interest in Burma's future because any increase in its security and stability will automatically increase security and stability in our region as a whole. But time is running out and we must act now. On behalf of the men, women, monks, students and children who have been beaten, tortured, imprisoned and executed in their valiant quest for freedom, I urge all honourable members to support this motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-At the outset, I commend the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) for putting this matter on the Notice Paper and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) for introducing this motion to the House today. I indicate my total support for the comments he has made. In the hothouse atmosphere of this place, where we all have political and philosophical differences which we pursue vigorously, on the question of human rights there is great unanimity amongst all members of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As the honourable member for Casey said, when one starts to delve into the abuse of human rights in Burma one is almost overwhelmed. What has happened there over many years is almost beyond belief. An Amnesty International report which was issued in November 1990 said that the Burmese military junta has turned the country into a secret state of terror where arrests and torture are commonplace. </PARA>
<PARA>  Burma is a country of some 50 million people who have been the victims of mass atrocities by the military dictator, Ne Win, and his successor. In 1988, the military's imprisonment, torture and execution of men, women, students, monks and children began to escalate and continues to do so today. Cartloads of terrified children have been seen taken away; people are dragged from their beds at night to serve as severely mistreated Army porters; and anyone even suspected of being critical of the regime is at risk of torture. </PARA>
<PARA>  Tens of thousands of people have been killed since the Army's massacre of unarmed demonstrators began to escalate in 1988. As late as yesterday in the Canberra Times there is a report detailing the fresh accounts of continuing Burmese military atrocities. As has been said, Amnesty International has declared Burma to be one of the world's worst violators of human rights. The Burmese regime has managed to keep the country in a remarkably high degree of isolation from the rest of the world. Since the expulsion of all foreign journalists in 1966 there have been no journalists there, and foreigners who visit Burma can stay for no longer than one week. I must admit that the press coverage of events in Burma has been next to nothing. Even though Burma is being terrorised by an unwanted dictator, its lack of strategic or economic importance to the rest of the world has allowed these abuses to go virtually unnoticed. </PARA>
<PARA>  During years of repressive rule, what was once one of the most productive and richest nations in South East Asia has been so impoverished that it has become the fourth poorest nation in the world. By 1987 a bankrupt Burma was the recipient of least developed nation status from the United Nations. The average income today is only $US180 per year. Burma's abundant natural resources, of which it has many such as oil, gas, gems, minerals, teak and fish, have been exploited solely for the benefit of the regime, with profits used to purchase military hardware. Press reports indicate that the country's teak forests may become virtually extinct within five years. </PARA>
<PARA>  Beginning on 8 August 1988 a massacre occurred which was dramatically more brutal, and killed greater numbers of innocent people, than that in Tiananmen Square one year later. Millions of citizens in 40 places throughout the country gathered in the streets. As students literally knelt down before armed military and pleaded for peace and freedom, thousands of men, women and children were shot. Eye witnesses report the bayoneting of children and the shooting of uniformed Red Cross workers attempting to aid victims of the shooting. Demonstrations carried on for days, with no let-up in the violence perpetrated against the protesters. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the general election in May 1990, despite the military government's unrelenting efforts to undermine the pre-election process, the National League for Democracy won more than 80 per cent of the vote. But the military stepped in and the National League for Democracy was not allowed to claim the victory of its election success. The leader was put in gaol, and most likely will never be released from gaol. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some people ask in this place why we members of the Australian Parliament raise these questions about the abuse of human rights in other parts of the world. Human rights are of concern to all and those who are persecuted need people to speak out for them. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- Australia has an interest in the affairs of Burma. Historically, Australians have fought in that region. They have come to know the Burmese people. Burma is also in our sphere of political and economic influence. Currently in Burma there is a dreadful regime which is wreaking ruin across the land and denying human rights to its citizens. Previous speakers have mentioned the fact that the national election of 27 May 1990 has been completely ignored. At that election 80 per cent of the seats were won by the National League for Democracy, which offered a new opportunity for the people of Burma. But the military regime has chosen to ignore the results of that election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Burma is on the edge of ASEAN and is of great interest to the ASEAN nations, in particular to Thailand. It is interesting to read some of the accounts of the conference on security and cooperation in South East Asia and the Pacific and to see the attention that member nations gave to the problems of the denial of human rights and the gross behaviour of the Government of Burma. </PARA>
<PARA>  Further, on 21 September last year, 18 countries took part in a demarche which raised three points in regard to Burma. The first was the expression of hope for the restoration of democracy in Burma. The second expressed the concern of the countries involved over the recent arrests of prominent members of the National League for Democracy. The third expressed concern at the recent detention and questioning of local employees of some embassies. Amongst those employees were staff of the Australian Embassy. It is deplorable that people working for the Australian Government have been treated in that way and have been detained and questioned. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Parliament today is debating a motion which broadly condemns the State Law and Order Restoration Council, the so-called SLORC, the current Government in Burma, and demands that it cede legal authority to the civilian government which was mandated by the Burmese people in the election of May 1990. The motion condemns the arrest, imprisonment and detention of Burmese citizens. It condemns SLORC's disregard of human rights and fundamental freedoms and urges a number of measures on the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased to see the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) in the chamber because he has had a continuing interest in this matter and has asked questions about Burma in this chamber. Also, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in the Senate has strongly condemned the regime in Burma. He has drawn attention in particular to the imprisonment of the former leader of the NLD, Aung San Suu Kyi and the fact that she has now entered her third year of imprisonment. About 60 members of the NLD are currently in prison and at least three of them have recently had their prison sentences, which were originally seven to 10 years, extended for another 10 years. That is the level of human rights, freedom and democracy in Burma. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is the role of the Australian Government? Firstly, it has been interesting that recently the United Nations Human Rights Commission conducted an inquiry but has been denied the opportunity of entering Burma for a second inquiry. I believe we as a Parliament should call on the United Nations and the nations of the United Nations to exert absolute influence and demand the re-entry into Burma of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the Australian Government is giving aid to Burma, I believe it should cease immediately. If the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation is continuing its work there, that should also stop. The current regime is capitalising on the Golden Triangle relationships in the production of opium and using that as a way of trading and raising funds. The Australian Government needs to be firm. There is no need to negotiate, to deal with or to give concessions to a regime such as this in any way whatsoever. It is only by strong talk and strong action by interested nations in our region that we will gain results. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In this grievance debate today it is my purpose to point out the alarming degree to which the Government is cloaking its so-called better cities program in secrecy. I find this to be absolutely reprehensible, and I am deeply concerned that this Government's undemocratic, behind closed doors, smoke-filled room approach will directly harm the residents of my electorate, the electorate of Lowe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In the first place we hear a great many rumours from the Government, and especially from the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), about multimillion dollar schemes that are allegedly meant to better our cities. There is also talk that one of the places that such a so-called better city is to be plonked down is within Lowe, at Homebush Bay. It is absolutely abhorrent for the Government to plant an artificial metropolis within our healthy, existing community without any say from its residents. </PARA>
<PARA>  In canvassing the Deputy Prime Minister's `mystery mad city' proposal, I find that none of the interested parties I shall list has been given any information whatsoever as to what plans the Government actually has for Homebush Bay. The residents of the electorate have certainly not been consulted. They are the ones who will be exposed to the noise, the air pollution, and the threats to safety and quality of life posed by such a huge development program. The local municipalities have not been consulted. They are the organisations that will literally have to pick up the pieces as a massive development program progressively crushes their old roads and undermines their services and utilities. The administrations of several hospitals which neighbour Homebush Bay and nearby feel great concern about the development's negative impact on their patients. They have not been consulted. The management of Bicentennial Park, one of the great developments over the last few years in this area--a wonderful project which made parkland out of wasteland--may now see all those gains potentially reversed by such a development. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is equally disturbing is that there is some evidence that the Federal Government has not even informed the New South Wales Government. The New South Wales Government may well itself have some separate plans in regard to Homebush Bay and Sydney's Olympic bid for the year 2000, which I understand is very likely to be successful-- and deservedly so, I might say. It seems to be a case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing and of the community itself not being allowed to know anything at all. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is more than just a question of democracy and how forthcoming the Government is in informing those who will be the most affected by its schemes. It is also a matter of practicality and, indeed, what constitutes a wise and well-considered policy. For example, within Lowe there are five municipalities either wholly or partially inside the electorate and all have once again experienced cuts to their Federal funding in this fiscal year. This is despite the fact that, on average, Federal funding has risen both nationally and in New South Wales. The municipalities concerned--Ashfield, Burwood, Concord, Drum- moyne and Strathfield--as opposed to many other municipalities, are told that they have to fend for themselves and should expect no particular help as they try to deal with some of the oldest infrastructure in Australia and one of its most diverse and challenging populations. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is the ultimate irony. The Deputy Prime Minister, for all his talk of compassion, seems happy to construct model dwellings for yuppies whilst the sewers, streets and services of our existing communities continue to crumble. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1K4">Dr BOB WOODS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It has not told the States anything. I have just pointed that out. I should also point out that within the Federal electorate of Lowe there are close to 10,000 unemployed people, again the victims of the Government's so-called compassion. With its so-called mad cities program, is the Government thinking of building designer soup kitchens or designer bus stops for them to sleep at? Surely the Government, which is currently celebrating the centenary of Labor-- perhaps it should be hard labour--should be spending taxpayers' dollars to create jobs and to stimulate the economy rather than following the pipe dreams of some tiny, eccentric, loony left faction of people. Moreover, I ask: what guarantees are there that people from our community will be given work on the Homebush Bay scheme, if it does eventually go forward?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I am also very concerned about the environmental impact of such a massive development scheme on the Federal electorate of Lowe. Much of the site in question was previously subjected to the waste products of a large abattoir and several other industries. I am currently investigating claims that the actual site is laden with toxic wastes. Is the Government aware of the problem of toxic waste in Homebush Bay and, if so, why has it not told our community anything? The Government should take a lesson from the United States' Love Canal tragedy. This was a model development of the 1950s which in the end finished up as a complete disaster, costing the taxpayer many millions of dollars because of deposits of toxic waste. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a number of problems with the Government's so-called better cities plan. Decisions are being made by a small clique of dreamers within the loony left of the Government whilst thousands in our community, in the real world, are left in the dark and left on the dole. The Government must come clean about the mad cities program, for now our community demands consultation and information. If our fears are not assuaged we will demand termination of the project. Sydney's inner west should not allow a `bitter city' in its own backyard. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another issue which particularly affects members of my own electorate--and it is also a national problem--is the proposed changes to SBS ethnic language radio broadcasts. This particularly harms residents in my area, which is one of the most richly multicultural areas in Australia. Literally thousands of people in this area may not be able to hear broadcasts in the language which is most understandable to them. Clearly this is unfair because they deserve the ethnic language news, social services information and the entertainment that they as taxpayers pay radio SBS 2EA to provide. Many of the people who listen to SBS 2EA are elderly. Many pensioners who have worked for years to earn their benefits may not be able to hear social security or health updates from the radio broadcasts on which they have come to rely. Some languages are heard exclusively on SBS--Welsh and Gaelic, for example. Some of these programs have been designated to be slashed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Other languages spoken by a growing number of Australians, such as Tamil, may have no regular spot. Cuts to some languages such as Estonian, Lithuanian, Croatian and Slovenian trouble me in particular because they cut people off from countries where there is enormous political turmoil. Many Australians are very worried about the effect of events on their families back in their homelands, and SBS 2EA is a main way for them to get information. It is very disturbing that SBS did not sufficiently consult the ethnic communities in deciding on the changes. Some groups benefit at the expense of others, and there is the potential for disharmony in our multicultural community with this crazy change. </PARA>
<PARA>  One solution clearly is for more broadcasting hours on another frequency. I understand that there have been some encouraging noises from the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) as a result of the opposition from myself and many other community representatives, and it looks as though, at least for the time being, there will be some backing down. I am glad that many of these regular programs may be saved. It is very important that the Minister go ahead with putting deeds to his words to ensure that we have an SBS like it was before this management got some bright ideas--an excellent, cost-effective service for thousands of Sydney's ethnic Australians. Sensible proposals from the Minister will have bipartisan support from this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also make use of this opportunity to express my own sincere and personal condolences to the families and friends of the victims of the recent Strathfield Plaza massacre. Strathfield Plaza is in fact my own local shopping centre and my wife and I do all our shopping in that area. My heart goes out to the people of this area and the victims and their relatives in this terrible tragedy. One of the young girls who was killed, in fact the first to be killed, was the daughter of a friend of mine. </PARA>
<PARA>  This incident underlines a plain truth that our society has ignored for too long: we simply cannot put weapons of mass destruction, weapons designed for killing, in the hands of sociopaths. To this end I am encouraged that the New South Wales Government, with the constructive support of the Labor Opposition, has acted to ban certain extremely dangerous firearms. </PARA>
<PARA>   I feel, however, that as a society we need to go further and the procedures currently used to issue shooters licenses must be made stricter. A psychological assessment of an appropriate type must be incorporated into the application. Had a worthwhile psychological screening been applied to Wade Frankum, our community would still have with it several vibrant and much loved citizens. Let us move forward with the conviction that such tragedies can indeed be averted in the future and let us not forget the memories of those who tragically perished. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I was surprised by the comments of the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) about the better cities program because, from what he was saying, I had the sense that he was concerned about improvements in urban infrastructure; his vilification of the nature of that program was simply misleading. I would have thought that the shared objective would have led him to be more constructive about a program that was designed to achieve what he says he wants to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I want to speak about development in Africa. Last Saturday I had an astonishing experience. I was attending the national dinner of the Australian and New Zealand Association for Intensive Care Workers. About 600 doctors and nurses met in Canberra for their annual conference. They were very serious about their concerns and I spoke to them during the afternoon about the issue of how to contain expenditure in the intensive care area. </PARA>
<PARA>  During the dinner, three of the leaders of the group said that they would like to sing their song. They sang a song about letting the children grow and the need to ensure that the impoverished peoples of the world have enough food and decent community services to be able to lead satisfactory lives. I was very impressed that such a large and strongly professional group which has a high degree of concern and very demanding work in intensive care could also have some concern for the rest of the world and the need to ensure that hunger is eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA>  In July I was co-chairman of a conference on African debt in Abidjan in Cote d'Ivoire in West Africa. During the 1980s in Africa the level of average incomes has fallen by well over 30 per cent, so that in the most impoverished continent the average living standards have gone down by over one-third. This means that people there are in a depression more severe than that experienced by the much wealthier industrialised countries during the 1930s. Yet, at the same time, Africa seems to have become marginalised in the global economy. In the last year or two there has been great concern about what is happening in eastern Europe, but all sorts of other issues have predominated in our media whilst the terrible growing impoverishment of Africa has continued. </PARA>
<PARA>  The conference on African debt was between parliamentarians of Western countries and African countries and we were also joined by experts. At the end of the conference we came out with a communique which suggested a range of policies for reducing the debt problem, which is one of the principal causes of the decline in African living standards. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is well illustrated when one notices that during the 1980s the level of debt in Africa has doubled. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa it has gone from $72 billion in 1982 to $163 billion in 1989. The principal reason for that doubling is that debt service and debt repayment have been delayed because of the incapacity of those countries to service their debt. Therefore, debt service has simply been added to the total debt. Debt service is accounting for about 8 per cent of the national incomes of all the sub-Saharan black African countries. That is an appalling drain on their resources. The Australian overseas debt--which is private debt, not government debt, unlike the debt in the African countries--is costing us about 4 per cent of our national income, yet Australia is 50 or 100 times wealthier than the African countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  The consequence of that drain in Africa is that not only have living standards fallen, but also services have been dramatically reduced as well. It is essential to find ways of addressing the problem. There are three forms of debt: bilateral government to government debt; debt to the international financial institutions; and private debt. The obvious solution in all cases is simply to reduce the debt. The principle of doing that has now been accepted by all the creditor countries. The Brady Plan, enunciated by the Secretary of the Treasury in the United States, accepts that principle, but so far the extent of reduction has been relatively slight. It is important to increase the extent to which debt is written off. </PARA>
<PARA>  The British Government put a proposal to the Group of Seven summit in July for reducing by two-thirds the amount of debt in the poorest and most debt distressed countries. That probably needs to be extended to a complete write-off of the debt of the poorest countries. Of course, the problem needs to be addressed on a country by country basis, but the ambit of opportunity for debt reduction needs to be substantially increased. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the astonishing things that we learnt was that the International Monetary Fund received over $3 billion net from sub-Saharan Africa in the last four years. In other words, the amount that it has lent to Africa has been exceeded by the repayments from Africa by $3 billion over those four years. That is a disaster and must be stopped. A minimal requirement is that the amount of debt to the international financial institutions from sub-Saharan Africa must be written off. That could be financed by the sale of a small amount of the IMF's gold or by a small new issue of special drawing rights. I was encouraged to find that a number of major Western countries support that proposal. At a time when global liquidity is very tight, that sort of proposal for a new issue of special drawing rights makes particularly good sense. </PARA>
<PARA>  The World Bank has a particular role in facilitating debt reduction. It already has a modest debt management facility that needs upgrading and strengthening. Private debt, of course, also needs to be written off. It is legitimate to expect that the small amount of private debt in these appallingly poor countries should be written off in about the same proportion as government debt. If those kinds of policies were adopted and complemented by the increases in aid and concessional lending that should come both bilaterally and multilaterally, then gradually Africa could recover. But unless debt is written off in that way, it will be very difficult for that recovery to occur. </PARA>
<PARA>  Africa is not the centre of Australia's attention, nor should it be. But it is a continent where we have some small concerns. We do spend a small amount of our aid there. There are a number of Australians who are very concerned about what is happening in southern Africa, Eritrea or in central Africa. Principally, we can have our executive directors at the bank and the fund contribute to leading the way to more effective facilitation of debt reduction and to being supportive of debt reduction programs from the major creditor countries. We could also join the African Development Bank, as the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended in its report on aid a couple of years ago. It is not our centre of concern but, because we are part of a global community, it is something that we should address as well. With these kinds of policies that I am suggesting, gradual recovery in Africa is possible, and that is what we should be looking for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In 1832, Andrew Jackson said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The wisdom of man never yet contrived a system of taxation that would operate with perfect equality. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think there would be a member of this House or any taxpayer who would disagree with that statement. However, while the vast majority of Western democracies have reformed their tax structures to meet the changing needs of their work force, here in this country we have maintained an archaic system of taxation that relies mainly on taxes on income for revenue. The majority of Western countries have moved away from this type of tax system. In fact, 21 out of the 23 OECD countries now have broad-based consumption taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our tax system, by relying on income tax for the bulk of revenue, means that a wage earner who is married with two children has the distinction of paying the sixth highest average rate of tax in the industrialised world. These average rates have risen under this Government. This is, of course, the greatest disincentive to work harder and to save. One of the most common complaints I hear from constituents in my electorate is that there is no incentive to work harder. Many have said to me, `What's the point in working overtime when you lose most of what you earn in tax?'. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government attempted to change our tax system of reliance on income tax and move towards the reform that most other countries had adopted in 1985 when the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), then a strong proponent of reforming this iniquitous system, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no logical justification for a tax which discriminates against manufactured goods compared with services, particularly in a society which has seen services replace goods as the dominant field of activity. </PARA>
<PARA>Part of the tragedy of our current economic mess is that the opportunity for reform existed in 1985, but because of the dominance of the ACTU and the lack of resolve of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that opportunity was lost. Today we are paying for that lost opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>   As well as increasing average rates of income tax, this Government has broadened the base of the wholesale sales tax system. In 1982-83, the Government collected $3.4 billion in sales tax. In 1990-91 it collected almost $10 billion. In other words, it has trebled the amount of tax raised indirectly through sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  The direction in which this Government's policies have been leading us as a nation for the past eight years has now been proved to be totally wrong because reform has not taken place. Today, we are a country riddled with debt--a net foreign debt of just over $130 billion. That is $7,900 for every man, woman and child. We are a country with rising, unacceptably high levels of unemployment with almost one million people officially out of work: a country with falling standards of living. Because these problems have not been addressed, we have limped towards stagnation and now find ourselves in recession--in fact, in the worst economic position for the past 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  These problems, however, can be solved, provided we start now. The 12 March industry statement was supposed to address these problems. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>We must export more manufactured goods and services and substitute more quality Australian production for imports. </PARA>
<PARA>No-one could disagree with that statement. But what that statement lacked then, and still lacks, is the means to achieve that goal. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister tried to convince us on that day that he was announcing the means whereby we could start to make the necessary changes, but they were mere window dressing. What was patently obvious was the lack of any structural changes. A classic example of this window dressing is the claim by the Prime Minister of reduced wholesale sales tax for business with a cost to revenue of $375m in 1992-93. That is a mere drop in the ocean. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the one hand, the Government is exhorting our business sector to be more competitive, increase production and increase exports to redress the massive problems of our balance of payments. But on the other hand, the Government is taxing those very exports through indirect taxation via the wholesale sales tax to the tune of $1.2 billion per year, thus making our industries uncompetitive with those of our major trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Taxation Research Foundation has estimated that at least half the revenue raised by our sales tax system comes from taxes on business inputs. In Taxation Issues of the 1990s, volume 8, No. 1, J.G. Head stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is generally accepted that relatively little can be achieved with the present wholesale sales tax framework. </PARA>
<PARA>It was important to make those reforms in taxation back in the mid-80s for reasons that are still relevant today. The problems, however, have been exacerbated and, for each day those problems are allowed to remain, the greater the need for reform will be. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we examine our taxation system, we will see that it is the wholesale sales tax system that has been the major stumbling block to reform and the key to effecting any real change to our taxation system. We in the Opposition recognise and understand that and are prepared to abolish it to achieve genuine tax reform. The Government has accused us of proposing to introduce a consumption tax when the reality is, of course, that we already have an unfair hidden consumption tax on hundreds of everyday items at rates of 10, 20 and 30 per cent with no compensation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The complexity and inequity of the wholesale sales tax comes from the multiple rates, the exemptions, the anomalies and the compliance cost. Let me give an example of these anomalies and the administrative cost to both industry and the Australian Taxation Office in relation to the plastics industry. Almost all raw materials are exempt from sales tax because they are classified as an aid to manufacture. These include, for example, plaster, metal, glass and timber. But this archaic wholesale sales tax system that the Government wants to maintain has no definition of plastics as a raw material. So it does not have the same exemption as an aid to manufacture that timber and glass have. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under the current system, suppliers of raw materials for the plastics industry are required to obtain quotations for exemption certificates for every transaction. There are an estimated 1,200 plastic processors required to furnish formal quotations for every transaction. When no sales tax is even payable on the plastic raw materials in question, the wasteful cost to industry and the cost in unproductive Australian Taxation Office administration time is estimated to be between $3m and $5m a year. Of course, these costs are paid by the taxpayer. The introduction of a goods and services tax will remove this anomaly, along with the thousands of others inherent in the out-of-date wholesale sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another lost opportunity was that to reduce the size of the black economy. Back in 1985, the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) argued that one of the major reasons for introducing a broad-based consumption tax was to tax the black economy. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Those who continue to evade or avoid their fair share of income tax are required to pay some tax when their income is spent. For the rest of the community this tax revenue from avoiders and evaders is available from net tax benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>The same argument holds true today. Again, the tragedy is that by not introducing reform in 1985, the situation is far worse in 1991. The black economy today is conservatively estimated to be at least $20 billion a year. On 5 June 1985 at the National Press Club, the former Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is now well recognised that the Australian tax system is unfair. It is widely appreciated that it encourages inefficiency and is extraordinarily complex. Clearly there is a need for action for reform. </PARA>
<PARA>He lost that opportunity for action, with the result that the need for reform today is now urgent. The coalition will not allow this country to stagnate any longer and will reform the tax system to restore incentive and competition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- The Federal Opposition is committed to abolishing the present sales tax system and replacing it with a consumption tax. To date, no precise details of this tax package have been released, but the Opposition, through press release, parliamentary questions and so on, has attempted to discredit the present sales tax arrangements with a view to making a consumption tax more palatable to the electorate. It asserts that many items, including some standard household ones, are now being taxed. Though the Liberal and National parties have not officially confirmed or denied the figure, the conventional wisdom is that they are looking at a rate of 15 per cent. They have suggested that many items being unfairly taxed at present will be cheaper and that the Government already has a type of hidden consumption tax in place in many instances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As part of its marketing strategy, the Opposition has tried to directly compare the consumption tax rate of 15 per cent with the present sales tax rates of, say, 20 per cent or more and create the illusion that its rate is lower. This is blatant deception and before the debate progresses any further it needs to be exposed. </PARA>
<PARA>  One very significant difference between the present sales tax system and a consumption tax needs to be highlighted and never forgotten when making comparisons--that is, of course, if we can take the Opposition at its word and believe it will introduce a consumption tax and not a value added tax, the latter being even more disastrous and an administrative nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA>  The present sales tax system is based mostly on the wholesale price of an item. A consumption tax is assessed on the retail price of a good or service--that is, a further increment has been added to the price before this tax is calculated. So while numerically 15 per cent is lower than 20 per cent, given the different points at which the rate is calculated the actual price effect of each needs to be examined. In many cases, a 15 per cent tax assessed on the retail price of a product has a greater impact on the final cost to the consumer than a 20 per cent tax on the wholesale price or manufacturing cost. The big lie is the attempt by the Federal Opposition to muddy the water by quoting the present sales tax rates in the same breath as its proposed consumption tax without mentioning the different points in the trading chain at which they are applied. Always remember that a consumption tax is a tax on the retail price. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to discuss one example that compares the impact of a 15 per cent consumption tax with a 20 per cent wholesale tax. This is an actual small business situation involving a book publisher. I recently discussed this matter with the proprietor of this business. This small business showed me by way of example one quote received for the printing of a planned book with a recommended retail price of $8.95. It should at all times be remembered that under the present system books are exempt from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  The decision was made to print 2,000 books and the quoted price was $3,151--a unit production cost of $1.58 per book. Firstly, let us see what would happen if the present sales tax system were amended to remove the exemption for printing of books so that books, under that criterion, like all other printing, attracted a 20 per cent sales tax. On this quote, the client would have to pay an additional $630.20, giving a total cost of $3,781.20. This would take the unit production cost to $1.89 per book. That is a 31c impact on the cost of each book. </PARA>
<PARA>  At worst, let us assume that, after taking into account marketing and other business expenses, the publisher decided that this could not be absorbed. The price of the book would be pushed, at worst, to $9.30, an increase of 35c. Thirty-five cents added to the retail price of $8.95 is equivalent to a 4 per cent consumption tax. However, in reality, this book is presently exempt, as I have said, from any sales tax and it continues to retail at $8.95. Let us see what would happen if it were subjected to a 15 per cent consumption tax. Fifteen per cent of $8.95 is $1.34. The price of the book to the consumer would now be $10.29. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As the honourable member for Bowman says, `exactly'. The Government takes $1.34 in tax, which, if all 2,000 books are sold, means a total tax grab of $2,680. With a 15 per cent consumption tax the Government collects $2,049.80 more than if a 20 per cent sales tax was added to the printing quote. To collect the same amount of tax and have the same price impact on the book as a 15 per cent consumption tax, the sales tax rate on the printing quote would have to be 85 per cent--not 20 per cent. We are looking at a wholesale sales tax imposition of 85 per cent to equate with a 15 per cent consumption tax. This is clearly a case of `the 15 per cent you have when you are not having 15 per cent'. I seek leave to include in Hansard the quote from the publisher of the book.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It will not matter, because over the next six months I will make sure that that quote gets out. This book is presently exempt from any sales tax and it continues to retail at $8.95. I am sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker, I have read the passage again; it is because I am so upset about not getting the quote in for everyone to see.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is quite obvious that the book industry is threatened by the consumption tax. Recently, I saw a piece of Liberal Party propaganda promoting the benefits of the Opposition's proposed consumption tax in which it described books, which are presently exempt from sales tax, as a leisure activity or a form of entertainment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition is trying to create the impression that it is unfair that books should be sales tax exempt, as they are not an essential item. It would be an understatement to say that I was somewhat astonished by this claim. I would be interested to know what school teachers, parents and citizens organisations and other people who understand that books are an educational tool would think of that claim. </PARA>
<PARA>  A consumption tax on all goods and services will be a tax on education--a tax on learning and knowledge. At a time when our Government is mounting a concerted attack on illiteracy in Australia, the Liberal and National parties are suggesting that reading books is only a leisure activity; they are proposing to put a tax on such books and, in doing so, a tax on learning and education. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to point, in particular, to the process of self-education. There are many people who are educating themselves through the system--mature age students and the like. Every parent in this place surely knows that reading is not a leisure activity. Parents and teachers around the nation put great effort into encouraging their children to read books, because it is critical to their ongoing education--as it is for adults. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition has the gall to describe reading as a leisure activity. Every intelligent person knows that by reading books--even novels--people's reading and comprehension skills are enhanced, their vocabularies are broadened and their general and specific knowledge are added to. These are all important factors in Australia becoming a clever country. </PARA>
<PARA>  We should be encouraging Australians to read more books; certainly we should not be taxing them for trying to learn more, trying to educate themselves and trying to lift the skills base of this nation. I think, in particular, that this instance has demonstrated quite clearly that a consumption tax of 15 per cent is the same as an 85 per cent wholesales sales tax. Over the next six months, Government members are going to slowly dismember this charade of the Opposition that people are going to get something beneficial out of a tax on food, clothes and learning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I want to talk today about the Government's social agenda. The Hawke Government has been big on a number of eye-catching statements, perhaps the most notable being, `No child shall live in poverty'. A number of Government members worked with the Aboriginal community before coming to this place and have expressed concern in that field. In addition, the Government has claimed a special relationship with the environmental groups, which had a significant effect in the minds of some at the last election. Almost daily the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) comes in here ranting about the Government's monopoly on health, education and concern for the aged and the disabled and so on. In fact, the Government tends to claim a monopoly on compassion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  But let us look at the record. Archbishop Hollingsworth dealt quite adequately with the claim that no child would be living in poverty. I remind the House that in my first question in this place in May of last year I asked the Prime Minister about that statement and, of course, we heard his very defensive and guilty response. </PARA>
<PARA>  When this Government came to power the Aboriginal community had high expectations. The Aboriginal community now, of course, feels let down, angry and very impatient for some action. </PARA>
<PARA>  The environmental community has learnt in the last 18 months that at the last election we told the truth. It is only now finding out about the Government's true situation. But those are all various high profile areas and I would just like to look at one or two specifics of the way the Government administers its policy in terms of its social agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>  Firstly, I would like to look at how it treats the disabled. Let us look at the domiciliary care nursing benefit which has not, as I understand it, been increased for 10 years. Now that, of course, is payable only to those who would otherwise be eligible for admission to an approved nursing home. By staying in their own homes and receiving care from their own families, the cost to any government is one-twentieth of what it costs to put somebody in a nursing home. But the Hawke Government has had so little real care for these people that their pleas for an increase to this relatively modest allowance have fallen on deaf ears year after year. There has been no increase for 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the same vein, I tell the House that a few weeks ago I went out on a round with the local Royal District Nursing Service and we visited a quadriplegic in my electorate. He happened to be a migrant whose English was not particularly good and who had had a devastating road accident. He can get only three visits a week from the RDNS because it does not have the funds to provide more. Therefore his mother, who is 70 and speaks no English whatsoever, is left to cope. He gets no financial assistance, but if he went into a nursing home for three or six months and then went back home again he would get some assistance. There would be no change to his condition, but there would be a lot more expenditure of government revenue in putting him into a nursing home. If the House compares the costs, it will see how ridiculous that legislation is. </PARA>
<PARA>  Madam Deputy Speaker, you will notice that I am not talking about the broad picture. I could talk about the Government's attitude to education. In the eastern suburbs of Melbourne we have no university and the opportunities to go to university are less than anywhere else in the country. I have not talked about having to go onto a hospital waiting list for months; the misery of the bankruptcies caused by this Government through its policies; the stress placed by this Government on families of the unemployed; or the family breakdowns generated through lost homes because of the high interest rate policies of the Government. I am not talking in detail about the growing problems of drugs and violence caused by the economic and social breakdown that is going on, I am talking about the ongoing pain that this Government inflicts on a day-to-day basis through sheer bad administration and poor legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at families and the unfortunate circumstance where there is a breakdown in the family and at the operation of the Child Support Agency. In my area we use the Dandenong office of the Child Support Agency. Many constituents come to me on a monthly basis complaining about the administration and operation of that facility. The complaints come from custodial and non-custodial parents, men and women--they are not all from one side. The complaints are about things that are very simple to fix, like the telephone being constantly engaged or no-one bothering to answer it. People frequently tell me that they can never get through to the agency, but that if they get through then the agency will not talk to them. The agency claims that under the Privacy Act it cannot talk to people on the telephone. Sometimes it will go away to check on something and just leave people hanging on the other end of the phone. </PARA>
<PARA>  The whole processing time of applications is totally unacceptable.  It is months and months and months during which individuals--not just the parents but the children--are suffering. We have had quite outrageous examples where a man's wages were garnisheed without him even being told that his case was up before the Child Support Agency. These are basic failures of administration. There are not enough staff, there are insufficiently skilled staff, and the Family Court, which deals with cases for only two half-days a month, is totally inadequate to handle the load. The Child Support Agency registrar here in Canberra has openly and publicly admitted that 25 per cent of the 1,700 cases that have occurred so far are in the problem category and that the Government has totally underestimated the task. </PARA>
<PARA>  People are suffering--the parents and the children. I have one constituent, for example, who has been waiting for two years for child support from a husband who knows how to manipulate the system because he is fast on his feet and the system is so slow that it never catches up with him. I ask: when will the Government take action to fix the problems, or does it not care?</PARA>
<PARA>  I would also like to talk about the elderly. I am sure that all honourable members yesterday received in their mail the publication Australian Nursing Home, which on the front page says, `Indecisive Federal Government Again Proves Unable to Make Proper Decisions, Yet Again They Avoid the Real Issues'. I quote a couple of extracts from this document:</PARA>
<PARA>There is now a complete inability on the part of the Government to make major policy decisions that in any way involve lateral thinking approaches to problems; the bureaucracy has yet again taken the upper hand in the decision making process in aged care matters. . .</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Some Ministers are now so unsure of their powers and position in the overall scheme of things that they will not meet with industry groups without the bureaucracy being present. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on further:</PARA>
<PARA>The real issues in coming to grips with the funding problems of the aged care industry relate to the fact that. . . the aged care funding cake is limited in content and is currently being unfairly and inequitably sliced. . . </PARA>
<PARA>All Government members have received that and I suggest that they pay some attention to it. The pensioners are told that they do not get a rise because the CPI has not gone up--but go down to the supermarket and see whether the things they buy have increased in price. Superannuants are punished for their thrift because they do not get the benefits of concession cards. It seems to me that the aged have earned the right to security and peace, they have done their bit, and we should be looking after them a lot better. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Spastic Society of Victoria has had its funding cut dramatically in the past couple of years. In terms of the way that policy is being implemented, there is quite clearly an anti-voluntary agencies bias. I have constituents who are parents with a disabled daughter whose Spastic Society funding is being cut by the Government in December. They do not know what the heck is going to happen. CSV Victoria, we are told, is going to pick up the responsibility in July and maybe there will be some temporary bridging funding from March to July, but what are they supposed to do between December and March? There is a three months gap, and nobody will tell them what is happening, nobody will take responsibility. It is a totally unsatisfactory and inappropriate way to administer this sort of important and sensitive portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us consider the indecent haste of integration. We are pushing ahead with a program covering people's lives in a few short years, and it is totally unacceptable. In conclusion, I am not talking about spending oodles of extra money; I am not talking about all the high profile issues. I am talking about attitude--the Government's attitude to social engineering, its attitude to social welfare strategy and the social justice program. I am talking about the nuts and bolts, the implementation, the simple little things, a few dollars spent more sensibly, some common sense, some compassion and some consideration for people. </PARA>
<PARA>  Government action, I am afraid, does not match its rhetoric. It has failed in all of these areas on basic issues on which it claims moral ownership. My message to the Government is that it has no monopoly on care and concern and that it should concede its failures and fix a number of these problems urgently. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ET4">Mr BEVIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-From the Opposition we have protestations,  which it will need to repeat more often in the months ahead. We are waiting for the Leader of the Opposition to announce the detail in September. We will hear then what it is he proposes. If Opposition members are tired of listening to these speeches now, they should wait until after the announcement is made in September, because they will hear it throughout the length and breath of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There are a number of constituents within the Brisbane Federal division who clearly are going to be adversely affected and who have raised their concerns with me. I wish to address some of those groups. Retired superannuants have a number of concerns about various matters of policy. They stand to lose more than most in the short term from a consumption tax. These people rely almost exclusively on their life savings as the basis for their income and for all of their purchases. If a goods and services taxes is introduced, the value of retired superannuants' savings, the spending capacity of their savings, will be reduced overnight. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us say that it is the 15 per cent rate that has often been quoted, although at the end of September, in the National Press Club speech from the Leader of the Opposition, we will find out precisely what it is. Let us say that it is 15 per cent. The day after the Liberal Party policy is implemented retired superannuants will have a reduction in the spending power of their life savings of 15 per cent. How does the Opposition plan to compensate those superannuants who are living on accumulated savings from their working career? The short answer is that it cannot. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another group that will be adversely affected is aged pensioners and all those in receipt of a fixed income. A little while ago the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) talked about some of the problems of the aged and infirm people. He sought to criticise the Government for failings in this area. His solution to the problem facing the aged and those who are on fixed incomes is to impose upon them an increased cost of living of 15 per cent, to add a goods and services tax--a consumption tax--to their weekly food bill, their clothing bill and the like.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Liberal's answer to that dilemma is to say that it will compensate these people. We need to have a look at that assertion. Firstly, we have to assume that it can be done accurately, and that is not something we can hold out great hope for when we look at other countries that have introduced these sorts of taxes. It is not simply a matter of compensating those people with an adjustment in the rate of their pension. The extent of the compensation they need depends on their spending capacity and what they spend their money on. But let us assume that it can be done. The question then is: has the Opposition got the will to do it?  In spite of the comments of people such as the honourable member for Aston, the record shows a quite different performance. In the seven years in which the Liberal Party was in government, from 1975 to 1982, its performance on age pensions was despicable. Age pensions fell in real terms. The Liberal Party's record in government on age pensions gives no hope for its willingness to compensate this group of people, who will be seriously disadvantaged by the proposed consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  In recent months I have spent some time meeting and talking to business people in Queensland, particularly south-east Queensland, concerned with the tourist industry. Madam Deputy Speaker, I know that in your electorate there are many people who rely upon tourism as a major source of income. As was mentioned in this place yesterday, the position of the tourist industry on a consumption tax is quite clear. The tourist industry understands the impact a consumption tax will have on its businesses. It understands the adverse consequences of the Opposition's policy of introducing a consumption tax. The tourist industry, which is vital to many parts of Australia and certainly to many key areas in Queensland, is opposed to a consumption tax because it will hurt employment, it will hurt investment, and it will hurt the nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I suspect that families will be the hardest hit. Some 70 per cent of items purchased in a normal weekly shopping outing at a supermarket are now not subject to wholesale sales tax. Under a Liberal proposal, these items would incur a 15 per cent consumption tax and increase the cost to the average family. This has been a matter of some concern to many of us in this place, and it has been picked up by the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission in a study it did on the Opposition's proposals. I will quote two sections from the Commission's report. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>Most of the GST revenue will come, not from income tax avoiders or evaders, but from people who have already paid their income tax. </PARA>
<PARA>The ordinary wage and salary earners, the ordinary family people in our country, will be the ones affected. In fact, a comprehensive statement on that was made. I wish to refer to it because I think it encapsulates the problem that Australian families will face under the Opposition's program. Those opposite would do well to listen. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA>If total tax revenues are to be unchanged and taxpayers fall into three groups--low, middle and high income--then the gains of one group must be at the expense of others. </PARA>
<PARA>That is simple enough for all of us to agree on, I would think. It went on:</PARA>
<PARA>If the highest marginal tax rates are cut--</PARA>
<PARA>and that is the Opposition's policy--</PARA>
<PARA>the high income group must gain at the expense of the middle and low income groups. If, in turn, the low income group is compensated by social security increases, the burden finally falls on the middle income group, especially those with families to support. </PARA>
<PARA>That is clearly the position and it is an inescapable conclusion which those opposite understand as much as anybody else. Of course, the cost of a goods and services tax-- a consumption tax--goes beyond the things we pick up in a supermarket. All services, not just goods that we consume, will be the subject of a 15 per cent impost. </PARA>
<PARA>  When people go to the dentist or the doctor, will they pay the extra 15 per cent consumption tax? I happen to go to a medical surgery that charges the Australian Medical Association recommended rate of $27, if my memory serves me correctly. A 15 per cent impost on that would lift my doctor's fee by about $4 to just over $31. That is the sort of extra payment I will be making when my children or I have to visit the doctor. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a lot of other expenses that average Australians have to meet on a regular or semi-regular basis and that are now free of tax. For example, most Australian families are not in the position of buying a brand new, off the assembly line vehicle. Most Australians are in the position of buying a second-hand car. There is no wholesale sales tax on second-hand vehicles. However, the Liberal Party will impose a 15 per cent tax on them. That will mean that a modest, second-hand vehicle that many Australian families would be looking to purchase for $8,000 will go up by about $1,200. It is no secret that I am a keen follower of sport and a keen follower of rugby league. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Well, by listening to this debate, the honourable member has been educated in a number of ways. One of the things that many people enjoy on their weekends is getting out and going to their favourite sporting match. As the rugby league season draws to a close, the grand final will be held at the Sydney football stadium. That stadium will take somewhere in the order of 40,000 people, who will each pay $35 for a ticket. Under the Liberal Party's proposals, they will be paying tax of approximately $210,000 for the privilege of going through the gate to watch the game. That is before they buy a program, a hamburger and a drink. Under the Liberal Party's policies, in a couple of weeks time at the Sydney grand final $210,000 in taxation would be collected. That is the effect of the Liberal Party's tax policy. When the details are announced in September, the Liberal Leader will put the lid on the coffin of his Party's chances at the next election.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --I have a very real grievance concerning my electorate of Maranoa. It is a grievance that should concern all residents of Australia. It relates to the proposal of the Queensland Government to site a toxic waste dump at Gurulmundi, near Miles, in south-western Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The draft impact assessment study found that the site was suitable, but one has to look at the people who are conducting that impact assessment study. Gurulmundi is sited at the headwaters of the Murray-Darling River system and is above the recharging aquifers of the Great Artesian Basin. Residents were initially given 28 days to respond to that environmental impact study, which dealt with products that will go into the ground forevermore. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 5 June, I put on notice in this House question No. 884, which referred to the disposal of toxic wastes in Australia. I was concerned mainly with disposal using the landfill method as proposed at Gurulmundi. There was a degree of urgency about my question because the impact assessment study was to be released before August of this year. I wrote to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) on 7 July. In my letter I stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The entire project is shrouded with confusion and contradiction and concerned residents are looking federally for some decisive action. As an announcement of the proposed site is expected shortly, residents of Miles and district are calling for your input. </PARA>
<PARA>It was on 22 August that I received the response to that question. This was after the draft environmental impact study had been brought down.  The Queensland Government has not had a great deal of consultation with the people of Miles. The Minister's response to my question stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The proposal does not involve any decisions by the Commonwealth; however I fully support the Queensland initiative to ensure that hazardous wastes are disposed of properly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This form of disposal of toxic waste is Stone Age technology, and the Minister at the table would do well to listen. It is Stone Age technology which Third World countries are rejecting. I hope we are not at the stage of calling ourselves a Third World country as well as a banana republic. Using the landfill method, these toxic wastes, which are hazardous, are going to be buried in our most valuable resource--the soil. The Minister does recognise the potential threat because she went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A secure landfill properly designed and operated as is proposed would pose a negligible risk to the Great Artesian Basin and the inland rivers system. </PARA>
<PARA>I say that no risk at all can be taken with our Great Artesian Basin and our inland river system. The Minister admits that there is a negligible risk. I repeat that any risk is too great a risk for this nation and the people of Australia. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that it would be unwise to rely on clay of any type as a sole containment medium however I am informed that at the dump proposed for Miles this has been recognised and that other measures are being considered. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me inform the House that the clay to be the sole containment medium is bentonite clay. Gurulmundi is on the site of an old bentonite mine. The Minister faces a clear contradiction.  The Minister says it is inappropriate to compare overseas facilities with what is proposed at Gurulmundi. I ask the Minister when the Commonwealth will compare our attitude to toxic waste disposal with the overseas attitude? Will we consider it when these poisons leach into the underground water aquifers--when it is too late, when the damage is done?</PARA>
<PARA>  There are alternative technologies available. This decision of the Queensland Government pre-empts a study which is currently under way. That study and the decision arising from it are contrary to the uniform approach to waste management. I remind the Minister that, currently, the governments of New South Wales, Victoria and the Commonwealth are considering taking a national and coordinated approach to the disposal of toxic wastes in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The two studies being undertaken involve determining the benefits of the seven potential sites for a high-temperature incinerator and considering alternative forms of technology. A report is to be handed down in December, only 16 weeks away. If the decision goes in the favour of the incinerator, an environmental impact study will be undertaken and tenders will be called. By 1993 we could see here in Australia a high-temperature toxic waste incinerator up and running. </PARA>
<PARA>  The incinerator which is proposed in this study has a capacity to dispose of 15,000 tonnes of toxic waste annually. Currently in Australia we produce 10,000 tonnes. The balance of that capacity will be taken up by the State of New South Wales as production of other forms of toxic waste. I commend the New South Wales Government on its attitude and on the responsible way in which it is approaching the problem that all State governments have in the disposal of toxic waste. </PARA>
<PARA>  Clearly, the future lies in high-temperature toxic waste incineration. Testimony to that is that in the United States today there are 205 high-temperature toxic waste incinerators in operation. In Australia, we do not have one. There is a study to be released at the end of this year which, I believe, will give the green light to go ahead with new technology-- technology that will deal with toxic waste disposal and treat waste responsibly. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the things that we must do is educate industry to minimise waste. One of the great benefits of high-temperature toxic waste incineration over the landfill method is that it converts one tonne of toxic waste in the process of incineration to one kilogram of waste. Imagine that. It is so much easier to dispose of because that toxic waste is converted to a stabilised form of a toxin and is much more easily and readily disposed of. </PARA>
<PARA>  We only have to look at what is happening in Germany today and all over Europe. Germany does not have the landfill method; it has high-temperature toxic waste incinerators. The heat that the incinerators generate is converted to electricity and the whole of Germany--every German house--is heated by the energy created in disposing of toxic waste. What wonderful technology. They get something for nothing and they solve the problem of toxic waste disposal. </PARA>
<PARA>  We should profit from overseas experience. We should not be going down the path that the Queensland Government is talking about. We should wait for that assessment study to be released at the end of this year. In the meantime, there is only one alternative to storing toxic waste as far as I am concerned--that is, concrete landfills which are secure--until this technology, high-temperature toxic waste incineration, comes on stream. </PARA>
<PARA>  The proposal at Gurulmundi is not a concrete landfill and is not safe. The site is clearly unsuitable. I say that the landfill method is unsuitable. It is stone age technology and Third World technology. The Queensland Government is irresponsible if it backs a proposal to site this landfill toxic waste dump at Gurulmundi in Queensland, because what it puts at risk is not only the great inland river systems of Australia, but the artesian basin which is the lifeblood of so many western Queensland towns that get their water from the artesian basin. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is only an irresponsible government that would put at risk the health and well-being of future generations of Australians. If this proposal goes ahead, the Queensland Government will be condemned as just that--an irresponsible government. </PARA>

However, it is not something which will be fixed overnight. The fact is that people want to keep coming to live in northern New South Wales, but industry and jobs are not in the same hurry to relocate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  One of the things which I am attempting is to get some coordination of the efforts of the three tiers of government and the private sector in working together to tackle the level of unemployment within the region. In this regard, I must acknowledge the coordinating role played by NOROC, the Northern Rivers Regional Organisation of Councils. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the end of September we will have exploratory talks as a sort of exchange of information between agencies at various levels to see what can be done. Of course, in such a situation it would be easy for people to play a political agenda, but I am hopeful that some at least will attempt to do something really effective for the people in this part of the State. To do nothing is to condemn both young and old or the unemployed to a jobless future. </PARA>
<PARA>  I preface my remaining remarks with a tribute to all of the dedicated people working in both State and Federal programs to prepare people by skilling and re-skilling them. I also pay tribute to the way in which they find placements for many of the people that pass through their training advisory schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are no easy fixes for the 60 or more years of neglect in the Richmond electorate. There are, however, some things which can be done. Governments at all levels must continue to remind themselves that what suits Sydney or its suburbs does not necessarily fit the needs of the electorate of Richmond. In this regard the debate going on in New South Wales about restoring a measure of payroll tax relief, to remove what is perhaps the greatest disincentive to manufacturers continuing to operate in rural New South Wales, is vital. I can think of no other single decision which would give impetus to the expansion of provincial New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the moment, there is growing what amounts to a revolt of industries located in the country. Many of them, by tradition conservative voters, are telling the New South Wales Government `enough'. The Greiner-Murray Government in New South Wales abolished the payroll tax rebate scheme by changing the guidelines under which country employers claimed the rebate. This has resulted in job losses because of what amounted to retrospectivity in the effects of the changes. With the high number of unemployed people, we have to make every possible effort to ensure that country manufacturers in particular are able to prosper. If they are forced to close down, many country manufacturers will never reopen. </PARA>
<PARA>  The cost of the scheme to the New South Wales Government represented only 0.8 per cent of the total payroll tax that went into the State coffers in 1989. No right-minded thinking person in New South Wales would begrudge this small amount, which would provide an incentive for manufacturers to set up shop in the country. </PARA>
<PARA>  A cloud on the horizon which casts its shadow over the Richmond electorate and, I suspect, over many parts of rural Australia is the proposal by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to impose a consumption tax, should he ever be elected to government. A consumption tax would place an intolerable burden on low income earners in the electorate of Richmond and would cripple the self-employed, who are now barely making ends meet. The imposition of a goods and services tax would create a vicious cycle which, in turn, would affect the prosperity of retailers. The few people who can afford to spend their money on luxury items would certainly be better off, but those caught in the cycle of economic necessity will be the ones who will suffer because of the higher prices of everyday items. </PARA>
<PARA>  During the years of Country Party and National Party representation at the Federal level the Richmond electorate became among the poorest electorates, in money terms, in Australia. If the Hewson scheme for a consumption tax is ever implemented, farmers on the north coast, who have already felt the sting of falling returns, will find that the cost of basic purchases will increase. Moreover, the impact of a consumption tax on people with fixed incomes, such as pensioners and the unemployed, will be horrific. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is people like these that the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) intend to sock hard with the consumption tax. No wonder delegates to the National Party conferences and some thinking Liberals such as Dr Metherell in New South Wales are shocked beyond belief at the prospect. I am, however, far more concerned about the economic impact on the people of provincial Australia, on whom the uneven burden of such a tax would fall. Once again, we have the prospect of decisions being made by conservative parties in the capital cities of this country without, apparently, any real consideration for the effects they will have on provincial Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>   I understand that the Leader of the Opposition may be planning a trip to the Richmond electorate during October. I think he owes it to ordinary people to come good with the details of his scheme and to show those on fixed incomes and benefits how they will be better off with the consumption tax. He might also explain to them how they will pay the consumption tax when he has cut them off from support with what the Lismore Northern Star called `a cruel, out of date policy'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The attacks yesterday on a goods and services tax by the Government in Question Time brought intelligent public debate on major national policy issues to a new low in cheap politics and gross exaggeration. The Government has made a series of totally spurious claims. One has claimed that inevitably under a coalition government the rate of GST would increase, as it apparently has in a selected list of countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Not only is that assertion without any foundation whatsoever; it also shows that the hypocrisy of the Government knows no bounds. The Labor Party has increased its take from the wholesale sales tax from $3.5 billion in 1982-83 to $10 billion last year. Without any compensation, it has imposed sales tax on everything from ice cream and biscuits, to matches, snack foods, household disinfectants and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) descended to raving nonsense by claiming that a GST would `push home purchase out of the reach of families'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) must take prompt action to remove the present duplication between Commonwealth and State prescription schemes which discriminate against pensioners in Queensland. The Commonwealth's prescription record form is used by pensioners when obtaining prescriptions from community chemists. However, the Queensland hospitals card is used expressly for prescriptions obtained through Queensland Public Hospital outpatient chemists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Since November 1990, the Federal Government has required pensioner health card holders to pay $2.50 for each prescription item on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme purchased through community chemists until the total of those prescription charges exceeds $130, after which additional prescription items are free of charge. However, the Queensland public hospital system does not recognise the Commonwealth's form when prescriptions are filled through its outpatient chemists, as it has its own record card system. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are many people who, by necessity, must use both community and hospital outpatient chemists. Because of the present duplication, they are not entitled to have the cost of prescriptions obtained at hospital chemists noted on their Commonwealth record card. This necessarily increases the overall cost of prescriptions and affects people who can least afford to pay. The health Ministers of both governments must act urgently to remove this duplication. </PARA>

Most people will tell you that the odds are stacked against the punter. In the long run, most end up losing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Opposition's proposal for a consumption tax would further reduce the chances of the punter winning. Under Opposition policy, any winnings by punters would be subject to a 15 per cent or 22 1/2 per cent consumption tax. In other words, a person winning $100 would receive only $85 or $77.50, depending on the rate of the tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  A consumption tax would force people to bet illegally.  Why would people place a bet with the TAB or a bookmaker when they know that their winnings will be taxed at 15 per cent or 22 1/2 per cent? The local SP would be able to offer punters tax-free winnings. The black economy would flourish as money went underground to avoid this insidious tax. Punters would not be the only losers with the introduction of the consumption tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Government and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) are to be commended for recognising the urban crisis and initiating the better cities program. I am greatly concerned, however, that not only will funds allocated be wasted but that they will be utilised in a manner that will be destructive to urban communities. I say this because of the repeated mantra from the Deputy Prime Minister, made up of two well-meaning but pernicious fallacies: firstly, that people must live at higher densities to stop urban sprawl; and, secondly, that housing will somehow be more affordable if this is done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Speaking as someone who has been involved in housing and urban affairs for over 30 years and who has run the only successful urban consolidation program in Australia, I want to tell the Deputy Prime Minister that both of his premises are wrong. Residential densities are almost irrelevant to the size of cities, and the cost of housing increases in direct proportion to densities. In the case of Sydney, the urban sprawl cannot be stopped while all levels of government pursue traffic promotion policies such as subsidising car usage, while Sydney Airport continues to expand into the centre of the city, while no attempt is made to slow population growth, and while infrastructure costs of land continue to be subsidised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-One of the matters the Opposition keeps talking about in relation to why we should have a consumption tax is that it will restrict the black economy. Everybody knows there are people out there who take money in cash and never present it, never pay any tax. According to the Opposition, the consumption tax is going to fix that up. In fact, exactly the opposite will occur. Let me give the House an example. Let us say a concreter says to a consumer that he will charge $1,000 to concrete his house. The consumer agrees, but the concreter then says that he will have to add on 15 per cent, 12 1/2 per cent or whatever. All the concreter needs to do is say, `You give me the money in cash and you do not have to pay the consumption tax'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The figures that were released by the Bureau of Statistics today were, I must say, a little better than we had expected. Because of the volatility that has been evident in the figures over the last couple of months, one must be a bit cautious about saying that the worst is over. Nevertheless, one can hardly be other than encouraged by the signs which are evident in these figures, especially as they confirm the indicative data which has come forward from some of the other recent indicators of economic activity, particularly those relating to the labour market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The figures for August showed an increase in employment of 106,000, with 86,500 of those jobs being full time jobs. That is a very encouraging development, because over recent months we have seen that most of the jobs which have come into existence have been of a part time nature. So the development of a strong growth in full time jobs which seems to be coming through in the figures is one about which we are entitled to be encouraged. Figures for both male and female full time employment rose by 35,000 and 51,000 respectively. The unemployment rate remains steady at 9.8 per cent. The number of unemployed rose slightly, by 8,600, to 840,500. We saw a strong growth of 0.8 per cent in the participation rate.</PARA>
<PARA>  I have mentioned the volatility of these figures; therefore, they have to be interpreted with some caution. But I can say that they offer no comfort for the Opposition, because the Opposition has been running around Australia with quite a scandalous campaign, saying that there are, or will be, one million Australians out of work. Opposition members are developing that campaign as if they cannot wait for one million people to be out of work.</PARA>
<PARA>  If we were to pursue the policy prescriptions which Opposition members lay down, the figure would far exceed that of one million Australians out of work. Not only are Opposition members prescribing a contraction of fiscal policy which would further exacerbate the problems of the labour market to the extent of about 50,000, but also we know that the policies which they would apply, if they had the opportunity, would make the employment situation far worse.</PARA>
<PARA>  So it is quite evident that the Budget predictions for employment growth in the near future are supported by the evidence from the ABS. I think it is about time that the Leader of the Opposition went around tearing down those scandalous posters that he has been putting up all over Australia, because he is interested not only in telling lies to the Australian people----</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As I have explained before, the 6.5 per cent year on year is basically because in the past financial year there was virtually no wage increase, and the 2.5 that was awarded would come in onto that figure. In the Budget estimates we are talking about a 4 1/2 per cent aggregate wage outcome. The ACTU is working within a 5 per cent aggregate wage outcome, taking into account the more devolved wages system. The reason why there is not a complete concurrence between the Government and other commentators and forces in the economy on those figures is simply that we are moving to a more devolved wages system, and no-one can tell us exactly what we will get by industry group and productivity bargaining through that process.</PARA></TALK.START>

What do Opposition members really want? Thatcher's smoking ruin? Do they want the American recession? Or do they really want New Zealand's seven quarters of negative growth and massive unemployment?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I address my question to the Treasurer. I refer him to recently released economic data which shows an improvement in retail sales, an improvement in housing starts, an improvement in business and consumer confidence, and an increase in the number of people employed. Is this data consistent with the estimates released in the Budget? What implications does it have for the setting of economic policy by our Government during the coming year?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1251" SPEAKER="Kerin The Hon J.C." NAMEID="QH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WERRIWA" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is good to get an intelligent question. In delivering the Budget, I indicated that the Australian economy would enter a period of growth through 1991-92. I did not promise rapid growth; rather, on behalf of the Government, I emphasised our expectations that the economy would steadily recover through the coming year. The Budget was deliberately set to achieve consistent, steady growth--growth in production, growth in exports and growth in employment. By doing so, we rejected the irrelevant calls to cut $4.7 billion from expenditure by those whose view of the world is framed in toto by a computer screen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We reject the calls of those who urge that the unemployed, those who need income support, those who are sick and those who receive disability or age pensions should carry alone the costs of economic adjustment. The Budget outcome was disciplined to achieve an offset in savings which went to fund new initiatives. In that way, the structural integrity of the Budget was maintained. I refer honourable members to page 6.18 of the Budget Statement No. 6, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>In broad terms, and on a year to year basis, the so-called discretionary component of the budget balance appears to have detracted from the overall outcome in some years during the early 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA>As you would recall, Mr Speaker, the early 1980s were the years when the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Bennelong had responsibility for fiscal policy. The statement goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The effect of the slowing in economic activity on the Commonwealth budget balance in 1990-91 and 1991-92 is clear. Over these two years, the budget balance is estimated to have deteriorated by a total of about $13 billion with the aggregated discretionary effect being only a small element.</PARA>
<PARA>In short, this year's Budget contributes to a sustainable recovery in 1991-92. I have been at pains to caution members of this House and commentators that one month's figures are not a solid base on which to construct economic policy. I have also been at pains to emphasise that, in developing economic policy, accumulated evidence and the overall trend of economic data are more sensible and more relevant indicators.</PARA>
<PARA>  It might therefore be of interest to this House that the prognosis for growth, based on accumulated evidence, confirms the Government's Budget strategy. Over a range of statistics that have become available since the Budget, these are consistent with an economy on the turn and set for recovery in 1991-92. These include the growth in employment, an improvement in the Department of Employment, Education and Training skill vacancy and ANZ job vacancy series, an improvement in housing activity, an improvement in retail trade, a consolidation of motor vehicle registrations and an increase in the leading Westpac Melbourne index.</PARA>
<PARA>  I repeat that we expect to see a steady and sustainable increase in economic activity through the year 1991-92. The accumulated evidence at this stage tends to confirm our expectations. Of course, that is welcome news to all Australians.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We have to be quite precise, and everyone agrees that we need a more flexible wages system in order to build a more competitive economy. The real issue is how to create a less prescriptive wages system which enables parties to negotiate on the kinds of agreements and changes that best suit particular needs, but which also achieve equitable outcomes for all workers and within satisfactory aggregate wage outcomes. On that score, I must point out that there are dramatic differences between the approach of the Government and the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Opposition is essentially advocating a free-for-all with no concern for equity, and will rely on high levels of unemployment to keep a cap on aggregate wage outcomes. On the other hand, the accord partners will ensure aggregate wage outcomes, consistent with holding inflation in line with our trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA>  Unlike the Opposition, the Government considers that unions and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission play a continuing and vital role in our wages system. The guidelines to govern workplace bargaining, supported by the Government in our submission on the review of the wage fixing principles, provide that any workplace agreement reached must be fair to all relevant employees and that national conditions of employment should form a minimum basis for each agreement. Unlike the Opposition, this Government considers that equity in the wages system is very important.</PARA>
<PARA>  If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wants more detail or does not want me to read precisely what I have just read out, I suggest that he refer to the publicly available Government submission to the AIRC on wage fixing principles.</PARA>

I ask you, Mr Speaker, and I ask honourable members of this House: are there many institutions more fundamentally important than the Reserve Bank? This gentleman, on this point of such massive and monumental irrelevance--this tape--says we are undermining important institutions in this country; yet he attacked, without cause, or reason of any sort, the Reserve Bank Governor.</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1256" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for Fraser for his rephrased question. It is the case that under this Government the size of the public sector has been significantly reduced through various processes to ensure a more efficient and better targeted array of government programs. When we came into office, government outlays as a proportion of GDP were about 29 per cent. They were reduced to 23 1/2 per cent by 1989-90 and, with the recession, they have come back to over 25 per cent. Given that the structural integrity of the Budget has been retained, as we have economic recovery we will go back to the 23 per cent level as shown by the Forward Estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Despite this reduction, the Opposition still continues to call for further reductions in the size of the public sector. It is a continuing refrain from honourable members opposite, despite the fact that our public sector is now one of the lowest in the OECD. This policy of introducing a consumption tax, which is also part of the Opposition's policy, will have the reverse effect on the public sector to that which it proclaims is its objective, because a consumption tax will increase the size of the public sector. That is due to the need to provide a substantial compensation package for social security recipients who would not benefit from any reductions in income tax.</PARA>
<PARA>  This compensation package obviously must involve increased pensions and benefits, that is, increased government outlays. That means we will have a higher level of government expenditure. With a tax of 15 per cent we can expect that compensation package to be in the broad order of about $3 billion. That is based on material prepared for the Tax Summit. Three billion dollars of additional government expenditure represents about three-quarters of a per cent of GDP, and it would be a significant increase in the size of the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA>  There would also be further increases through the fact that the administration costs of a consumption tax, as a percentage of revenue raised, are about double those of the wholesale sales tax. On the tax side of the Budget, we would find that taxes would be a higher proportion of GDP than they would be without a consumption tax because we would need to retain that higher tax revenue to pay the additional pensions and benefits. So both outlays and tax will be higher as a proportion of GDP as a result of the consumption tax, if that is introduced.</PARA>
<PARA>  The question asked also about the effect on people. I must say that the Australian public must be extraordinarily confused about an Opposition which advocates a smaller public sector on the one hand and then proposes policies to increase it on the other; that is just a further reason for the Australian public to oppose this tax. It is a reason, of course, which just adds to the many other reasons that have been portrayed by the Government in recent times.</PARA>
<PARA>  But the Opposition itself is aware of the fact that this is a very unpopular proposal and it is having great trouble in getting people attracted to it. To try to make it more attractive, the Opposition has taken to producing pamphlets to help the Liberal Party supporters and members to try to `win the war', as it says. Senator Vanstone produced a little red book called A War of Words is Raging on the Air Waves about the GST. We Have to Win It. It is complete with a picture of a tank. I quote from a couple of excerpts from this amazing pamphlet. The first page, equipped with an armed soldier, says:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The scheme provides for the costs of petroleum product excise to be rebated by registered producers in agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining and certain welfare organisations. The 1991-92 rebates to producers and welfare organisations will total about $918m. The breakdown is $477m for agriculture, $425m for mining and $17m for welfare organisations. In 1982-83 the value of the rebates was about $71m. During the life of this Government this rebate has increased by something like 1,200 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government is well aware that the costs of petroleum and diesel fuel are an important concern to producers in rural and regional Australia and to those Australians living in non-urban areas.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for Calwell for his question. It is an important one because it goes to the question of Federal-State financial relations, and it goes to issues of policy in terms of the links between health care and aged care and the way that we deal with a number of problems that exist in Federal-State relations as they go to the areas of health and related policies. For example, the question of cost shifting for pharmaceuticals between the Commonwealth and the States was dealt with as part of a proposal to look at funding for a number of national programs. So in the case of pharma- ceuticals and pharmaceutical services, they would be dealt with in a single program in-volving the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, the public hospitals and community pharmacies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Secondly, areas of primary care are important, as is the coordination between different aspects of primary care, including general practice, community health services, palliative care, post-acute care and community based services, as well as some of the primary medical care services provided in public hospitals. By bringing those programs together into a single national program we are able to build a degree of coordination.</PARA>
<PARA>  Thirdly, for example, in the area of long term care for the aged, the conference agreed on a program that would mean the resources of Commonwealth, State and local governments again could be coordinated to ensure that policies could be carried through in a way that made the best use of the available resources.</PARA>
<PARA>  Obviously there needs to be a point of integration, and one of the most significant decisions from the conference is that we will build on the approach that has been developed by some States in terms of area health boards or points of administration at the area level which would lead to coordination, including coordination in funding, particularly through area based population funding formulae. So the possibilities of using resources in the health care field, by pooling national resources, by looking at the way programs might improve coordination, could decrease the level of cost shifting that occurs between the Commonwealth and the States and deliver better primary health care to individuals.</PARA>
<PARA>  This conference--a successful conference, the outcome of which will lead to successful reform supported by both the Commonwealth and the States--contrasts with the approach by the Opposition. I refer to this example because it is a very clear example of where the Government is seeking to develop policy and to have a process which is opaque so that people can see what the options are and where there has been community consultation, as opposed to the Opposition which floats proposals from time to time that lack any follow-up, any real content.</PARA>
<PARA>  For example, the Leader of the Opposition, in an address to the Australian Institute of Political Science in February this year, wanted to put the focus upon the individual. In that particular address he suggested that rather than payments being made, for example, to the States, they might be made to individuals, perhaps in the form of an access card or voucher, as the Americans have called it. The access card could then in turn be used by the individual to buy services from State governments or from private sector providers. In other words, he floated the idea of a health voucher, a kind of Amex that people would be able to use to go and directly buy those services.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Mr Speaker, you will be aware that the Opposition has always argued that sanctions have not worked. Those opposite have been in this rather precious position where they have piously expressed and declared their opposition to apartheid, but they have rejected the very best instrument available to the international community to do something about removing that obscene system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Now we have the most direct unequivocal statement out of the mouth of a responsible Minister of the Government of South Africa as to the impact of sanctions and just how effective they have been. The South African Minister of Justice spelt it out unequivocally to the National Party in the Orange Free State. The Justice Minister of the South African Government did not mince words. I give you some of his remarks:</PARA>
<PARA>Less than two years ago the Republic was in an economic and political cul de sac. Our agricultural products were marketed abroad under false names. Our landing and overflight rights were severely limited. Stagnation was staring us in the eye. Abroad we were accepted by no one. The National Party leadership sat down and said enough is enough. We are going to take the lead to bring about a new South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA>Could the effect of sanctions in reversing that abominable situation in South Africa be put any more clearly or any more directly? He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We have been convinced that the CAAA [the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act] must be repealed so that the South African Government could again have access to the facilities of the IMF and we have decided that the necessary steps will be taken. Two of these steps were amendments to our security legislation. . . [and]. . . release of so-called political prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA>These remarkable, direct and unequivocal statements by the South African Minister of Justice show four things:  firstly, that the international sanctions regime was critical in initiating a process of reform in South Africa which started under President de Klerk nearly two years ago;  secondly, that sanctions have remained important in keeping pressure on the South African Government to implement specific reforms;  thirdly, that our policy of phased lifting of sanctions in response to achievement of reforms is therefore correct;  and, fourthly, that the Leader of the Opposition has been as wrong about this issue as he has been about almost everything else he has touched on foreign affairs.</PARA>
<PARA>  He will remember his words--although he would like to forget them--of only three months ago. These were the words of the Leader of the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA>They have messed things up. They did not do any good by their sanctions policy all the way through.</PARA>
<PARA>If the Leader of the Opposition had the beginnings of decency he would stand up in this House and apologise. He got it wrong;  it was the Leader of the Opposition who got it wrong all the way through. I say this for his shadow spokesman:  at least he had a semblance of decency--which is totally absent in the Leader of the Opposition--because on 11 July he said, `I think sanctions have helped'. Why does the Leader of the Opposition not have the decency to acknowledge that he was wrong? Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</PARA>

The honourable member for North Sydney is allocated the call among those non-Government members who sit on my left. When he and other non-Government members rise, he will get the call if he catches my eye. The honourable member for O'Connor has drawn my attention to the fact that we should have some parity in this. Obviously, many commentators suggest that this Parliament is often dominated by the executive on both sides. I would think that, if more backbenchers on both sides rise, it may be a burden on me to give them more of a go than the front benchers on the non-Government side. The honourable member for Pearce had had about four questions, I think, in a row that day.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- By far the most important political event today has been the release by the Australian Bureau of Statistics of the latest survey of the Australian labour force. I am very happy to say, on behalf of the Opposition, that we welcome the fact that, according to that survey, the number of employed people in Australia rose by 106,000 during the month of August. On that point I would like to say immediately in my remarks that everyone on this side of the House repudiates with all the force that we can command the absolutely disgraceful and despicable insinuation by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in Question Time that the Opposition gets joy out of bad economic news for ordinary Australians. We on this side of the House reject his craven posturing of a monopoly on compassion for the unfortunate in the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We on this side of the House remind the Prime Minister of what care he had for the unemployed of the Australian community late in 1982 when the former Fraser Government was putting forward a wage pause proposal in order to save the jobs of fellow Australians of the then Opposition spokesman for industrial relations. He went to no end of trouble with his trade union mates to trip up the then Leader of the Opposition and to prevent support being given for the Fraser Government's initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>  In other words, the preoccupation of the present Prime Minister of Australia, back in 1982, eight or nine years ago, was not the job prospects of 90 per cent of his fellow countrymen who had jobs, but the job prospects of he, himself, so far as the leadership of the Australian Labor Party was concerned. I am not surprised that the Prime Minister would come into the House today and carry on with some degree of ebullience and excitement about the fact that the employment figures were better than some people had predicted, but I find absolutely despicable the allegation of the Prime Minister that in some way we derive comfort and joy from the suffering of our fellow countrymen and women. If we are ever to have a rational debate about a long term employment strategy in this country, the first thing we ought to understand is a ground rule for that debate--I have made this point before in similar debates on employment--that is, no side of politics in this country has a monopoly on compassion or concern for the less fortunate in our community. </PARA>
<PARA>  The next thing that we ought to understand is that, if we are honest about it, neither party over the last 20 years in this country has really developed a long term employment strategy. There is a very simple reason for that; that is, unemployment was not a major economic and social problem in this country until the early 1970s. Anybody who has studied the structure of the Australian labour market will know that until the early 1970s we had a phenomenally low level of unemployment in this country. It went to 1 1/2 per cent in the lead-up to the 1972 election and people were saying, `How shocking, how horrible'. We know that never in the lifetime of anybody in this Parliament--in the chamber or in the gallery--is unemployment ever likely to go back to that kind of level. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), who is at the table, can get up, as undoubtedly he will, or he will be tempted to, and talk about the 10.4 per cent unemployment early in 1983. He can talk about the record of the Fraser Government, he can talk about my record as Treasurer in that Government--he can carry on as much as he likes. I can pre-empt that by reading a very interesting statement that was reported to have been made by the present Prime Minister back in 1974 when he led the ACTU. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . warned there could be 200,000 unemployed before the end of the year if there was a tough Budget. He said he would rather see a new election than have Labor cause mass unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>We can all dredge back into the past and score a few political points. I say to the Minister at the table that the only thing that really matters to the 9.8 per cent, the almost one million Australians who are still out of work--the 17 per cent, when we add in the underemployed to the unemployed----</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-They are sick and tired of that kind of argument. They are sick and tired of the sort of self-righteous abuse that the Prime Minister indulged in at Question Time today, parading himself as the only person in this country who has ever shed a tear, metaphorical or otherwise, for somebody who has been out of work. The fact of the matter is that they are now asking both sides of politics to tell the employment situation as it is and to tell the Australian people why the Government thinks it can do a better job in regard to maintaining high levels of employment into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), my colleague the shadow Treasurer (Mr Reith) and I have said all along that we do not claim that if there is a change of government tomorrow the unemployment level would be cut in half. We know, and the Government ought to know, that the nature of the labour market in Australia is such that, over the last 20 years, when there is a rise in unemployment it never really goes back to the pre-rise level--there is a ratcheting effect. It took seven or eight years after the 1982 recession to get the levels down to anything approaching what they were in 1981, and they still did not reach that level. That pattern will be repeated on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA>  I know that the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) is very concerned about unemployment--anybody who represents Whyalla in this Parliament would have to be concerned about it. Many of my colleagues, such as the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), who represents the Gold Coast area of Australia, where there is massive youth unemployment, are very concerned about unemployment. I say to all those who are concerned about it that the only way that this country can ever build secure employment and maintain high employment levels is to ensure that every aspect of our economy is functioning in the most effective, the most efficient, the most competitive and the most productive manner possible. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no such thing as an enduring job creation scheme. We can have labour market programs which increase the competitiveness of the unemployed for the jobs which are available; we can have a system of benefits which rewards the needy and weeds out those who do not need support; and we can have an educational system that injects into the community people who have basic skills of literacy and communication and interpersonal skills. But in the long run the only way we can create jobs in this community which will last is through sustainable growth in the private sector of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reason the Prime Minister and the Minister at the table get up in this Parliament and boast about the hundreds of thousands of jobs that were created in the 1980s is that job creation was not sustainable. It was built upon the back of an unacceptable and unsustainable expansion in this nation's foreign debt. I say to those opposite that, if they had not heeded the economy as much as they did in the 1980s, if they had not gone into debt as much as we did at their behest in the 1980s, if perhaps they had a slower rate of employment growth, the Australian economy would not be as deeply recessed as it is and the level of unemployment would not be as high as it is. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Parliament should be directing itself towards--the Australian people want it to direct itself towards--an examination of why the Opposition and the Government believe that over the next five or 10 years, if we have the opportunity, we can do a better job about building a secure employment base in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are four or five things which mark out the two sides of politics at present. I believe that therein lies the real debate about employment. Pride of place must be given to changes in Australia's industrial relations system. I am in favour of what the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) called a completely deregulated labour market, not because I want to destroy trade unions--I have no argument with mainstream trade unions--but because I have every argument with putting unions above the law. </PARA>
<PARA>  I say to the Government that we will fight every inch of the way to prevent the resurrection of the legal privileges that unions in this country once had above other citizens. We have no desire to destroy trade unions. Many trade unions in Australia now recognise that the world is a very different place from what it was in the 1970s and 1980s. The union that negotiated the deal with ICI at Port Botany, the SDA union in New South Wales which is now negotiating a trail-blazing deal with the Pizza Hut company--unions of that kind-- recognise that they have to change if they are to survive. </PARA>
<PARA>  The ACTU Congress ought to understand that its great challenge in the 1990s is not knocking over the next coalition government. It will not be able to do that. Its great challenge in the 1990s is to preserve its legitimacy as the representative of not even a majority but a substantial number of Australian workers. The reason we support a free labour market is not that we have some primeval hatred of trade unionism. The reason I support workplace bargaining is that, given the sorts of industries which are likely to generate jobs in this country, I believe those industries will need an industrial relations system which is focused on the workplace and not upon the large, nationally operated and nationally organised unions. </PARA>
<PARA>  We will never have the prospects that we have over the next 10 years of further building our tourism industry unless we are able to develop in this country an industrial relations culture that is built on workplace bargaining. Unless we are able to build an industrial relations system that encourages each individual employer and his or her employees to make arrangements that are suitable uniquely to the operation of their enterprises, we will never harvest the job opportunities that exist and will exist in those industries. The building of employment levels in Australia over the next 10 years will not be found by trying to resurrect industries that have become uncompetitive. They will be found by generating new industries in Australia; they will be found by an industrial relations system that makes us sufficiently competitive and sufficiently productive that we can not only survive better against import penetration but, in all areas of the economy, we can expand our export performance. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is why we on this side of the House want a different industrial relations system. Every time the Treasurer and others launch into an attack on us and they say it is all about our hatred of trade unions, they really miss the point. It is not about a hatred of trade unions; it is about a fundamental belief that the only way to lift the productivity of this nation is to encourage workplace productivity, and that will not be achieved unless a sense of common purpose is injected into every workplace and every enterprise between employers and employees. That requires a fundamental change in the industrial relations mentality of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are in favour of reforming Australia's taxation system, not because of any sort of blind ideological commitment towards a different taxation order but because we think the present taxation system is inefficient and rotten to the core. We are against the present taxation system because it unfairly penalises many Australian industries. Through lower personal tax we want to provide people with a greater incentive to work hard. We want to provide a taxation system that forces those who cheat and bludge at the present time to make their fair contribution. Again, the driving force is not some kind of blind ideological commitment, but a belief that, if there is a better taxation system, people will be encouraged to work harder, there will be a more competitive and more productive economy and there will be more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  If time permitted I could go on through all the other areas of economic reform, but I have mentioned industrial relations and taxation because they take pride of place. In conclusion, I say to the Minister at the table, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, that this debate is not about the point scoring of the last 10 years;  this debate is about which side of politics offers hope to build employment over the next 10 years. The Minister ought to direct his mind to that. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Once again, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) beseeches me and the Government to approach this question with a kind of dispassion and a kind of failure to appeal to cheap political points. I am quite happy to do that, but during his remarks he was unable to resist doing precisely that. He can never resist the temptation to pontificate. He can never resist the temptation to try to ascribe motives to others. For the first five minutes of his speech he tried to anticipate what I was going to say. In other words, he was engaging in the exercise of creating a straw man, which he then tried to knock down by trying to anticipate what I was going to say. I was going to say none of that. I am perfectly happy to meet him here or anywhere else in a fair-minded debate about unemployment and longer term employment strategies, because I am not trying to say that he or other members of the Opposition really have it in for the unemployed person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  However, I do have to remind the honourable member for Bennelong that it is his Party that is going around Australia erecting billboards on this question of unemployment. It is he and his Party who are actually trying to make a political issue out of the circumstances of the unemployed. They are not putting up billboards that say, `Give us a long term employment strategy' or that give us the five points he said he wanted to talk about, when in fact he did not get beyond two. He said that there were five points which separated the Government from the Opposition, but he got only as far as industrial relations and taxation, to which I will come in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Bennelong really has to take account of what it is the Opposition is doing--what the Liberal Party is doing--in relation to this matter. He again repeated the figure of one million unemployed. Of course, there are not one million unemployed. I am not trying to say that I am happy with the fact that there are 840,000 unemployed; but 840,000 is not one million. The honourable member knows that. He talks about the hidden unemployed. There have always been hidden unemployed. There were hidden unemployed when he was in office, and there will always be hidden unemployed. We are trying to measure like with like. In the last decade we have always used the ABS survey, which is the agreed measure of what the unemployment level is. It is not one million, as the Liberal Party says, but rather 840,000. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wish to make another point about the holier-than-thou approach of the honourable member for Bennelong. We are not the ones who are going around saying that the unemployed should be penalised after nine months by being taken off the dole in a way that would save $750m. The honourable member for Bennelong knows very well that one cannot have a policy that saves $750m unless one actually denies those payments to people. He knows that means that 90,000 recipients-- probably 200,000 family members--would suffer as a result of that policy. Also, he should recognise that it is his Party, not the Government, that wants to massively reduce labour market programs which have a special focus on trying to help the long term unemployed get back into work. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us start this debate on the basis of where the Opposition stands in relation to this matter. As to the honourable member's comments in relation to a long term employment strategy, I cannot cavil with much of what he had to say. Any employment growth must be built on sustainable jobs in the real economy, whether it be in the private or the public sector and--as I have said many times --increasingly the jobs which need to be created in this country must deal with two issues simultaneously: firstly, the current level of unemployment and, secondly, the state of the current account deficit. In other words, we must build jobs which make a contribution towards reducing the size of the current account deficit and the size of our foreign indebtedness. Therefore, there have to be jobs which are overwhelmingly in the traded goods and services sector. This Government has been trying to create the circumstances in which that might occur. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member does not want me to remind him of his past, and I will not do so. However, I will say that only this Government has tackled the essential question of protection and the essential question of opening up this economy to international competition. I would prefer to respond to his comments if he were able to make a few in acknowledgment of what it is this Government has done, particularly in areas which he knows--and has known for more than a decade--required attention. He knows that it was only this Government which was prepared to take on the issue of tariffs and subsidies to various sections of the economy and to make the fundamental point that, if we are going to have sustainable jobs in Australia, they will be jobs in industries that do not require a massive amount of propping up through barrier protection, tax concessions or direct subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is the point that we made in the March statement. That is why the March statement was such an historic document in the sense that it essentially ended the debate about tariffs and has therefore opened up a new debate about what kinds of industrial circumstances we want to see develop in Australia as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA>  The major difference between him and me, between the Opposition and the Government, is that he and his colleagues believe that governments need do nothing about creating that new industrial fabric, that new employment framework, which will lead to sustainable jobs. Frankly, I find it a little amusing that the only two points to which the honourable member can refer are industrial relations and taxation. When he mentioned industrial relations not once did he mention the question of management. If he were prepared to be fair dinkum about this issue, as I am prepared to be fair dinkum about it, he would at least make the acknowledgment that management has a lot to answer for in terms of our industrial response and our industrial behaviour at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the reasons why our industrial relations system has been so rotten and so polarised between management and the unions is not all the fault of the unions; it is very much due to the fact that management has not had a contemporary and modern approach to these questions. He refers to ICI, and well he might, but the reason why we had a transformation of attitudes at ICI is that we had a transformation of not only management attitudes but also union attitudes. The unions involved were some of the same unions which this honourable member has been prepared to berate ceaselessly over the years. They were the metal unions--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Well, they are one of the groups the honourable member missed out. But if we are going to be sensible about this, I think we have to recognise that unions and management had a lot to learn in the 1980s. They both had a lot of responsibility for what happened with the wages explosion in the very early 1980s; and, of course, the honourable member cannot entirely avoid some of the responsibility for that. But I think it is a bit unfair to say that the unions--including at their current congress in Melbourne--have not transformed themselves in their attitude to industrial relations and wages policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  One of the reasons why we are not in a worse situation than we otherwise might have been, one of the great saving graces, is that during the period of strong growth, which the honourable member rightly says was a period of growth which was too strong and, indeed, unsustainable, is that we did not at the same time have a wages explosion, as we have had in every other period of strong growth. The fact that we were able to have a period of wage restraint notwithstanding a period of strong economic growth has meant that we now have arrived at a position where we have a low level of inflation and prospects of very low wage outcomes in the next couple of years, which together do constitute an amazing transformation of the prospects for the Australian economy as we look forward to a period of recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not want to go into the question of taxation. Many points can be made on that issue, and no doubt they will be; but I want to take up a point made by the honourable member when he referred to the record level of youth unemployment. It is all very well to refer to percentage rates of unemployment of young people, but I think he ought to be aware--if he is not aware--that if we compare teenage unemployment now with 1983, we find that in 1983 there were 157,000 unemployed and now there are 118,000. In other words, about 40,000 fewer young people, teenagers, are out of work now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am referring to April 1983 and July 1991. I am not trying to make any particular point about this, other than to say that the major reason for this is that we now have a much higher level of participation in the education and training system. That, in itself, is a good thing, because one of the great weaknesses of the Australian labour market and the Australian education and training system has been the number of young people who have left school early and have totally abandoned the education and training system for life. When we compare ourselves with some of the successful European economies, such as Germany, we find that the great difference between us and them is that they have a strategic approach to vocational education, whereas we in Australia have been rather obsessed with higher education only, and we have not given nearly enough attention to those 75 per cent of kids who leave school, never intending to go to a university.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That is why in the remaining moments that I have to speak I want to refer to the work of the committee chaired by Brian Finn, because I think it has identified that there are something like 430,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 19 who leave school never to return or to have anything to do with the education and training system again. Frankly, this is a tragedy for them and for us. Whilst 96 per cent of 15-year-olds are in education, by the age of 19 only 40 per cent of them are. Brian Finn has put together a strategy which will help us, in conjunction with the States, to achieve what we hope will be a participation rate in education or training of something like 95 per cent of 19-year-olds by the year 2001. </PARA>
<PARA>  In paying tribute to Brian Finn, I also want to pay tribute to the States, who have taken up these proposals with a certain amount of alacrity, and to another member of that committee, a man who is retiring from a long and colourful career in the trade union movement--Laurie Carmichael. He has had an enormous influence on the way in which the trade union movement now approaches skill development in Australia. If it were not for the work he has done, in the context of not only the trade unions but also employers in industry, I do not think we would have been able to achieve many of the important reforms and the increased levels of participation, nor would we have been able to achieve the high degree of consensus around issues such as this Finn committee report.</PARA>
<PARA>  I say to the honourable member for Bennelong that a number of people in the trade union movement deserve congratulations and tributes not only from me but also from him and his Party, because of the sea change which has occurred as a result of the work of people such as Laurie Carmichael. There is also a high degree of unanimity between industry and the unions on this question. It is for that reason that I am delighted that Peter Laver, a senior executive of BHP, has taken up the chairmanship of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, and that Laurie Carmichael has taken up the chair of the Employment and Skills Formation Council. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the areas of skills and training, I think we now have a coherent policy which along with the States we can further develop, which will improve the employment prospects of young people and also improve the prospects of getting back into a job for those who, unfortunately, are out of a job at the moment--a job which, I agree with the honourable member for Bennelong, is likely to be a very different job from the one that they lost.

One point I want to raise about this committee, as a Queensland member of this House, is that again Queensland has been ignored. This committee does not have any Queensland representation, just as the Cabinet has no Queensland representation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Last Saturday, I sponsored in my electorate an open youth forum at Maroochydore to launch Youth Week 1991. The purpose of the forum was to give young Australians in my electorate the opportunity to have their say and have their voices heard by their elected representatives--State, Federal and local. Of all the problems that were raised that day, the fundamental, underlying problem was unemployment. There was no problem raised that was not related to unemployment. I was surprised at the vehemence of the scorn of those young people for this Government. It confirmed for me the rising tide of urgency that I can feel in the community. I have seen it in other sections of the community as well. There is a need for a change of direction--an urgent need. There is a need for a change of government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The chief target of scorn of these young people was the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his now infamous statement that no child would live in poverty by the year 1990. These jobless, disadvantaged kids described the life that they are forced to lead--one of homelessness and unemployment, with the promise of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) that things will get worse. They described their lot and the food they eat--the endless meals of rice and sausages. Honourable members might laugh at that, but that is their staple diet, if they are lucky. </PARA>
<PARA>  They spoke of their despair, their disenchantment and their hopelessness. They ridiculed and scorned the system of forced training by CES, with no job at the end of that training. They spoke about their living standards and said that they are forced to sleep and squat in derelict houses. They said to me, `If this is not poverty, what is it?'. </PARA>
<PARA>  These kids did not speak about the future. This matter of public importance is about the future, but these kids do not look to the future because they are too busy trying to make it through each day. The future under this Government offers no change, no relief, and no hope for them. Reflecting on the work of this Parliament, they said, `All politicians do is yell and scream at each other in Parliament while the rest of Australia suffers and our plight is ignored'. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) foreshadowed that the response by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) to this topic of debate would be to talk about what happened 10 years ago. Does the Minister know how old those kids were 10 years ago? They do not remember what happened 10 years ago; they only know what is happening now. </PARA>
<PARA>  During Question Time, we heard attempts to open the eyes of the Prime Minister and his front bench to the devastation of unemployment on individuals, families and young people by citing individual experiences of their unemployed constituents. Recently, the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) spoke about a constituent named Ray. Did honourable members opposite see a faint glimmer of compassion from the Prime Minister? There was not a single sign. Instead, we got a tirade of abuse. The problems of that person were ignored. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wonder whether the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), has changed his attitude towards the new poor, as I call them--the unemployed. The honourable member for Blaxland has not uttered one word in this place since his inglorious exit from Treasury. With his new found spare time, I wonder whether he has had the opportunity to visit his electorate. If he has, has he found time to talk to his unemployed constituents about the effects of his policies and what this Government has done to families?</PARA>
<PARA>  As I said earlier, what an indictment on the Labor Party that its Cabinet could become so out of touch that the headline in the Courier-Mail, as I said earlier, read: `Caucus Muscle Forces Action On Jobs'. I think members of the Labor Party should hang their heads in shame. The article went on to state that Caucus had decided to appoint a seven-member committee to urgently examine regional unemployment problems. After nine years in office, members of the Australian Labor Party need a back bench committee of Caucus members to advise Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA>  Queensland is the most decentralised State in Australia, with problems totally different from those of other States. These unique problems are reflected in unemployment statistics and trends. While unemployment is approaching 10 per cent across the nation-- and the honourable member for Bennelong said `approaching' one million; he did not say that it was one million--in my electorate unemployment is closer to 20 per cent, which is almost double the national level. In Australia, youth unemployment is 29 per cent, but in my electorate it is around 50 per cent. The people of my electorate and the people of Australia have simply had enough. The short term convenience strategy of this Government has failed. The balloon cannot take any more bandaids. The young unemployed people and the families with no breadwinner want change. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister for Employment, Education and Training accused the Opposition of attempting to ride into office on the back of the misery of the unemployed. Mr Deputy Speaker, I assure you--as did my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong--that nobody on the Opposition side of the House gets any joy from the misery that this Government has heaped on the unemployed, the new poor. We are the ones who have to face these people every day in our electorates while the Prime Minister sits in comfort in Canberra. We welcome any good economic news that provides any hope--any hope at all--for the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government should heed a warning. The role of the Opposition is to warn the Government on issues such as this. This Government had a recession to fix a problem, the current account deficit. The Minister at the table earlier admitted that the current account deficit was the main target of the recession. This Government raised interest rates and sent individuals and small businesses broke. The Government, and nobody else, caused Australia's massive unemployment problem. Now it is lowering interest rates to get us out of the recession. However, honourable members opposite should remember that the problem of the current account deficit and the growing foreign debt will remain. These problems will remain until the Government finally bites the bullet and acknowledges the need for Australia to develop a long term employment strategy.  The Leader of the Opposition--backed by the entire Opposition--sincerely offered the Government bipartisan support to carry out the reforms necessary to restore Australia's rightful place as a nation of high living standards. As the honourable member for Bennelong said, that can be achieved only if we work towards a competitive Australia, which is a long term strategy. The honourable member for Bennelong outlined two specific areas that need to be addressed by this Government: industrial relations and taxation reform. The bipartisan approach adopted by the Opposition is intended to support the Government if it is prepared to bite the bullet. We do not want to wait 18 months until we are in government, because the misery of people who are unemployed will continue. We want some action from this Government, and we want it now. </PARA>

However, I do not accept the argument advanced by the honourable member for Bennelong when he claims to speak for all members of the Liberal Party because I believe there is an element within the Opposition that gets joy out of the bad news. I think that was reflected very clearly in the speech made by the honourable member who preceded me in this debate, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This Government is determined to maximise the job prospects for Australians as this country emerges from the recession. No long term victory can be claimed by the Government over the problems that befell this country in the late 1970s until the employment growth created by this Government, which has resulted in 1.6 million new jobs or a net of 1.3 million new jobs, undergoes a resurgence. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is determined to put a new optimism into industry in Australia; we are determined to create the conditions under which industry in Australia can prosper; and we are determined to provide the training for the people in Australia which will result in a work force that matches those growing industries. We are emerging from this recession as a vastly different country from the one that emerged from the Liberal Party recession of the early 1980s. We do not have the double digit inflation that the last Liberal Government enforced on this country, but we have a historically low inflation level now. We do not have the wages explosion created by the Liberal Government, which was unable to deal with the workers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are emerging from this recession led by the manufacturing industry for the first time. We are emerging from this recession without much of the great weight of the tariff protection and subsidy policy created by the Liberal-National Party over a couple of decades to the great cost of all Australians. It will be largely as a result of those policy changes that we have put in place--changes, I might add, that the Opposition would never have had the gumption to put in place--that in the long term the job prospects of all Australians will be enhanced. It is one thing in opposition to say that things should happen; it is quite another to do it when one is going to offend some friends. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is, of course, apparent that there are industries that are going to have difficulty in adapting to the ideal that Australian industry has to compete with the best that the world can do. I think that the honourable member for Bennelong recognises that there may well be structural reasons why some Australian industries are in a difficult position because of those tariff and subsidy changes. But there are others led by people of vision who have faith in Australia and the ability of their fellow Australians that will prosper, and those industries that compete in price and quality with world products will be the backbone of Australia in the future. Industry now needs the best encouragement that this Government can give it--encouragement that will make those leaders in those industries think of expanding, and expanding not only into local markets, as happened in the past, but also into world markets. The challenge is there for those industries and the Government is determined to foster the conditions that will encourage them. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even in my electorate, there are moves along these lines. The port of Yamba, which only a few years ago really did no business, is now being used to export goods, much of it local goods, to the Pacific and Asia. But, of course, there are two components of any credible and achievable employment strategy. The first is the transition from an obsolete ramshackle economy, such as the one that this Government inherited, to an economy that is structurally sound and competitive in world terms. I have touched on that in my previous remarks. The second, and necessary, component is the provision of support to those who do become unemployed. That means providing a safety net with income support and structural support in the form of education, training, retraining and counselling to enable the unemployed to meet their own personal challenge of transition and to provide a work force that can match any growth in industry. There need to be constructive measures to assist the unemployed back into the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Fairfax criticised this approach, and the Opposition policy on this would be--if we assume that there is going to be, as it implies, a $3 billion cut in services--that many of the services we offer in this respect would be cut. So, even with the sorts of things the honourable member for Fairfax spoke about--of kids out of work, unemployed, of sleeping and squatting--he and his Party would cut many of the programs that assist those kids. </PARA>
<PARA>  As has become patently obvious in debate in the House in the past week, the Opposition would effectively withdraw that safety net for tens of thousands of unemployed by throwing them off unemployment benefits after nine months. It would also drastically slash funding on structural support measures, leaving the unemployed to their own devices. It is a recipe for social devastation and for division, for despair and hopelessness. </PARA>
<PARA>  The recent Budget builds on initiatives flagged in the March economic statement: a 50 per cent increase in funding for low labour market programs, with a total Budget increase from $400m to $600m; and boosting those assisted by $60,000 to $260,000. This is in contrast, as I said before, to Opposition policy that would slash spending in this area alone by $200m. As it has been for the past 50 years, it is wrong on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA>  If by some mischance the Opposition were ever to fall into government, it would be the people of Australia, of course, who would be the victims of its social and economic irresponsibility. One of the programs that would be put at risk is the 10,000 new training places that have been created in TAFE at a cost of $40m. A significant slice of these funds will go into Newstart to help those most at risk and hardest to assist, although some of them would be the people honourable members opposite are talking about. Another program that would be put at risk is the $38m expansion project for existing training and wage subsidy programs--that is, Jobtrain and Jobstart. There are many other programs that would be put at risk by the sort of budget policies that the Opposition says it would bring in. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Bennelong mentions taxation systems and how they can assist the long term unemployed. Of course, they cannot be considered without also considering the consumption tax policy of the Opposition. I have been a businessman most of my life in a number of businesses. One thing that the Opposition keeps saying is that prices are going to increase by the rate of the tax, so that if the tax were 15 per cent, the price would increase by 15 per cent. There is absolutely no truth in that. Business inputs will increase in price. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us take a business which has the costs of accountancy, bookkeeping, fuel, electricity, telephone, postage, transport and freight. All of those business inputs are going to increase, and as a result the price has to go up. The cost of the goods that that business buys and sells will also increase, because the businesses that it buys those goods from will have increases in the costs of their inputs as a result of the consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  The businessman will still want to make his margin. If he owns a newsagency, he is not going to want to drop from about a 30 per cent gross profit margin to less. He is not going to suddenly increase his sales; they will stay at about the same level, which means that his volume will decrease. He will want to make the same profit on those sales as he did before, and the 15 per cent tax will appear as a cost on the business. </PARA>
<PARA>  The end result of a 15 per cent tax--and I have done calculations for a newsagency-- will be that prices will increase not by 15 per cent, but by something of the order of 30 per cent. That will make the price of the Sydney Morning Herald nearly $1. The same tax will make a loaf of bread cost $1.70 and a middy over $2. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA>  The year has been an extremely busy one for the Committee. It conducted seven inquiries, tabled five reports and, together with its four sectional committees, met 111 times for a total of 285 hours. The Commit-tee's reports have dealt with several diverse issues, which include an investigation of the Parliamentary Information Systems Office, a review of annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities and an examination of Australia's business migration program. </PARA>
<PARA>  Each of these reports has been a catalyst for change. I note in particular the report on the business migration program. Only one month after tabling, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) announced the Government's acceptance of the Committee's recommendations-- effectively dismantling the business migration program. It is fair to say that few reports of parliamentary committees receive such prompt attention and lead to such dramatic change. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee's activities are not limited to the conduct of inquiries, of course. The Public Service Act requires the Committee to approve the guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports and this year the Committee reviewed a revised set of guidelines prepared by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The guidelines had been revised in response to the findings and recommendations contained in the Committee's 304th report entitled Guidelines for departmental annual reports, tabled in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee approved the annual report guidelines subject to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) agreeing to certain changes to them. One important change was that the House of Representatives standing committees be assigned the ongoing role of reviewing the operations of Commonwealth departments based on the departmental annual reports tabled in the Parliament. I am happy to report that this task has now formally been given to the House standing committees. I believe the work of the House standing committees in this regard will complement the work undertaken by their Senate counterparts. I am hopeful that the combined efforts of the House and Senate standing committees will contribute to the enhanced accountability of the executive government to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  During the year, the Committee made substantial progress on a number of its inquiries, and reports on these inquiries should be tabled during the current Budget sittings. I do not wish to elaborate on the inquiries but only to mention them by name. They are inquiries into the following: research and development in Australia; defence computing; the social responsibilities of statutory authorities and government business enterprises; the Australian Customs Service; and the role and work of the Independent Auditor--that is, the auditor who audits the Auditor-General. I believe the diversity of these inquiries indicates the Committee's clear interest in all areas of Commonwealth administration. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, the achievements of the Public Accounts Committee reflect the commitment and hard work of its members, staff and advisers, and I take this opportunity to express my thanks to them--not least to the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), who is in the House at the moment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--It is with some pleasure that I present the report of what was the first delegation from this Parliament to visit China after the suspension of relations between Australia and China following the events in Tiananmen Square on 2 June 1989. It was of course inevitable that those events would be the subject of discussion with the Chinese leadership, and the details of that frank and essentially courteous exchange are set out in pages 20 to 30 of this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The report also outlines the range of discussions that took place with particular emphasis on the strengthening of Australian and Chinese relations to increase trade, joint ventures and cultural exchanges. There are already Australian companies which have established business ventures in the People's Republic. It is important that we do not simply export Australian industry offshore in order to take advantage of a lower paid Chinese work force. It is important that the Australian Government develop a strategy to ensure that the development of our trade links and our work with the People's Republic of China take place on the basis of our exporting to China those areas of our knowledge, capacity and technological change which will act to our mutual advantage. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the officers of the Chinese Embassy in Canberra for their assistance to the delegation in the early stages of its planned departure to China. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank those many representatives of the Chinese Government--from interpreters to the people we met in every walk of life--for their unfailing courtesy and frankness, which made the tasks of this delegation so much easier. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is also important to acknowledge that the work of the delegation was greatly assisted by the briefings from the Australian Embassy and Trade Commission. Their knowledge and background briefings, both before we left and while we were there, enabled all members of the delegation to discharge their very important obligations to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe this report will add to the development of the important relationship between Australia and our near northern neighbour, the People's Republic of China. It is in that spirit that I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave-- As deputy leader of the delegation, I would like to support the remarks made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) in relation to the assistance given to the delegation both in Australia and China. I wish to add a couple of other comments. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has indicated, pages 20 to 30 are ones which I think honourable members of this Parliament will find particularly interesting because they represent the discussions between the Australian parliamentarians and the Chinese parliamentarians. I draw particular attention to paragraph 1.76 on page 24 and paragraph 1.79 on page 25. It appeared at the beginning of our discussion on the events of Tiananmen Square that we may have been in for a very strenuous discussion indeed, because it appeared at that stage that the Chinese representative was a little angry at our having raised the subject. However, after a slightly raised voice for a short period of time, the tone evened out and became very different indeed. I interpolate that I visited China in September last year. I believe I was the first Australian member of parliament, apart from the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) who went there in a ministerial capacity, to have visited China since Tiananmen Square.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I want to state to the Parliament some of the very different things that were said to this delegation compared with the statements made to me in the previous year. I say that not to suggest that people say different things to different people, because they knew very well they were talking to the same person this year as last year, but as an instance of how the statements being made to Australian members of parliament had changed in a few months. </PARA>
<PARA>  When I visited in September last year I was told repeatedly that the events relating to Tiananmen Square that we had seen on our television were fabrications by the international media, and that the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square were not students demonstrating for democracy but just a few hooligans who were making nuisances of themselves. Whilst I heard that over and over again in 1990, that line was never raised in our discussions in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting, in relation to paragraph 1.76, that the leader of the Chinese delegation in these discussions asked, `What would have happened in the United States if the US Capitol in Washington were surrounded by 100,000 demonstrators for more than 50 days, crippling the government of the country? What would the US Administration have done?' To answer for the US Administration, I presume that it would certainly not have called in tanks and used machine-guns on its own students. I also think it is interesting that there is mention of 100,000 demonstrators in contrast to what I had been told the previous year. The really startling paragraph is 1.79, which reports what we were told:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the authorities were totally unprepared to deal with the situation that had developed in Tiananmen Square, such a predicament had not happened before and the police were not trained or equipped to deal with it. They had not been issued with riot control equipment because there was none. So to restore order it was necessary to bring in the only organisation that could restore order, the Army, and they are trained to fight, not to control crowds. Since Tiananmen Square, Zeng Tao said the police had received training and had been provided with the appropriate equipment to deal with future situations to guarantee it will not happen again. </PARA>
<PARA>The report does not mention it, but the `appropriate equipment' referred to is rubber bullets and tear gas. In 1990 I heard--although not from any officials I had contact with--the view that had been stated so often in the West, namely, that the Government could have used tear gas and rubber bullets, it did not have to use tanks and machine-guns; whether or not it had used riot control police or the Army, it did not have to shoot to kill. Very clearly, that criticism has struck home. We were told that there were no rubber bullets or tear gas in China in 1990 but since then they had bought supplies. We were virtually given assurances that tanks and machine-guns would not be used again. It was not in so many words, but I was actually very impressed by what was conveyed to us. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a Chinese saying that the parent never apologises to the child, so one can never expect the Chinese Government to say publicly that it was wrong. I really believe that that view I have quoted from the report, which represents a significant shift in just a few months, in effect, was the Chinese authorities saying, `We admit we made a mistake'. They may not be sorry that they made a mistake, but they admit having made one and say it will not happen that way again. I think that should be pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think there is value in delegations visiting other countries. I also want to underline that, whilst one never wants to be rude, there is value in continuing to point out to the authorities in China that the world does not want to see the events of Tiananmen Square again. China did itself a great disservice and set itself back some way in the world's regard by the events of Tiananmen Square. We look forward to their talking, not fighting, in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is one other point that I want to make in relation to the report. I apologise to the Secretary for not having noticed this when I saw the draft report. Page 21 says:</PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Sullivan said that she had led the first Opposition delegation to China. . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is incorrect; I led the first Australian parliamentary delegation to China in 1977 when, of course, I was a member of the Fraser Government. I would like to set the record straight on that point. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9G4">Dr HARRY EDWARDS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Berowra)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--I would also like to support the comments made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). As an economist, one can be all but mesmerised by the undoubted great economic progress that has been made by China in the past decade and the vast and challenging, and in a sense exciting, potential for the future. World Bank statistics, not anything we were told, indicate that China's economy grew faster over the past 12 months and most of the 1980s than even the so-called capitalist `tigers' of Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong and certainly faster than its two large neighbours, India and the then Soviet Union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is not often appreciated that the agricultural sector in China is substantially privately owned, that overall there is a private economy that can and does stand up to the state economy, that the modernisation drive maintains momentum, that China is significantly open to the outside world and that one of the effects of economic progress is that 90 per cent of households in the big cities now have colour television. When one reflects on the achievements of two to three million Chinese in Singapore, for instance, it boggles the mind to picture what will happen when the productive and entrepreneurial skills of more than one billion Chinese are more fully unleashed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Albeit the National People's Congress, or parliament, reported in this document plays an important role; the Communist Party is still there; freedom of speech and association where it counts is still seriously repressed; and the paramount issue of human rights remains a concern. </PARA>
<PARA>  I stress that our delegation, the first Australian official visit to China since Tiananmen Square, was not wanting in raising the issue of human rights with our hosts, as is clear from the statements by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan). I say in parenthesis that one is perhaps a little sensitive to the fact that the specifically entitled human rights delegation to China last July led by Senator Schacht reported to the Parliament last Monday but assuredly had no monopoly of concern with the issue. </PARA>
<PARA>  In fact, the dialogue with the Chinese on human rights began with a visit to Beijing last December by America's Assistant Secretary of State for human rights, Richard Schifter. In our own case, in a lengthy session at high level in Beijing and on many other private occasions we were listened to on the subject and, I dare to believe, heard. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, I join in the thanks expressed by the leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I would particularly like to thank the Secretary to the delegation, Mr John Dyer, for his dedicated and very effective work both before, during and after the visit here referred to. I also thank Mrs Christine Toplis from the Speaker's office who gave strong secretarial support to the delegation overseas. My wife Elaine accompanied us, participating as an ex officio member of the delegation, so to speak; and it was a very harmonious delegation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--I present the report of the Australian delegation to the eighty-fifth conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held in Pyongyang, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, from 29 April to 4 May 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I do not want to take up the time of the House--the report speaks for itself-- but there are a number of points that I feel it is important to make. I do not know whether all honourable members are aware of the role that Australia is now playing in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The fact that we are a member both of the 12+ organisation and the Asia-Pacific Group places a heavy burden on Australia. We actually service the executive of the Asia-Pacific Group and are generally regarded as honest brokers when it comes to dealing with the range of problems that come up for debate. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the absence of the Speaker as a member of the executive, as leader of the delegation I had to spend a great deal of time on the executive. That placed an increased burden not merely upon the executive officers of the delegation but upon all members of the delegation. I am bound to say that those obligations were readily accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>  I acknowledge with thanks the support of all other members of the delegation, with particular reference to the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) who played an important role, not merely in terms of the meetings of women parliamentarians but on the major topic of the conference where she was chosen as the rapporteur, a position which recognised the roles which she had played in the working committees of the conference. It indicated the high regard in which she was held and the confidence in her work as a result of what she had done on those committees. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also place on record the service provided to the delegation by Mr John Dyer as Secretary. I particularly thank the Speaker for making available to the delegation the services of a member of his staff, Mrs Christine Toplis. She worked untiringly, often at very short notice. No task was too small or too large. I believe it is true to say that the delegation could not have discharged its obligations to the Parliament and to the IPU without the very important assistance that she provided. In doing that, she also released Mr John Dyer so that he could fulfil the very wide range of activities that go on at a conference of this kind--not merely monitoring what was occurring at the executive meetings, but providing ongoing assistance in the range of meetings that seemed to be continually taking place. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report also deals with what might be described as some important development in the relationships between the Australian Government and the Government of the Peoples Democratic Republic of Korea. We do not have embassy representation there; indeed, the principal adviser to the delegation had not visited. The delegation did provide our foreign service with the capacity to join us so that the foreign service would have first-hand information as to the nature of the Government of the Peoples Republic of Korea and at the same time see what works had taken place there, meet with senior officers of that government and discuss some of the important developments. </PARA>
<PARA>  This provides an opportunity for a society, which in many ways has been closed with a fairly traditional communist-type regime, to establish important links with Australia. I think the bridges that have been established could be built upon, and I hope that will take place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--I have pleasure in supporting the report of the Australian Parliament's delegation to the Eighty-Fifth Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference and the comments made by the leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). I want to touch on a couple of areas. At the risk of detaining the House from its business, I think that something should be put on the record in relation to the conference meeting in Pyongyang in North Korea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  First of all, as part of the agenda for IPU, there is a preliminary conference on the Sunday before the conference starts--it is called a women's meeting. The women members of parliament attend but male members of parliament can also attend and quite a number did. I encourage the Australian delegation to pursue that course of action. I particularly place on record my thanks to John Dyer, the Secretary of the delegation. He accompanied me to that day long conference and was of great assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>  At that meeting a notice of motion was put forward, which was carried unanimously, indicating to the countries of the Inter-Parliamentary Union that all present at that meeting on the Sunday supported the proposed amendment to the rules which has been moved by the Australian parliamentary group, and which will be considered at the forthcoming meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Santiago this month. We are very grateful for that support. The women's meeting unanimously supported that suggested change to the rules being moved by Australia, and that has been circulated to all countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the Monday the United Nations Secretary General conveyed to all participants at the opening ceremony a message which dealt with the subject of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. There were two scheduled items for discussion: firstly, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and, secondly, violence towards women and children. It is very welcome that the United Nations Secretary General chooses to send messages to Inter-Parliamentary Union meetings. I express one small regret: he considered that only one subject was worthy of his comment. The United Nations is very active on the subject of women's welfare and children's rights throughout the world, and it is a pity that some reference was not made to that, particularly the importance of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, because that is very relevant to the subject of violence towards children. </PARA>
<PARA>  One other matter I really ought to put on the record relates to some aspects of the conduct of the conference. We were given excellent hospitality by the North Koreans, who staged this conference at very short notice. It requires a lot of organisation and a lot of resources, and the organisation was excellent. It is unfortunate that they could not relax their surveillance of foreigners a little more. The surveillance was done fairly cleverly--the longer one spent there the more one found out. It was really by accident that we found out the sort of surveillance we were under. </PARA>
<PARA>  I raise this matter because of one particular incident involving Ms Toplis and me which I have not previously referred to publicly. I put on the record, as one of our parliamentary delegates, that when members of parliament visit a country such as North Korea, I do not think they necessarily have to accept whatever treatment is meted out to them. While some of the treatment was good, there were some other unfortunate occasions. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have been in this Parliament for 17 years now. During that time I have had many occasions to travel on my own, both within Australia and overseas. As a woman travelling on my own, I do not appreciate answering telephone calls to my hotel room when the person on the other end just hangs up, particularly when this happens frequently. I found it a little unnerving to receive these calls in my hotel room when I was in a strange country. It became clear, almost by accident, after a number of days that this practice was part of a surveillance system. </PARA>
<PARA>  On one occasion one of the members of our delegation mislaid some papers. He thought that he had left them in a taxi when travelling between the conference centre and our hotel. We sought out the controller of the taxis--a gentleman who used to usher us into the taxis and tell the driver where we were going--to tell him that one of our members might have left some papers in a taxi, so that if the taxi driver handed the papers to him he would know whose they were. This gentleman said, `No, you did not leave any papers in the taxi that brought you home from the conference this afternoon'. Given that we had returned only 30 minutes earlier, this was a fairly startling piece of news. </PARA>
<PARA>  The gentleman concerned was then able to turn up a record of every taxi that the Australian delegation had caught since it had been in Pyongyang. So there was a record keeping system. As it turned out, the record keeping system was our badges. When attending a conference such as this, one is normally given a badge which indicates one's status. If one is in a lift in the hotel and somebody from the host country says, `Which country are you from?', one thinks they are being friendly. On leaving the hotel to catch a taxi, if the person who is finding and directing the taxi says, in a very pleasant way, `Which country are you from?', one thinks he is being friendly, too. In fact, it was part of the surveillance system. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was a little annoyed when I realised this, so I stopped wearing my badge outside the conference centre. The next time I went to catch a taxi in the company of Ms Toplis-- we had been working back on a speech of mine one morning--this same question was forthcoming. The gentleman said, `Where do you come from?' I said, `Queensland'. He said, `I am sorry, where did you say you came from?' I said, `Queensland'. He said, `In which country is that?' I said, `Don't you know?' At that point he stopped walking towards the taxi. Obviously we were not going to go any further unless I reported accurately. I had given him an answer he was not expecting. I then said, `I would like to catch my taxi', which I did, and Ms Toplis and I went on our way. </PARA>
<PARA>  The next day the same thing happened again. We were working on a speech that I had to make at very short notice because I was rapporteur of a committee. We were working in a suite that was used by the delegation as an office. Apparently our minders had been trying unsuccessfully to contact me in my room. I had not left the hotel that morning with the rest of the Australian delegation and they had lost track of me because I did not answer telephone calls to my room. Likewise, Ms Toplis. So by the time we left--we did not realise this at the time, we realised it only when we got to the conference centre--we had totally fouled-up the surveillance system and they were in a bit of a panic. They thought two Australians had escaped. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we left the hotel I said to Ms Toplis, `Don't wear your name tag'.  So neither of us wore our badges. There were no questions this time;  we were just put into a taxi which, instead of going to the conference centre, drove to the front door of the hotel. A woman rushed out of the hotel, leapt into the front seat, spoke to the taxi driver in Korean and then the taxi driver drove off. We had no idea who she was or what on earth she was doing in our taxi. Ms Toplis and I had a conversation about this and we were not very pleased about it. We agreed that if she was going to ride in our taxi, when we got to our destination she was going to pay the taxi fare. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we arrived at our destination Ms Toplis and I stepped out of the taxi. The taxi driver got a bit alarmed and started saying, `Money, money'. We said, `No, she'll pay' and quite an altercation followed. She said that, no, she was not going to pay and we said, `If you ride in our taxi; you pay the fare', at which point she turned on her heel and leapt on a bus which was then departing from the conference centre. Subsequently, when we entered the conference centre comments made to us by our escorts indicated that they had been alarmed because they had not been able to locate us that day. Therefore--putting the two things together--they had seen fit to give us an unrequested, in fact unwanted, escort in our taxi. They were making the point fairly heavily that we really were not going to get away with being in Pyongyang without people knowing where we were. </PARA>
<PARA>  I put that on the record, but unfortunately the record will not show my tone of voice. I would not want anyone from North Korea or anyone else in the future to think that I had made these comments in a declamatory way. I have not; I have put this on the record quietly. But I believe it should be on the record. </PARA>
<PARA>  One always has misgivings about holding a parliamentary conference in a country with a government like that of North Korea, which is notoriously undemocratic. There were a lot of benefits to be derived from the conference being held in North Korea, not the least of which was that one of the conditions of holding an Inter-Parliamentary Conference is that every member country has to be invited. This meant that North Korea had to invite South Korea, which attended, and that was wonderful. It was very positive and it was a landmark. North Korea also had to invite the United States of America, which accepted but unfortunately, did not attend. There were many positives involved and so, in that sense, the decision of the IPU to accept North Korea's invitation to stage the conference in Pyongyang had some very positive effects. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, I do not think we should pretend that those other things did not happen. There was surveillance of members of parliament who were attending a parliamentary conference, and fairly unwelcome surveillance at that. At one stage, someone tried to take a camera from me at the conference centre. They did not succeed, but they tried. Little things like that occurred. I do not think we should shy away from the fact that this is not the way to treat parliamentary delegates at a parliamentary conference. It is a pity that it happened. It was noticed, and it was not appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA>  That said, I reiterate what I said at the beginning of my remarks: I indicate my gratitude for the hospitality that was extended to us. It was an excellently-staged conference in terms of the organisation and facilities and it was a great privilege to participate in it on behalf of the Australian Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--I wish to make a few remarks. The leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), was appointed at this Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference to the committee of the IPU on Human Rights of Parliamentarians--which is a demanding and responsible office--and he was also appointed to a committee of the executive committee of the IPU which is monitoring events in Cyprus. This was an honour for him and the Australian delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea would be the last remaining hardline communist country on earth, so it was indeed a fascinating and unique experience to visit the DPRK. It has been properly described as `an unlovely dictatorship'. It is indeed a command economy with a pervading sense of `big brother' of surveillance--which the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) mentioned--regimentation, especially of the young, and a real cult of personality in respect of the `Great Leader', Kim Il Sung, and so on. Nevertheless, it is now evident that the economy of the country is on its beam- ends. A massive program of public building-- notably in Pyongyang--among other factors, has taken its toll on more productive investment and the country is being forced to come to terms with the outside world. </PARA>
<PARA>  A notable aspect of this was in respect of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.   The Australian delegation to this IPU Conference was, to some extent, singled out by the North Koreans as an appropriate, perhaps the best, channel to the West and the rest of the world--part of the `honest broker' role, to take a phrase from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, that Australia often plays. At the several high level luncheons to which we were treated, and on every other available opportunity, we pressed the case that the DPRK, having become a signatory in 1985 to the NPT, should take the next step and conclude the required safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency. This was its legal and unconditional obligation under the treaty, but the further argument advanced was that, if the DPRK had nothing to hide in respect of its nuclear facilities and the development of nuclear weapons, then why not sign?</PARA>
<PARA>  Therefore, it is pleasing to note that barely a month later North Korea announced that it would in fact conclude a safeguards agreement with the IAEA. I do not suggest that this was directly due to our contending on the issue--there were stronger pressures from elsewhere--but I am confident that we were a significant component of the international pressure that brought about that welcome development and important contribution to peace and stability in the region, which is our region also. It was an important aspect of the work of this delegation and, in that sense, of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  On an earlier occasion I expressed my thanks in the terms of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, but again I express my thanks particularly to Mr John Dyer and Mrs Christine Toplis. </PARA>

<PARA>  It has been a longstanding intention of the building's owners to undertake a major refurbishment of the building after the five-year lease expires in April 1995. This proposal has been driven by the need to vacate the Remington Centre prior to the expiry of the lease and by economies to be achieved through rental savings in the order of approximately $3.3m. </PARA>
<PARA>  To achieve the timeframe for relocation, Defence examined a wide range of options. Based on a financial evaluation and other non-financial factors, refurbishment of buildings 1 and 2 at the Royal Edward Victualling Yard was selected as the most effective and preferred option. The work involves the internal and external refurbishment of two substantial buildings, together with the removal of a vehicle garage, relocation of an electrical substation and construction of a special purpose workshop facility for use by underwater systems divisions of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. Work has been designed to keep within a cost budget of $13.4m at April 1991 prices. Defence plans to vacate the leased premises in the Remington Centre from April 1994, with tenders for the main construction contract to be called in February-March 1992. Progressive occupation will commence from April 1994. </PARA>
<PARA>  I table selected drawings of the proposed relocation of the Naval Support Command Headquarters to the Royal Edward Victualling Yard in Pyrmont, New South Wales, and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will amend the Broadcasting Act 1942 to:</PARA>
<PARA>(a)  require that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal be given prior written notice of acquisitions of interests which could contravene that Act, including a contravention that would arise if the interests of associates were aggregated;</PARA>
<PARA>(b)  increase the ABT's powers to gather information on the ownership and control arrangements for media outlets to assist the Tribunal in determining whether the ownership and control rules of the Act have been, or are likely to be, contravened; and</PARA>
<PARA>(c)  strengthen the powers of the Federal Court to protect licensees and other companies and to prevent, or prevent the continuation of, contraventions of the ownership and control rules, either on an interim basis to enable proposed acquisitions of interests to be appropriately investigated or on a more permanent basis. </PARA>
<PARA>  The changes will not affect the limits currently provided for under the Act. The Government has no wish to interfere in arrangements which comply with the letter and the spirit of the Act. The changes simply strengthen the capacity of the ABT to gather information and ensure that acquisitions which do not comply with the spirit and letter of the Act can be prevented if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the limits will be contravened. </PARA>
<PARA>  Persons acquiring media interests in good faith have no reason to fear these amendments, but it is an entirely different case for anyone seeking to acquire real control over media outlets in contravention of the Act. The Government will not stand by and allow the Act to be ignored or circumvented. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendments will make it more difficult for people to evade the legitimate requirements of the Act. I believe they should, therefore, receive universal support from within this Parliament and from all Australians concerned with the independence of our media from improper influences. </PARA>
<PARA>  Passing to the details of the Bill, I refer to clauses 5 and 6, which introduce the prior notice requirement that will apply to the majority of acquisitions. Naturally, prior notice will not be required of persons who are unaware of an acquisition, which is quite possible given the tracing requirements of the Act. Those people will be required to give notice when they become aware of the acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA>  The notification requirements will apply only to interests which could give rise to a contravention of the ownership and control rules of the Act, which include the foreign ownership and cross-media rules. It will not apply to the vast range of acquisitions which will not have that effect. But, for the first time, the obligation to notify the ABT will relate to the acquisition of interests, rather than to the more limited concept of a transaction. Persons who will acquire interests by way of gift or through the operation of law will now have to notify the ABT, rather than wait for their interests to be discovered by other means. </PARA>
<PARA>  Associate relationships will also be the basis of a requirement to notify the ABT if the aggregated interests of the associates could amount to a contravention of the Act. Those relationships may be evidence of persons acting in concert, but they will certainly not, taken on their own, be conclusive. </PARA>
<PARA>  The aim of the notification requirements, and of the related information gathering powers, is not to remove the fundamental duty on the ABT to establish that a contravention of the Act has occurred. People will not be required to prove themselves innocent under the Broadcasting Act, any more than they are under other Acts. The aim of the requirements is simply to enable the ABT to gather information in a timely fashion which will enable it to make decisions on an informed basis and, if appropriate, to discharge its onus of proof before the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA>  Because the definition of associates in the Bill is relevant only to a notification requirement, it has been cast widely. However, the Government has no wish to intrude more than is necessary into the legitimate activities of individuals, even that limited class of persons who have interests which fall within the notification requirements. Consequently, the ABT will have the power, by notice published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette to exclude certain classes of people. The ABT will be able to exercise this power either in relation to particular inquiries or generally and the Government expects it to use this power to the maximum appropriate extent. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, the ABT will not be able to negate the policy of the amendments by use of this power. It can exercise it only in relation to interests not likely to contribute to contraventions of the ownership and control rules and any determination it makes will be a disallowable instrument, to be tabled in and capable of disallowance by either House of  the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  Associate relationships, and evidence gathered as a result of the notification requirements or of the strengthened information gathering powers, will be evidence of the matters to which they relate and will be considered by the ABT in exercising any of its powers under the ownership and control part of the Act, in accordance with proposed sections 90HB and 92EB. </PARA>
<PARA>  The strengthened information gathering powers under section 89X, clause 4, will combine with the already extensive powers of the ABT to inquire into acquisitions, and proposed acquisitions, of interests to give the ABT the muscle to discover the reality of arrangements often obscured within a maze of legal minutiae. An important change in the section 89X powers lies in the reduction of the minimum time in which a person must respond to an ABT request for information from 21 days to 7 days, or less if the ABT considers that reasonable. This is essential to enable the ABT to react before acquisitions are completed, at least by applying for interim orders from the Federal Court. However, it does not allow the ABT to abuse its power. Under administrative law principles, the ABT must act reasonably, and I expect that it would be rare for a requirement to supply information in the shorter periods envisaged to be considered reasonable unless there is an urgent need for a decision or court application. </PARA>
<PARA>  Clause 3 will introduce new confidentiality requirements in relation to information about prospective acquisitions to protect the interests of individuals during ABT investigations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Clause 9 strengthens the powers of the Federal Court to make orders. The scope of those orders will now extend to any contravention, or possible contravention, of the ownership and control rules and to actions or things likely to affect the ability of licensees to comply with their licence conditions or to provide the licensed service or choose programming. The orders may be made on application of the ABT and may be either interim or permanent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Interim orders may be sought either in their own right as applications for orders of an interim nature under subsection 92P(1) or (2) of the Act as proposed to be amended, or under subsection 92P(6) of the Act as an adjunct to an application for permanent relief under subsection 92P(1) or (2). Naturally, it will be up to the court to determine whether an interim order is warranted. It will weigh all the circumstances and, I am sure, will act if there are reasonable grounds for doing so, whether in support of an application for permanent orders or in support of an ABT inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>  The proposed power of the Federal Court to protect licensees and other companies will be similar to current powers of the ABT under section 92M, but will be able to be made at any time, even before the transaction. </PARA>
<PARA>  There will be no requirement for the Federal Court to wait until a contravention or proposed contravention becomes a breach of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  The exercise of this extended range of powers by the Federal Court would be expensive and necessarily public. Persons wishing to acquire interests will probably prefer to avoid this. In such cases, it would be prudent for those persons to approach the Tribunal as soon as possible to discuss potential problems. The Tribunal is able to examine proposals and, if satisfied that there are no real causes for concern, can inform those persons of that fact, thus allowing them to proceed with the acquisition in full confidence. The Tribunal's provisional clearance, which I hope will become a normal feature of transactions involving media interests, does not require legislation. It is simply an incident of its functions. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, to facilitate this function, and to ensure that conditions can be agreed between the parties and the ABT, the Bill includes provision for the ABT to accept undertakings under proposed section 92NA. If the ABT accepts that those undertakings are adequate, there will be no need for the ABT to seek Federal Court orders that might prevent the acquisition. But the Federal Court will also be given powers under section 92P to make orders to enforce, or prevent a breach of, those undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend the Bill as an appropriate means of ensuring that the ABT can act to investigate media acquisitions that might threaten the public interest without the unwarranted and draconian step of casting the onus on the purchaser to prove innocent intent. We must never forget that it is for the ABT to establish that there may be contraventions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  I expect that the main effect of this Bill will be apparent in the limited number of times the powers of the ABT and court are used. I feel sure that purchasers and the ABT alike will be anxious to sort out any potential problems without the need to resort to those powers, and I think that will be a great improvement on the current arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>  But the powers will be there if needed. And I believe they will ensure that the Broadcasting Act can be applied appropriately and in a timely fashion until the Government's more wide reaching review of broadcasting regulation is in place. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill is expected to have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. The greater efficiency with which the ABT will be able to identify matters requiring exhaustive investigation as a result of the prior notification requirement should offset the cost of monitoring those notifications and the potential to avoid blatant contraventions and the expensive process of trying to rectify contraventions through ABT inquiry could result in savings.  I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Special Broadcasting Service Bill is to provide the SBS with a new charter and the full range of corporate powers appropriate to an independent public authority. The decision to develop the Bill was announced in the Government's national agenda for a multicultural Australia launched in July 1989. The agenda defines the Commonwealth Government's multicultural policies and the goals that underlie them. </PARA>
<PARA>  The national agenda for a multicultural Australia emphasises that the nation's cultural institutions, including the media, have a critical role to play in both mirroring and shaping Australians' image of themselves. Our institutions need to be responsive to Australia's diverse community in which four out of 10 Australians are immigrants or the children of immigrants, half of them from non-English speaking backgrounds. The Government regards the SBS both as a special service for Australians of non-English speaking background and as a genuinely multicultural broadcaster for the benefit of all Australians, regardless of background. </PARA>
<PARA>  The establishment of separate legislation for the SBS will secure the future of the SBS and will express and guarantee the multilingual and multicultural character of the broadcaster. The legislation defines the charter of the SBS and sets out its structure, powers and responsibilities. It removes from the Broadcasting Act the provisions relating to the establishment and management of the SBS. The principal effect of the legislation will be to establish the SBS as a statutory authority with similar powers and operational structures to the ABC, taking account of statutory authority and government business enterprise reforms, where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill provides for the introduction of a new Act, the Special Broadcasting Service Act, and consequential amendments of the Broadcasting Act 1942 and a range of other Acts. The new staffing provisions will commence on proclamation. All other provisions will commence 28 days after the legislation receives royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA>  I now turn to the detail of the proposed legislation. The new legislation for the SBS provides the Government, the SBS and the public with a clear statement of the SBS's intended role. It also establishes management, advisory, accountability and staffing structures appropriate to the functions of the new corporation. An important underlying theme of the legislation is to provide the SBS with greater flexibility in the management of its operations. At the same time there is a need to put in place adequate measures to ensure that the SBS operates efficiently and is accountable through the responsible Minister and the Parliament to the Australian people who own and fund it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The SBS charter establishes the primary role of the SBS as being Australia's multicultural broadcaster. It provides a broad statement of the main objective of the SBS which will be to provide multilingual and multicultural broadcasting services which inform, educate and entertain all Australians and, in doing so, reflect Australia's multicultural society. </PARA>
<PARA>  The specific charter objectives recognise the wide ranging role of the SBS. The SBS will be expected to meet the needs of ethnic, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities for information and entertainment in languages other than English, and to contribute to the retention and development of language and other cultural skills now present in Australia. It will be expected to increase awareness of the contribution of a diversity of cultures to the continuing development of Australian society and to promote understanding and acceptance of that diversity. The SBS will also be expected to extend the range of Australian television and radio services, to make use of Australia's creative resources and to contribute greatly to the overall diversity in Australian broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA>  In practice, the SBS's approach to fulfilling its charter will differ between television and radio, reflecting the inherent characteristics of these different broadcasting media. SBS radio will continue to mainly provide programs in languages other than English which cater for the needs of a wide range of communities. SBS television will provide programming in both English and community languages, reflecting the needs and interests of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  The SBS will continue to be primarily funded from the Budget. It will, however, as a subsidiary function to its charter obligations, also be able to conduct business or other activities incidental to the fulfilment of the charter with a view to generating off-budget revenue. In addition, the SBS will have the opportunity of increasing its revenues through advertising and sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA>  To assist the SBS to undertake permitted business activities, the legislation will allow it to enter into partnerships or other business arrangements with the agreement of the Minister. These business activities should not detract from the SBS's primary charter responsibilities. The SBS will be subject to a range of corporate planning and annual reporting requirements. The SBS will be required to identify, in advance, the corporate objectives, including forecasts of revenue and expenditure, and overall strategies and policies to be followed by the SBS, and its subsidiaries, for meeting those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under the current legislation, the SBS is already able to accept money for the sponsorship of programs. Accordingly, it has, over the past 12 months, entered into a number of successful sponsorship agreements which have enabled it to purchase programs which have attracted high audience ratings such as the World Cup Soccer Series and The Civil War. The additional revenue it can expect to attract from advertising will enable it to further improve its services and, in particular, to produce more programs of its own. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister is sensitive to the concern that advertising and sponsorship revenue funding has the potential to alter the scheduling and content of SBS programs. The distinctive character of the SBS will, therefore, be preserved through a number of measures. Foremost there is the detailed charter and the obligation on the board to ensure the independence and integrity of the SBS. Also, the SBS board will be required to report annually to Parliament on how its programming activities have related to its charter obligations. It will also be required to report on the detail of the advertising and sponsorship arrangements it has entered into. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, the legislation limits the amount of advertising and sponsorship announcements the SBS can sell to five minutes per hour and requires that the announcements be broadcast only between programs or in natural program breaks. The five-minute limitation will not apply to announcements for which the SBS receives no payment or other consideration-- for example, community announcements or the promotion of the SBS's own programs and products. The SBS will be generally subject to the same statutory control on advertising as the commercial broadcasters. </PARA>
<PARA>  Within these statutory limitations, the SBS board will have discretion to determine a range of matters about the types of advertising and sponsorship announcements it will broadcast and when they will be broadcast. The board will be required to develop and publish guidelines on these matters, and may refuse advertisements which do not comply with its guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>  The effect on the commercial broadcasting sector of the introduction of advertising and sponsorship is not expected to be significant. The SBS audience share is relatively smaller and its advertising revenue share is expected to reflect this. Furthermore, the SBS serves many distinct audiences and has the potential to appeal to companies which do not presently advertise on radio or television. </PARA>
<PARA>  The legislation allows the SBS to borrow money from the Commonwealth or other sources with ministerial approval and to offer its assets as security. It will permit the Commonwealth to guarantee the loans. The legislation also confers powers to enter into hedging contracts to reduce the risks of foreign exchange or interest rate fluctuations and to invest surplus funds in a manner approved by the Treasurer. These powers are consistent with the greater independence and accountability of the SBS in financial matters. </PARA>
<PARA>    The size of the SBS board will be increased by two to reflect its increased statutory responsibilities. Although there are no formal qualification requirements for board members, members will collectively be required to possess expertise in the areas needed to govern the SBS effectively. For this purpose, members will be required to have an understanding of multiculturalism and of the needs and interests of the SBS's culturally diverse audience. They will also be required to have between them a diversity of cultural perspectives. At least one member will be required to have an appropriate understanding of the interests of employees. </PARA>
<PARA>  In making appointments to the SBS board, the Government will actively seek equitable representation of women, young people and people of different ethnic backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Managing Director of the SBS will be the only full time member of the board. He or she will be appointed by the board and be responsible to it for the conduct of the SBS's business. Other appointments to the board will be made by the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>  The SBS requires a flexible staffing regime that can accommodate a range of employment arrangements. Accordingly the SBS will be empowered to engage staff in accordance with terms and conditions determined by the SBS. However, the Government expects the terms and conditions, including internal administrative arrangements, to be developed in full consultation with the unions. The new staffing provisions will not commence operation until the Government is satisfied that there has been full consultation. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, the SBS will be expected to adhere to the Government's policies on industrial relations matters with possible flow-on or policy impact, including pay and conditions of service issues, and matters such as industrial democracy, occupational health and safety, and technological change. </PARA>
<PARA>  The board will be required to develop and publicise the SBS's programming policies and its policies on the handling of complaints. The Government is separately reviewing public accountability arrangements in relation to both the ABC and SBS. As part of that review, the Government will consider the adequacy of existing arrangements for program standard setting and complaints handling and the appropriate role of external bodies such as the Ombudsman and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>  The SBS board will be expected to ensure that SBS programming is responsive to the changing needs of SBS audiences, and to take account of community opinion in developing programming strategies and policies for fulfilling the charter. </PARA>
<PARA>  The consultative mechanisms for gauging community needs and opinions will be determined by the SBS board. The board will be required to describe these measures in its corporate plan. Due to the public interest in effective consultation, this element of the corporate plan will be subject to alteration by the Minister, if deemed necessary. Through this process, the Minister will be empowered to require the SBS board to establish an advisory council if the Minister is not satisfied with the consultative arrangements planned by the board. </PARA>
<PARA>  To assist the board to develop appropriate community consultative mechanisms for inclusion in its first corporate plan, the board will be required to establish an interim community advisory committee constituted by persons with an understanding of multiculturalism together with interests, skills and experience relevant to ethnic, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. This committee will be disbanded when the first corporate plan is provided to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>  The independence of the SBS from government influence is an important policy objective. The legislation aims to guarantee this independence in programming and editorial matters, but at the same time ensure that the SBS, as a Budget funded organisation, is properly accountable to the Australian public for expenditure of its money. </PARA>
<PARA>  The SBS will be expected to adopt relevant government policies in the performance of its functions where these do not conflict with the exercise of its statutory responsibilities. Also, the Minister may formally direct the SBS board on matters and circumstances which are prescribed in regulations but not on programming or scheduling matters. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendments in the Bill will not alter the costs or revenues of the Commonwealth. They do not require the application of additional resources by the SBS to meet its new charter obligations or to comply with its establishment and management responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government sees the SBS as playing a vital role in the enjoyment of being Australian. The SBS also meets real communications needs for many Australians. The SBS has won acclaim for its successes in radio and television, which the Government recognises and applauds. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's commitment to the SBS has been evidenced by the decision to continue indexed Budget funding for a further three years and to allow the full retention of non-Budget income, including income from sponsorships and advertising. The Government has also authorised borrowing to allow the SBS to purchase its own headquarters building. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill seeks to provide the foundations for a stable future for the SBS. The Government is confident that with solid legislative and financial underpinning the SBS will continue to offer a fine and improving service to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The National Crime Authority Amendment Bill contains several proposals which are designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the operations of the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>  The major reform contained in the Bill will prevent the disclosure of the existence of process issued by the NCA in the course of its investigations. It will also prevent disclosure of any information about the reference, the investigation or any hearings or proceedings to which the process relates. Previously some recipients of NCA summonses or notices, such as financial institutions, felt obliged to inform their clients of the receipt of these documents. This has resulted in suspects being alerted to NCA investigations and concealing or destroying evidence or going into hiding. The amendment will help to prevent this happening again, and will clarify the legal position of these institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition to this, the amendment will serve to protect the reputation of suspects at a time when the allegations have not been properly investigated. The recipients of the summons or notice have to be given sufficient details about the suspects so that they can determine what information is required. The potential for damage to the reputation of these people through disclosure of the existence of the summons or notice could be significant. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is for these reasons that the decision to make a notation restricting disclosure can only be made where the NCA is satisfied that failure to prohibit disclosure might prejudice the safety, reputation or fair trial of a person, the effectiveness of an investigation, or it is otherwise in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>  The provision has been designed in a way which is consistent with the NCA's desire to be more open and accountable. Instead of a blanket prohibition, this provision will only apply where, subject to the criteria I have just mentioned, a decision is made to restrict disclosure in a particular case. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important to note that the provision contains a number of other safeguards:</PARA>
<PARA>.  Under the amendment, disclosure will always be permitted to allow the person served with the NCA process to obtain legal advice or legal aid in relation to the process or matter. </PARA>
<PARA>.  Further, where process is served on a legal practitioner, disclosure can be made to allow the practitioner to comply with any legal duties of disclosure arising from the professional relationship with the client, or to obtain instructions in relation to legal professional privilege. </PARA>
<PARA>.  Depending on the particular case, disclosure may also be permitted in other circumstances specified in the notation on the summons or notice. </PARA>
<PARA>.  A further safeguard is that the prohibition will only remain in force for a maximum period of five years or until the investigation is concluded, whichever occurs first. If the investigation is concluded and the NCA has been advised by the prosecuting authority that no prosecution will be undertaken, or there is no evidence of an offence, or in other cases criminal proceedings arising from the investigation have been commenced, then the prohibition will no longer apply. Where this occurs the NCA will be obliged to notify those to whom the summons or notice was addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The NCA is giving a higher priority to the coordination of efforts by State and Commonwealth law enforcement agencies against white-collar and corporate crime. It is evident from past experience that these complex investigations also lead to the disclosure of major tax evasion, proceeds of crime and money laundering offences. White-collar crime transcends State boundaries, and effective control can only be achieved by the coordinated national activities of agencies such as the NCA. The power to obtain documents had proven to be a powerful tool in NCA investigations of fraud and related criminal activity, which are often document based. This amendment will improve the effectiveness of investigations in these important areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also contains three more minor amendments which will help to improve the functioning of the NCA. The first will enable the NCA to apply for a warrant of apprehension where a witness fails or refuses to appear at a hearing. Currently, such witnesses may be fined or imprisoned under the Act; however, the current penalties do not in themselves ensure attendance at a hearing. Access to a warrant for the arrest of such people would assist the effective conduct of NCA hearings. The second of these will allow the Chairman of the NCA, rather than the Attorney-General, to appoint counsel to assist the Authority. This amendment is in line with recent Government moves to devolve such powers to authority heads to improve efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, the amendment will authorise the NCA to inform relevant members of the inter-governmental committee about general investigations being conducted in their particular State or Territory. At present there is a cumbersome procedure whereby the information has first to pass to the Commonwealth Minister before dissemination to the State or Territory Minister. It is the view of the Government, the NCA and all the States and Territories represented on the inter-governmental committee that the States' and Territories' current access to information regarding references and special investigations be extended to include general investigations and to improve accountability. I believe this Bill contains important reforms which will improve the effectiveness of the NCA as a national law enforcement body. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>  The Government's 12 March Building a More Competitive Australia statement recognised the need for Australian exporters to have access to competitive financial facilities to be effective, especially in Asia-Pacific markets. The Government announced its intention in the statement to re-establish EFIC as a separate entity to Austrade, with greater visibility and an extended range of services for exporters. As part of this restructuring, a $200m callable capital facility is to be provided to supplement EFIC's existing reserves of some $160m. This will ensure adequate financial backing for its insurance, guarantee and lending operations. </PARA>
<PARA>  A $50m performance bonding facility and the more aggressive use of interest subsidy arrangements through Australian dollar financing and the provision of lines of credit to offshore banks, which were also announced in the March statement, are now in operation. The performance bond facility already stands to provide vital assistance for projects worth over $200m. </PARA>
<PARA>  In considering the Bill, it will be of benefit to members to understand a little of EFIC's background, its core activities and its relationship with the Government. EFIC's services are broadly comparable to those available to our overseas competitors through similar Government backed export credit agencies. It insures exporters against the risk of non-payment by overseas buyers and provides a range of guarantee and bonding services. EFIC covers around 10 per cent of Australia's trade and in 1990-91 supported exports totalling $4.5 billion. It also insures offshore investments by Australian companies against non-commercial loss caused by exchange transfer blockages, expropriation or war damage. Cover on investments totals $490m. </PARA>
<PARA>  Concessional finance is available for exports of capital goods and related services on internationally competitive terms within trade finance rules set by the OECD. EFIC's lending program presently totals some $1,640m. Lending is supported by an active program of borrowing on international capital markets. These funds are on-lent, often at subsidised interest rates. This year's Budget provides $14.7m to meet interest subsidy costs. </PARA>
<PARA>  EFIC, in one form or another, has been in operation for 35 years. Interest subsidy aside, EFIC's business has been at no cost to the taxpayer. For the past five years, EFIC has been a part of the Austrade organisation. To better equip EFIC for today's competitive export climate requires it to operate in a more commercial and accountable way. In the Government's view, this will be best assured by establishing EFIC as a statutory corporation, structured along government business enterprise lines. It will continue to fill a market gap by providing services which are not normally available from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  EFIC also undertakes transactions which the Government considers to be in the national interest. These are usually high risk and involve important industry, trade or political considerations. Total exposure on the national interest account is around $1.3 billion, of which the greater bulk relates to commodity exports, particularly wheat and wool. The UN sanctions on Iraq resulted in substantial calls on the Budget last year to fund claim payments to the Australian Wheat Board. A further $255m has been provided in this year's Budget for this purpose. Although recovery of these debts is expected, this may be a protracted process. </PARA>
<PARA>  Returning to the Bill--although structured along government business enterprise lines, EFIC is clearly not a commercial operation in the normal sense and will remain dependent on the Government's ultimate guarantee of its operations. The provision of a $200m callable capital facility is a key element of this restructuring. EFIC must have adequate capital to enable it to take up worthwhile business while observing a proper prudential ratio between capital and reserves and contingent liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  Although EFIC has accumulated substantial reserves of around $160m, independent advice indicates that its total contingent liability requires a more substantial capital base. The $200m facility will be fully assessable for capital adequacy purposes. However, it will only be drawn upon when EFIC is no longer able to meet expected claims or losses. Provision has also been made for the return of such funding to the Government once the need for it passes. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's control over EFIC will be limited to broad policy oversight. This will occur mainly through the corporate planning process and will include financial targets and accountability for results. Day to day control will rest with the EFIC board and the Corporation's management. The composition of the board is an important consideration requiring a blend of expertise in finance and exporting. A number of intended appointments to the new board with these skills have been announced. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has been fortunate to obtain the services of Mr Reg Nicolson, recently retired Deputy Managing Director of the ANZ Bank, to head up the new board. To ensure that linkages between EFIC and Austrade are maintained, provision has been made for cross membership of boards by the managing directors of the respective organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>  In terms of direct financial impact, the Bill is neutral. However, the $200m callable capital facility contained in the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Bill is supported with a mechanism for EFIC to access the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This would only occur if, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, it is determined that EFIC's money and other assets are insufficient to meet expected liabilities, losses and claims. It is not anticipated that EFIC will need to call on this facility. </PARA>
<PARA>  EFIC's overall operations are governed by maximum contingency liability and loan limits. These are prescribed in regulations. The maximum contingent liability for insurance and guarantee business is $3,600m. For overseas investment insurance it is $750m. The maximum amount of loans is set at $1,900m. Regulations maintaining these limits will be promulgated under the EFIC legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, EFIC will continue to work with the financial sector and not in competition with it, to provide Australian exporters with access to competitive credit insurance and export finance facilities. This is an essential part of the international trade environment and especially of the Asia-Pacific region. EFIC has proved itself to be an efficient and cost effective organisation. In an increasingly complex global trading environment its financial record is exceptional. It compares favourably with most, if not all, other export credit agencies. The independent and flexible structure proposed in this legislation will enhance EFIC's capacity to match competition from its overseas counterparts and meet the needs of Australian exporters into the future. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum.  Debate (on motion by Mr Downer) adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Student Assistance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 amends the Student Assistance Act 1973. It provides for the introduction of the Austudy scheme to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, alterations to the provision of living allowances under the English as a second language scheme, and the introduction of a special appropriations clause. The coalition supports the extension of Austudy to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The entire population of the islands is 500. The Government's expected cost of the initiative is $20,000 annually. Similarly, the coalition has no objection to the alteration of the living allowance for English as a second language administration, or the appropriation provisions for Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I take this opportunity to make some comments on the operation of access to higher education for all who have the capacity and the will to benefit, which is of great importance to the coalition. The coalition appreciates that there are students who face financial difficulties while undertaking higher education. We support the notion that this should not be allowed to become an insurmountable obstacle to tertiary education participation. We also acknowledge the likelihood that with the Government-orchestrated `necessary' recession, the number of students in need of assistance, particularly in the hard-hit rural sector, will increase. </PARA>
<PARA>  The twin goals of the coalition are a new standard of excellence in education and the availability of such excellence to all who are willing and able to pursue it. The coalition remains concerned that the Minister for Higher Education (Mr Baldwin), for all his rhetoric in the House, has still done nothing to alter the reality that the present system of student financial assistance is not operating equitably. There remain many who, whilst genuinely needy, are missing out on Austudy. There is also a considerable weight of evidence to indicate that among students, and in the general community, there are those who are not so needy but are nonetheless in receipt of benefits. In particular, opportunity for many students in rural Australia is continuing to decrease--a theme to which I shall return. </PARA>
<PARA>  Today, more than at any other time in our history, we need to develop our intellectual resources to the fullest, but the reality is that many thousands of potential students are not being provided with the opportunity to be educated to their maximum capacity, and they are not, therefore, able to make the maximum contribution of which they are capable. Their talents are underutilised. Their contribution to our economy, society and culture is lamentably below the level of their potential skills, knowledge and creative ability. If this nation is to rise above the impasse we are at, where every willing individual--whether he or she be from the rural or the metropolitan areas of this country--is to have the opportunity to develop talents and ability in an institution of high standard, there has to be a significant change. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those of us who inhabit this nation are Australians all, but we are two nations in terms of educational opportunity: those of us who are fortunate enough to live in metropolitan Australia and those discriminated against by living in rural or remote Australia. This Government has done nothing to try to bridge this rift. Indeed, its policies have contributed to a disturbing widening of the gulf between these two nations. This Government has demonstrated that it has no interest in those non-metropolitan Australians. Its neglect effectively punishes those who, for a variety of reasons, choose not to live in the cities and big rural towns. </PARA>
<PARA>  To be a non-metropolitan Australian under this Labor Government is to be second class, a member of the B team, a reserve grade Australian. Many rural families are missing out or cannot afford to send their children to school or university because of the cost of transport, board and communications. The inequities and rigidities of student assistance programs at a time of severe rural downturn are, once again, widening the gap between country and city. Many rural families are being forced to abandon children's studies.Given that educational levels among the rural community are already sharply below the national average, it is inequitable and short-sighted for the Government to pursue a policy, the greatest impact of which will be to further widen the gap between standards of education in rural and urban communities.   It has been the coalition that has drawn attention to the plight of rural Australia, which is now hit by a severe recession that has only exacerbated these divisions. In May, the coalition moved successfully in another place for immediate education assistance for families suffering severe financial hardship in this economic crisis. The terms of the coalition's resolution sought to have Austudy made available to families in circumstances in which they would otherwise be excluded by the assets test. The Liberal and National parties were the only parties to put forward anything like a workable proposal which could provide immediate emergency educational assistance to families suffering severe financial hardship. It was aimed at ensuring that immediate assistance could go to those in genuine need. It was a practical and realistic policy to ensure that no child was withdrawn from school or tertiary studies on economic grounds alone. </PARA>
<PARA>  The coalition's proposal, which the Government has not seen fit to adopt, called for hardship provisions that recognise that while assets are related to income-earning ability they can, in some circumstances, operate very unfairly. Hardship provisions allow a person who is experiencing severe financial hardship to receive a benefit, even though that person has assets which would otherwise exclude him or her from the benefit. Each case would be considered on its merits. </PARA>
<PARA>  The coalition advocated emergency assistance through hardship provisions as the appropriate road to take because such assistance targets aid that can be given to those who need it. There are currently assets tests for Austudy, the means tested portion of the assistance to isolated children's scheme, pensions, benefits and the family allowance supplement. Both the pensions and benefits assets tests have hardship provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>  The provisions applying to pensions, for example, provide that, although persons may exceed the assets test, they may be able to receive the benefit if they own an asset which they cannot sell or which it would not be reasonable for them to sell. They cannot borrow against the asset and cannot reasonably be expected to do so. Therefore, they are in severe financial hardship because of the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA>  Severe financial hardship is defined in relation to their total income and their readily available funds. If these funds fall below a specified threshold, they are eligible for assistance. A special income and assets test then applies to determine the level of pension received. As well, persons whose pension is reduced or cancelled because of the assets tests can borrow against their assets at a set rate of interest. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our proposal was not received positively by the Government. In the Budget there was a half-hearted attempt at giving the impression of addressing the problem. But a close look reveals that a narrow application of hardship provisions will mean that only those who are destitute or who are already leaving their farms or whose parents received a social security or veterans pension will be eligible for emergency education assistance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-All very late, and unfortunately many young people have already been withdrawn from education as a result of this delay that has occurred. The coalition also raised with the Government the option of establishing a scheme of rural loans, either at no interest or nominal interest. But the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services has ruled this out until at least 1993--by which time the Minister will, of course, no longer be in office. It is quite wrong that people experiencing severe hardship as a result of the rural crisis should have to wait until 1993, but they now might have to and the election of the Hewson government is the only hope for their salvation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  A report has just been tabled in this Parliament, titled Toward a National Education and Training Strategy for Rural Australians, which paints a dismal picture of rural educational disadvantage. It was begun by the National Board of Employment, Education and Training back in 1989, and it says that it `represents the first attempt by the Board to come to grips with the complex issues of the education and training of rural Australians'. But the problem has been around for years. We have been telling the Government about it, but it has chosen not to hear and not to listen. Whether it now will listen to the report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training will be interesting to observe. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even before this report was published, there was overwhelming evidence as to the existence of two Australias. Let me give a brief illustration or two. There is a boarding allowance under the assistance for isolated children's scheme for students who have to live away from home to attend school, at either a boarding school or a hostel, or in private board. But even with the assistance from the assistance for isolated children's scheme, the gap between the basic boarding allowance of $1,500 and the fee of $5,280 charged by the three government boarding schools in New South Wales is $3,780 per student. Allowing for the New South Wales allowance of $600, it means that parents must find $3,100 per student to get them to the so-called free government school. This is not a problem faced by those living in metropolitan Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Hardship is not confined to a handful of cases. In Western Australia, for example, 47 isolated students did not proceed with their boarding school bookings for 1991; 29 had been withdrawn up to May this year; many students have been forced to transfer to distance education; and some have just not proceeded to the upper secondary level. The two largest non-government hostels in New South Wales, at Forbes and Hay, after five years of capacity enrolments, have reported sharp declines in enrolment, with Forbes falling by 17 last year and Hay by 10 this year. This is at a time when school enrolments across the nation are again on the increase. </PARA>
<PARA>  According to the Isolated Children's Parents Association of New South Wales, this is a message which just does not seem to get through to the Government: that the asset value of a rural property and the income generated from it are not necessarily related to profits. It adds:</PARA>
<PARA>Fluctuations (usually downward) in commodity prices, and the vicissitudes of droughts, floods and bushfires can lead to a low or negative income without much short term variation to the asset value. </PARA>
<PARA>A study called Austudy Rural Inequities, produced by the Bendigo CAE, highlights significant confusion about the scheme in rural areas. While it is necessary to provide information on assets, the Austudy guidelines themselves provide no information about how applicants might best estimate their asset value. At the present time, there are major difficulties in the way of assessing property values in many rural areas. In some areas, properties are virtually unsaleable and it is impossible to give them a market value. This needs to be taken into account in the application of the assets test. The Government has failed to address this problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many farmers rely on accountants, but they too suffer from a lack of reliable information on which to base their advice. According to one study quoted in the report, many students in rural Australia have not continued their education following incorrect advice from accountants. There has been a steady accumulation of evidence as to the existence of rural educational disadvantage and, to its credit, the working party which put together the new report has taken note of its forerunners, observing that there have been many recommendations made to both Commonwealth and State governments, but `very few of the recommendations have been implemented'. In fact, a number of submissions draw attention to the plethora of reports on rural education and training needs and the absence of any concerted coordinated action. </PARA>
<PARA>  The findings would not surprise people living in non-metropolitan Australia. They have known for years that they are in `second' Australia not `first' Australia when it comes to educational advantage. The report finds:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . despite considerable effort and expenditure on the part of Commonwealth, State and Territory governments, industry and rural communities themselves, the provision of post-compulsory education and training in and for non-metropolitan Australians remains uneven and inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA>  People living outside the major population centres across Australia are simply not participating in education and training to levels comparable with people living inside the big cities. </PARA>
<PARA>I submit that this is a national disgrace. Where is the urgency in addressing such a divisive and discriminatory situation? To be sure, it is not in the policies of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report does not pull its punches. It notes that it is widely accepted that lower participation rates in education and training are an indicator of disadvantage. One-third of Australians are classified as non-metropolitan and, therefore, in the words of the report, `suffer locational disadvantage'. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>This should be a matter of deep concern to all governments, not only on social justice grounds but on economic grounds as well. If Australia is to have an education and training-led economic recovery, if it is to become a truly clever country, it can ill afford to permit discrimination against one-third of the nation's labour force in terms of access to education and training. </PARA>
<PARA>The economic implications, as distinct from the serious social implications, of this shameful neglect of the `other' Australia are of immense significance.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Business Council of Australia earlier this year commissioned a paper titled Developing Australia's National Competitiveness in which the state of Australia's work force was seen as a major impediment in the way of improving our economic performance. It made the strong point that, in effect, while good human resources are available in Australia, we make poor use of them. Certainly this is the case with the `other' Australia--that Australia the Government does not want to know about. </PARA>
<PARA>  The facts as presented in the report make very disturbing reading. But they will come as no surprise to country communities where the higher education of hundreds, if not thousands, of young rural Australians has been cut short in the past year or two by the Government's steadfast refusal to implement specific hardship provisions for Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me give some examples of rural disadvantages presented in the report. Among non-metropolitan young adults, particularly in the 20 to 24 year age group, the participation rate in higher education is only at half the rate of their metropolitan colleagues. Statistically, rural students are 4 percentage points behind urban students in completing year 12, while remote students were an alarming 9 percentage points behind the rural students. In the 15 to 19 year age group, non-metropolitan participation in higher education ranged from 30 per cent lower than metropolitan participation in New South Wales and Queensland, to 40 per cent lower in Victoria and Western Australia, to 90 per cent lower in South Australia. At less than one per cent, South Australia has the lowest non-metropolitan participation in higher education in both the 15 to 19 year and 20 to 24 year age groups. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That has clearly shocked my colleague the honourable member for Mayo, because of course his electorate is in South Australia and he is aware of the tremendous concern in that State. But I think very few people knew before this report came out that these figures were as shocking as they have been revealed to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I repeat: at less than one per cent, South Australia has the lowest non-metropolitan participation in higher education in both the 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 age groups, a situation the report tentatively attributes to the fact that higher education is concentrated in Adelaide. In its deliberations, the report concludes:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the single most significant factor in the lower participation rates of non-metropolitan people is the obvious one. . . .lack of access, without major dislocation and/or significant personal costs, to the broad range of formal and informal education and training options available in metropolitan areas. </PARA>
<PARA>The two major barriers to participation identified in the report are a perceived poorer quality of service in non-metropolitan regions and inappropriate provision.  The report is decidedly unimpressed with efforts over much of the past decade to increase the participation rates of rural Australians. It notes:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . past efforts to resolve problems of participation and access have proven only marginally effective. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, they have not worked. One piece of disinformation happily laid to rest by this report is that the people of the other Australia are not interested. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>  The Working Party concluded, however, that there was little evidence to indicate that rural people are any more inclined to take a negative view of education and training than are metropolitan people. Rather, a strong commitment to and concern for better education and training provision in rural areas came through in both the submissions and in the consultations. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not as though this Government has simply turned its back on rural problems, letting them fester by callous neglect. It is worse than that. Its policies have actively worked to make things worse, a situation reflected in a concern raised in this report. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report noted a concern, particularly among Victorian rural communities, that the push to amalgamate regional tertiary institutions with large metropolitan universities under the unified national system--that accursed child of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) --may lead to a reduction in their role as regional providers as the administrative power shifts to a metropolitan base. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>  The concern is that special rural participation initiatives such as bridging programs, regional secondary school links and so on may become increasingly marginalised, and therefore financially insecure, in relation to the overall operations of the mega-institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>It is worth putting on record--and this report does in fact record the matter--that one of the few initiatives to have succeeded in this area is the country areas program, an initiative of the former Liberal-National Government introduced in 1982. This program was set up with the aim of improving the educational participation and achievement of students disadvantaged by restricted access to social, cultural and educational activities and services as a result of geographic isolation. </PARA>
<PARA>  A review of the country areas program in 1990 by the National Board of Employment, Education and Training concluded that it has had a significant, positive impact on the quality of rural schooling. The latest report on the scheme states:</PARA>
<PARA>  The strength of the program lies in the soundness of its underlying principles of sharing resources within a region and community participation in the schooling process--both are principles which the Board believes need to be applied to the whole education and training continuum in non-metropolitan Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>It will be most interesting to see how the Government responds to this latest report. As I have noted with regard to higher education, the Government has not been above stealing the coalition's policies, policies they once derided as unworkable and inapplicable. Recommendation No. 6 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>  As a matter of urgency, the Commonwealth, in close consultation with the States and the Northern Territory, review current AUSTUDY assistance schemes and develop new guidelines specifically for financial assistance for rural students undertaking tertiary education and training. </PARA>
<PARA>This is coalition policy and has been for some time. Will the Government now seek to adopt this recommendation as its own?</PARA>
<PARA>  The coalition has repeatedly called for the establishment of a realistic assets test for Austudy. The scheme to date has been bedevilled by administrative deficiencies and is constantly weakened by ongoing allegations of inequity and unfairness in the awarding of benefits. On taking office, a coalition govern-ment will thoroughly review the rules and administration of Austudy to ensure that they are fair to all and that the scheme delivers its advertised benefits smoothly, effectively and efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA>  As conditions permit, a coalition government will work to improve the support given to needy students. Particular regard will also be given to the needs of regional and rural students who have to travel long distances or be accommodated away from home to attend higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>  The assets test on Austudy and the assistance for the isolated children scheme have introduced hardship for some families. The assets test as it applies to the assistance for the isolated children scheme will be abolished by a coalition government and be submitted to searching review to ensure the fairness and equity of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  A coalition government will move swiftly to unite these two Australias into one nation and end the geographical apartheid practised by Labor. We have demonstrated that we in the coalition are the only ones who can look after the interests of non-metropolitan as well as metropolitan Australia and bring them together in a single nation where fairness and equity prevail. </PARA>

The second is to allow changes to the living allowances for English as a second language scheme from 1 July 1991. The scheme has been integrated into the social security payment system with students receiving Job Search or Newstart allowances under the Social Security Act 1991. The Department of Employment, Education and Training will continue to administer the scheme and will reimburse the Department of Social Security for outgoings under it. The amendments serve to amend the current Act so that the scheme will cease to be defined as a current special education assistance scheme but rather redefined as a former special education assistance scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The third area of amendment is to extend the Austudy scheme to students living on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean. The third area of amendment draws my attention and I will devote some time on it. I believe it is worth putting before the House some of the background of this amendment and some very relevant information on the Territory of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. </PARA>
<PARA>  Being the member for the Northern Territory means being a member for one of the most diverse electorates in our country. Honourable members will appreciate the role that the member for the Northern Territory acquires in providing representation for a geographic area greater in size than many European countries, a climatic area that ranges from the arid zone of central Australia to the tropical regions of the Top End and Christmas Island, and a population which represents the widest range of ethnic backgrounds, education skills, social orientations and spiritual beliefs found anywhere in our nation. However, honourable members may not understand that the role of the member for the Northern Territory also includes being the representative in this House of the Territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. </PARA>
<PARA>  My electorate office in Darwin is further from Canberra than that of any other member of this House. Yet it is still another 3,700 kilometres to the farthest point of my electorate, the Cocos Islands. That is a distance I have been fortunate to travel a number of times as the member for the Northern Territory, when I have been fortunate to visit my constituents in Christmas and Cocos Islands. Whenever I spend time on Cocos, I am reminded of the words of Joshua Slocum, who visited the islands in 1897. He espoused his view that the Cocos Islands were `the closest thing I have found to paradise on earth'. </PARA>

Madam Deputy Speaker, I assure you and members of this House that Mr Slocum knew a good thing when he saw it. The Territory of Cocos Islands is made up of 27 coral islands and two separate atolls. For the benefit of the honourable member for Mayo, who made such a curt observation, I point out that the total area is only 14 square kilometres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The inhabitants of the Cocos Islands live on the two main islands, West Island and Home Island. There are around 200 people on West Island who are involved in, or are the families of those involved in, the island's administration, airport, animal quarantine station or private sector enterprises. On Home Island lives the mainly Cocos Malay community of around 400 people. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1886 the British Crown, which had annexed the islands some 30 years earlier, granted all land above the high water mark to George Clunies-Ross and his heirs in perpetuity. Australia's first legal link with the islands was not until 1955, when sovereignty was formally transferred from the United Kingdom to Australia. In 1978 the Australian Government purchased the vast majority of the land on the islands and subsequently transferred title to that land to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Council in 1979. Finally, in an act of self-determination in 1984, the Cocos Malay community chose to integrate with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The information I am putting before the House today is important in that this historical groundwork is being built on by the passage of this legislation. The move to full integration of the Cocos Islands into the Commonwealth of Australia has been a long process. Earlier this year I was privileged to witness the signing of the memorandum of understanding between the Australian Government and the Cocos Islands Council. Under the provisions of that memorandum, the Australian Government is committed to ensuring mainland standards are reached and maintained for the population of the islands and that the legal regime applying to the islands is normalised. From 1 July 1991 the residents have been brought within the ambit of Australian income tax arrangements. A phasing in of full taxation obligations is currently under way. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Student Assistance Amendment Bill (No. 2) before us today will ensure that the citizens of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are extended their rights in relation to Austudy. This is one more significant step in the process of integration and it is extremely important for those people who work in the quarantine station, who are teachers from the mainland and work at the school or who work in the health services or the administration of the island for the island community. There are a number of people who are involved in ensuring that this particular matter was brought to the attention of the Government. I will come to them in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important to recognise the important developments that are occurring in the Australian Territories of Christmas Island and Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean. Australian citizens, whose first language is just as likely to be Cocos Malay, Malay or Mandarin as it is to be English, are developing a long term future as part of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst I am emphasising the importance of this particular piece of legislation to the community on Cocos Islands, I will mention briefly the implications for other Australians elsewhere and those people who benefit from other aspects of this legislation--that is, the people on Christmas Island. </PARA>
<PARA>  Before I do that, I would like to say that the specific problem with Austudy in relation to the community on Cocos Islands was brought to my attention through the efforts of Claire and Ian White on Cocos, who sought the right for their daughters, Simone and Emily, to receive assistance with their studies. It is directly through their efforts that this legislation passes through this House. They are to be commended because they were able to bring it to my attention and therefore to the Government's. I also commend the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) for his speedy analysis of the difficulties that were encountered and his action to remedy them. </PARA>
<PARA>  The point that I would like to make is that, whilst the White family may not remain on Cocos Islands long enough to enjoy the full fruit of their efforts, they have made an important contribution as citizens for others who follow and they deserve special congratulations. They merit very special consideration because, as I have been trying to demonstrate to the House, they live in the most isolated of circumstances. Gaining a high school education for their children requires their children to live off the island. They have been good enough to work in this community in a very isolated situation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those people who worked with them have endeavoured to ensure that as far as possible the services that they receive in terms of education for their children have been of a normal standard, especially if they have come from the mainland or are there for only a short time. Continuity often requires, and a preference is made for, keeping their children on the mainland. It is their efforts as citizens--I cannot emphasise this too much--that have enabled them to do something, and they have achieved a very good result for themselves and those who will follow them. They need to be commended for it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have to emphasise that it was the strong support of the administration of the Cocos Islands communities--particularly from the Administrator, Barry Cunningham, a former member of this House, who provided a great deal of assistance to us--that ensured that we had the appropriate information to place before the Minister responsible. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important that we understand also that there are a range of individuals on the island who will benefit directly as a result of these sorts of changes. It essentially means that the mainland based employees who worked in the community and who were concerned about the education of their children will be attracted to stay. They are now in a position where they can get Austudy entitlements which they hitherto could not get. </PARA>
<PARA>  The people who will benefit include, among others, the Chairman of the Cocos Island Council which these mainland employees service, Haji Wahin bin Bynie, and Tarson bin Yapat, the Chairman of the Cocos Island Cooperative. These people benefit in a very material way from the services that are supplied by the administration of these mainland based employees, who will now have an additional reason for being able to make judgments about staying on the Cocos Islands because they will now have access to these Austudy arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is relevant that I finish my contribution at the point where I started in this debate. A number of statements were made by the honourable member for Goldstein in relation to whether this Government was dealing appropriately with people in remote areas. Some of his statements are just so far wide of the mark that he ought to look at the administration--and I will again use a parochial interest--of the Northern Territory to see how a government of his persuasion has actually undermined the processes of education for the most disadvantaged of Australia's people, Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  This afternoon I had the pleasure to have visiting me in this Parliament nine Aboriginal teaching assistants, trainee teachers, from the communities of Willowra and Alekarenge. These teachers are undergoing a remote area teacher education program based at Batchelor College. They expressed a great deal of concern, not only to myself, but also to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), about the way in which educational services were being provided for people who live in remote communities. They were concerned about decisions which had been made in the recent past by the Northern Territory Government which materially affect the outcomes of education for these people. They have looked at the funding of these schools, reassessed their administrative arrangements and changed the staffing formula so that now we have situations where schools such as the one at Alekarenge have been downgraded and are losing teachers. </PARA>
<PARA>  That has a direct bearing on two things: the quality of the education which is being provided to the students of the Alekarenge school and the availability of jobs for teachers who have trained at Alekarenge and through the RATE program at Batchelor. The problem we have--and this is happening throughout the Northern Territory--is that as a result of quite deliberate decisions made by a conservative government the level of education and the adequateness of the education programs being offered to Aboriginal Territorians is suffering. Job opportunities for Aboriginal Territorians who want to undergo training are limited, and the ability for people to undergo training as a result of receiving a good basic education is being affected. As I am sure you will know, Madam Deputy Speaker, unless we provide that platform, provide the fundamentals of an education through an adequate school education, and thereby provide an opportunity for people to go on to higher education, there will be no success. </PARA>
<PARA>  In terms of the statistics which are being proffered by the Opposition, one would have to say that the honourable member for Goldstein ought to look at what the Northern Territory Government is doing. He referred to higher education. Let me tell the honourable member that the Northern Territory Government signed a higher education agreement with this Government for the funding of Batchelor College. That was a triennial agreement which guaranteed that the Northern Territory Government would provide funds for particular courses. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have learnt in recent months that the Northern Territory Government has indicated to the Batchelor College council that it will not have the funds which it had been promised. Effectively, that means that the educational opportunities for people such as the people from Alekarenge who might in this instance be interested in undertaking health worker training are being affected, because courses which they thought were going to be offered by Batchelor College as a result of an agreement with the Northern Territory Government have been materially affected by the fact that the funds which they thought were going to be available may not be available if the Northern Territory Government pursues this course. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is gross irresponsibility and it is something which affects Aboriginal Territorians from across the Northern Territory. I suggest to the honourable member for Goldstein that if he is fair dinkum he will ring up the Northern Territory Minister for education, employment and training and say to him, `It is about time you lifted your game, buddy; it is about time you did what we think you ought to do'--and, if one gauges what the honourable member for Goldstein said today, that is to provide adequate and appropriate educational opportunities for people who live in rural and remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, the problem is that they are black. The Northern Territory Government is known for the way in which it discriminates. In this particular instance there is absolutely no doubt that it has chosen and targeted Batchelor College for special treatment, despite an agreement with this Government on higher education funding--signed by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services. The Government has broken the agreement and thereby affected in the most obvious way educational opportunities for Aboriginal Territorians. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is nothing short of scandalous, in my view, and the women who were here today--the teachers--were expressing the frustration not only of themselves but also of all the other teachers who are in training at Batchelor College, because their futures are at risk, for two reasons: job opportunities and training opportunities. These people are in a training mode and they have now got no guarantee that, at the end of their training, jobs will be provided. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am delighted to rise to support the Student Assistance Amendment Bill, which is designed to amend the Student Assistance Act 1973. In particular, it is appropriate that we extend Austudy benefits to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Unfortunately, I am not so certain that I could defend with any degree of ferocity our system of student financial assistance, better known as Austudy. Austudy has become big business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Student financial assistance of all classes, according to the Budget Papers for 1991-92, will involve an expenditure of $1.6 billion--$1,600m--worth of Commonwealth funds. That is big business. In this financial year it represents an 18.5 per cent increase in spending from 1990-91. Austudy itself this year will consume $1.25 billion, which is a 22.1 per cent increase on last financial year. By any standards, Austudy represents a big slice of the Federal Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remind the House that in April this year this House's Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, of which I am a member and the Deputy Chairman, tabled a report on student financial assistance. In that report we made some 28 recommendations to the Government regarding improvements which we saw as being necessary to make Austudy relevant, practical and of better assistance to the students to whom it is directed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to make a few comments regarding the Government's response to that report, not in terms of a paper tabled in this House, but in terms of the Budget--because the Budget is the practical response to any report, is it not? Our first and second recommendations said that the Government should develop clear policy objectives and performance indicators for the Austudy program and then assess the effectiveness of such programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, the Budget response was nothing. I grant that the Department of Employment, Education and Training has undertaken a review into all student financial assistance--another review--by hiring an outside consultant to consider whether the whole scheme itself ought to be  modified or what other mechanisms could be taken to make Austudy work properly. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remind the House that Austudy is really a revision of the 1974 TEAS system, which was brought in by the Whitlam Government at a time when it abolished all fees for tertiary places. Austudy has grown, and while it has grown there have been many inequities--at least we, a bi-partisan committee of this House, felt that there have been many inequities. The most important of those is the fact that the system itself has no clear policy statement. What an indictment of the Minister--it has no statement and no measurement of objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>  In recommendation No. 3 the Committee recommended that the Government change taxable income as a method of assessing eligibility--that is to say that taxable income, itself, is no longer a true measure of an individual's ability to support children in tertiary education. We have long since accepted the fringe benefits tax as being a reasonable tax and many companies have reorganised their employees' benefits to include fringe benefits which are now taxed to the company. But because they are taxed to the company, the Taxation Office has no idea which individuals receive which benefits. Therefore, if an individual elects to receive a low salary and high fringe benefits, that individual's children may be eligible for Austudy, while another individual who has no fringe benefits is denied Austudy access. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, the Minister did not think our argument made much sense--I think, probably, because it is very difficult. The system of fringe benefits taxes ought to be changed so that it is the individual who is taxed and not the company. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recommendation No. 5 involved an increase in marginal family income to 75 per cent of average weekly earnings; a stepped abatement rate;  benefits to cease at twice average weekly earnings;  and a minimum allowance of $20 per week. People can now get Austudy allowances at $1 per week, which seems to be rather silly and expensive. In any case, the Budget Papers did abolish the tapered sibling test, introduced a flat deduction of $3,700 for each child aged over 16 years who is in full time education, and raised the minimum payment from $50 per annum to $250 per annum--not the $1,000 that we recommended. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's response in the Budget did not really address our Committee's concern, but the flat rate of deductions will reduce the upper limit at which benefits are received. So I guess in that respect we have to be happy about it. We recommended very clearly and strongly that the means and assets test free component of the assistance to isolated children's scheme be increased from $1,500 to $2,250. The Government has not seen fit to make any comment regarding that recommendation, nor is there any increase in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recommendation No. 7 calls on the Government to examine additional means of assisting rural students. As the honourable member for Goldstein pointed out quite vividly tonight, the Government has made some adjustments to the assets test with respect to part C of the rural adjustment scheme. It will assist some families on non-viable farms, but we reckon they will be very few and probably only those that are gone anyway. The whole point of the hardship measures that we have recommended--and continue to recommend--to the Government is to try to save some families; to try to keep them on their farms and let their children have an education. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recommendation No. 8 calls for the discount on allowable assets for businesses to be discontinued. Madam Deputy Speaker, with respect, I could not support that recommendation myself. Unfortunately, I had the Parliament House flu the night that we finally debated that report. You know what the Parliament House flu is like, Madam Deputy Speaker. At the same time, I was still smoking very heavily and I was in no fit shape to argue about this particular recommendation. But since that time I am pleased to advise the House that, because I was having trouble breathing, I have decided to discontinue the use of that noxious weed and it is terrific to be able to breath again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In any case, in relation to a discount on business assets, I consider that there should be, in any system of assets testing, a difference between productive and non-productive assets. Those people who wish to put their money into yachts, furs and diamond rings must be treated differently from those who put their money into productive businesses, including farms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Recommendation No. 9 concerns a survey of student finances. The Department tells us that it will undertake that this year. Recommendation 10 calls for allowable personal income for students to be increased to $8,000 and for the abatement rate to be decreased from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. It seems to me, and it seemed to the Committee, that it is really crazy to say to students who are in receipt of Austudy that if they work--if they try to help themselves through their own part time work effort--they will be penalised through the Austudy system, compared with another student who says, `I couldn't be bothered working'. It does not seem to make much sense. In any case, the Government ignored us. It did increase the allowable income up to $5,000, but it left the abatement rate alone. So a student loses 50c in the dollar if he or she wants to work. </PARA>
<PARA>  The independent status at age 21 is the biggest single issue which was raised by all of the student representative councils that we spoke to all over Australia. The fact that Austudy will not allow a student to be classed as an independent student until he or she is aged 25 is certainly out of kilter with society and all sorts of social welfare systems--although I make the point that Austudy should not be considered a social welfare payment. It is the biggest area of complaint and the Budget did not address it. Some day soon someone will have to address this very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recommendation 12 deals with the spouse abatement rate and income rate. The Government has made some allowance in the Budget for dependent children, but that does not address the Committee's concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recommendation 13 calls for Austudy to be paid to year 11 students who are under 16 years of age. We note that, in Queensland, students start year 11 at age 15 and some students seem to miss out because they are not 16 when they are in year 11. The Government's response to the committee report entitled The Restless Years--Inquiry into Year 12 retention rates rejected the payment of Austudy to 15-year-olds. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recommendation 14 deals with assistance to students at private colleges and universities. We are recommending that Austudy should go to the student, not the institution. The Budget has increased Austudy payments to private providers of TAFE-type courses, but not to private universities. That means that, if a student goes to Bond University and he or she is poor, that student cannot get Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recommendation 15 concerns the payment of Austudy to students aged 19 years and over who repeat year 12. The Budget does seem to provide some additional funds for adult secondary education, but we are unsure as to whether the Government has met our recommendation requirement. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recommendation No. 16 was a non-applicable external students recommendation. Recommendation 17 deals with a separate level of associate diploma. In this respect, we congratulate the Government, which has accepted our recommendation; likewise recommendation 18. Austudy will now be available to those people who are trying to upgrade their overseas qualifications and we thank the Government for that response. There has been no comment by the Government about recommendation 19, self-assessment. In relation to the development of expert computers, recommendation 20, the Government is talking about an expert system by 1993. We are not sure when; we would like more information. </PARA>
<PARA>  In recommendation 21 we said that DEET, as a huge department with a huge bureaucracy, was responding poorly to the requirements of students in giving them information quickly regarding whether they were eligible for benefits under this very complex scheme. I remind the House that any grants scheme is, by its very nature, complex. If one is trying to target funds to specific students it is very difficult to do that without asking many questions across income ranges, assets, work experience and a whole range of qualifications that have to be built into the system. That is why grants systems are so hard to administer. </PARA>
<PARA>  In any case, we felt that DEET was doing a very poor job and that if it did not raise its game we should probably transfer the Austudy system to the Department of Social Security, which seems better able to cope with such clients at a local level. That is not applicable to the Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Before dinner I was going through an analysis of the House of Representatives Standing Committee report into student financial assistance as it relates to this year's Budget. Recommendation No. 23 was to upgrade and decentralise service delivery. It is our understanding that through the Budget some resources have been appropriated to improve client services. For that we are thankful, but probably it has not gone as far as we would have wished. Recommendations 24 to 28 have not been considered in the Budget context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There is no doubt whatsoever that education is one of the most productive and beneficial activities available to Australian society to improve our lot in the world today. But I remind this House that education is expensive. The education budget amounts altogether, including employment services, to some $13 billion, and in anybody's terms that is a lot of money. </PARA>
<PARA>  Demand today exceeds supply, and demand in the future unfortunately will exceed supply. One of the biggest problems that we have relates to supply. We have created within society a desire for further education, as parents have decided that it is appropriate for their children to receive tertiary education, to go further, to learn more than they did, and students have recognised that in order for them to have jobs in the future they will need to be better qualified, better educated, more literate and more numerate than their parents. But with all this expectation we have created a crisis in education, and the crisis is one of supply. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have said before in this place, and I will say it again, that it is certainly possible to have access without equity but it is impossible to have equity without access. There can be no social justice if there are no places. If there is demand in society for education which cannot be fulfilled, we must address that situation as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>  Two days ago I read into Hansard some alarming statistics produced by the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission, VIPSEC, which in essence show that for the next triennium, and the triennium after that, we will have very substantial unmet demand in the State of Victoria both for university places and for TAFE places. If we as a Commonwealth government are to do our job, then we have to consider that issue. </PARA>
<PARA>  The access versus equity issue also affects Austudy, which is what we are here to debate. When we look at Austudy, consideration has to be given as to whether the $1.6 billion worth of total student financial assistance this year is being wisely spent or whether we need to change the system in order to take some of those dollars and put them into facilities--that is, space, universities--and teachers, and materials for the teachers to teach with. </PARA>
<PARA>  I maintain that the debate is one of cost sharing. In considering cost sharing, one must consider the public benefit versus the private benefit and who will pay for what. In the Australian education context, the cost sharing must be considered between taxpayers, students, parents, partners of students, institutions and employers. It is the balance between all of them that at the moment we have somehow got wrong. We have it wrong because we cannot meet the demand that we have created, that is, what Australian citizens demand for themselves and for their children. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no question but that, in the future, as our technology increases, our society will demand a more literate and more numerate population. The population itself demands the services that will allow it to be more literate, more numerate and have a greater understanding of science, geography, history and mathematics. I maintain that we must re-examine the Austudy system in order to re-examine the balance of expenditure between student financial assistance and general education. (Time expired)</PARA>

This is one of my pet topics and I take the opportunity, when it is given to me, to speak about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1991 is not exactly momentous, I suppose, except to a few people of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands who will gain access to Austudy. Seeing that we are looking at the maximum expenditure of $20,000 for that purpose, there are either very few of them or one or two who are going to hit the jackpot well and truly. The legislation as such is not of extreme consequence but, once again, it does raise the whole spectre of student financial assistance. It is really that topic and Austudy in particular that I want to speak about. </PARA>
<PARA>  I listened with some interest to the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) who gave us a detailed history lesson on Australia's relationship with the Cocos Islands. I found that rather informative, although it did not really address the main issues which I think are important, that is, the question of Austudy. I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. The extension of Austudy to the extent of $20,000 raises a number of questions in my mind, particularly having been involved in both the Committee's deliberations and the bringing down of its report on student financial assistance. In that report we found, of course, that the scheme was lacking in so many respects. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) actually went to a great deal of trouble to go through the Committee's recommendations and also to deal in some detail with the Government's Budget response to those recommendations. In fairness to the Government--and I am prepared to give the Minister at the table some benefit of doubt here--our report may have come down a little bit late for it to have a full impact on the Budget. Seeing that the Committee has not yet had from the Minister a response to its recommendations, we may have some good news coming through soon in the form of a detailed response which will address, perhaps in a little more depth, the Committee's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA>  I do not intend to canvass each and every recommendation that the Committee made, except to add to what the honourable member for La Trobe has said in broad terms, that is, the fact that the Committee members-- certainly those on this side of the House--are particularly disappointed with the Budget in so far as it addressed the Committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>  We can only hope that there will be better news ahead for us, because that was one particular exercise undertaken by the Committee that we felt was of some moment to those of us involved in it. Having received many representations and submissions from all sorts of groups, we suddenly became aware--not that we were not before--that this was an area of great concern within the community. This matter has constantly been controversial. We have gone through a whole series of changes, updates and adjustments to the whole subject of student financial assistance, and now there is Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee, in its deliberations, was effectively catapulted into action by the Auditor-General's report into the effectiveness and efficiency of Austudy. That particular Auditor-General's report identified some major deficiencies with Austudy. I forget the number, but it was very significant. To the Department's credit--and I do not wish to overkill, because to a large extent this is now history--I was assured only today by the Auditor-General's department that in the not too distant future it will look at Austudy again. I expect that most of the deficiencies that were identified in that previous audit will have been rectified and possibly now the scheme is working much more effectively than it was at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for La Trobe alluded to the fact that one of the Committee's recommendations was that the Government develop clear policy objectives and performance indicators and assess effectiveness. That was the underlying, fundamental or basic concern that the Committee had in its deliberations. It realised that here was this enormous Government program with expenditure of well over $1 billion, and possibly as much as $1 1/2 billion, but there was no clear indication of what the expectations of the program actually were. That recommendation of the Committee was fundamental and the Budget Papers have addressed that by saying that there is to be a review carried out. A review has been commenced that will assist its effectiveness and will canvass options that may be available. There are a wide range of options that may be available for student financial assistance, and hopefully a number of them will be canvassed. </PARA>
<PARA>  We do not yet know whether the review is a full examination of the alternatives, but I hope that it is. I expect that, if it is to be a helpful and comprehensive review, it will need to go beyond just looking at Austudy as it stands and perhaps think a little laterally about some of the alternatives. I think that it was fairly clear from the Employment, Education and Training Committee's deliberations that people were not satisfied with Austudy in terms of what it was delivering. There were numerous concerns about it and those sorts of concerns were submitted to the Committee for its consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am hopeful that the review will result in concrete objectives or performance indicators and I am also hopeful that there will be a fairly complete examination of possible alternatives. I challenge those who are undertaking that review to look a little beyond the current scheme to what better options there are for the expenditure of that enormous amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA>  I was looking back today over some of the submissions that were made to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I think one of the most significant ones was from the National Union of Students, the NUS. In reading over that submission, I thought it made some very good points. Perhaps, in this context, where we are thinking a little laterally about student financial assistance, I could mention the criteria that it established and submitted as the sort of criteria that ought to exist for a student financial assistance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  The NUS submitted, firstly, that there should be inherent in the scheme an incentive to enrol. I think that is a good point. Any student financial assistance scheme should have that in-built incentive to participate in tertiary education in particular. Secondly, following from that, there should be an incentive to remain enrolled. One of the criticisms offered of the scheme as we listened to people was that that incentive to remain enrolled was not always there. In fact, there were some very positive disincentives, not the least of which was the difficulty for students to survive on Austudy, which was constantly highlighted. The answer I frequently hear to that is that it is not meant to be a living allowance as such; it is meant to be a support scheme. The question, nevertheless, came up constantly as to how students could live on Austudy and the maximum amount they could actually earn without starting to lose their Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA>  We recommended, not without a considerable amount of consideration, that the allowable personal income be increased to $8,000. The reason why we picked on $8,000 with Austudy was that that then brought students up to what we thought was pretty much a subsistence level of weekly income. That would be around $250 a week. We could not for the life of us in all our deliberations find how it was possible to live on anything less than that amount. We also recommended a decrease in the abatement rate. However, the Budget response--and I mention it in the context I used earlier; it may be only an interim response--increases the allowable income by another $1,000, taking it up to $5,000, and there is no change in the abatement rate. </PARA>
<PARA>  In terms of that second criterion--that a student financial assistance scheme should provide an incentive to remain enrolled--we need to recognise that that incentive, in a lot of respects, is not there, because students are constantly battling to survive on Austudy, even if they have part time income to the extent of what will now be allowed, that is, $5,000. It is still not very much money, because the incentive may not be there. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is not to say that I believe for one moment that the life of a student was meant to be easy. I think all of us who have been students look back to our student days and wonder how we survived, but one way or another we got by, for example, through part time work. Maybe it is a time of life when part of the challenge of getting through tertiary education is to live in that way. We are not suggesting that students should lead the life of Riley, but there needs to be a fairly realistic appraisal of what a student needs to live on in order to be comfortable enough to be able to pursue his or her studies fairly diligently. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third criterion mentioned by the National Union of Students was that any student financial assistance scheme should be targeted to the most needy students. I do not think there is any doubt at all that that is fundamental. I do not think there is any argument with that being the objective of the Government's approach. Whether or not it actually achieves that is a bigger question. The implication in that submission was that the scheme was not necessarily reaching the most needy. There were many at least anecdotal accounts of students who are clearly not needy and who are accessing Austudy, not necessarily fraudulently--although that in itself was a consideration. The fact was that there were many ways of circumventing the testing that was required for assets and income. </PARA>
<PARA>  There were a lot of jokes floating around about students arriving at university in their BMWs while actually living on Austudy. In the minds of the student organisations there was plenty of evidence around to suggest that, in many cases, Austudy was not reaching those whom it should have been reaching. In the study we carried out there was no doubt that that was the case. </PARA>
<PARA>  The member for La Trobe mentioned one area that we are particularly concerned about. At present the Government does not appear to have taken seriously the way in which fringe benefits income can be manipulated. If the Government is not aware of the extent of a person's fringe benefits, that person can be taking a significant amount of income in fringe benefits and still pass the income test, which is not the intention of the scheme at all. More work needs to be done to make sure that Austudy is targeted at the most needy students. We on this side of the House regard that as fundamental. We think that any welfare payments should be targeted at those who are in need. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fourth criterion mentioned by the National Union of Students was that any such scheme should be simple to administer and to understand and, finally, that it should be fair. It was clear to the Committee that the system was by no means simple either to administer or to understand. One of the major criticisms of the scheme was its complexity. A great deal of time was spent deliberating on how the forms could be simplified. I suppose that, no matter what type of scheme is involved, there is a tendency towards overkill in the number of questions that are asked. I know that this problem is being looked at and that a number of attempts have been made to improve it. I do not think that we are there yet and I do not think the Department does, either; nevertheless, there is a need for those sorts of schemes to be simple to administer and to understand. They should also be fair. </PARA>
<PARA>  The NUS said that the administrative basis of Austudy is, unfortunately, far from simple. The Committee, in its report, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>  The Austudy rules and regulations failed dismally on any test of plain English. Because the scheme is so complex, the regulations continue to remain complex. </PARA>
<PARA>There is still work to be done in that respect. The Auditor-General's report that we were acting on also pointed out that a major weak point in Austudy's processing procedures was the handling of inquiries. There is no doubt in my mind that, up to a point, that matter has been addressed. However there are still concerns in the community, and there is room for improvement. I know that the Department will look into this as a matter of priority, so I do not wish to overemphasise that point. </PARA>
<PARA>  The National Union of Students put to the Committee, as a matter of priority, that the independent status age should be lowered from 25 years to 21 years. The Committee regarded that as a key recommendation and supports the view that it should occur. The Minister would be aware that the Committee undertook a costing in relation to that recommendation. Although I do not recall the exact figure, it was not a significant amount. It was certainly in the tens of millions of dollars. The need to reduce that age was the greatest area of complaint in terms of the fairness of Austudy. This matter has not been addressed in the Budget. When the Minister responds in detail to the Committee's report, he may be prepared to pick that recommendation up for future attention, because the Committee is not happy with it at all. </PARA>
<PARA>  While the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services is in the chamber-- obviously, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training could not stay--I will raise a matter which I want him to comment on tonight; that is, the extension of financial assistance to students at private institutions. This matter is addressed in the Committee's report. In the Budget, the Government went a small way towards that by extending Austudy to private and TAFE-type courses. </PARA>
<PARA>  But what about universities, including Bond University? As I have said in this House already once this week, Bond University is a shining example of how a private university can succeed. It is producing quality graduates, it is working towards economic viability and it is providing a tremendous boost to the local economy by attracting overseas students. It is providing students with a choice and, ultimately, it is freeing up places in the hopelessly overcrowded public system. </PARA>
<PARA>  Yet although students at Bond University are there at no cost to the public purse-- unlike those in public universities--they continue to be discriminated against by this Government. The Committee was a bipartisan committee--though, in a sense, I was outnumbered. Nevertheless it accepted that point. I challenge the Government to explain why it continues to discriminate against institutions like Bond University. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- It was not originally my intention to speak on the Student Assistance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. In my years in Parliament I have made many speeches on the subject of student assistance. However, a speech was made earlier in the debate that I wish to develop a little further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I have been involved in education in the Federal Parliament ever since I have been here, which is 17 years. I have done my turn as member and chairman of my Party's education committee, particularly when we were in government. I have been on all the parliamentary committees on education and I have made many speeches on the subject. Along the way I have given an opinion on a matter which I think we can now seriously address--that is, the participation rates in tertiary education of low income rural students. </PARA>
<PARA>  After its election in 1972, the Whitlam Government abolished fees for tertiary education. Many times over the years there has been debate in this place about the effect of fees on access to tertiary education by students from low income backgrounds. Of course the major plank of Labor's reason for abolishing fees for tertiary education was to give equity and access to economically disadvantaged students. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, for the amount of resources and for all the flow-on implications that this decision has had, there simply has not been the outcome that was predicted or that one would have hoped for. The percentage of students attending tertiary institutions full time who come from the lower economic group has not risen to the degree that had been predicted. </PARA>
<PARA>  In various debates I have ventured an opinion as to why I thought the statistics appear to give this outcome. It is only now, after nearly 20 years experience of fee free tertiary education, that we are starting to get some evidence of what is a core problem of access to tertiary education by students from low income families. In the speech this evening of the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), which I hope the Minister for Employment, Education and Training heard--I expect he has been briefed on it by staff, but I hope he did actually hear it--he referred at quite some length to a report, for which I gather the Isolated Children's Parents Association takes some credit, on participation rates of students from the country and the difference in participation rates between students from country areas and those from urban areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  On a number of occasions I have been slanged by members of the Government because 60 per cent of my seat is located on the Gold Coast. The Gold Coast has a fairly affluent image  because there is a lot of up-front living there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There might be a reason for it in the electorate of the honourable member for Grey. I suspect it might be the same reason as in my electorate. One reason my electorate has such a low income per household is the high proportion of rural families there. The very high rural component does have its effect on the average income in Moncrieff. It is not only the rural areas that have this effect. There are also many other low income areas in Moncrieff. We have to be careful about the assumptions we draw about particular locations, affluence and so on. We really ought to look at the figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The figures that I have referred to, put forward by the Isolated Children's Parents Association, show a quite tragic discrepancy between city and country in terms of access to tertiary education. Governments of both persuasions in the last 20 years have put enormous sums of money into supporting students in tertiary education, but there seems to be something fundamentally wrong with the policies in place for one to get such discrepancies. I am not sure whether the honourable member for Grey heard the speech by the honourable member for Goldstein, who referred to the fact that, for example, in South Australia, there is a 90 per cent discrepancy between urban and rural participation in tertiary education. The honourable member indicates that he is aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that this is something that the Government ought to address quite urgently. As I have said, it is something I have had a hunch about for years, and something I have talked about over the years, but now we actually have some statistics. There is not equality of access, and the Government needs to face it. It needs to show that it cares about rural poor as well as urban poor. I am not just referring to the farmer's son or daughter. The fact is that in country towns the average income is significantly lower than the average income in urban areas, yet there are very much larger costs associated with rural students' access to tertiary education. The extension of high schools throughout Australia in the last two or three decades has certainly made secondary education much more accessible for rural children, but tertiary institutions have not spread to the same extent. Nor should they. </PARA>
<PARA>  Tertiary institutions are extremely expensive to establish. It is, I think, a far more effective solution to bring students from less populated areas to the institution. That does not mean I think they all have to be in capital cities. Far from it! I believe we need rather more expenditure on tertiary education on the Gold Coast, for example. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Gold Coast, one of the areas that is thought to be reasonably accessible to education, has a university college which, as I recall, has been established only in the last five years--for less time than I have been a local member. It is still a small institution, although it is growing rapidly. It offers excellent courses, but the variety of courses is necessarily extremely limited. The great majority of would-be tertiary students on the Gold Coast go outside the Gold Coast to get their education. If they want to be doctors, for example, they must go to the University of Queensland in Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many times I have conveyed to this House the great difficulty that this poses for Gold Coast parents. Because of distance, students cannot comfortably travel daily from the Gold Coast to the University of Queensland-- Griffith University is more accessible--unless the student's parents are well heeled enough for the student to be given a motor car of his or her own, and that would apply to only a very small minority of students. Therefore, most of those students have to domicile in Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are many parents who are not happy about their offspring living in flats in the city--and I do not blame them. I do not think one should say that, if people live three or four to a flat or a house, they can manage on the assistance that is available. Many parents prefer their children to live in college. In particular, parents of girls prefer this because of the support and protection that it gives to young women living in the city whilst they are away from the support and protection of their families at home. </PARA>
<PARA>  The policies of this Government have made it extremely difficult for a family to support a son or a daughter in a university college. That is just the Gold Coast situation. In the country areas one finds a very much more difficult situation. We must move away from the thought that the reason incomes in country areas are so low is that farmers arrange their finances to look low--a notion that the Government puts forward from time to time. The fact is that, because Austudy is now assets tested and because the Government has put into legislative practice its propaganda, the percentage of enrolments of rural students is dropping dramatically, as was instanced earlier in this debate. This just will not do. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government started from a poor base in terms of participation in tertiary education by rural students, and it has dealt that situation a savage blow by its attitude to Austudy. It should face its responsibility for access to tertiary education by all students and realise that its policies make it extremely difficult for students from rural areas to access tertiary education. The Government's latest move on assets testing for Austudy has been unreasonable and has had diabolical results. </PARA>
<PARA>  The parents of children in rural areas care no less about the access to education by their sons and daughters than do city parents. If the assets testing of Austudy were fair, there would not have been the effect on enrolment of students from rural areas that has occurred. It has been an unfair thing to do. Rural parents are not capable of supporting their sons and daughters in tertiary education in the way the Government expected. I call on the Government to review the situation and to look closely at this report and the figures in it now that solid figures are available. I ask the Government to admit that it made a mistake and to extend equity of access to all young Australians, which is this Government's proud boast. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I had not intended to speak on the Student Assistance Amendment Bill (No. 2), but the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) virtually invited me to do so. She has made a positive contribution to this debate. On a number of occasions I have drawn attention to the position of people who are denied Austudy because of the amount of money they have, and virtually they have to set up a second home. Many of these people are not farmers. They are battling fitters and turners, boilermakers and other people who have just above the amount of money involved, so denying them the advantage of Austudy. The honourable member for Moncrieff has summed up the position particularly well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  One of the tragedies is that the bureaucracy which tends to advise Ministers does not get out of its ivory tower in Canberra but makes carte blanche statements across the board and has not a clue what things are like in regional and rural Australia.

<PARA>  I represent 86.2 per cent of the landmass of South Australia and, with the redistribution that is coming up, I will represent 92 per cent of the State. The people who live in country and regional Australia are denied access to universities because in many instances they do not get Austudy. If somebody who lives in a city where there is a university is denied Austudy, at least that person lives at home. If somebody who lives in the country and is just above the limit to get Austudy for his children, he has really got to set up a second home. In many instances the parents cannot afford a unit or flat, which the honourable member for Moncrieff says they do not like--but they just cannot afford it, anyway. </PARA>
<PARA>  Judging by the figures, the people who go on to secondary and university education are those who live in the cities, because the same opportunities do not exist for people who live in the country; they are really cut off from these opportunities. It behoves the Government to do something about it. We used to talk about decentralisation. It is a word that is never used any more because every policy today is a centralised policy, one of the latest being the better cities program. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am glad that the honourable member for Moncrieff has highlighted the problem. As a regional and rural member, I would think that, right across the spectrum of politics, people would agree with her. She made a very positive and good contribution. I could quite easily have got up here and said, `Hear, hear! I completely agree with her', and then sat down. The Minister really needs to take this problem on board. It is a genuine problem. Regardless of which side of politics we come from, we need to address it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Governments come and go, but the same public servants are there regardless of who is in government. They need to get the message. The responsibility lies with Ministers, who need to get out into the electorate to talk to people at the grassroots level and try to do something for all Australians. I have tried to advocate a way to redress the problem which the honourable member for Moncrieff has genuinely raised, that is, that anybody who lives outside of, say, a 150 kilometre radius of a city should be means-test free. That would provide not only for those people to get some assistance to send their kids to university but also an incentive for people to remain in regional and country Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not only for farmers; it is also for people in cities such as Whyalla, those who work in lead smelters in places such as Port Pirie, and people who work in the railways and powerhouses in places such as Port Augusta. All have that problem. It is something that we need to genuinely look at. What needs to happen is that perhaps regional and rural members need to get together to press the point more. I concur with the honourable member for Moncrieff. I think she has put forward a very significant contribution. I can only agree with her. </PARA>

The legislation itself is obviously of a fairly minor, technical nature, and I am not aware of any controversy about the specific provisions of the Bill, so I will not have anything further to say about them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The debate has become a general debate on Austudy. We have heard a variety of contributions. There has been some reference to the position of people in rural and isolated areas. The Government certainly does recognise that conditions in the rural sector have warranted a consideration of the criteria in provisions relating to Austudy for people affected by those conditions. As a consequence of that, in this year's Budget we have introduced a hardship provision that is applicable to rural families so as to extend to Austudy beneficiaries the benefits that are already made available to recipients of social security benefits, and we are also extending that hardship provision to families in receipt of assistance under part C of the rural adjustment scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is ironic that the Opposition spokesperson on education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), criticised what we did in that area as being too little too late, because when the matter was debated in the Senate there was a motion moved calling for the introduction of such a hardship provision. The Opposition, in speaking to that motion, called for the extension to Austudy recipients of the provisions that are applicable to social security beneficiaries, and we have done that. We have gone one step further by extending that provision also to families getting assistance under the rural adjustment scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer to some of the more general points. We really do not know where the Opposition stands on student income support. The Opposition spokesman has not laid out any policy of a general nature on student income support. His response to the Budget was essentially confined to criticising the adequacy of what we have done by way of hardship provisions for rural families, which I have already referred to. In the absence of any statement by the Opposition spokesman, we really have to wonder what policies the Opposition would introduce, particularly given that it is committed to introducing spending cuts of the order of $3 billion. It is very hard to believe that students will be made better off by the time such an extensive array of cuts in public expenditure is made. </PARA>

In fact, the cat has been let out of the bag by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) who, to give him his due, is I think the only Opposition member to actually say anything specific or substantive about Austudy. Of course, he has called for the abolition of secondary Austudy. About half the recipients of Austudy at the moment are recipients of secondary Austudy. The honourable member for La Trobe would get rid of that. He would replace tertiary Austudy by a loan scheme which would be repayable, irrespective of the means of the recipient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We have seen the sort of revolution in education participation that has gone on in the last few years, when the proportion of high school students completing year 12 has gone from something like 36 per cent in 1982 to over 70 per cent in the current year. That participation revolution, which undoubtedly is in part a consequence of the more generous income support arrangements introduced by this Government for people in their last years at school, would, of course, go by the board. The whole equity of income support arrangements for students at the secondary, tertiary and TAFE levels would be severely degraded; there is no doubt about that. That has to be the underlying observation that one makes about what the Opposition has to say about this. What policies does the Opposition have? We really do not know. </PARA>

In the Budget the Government, as well as introducing the rural hardship provision, has brought in a range of additional improvements to the Austudy scheme--improvements which, I might say, have been warmly welcomed by student groups. The International Union of Students, in its press release on the Government's Budget decisions, supported in a very congratulatory way the measures we have taken in respect of Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The net effect of those changes will be to make Austudy more broadly accessible, more flexible, more equitable. There is a major increase in the personal income test threshold by 25 per cent to bring it up to $5,000. There is a range of additional measures, such as the introduction of a dependent child concession to apply in respect of the spouse income test. There has been a great increase in the flexibility of course combinations for which people can receive Austudy. They will now be able to do a degree and perhaps go on to do something more vocationally specific in TAFE and receive Austudy support for both. They will be able to do an associate diploma and then get a degree and receive Austudy in those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>  I will not try to enumerate all of the improvements, but there are about a dozen distinct changes and improvements. For example, there is the lengthening of the period for which  students can receive Austudy. If they are doing a semester based course, they get an additional semester over and above the minimum duration of the course. If they are doing a year based course, they get an additional year. All of these things serve to make the scheme much more flexible and much better. That has been generally recognised. In addition to that, of course, as I have said, we have the rural hardship provision. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is the first stage of a review of Austudy that the Government has committed itself to. We said that in this year's Budget we would attempt to correct some of the anomalies in Austudy which, in a sense, are cheaper to fix. In that sense, they are easier in the current difficult fiscal climate. </PARA>
<PARA>  For the medium to long term we are looking at the question of whether we need some more fundamental changes. That relates to issues such as the criteria for independence, the assumptions that we make about students whom we deem to be dependent on their parents, and issues such as the use of taxable income as the basis of the parental incomes test. These things relate to whether people are getting Austudy who should not be able to get it--people with families who are in quite favourable circumstances but who are able to state a very low taxable income by a range of artificial means whereas, for example, a two-income wage and salary earning family might be denied access to Austudy even though its circumstances might not be very favourable at all. </PARA>
<PARA>  They are the sorts of issues that we need to look at. Fixing those things up is far more difficult than dealing with some of the matters we have dealt with in this year's Budget. If we are not going to use taxable income as the basis of a parental incomes test, what do we use? Is there some way of adjusting taxable income? Administratively, it becomes a lot more difficult if we start to get into those sorts of areas. That is the kind of issue that Bruce Chapman from the ANU, who has been engaged by the Government as a consultant, is looking at and attempting to come to grips with. We hope that he will be able to provide us with some material that will serve as an input into next year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) asked about private providers. That is another area in which the Government has made a number of recent announcements. To clear that up for his benefit, in 1992 Austudy and Abstudy eligibility will be extended to accredited courses in higher education and computing in private educational institutions</PARA>
<PARA>and accreditation will be carried out by the relevant State or Territory accrediting authority. Austudy or Abstudy will be available in 1992, subject to State and Territory accreditation, to students of private business colleges with secretarial courses. In 1993 Austudy and Abstudy will be phased in over two years to students undertaking TAFE type courses provided by accredited private providers. There seems to be some misconception on the part of the Opposition about that. I state that to clear that up.  Finally, we constantly get this furphy about there being no program objectives or performance indicators for Austudy. I refer honourable members to the program performance statement, previously referred to as the explanatory notes, which are released in the budgetary context. The program objectives and performance indicators can be found in that document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It was the winter session at that stage. We complained about the haste with which a lot of legislation was being brought before this House. It was obvious from the present state of that Bill that something would have to be done about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is interesting that this matter was then referred to a committee in the Senate. The fact that 111 amendments are coming forward is proof positive of the need for more consultation, more discussion and perhaps more input at this stage from the Opposition to put the legislation through in a decent form. I think it is very important to note that the consultation that should take place with groups in the industry, such as ACOSS, has not been carried out very effectively by this Government. It is an indication that perhaps more of this consultation should occur. </PARA>
<PARA>  All too often we deal with the negatives in this House. This afternoon, as I was waiting for this Bill to be brought on for debate, I had the pleasure of attending a function for the Prime Minister's Employer of the Year Award for those people around Australia who are employing people with disabilities. It is great to see the positive side and the manner in which people within industry are reacting. It was also good to see that a State departmental office won the overall award as Australian champion, indicating again that government has a part to play in putting those people into employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a few things within industry that we recognise. Firstly, we recognise the difficulty of people finding jobs when one million people are unemployed. It is impossible for some of those people with disabilities to take their part in the work force. The time of intervention, as provided by these amendments and this particular Bill, is at the end of the stage and not at the beginning. Intervention would be a lot better, say, within the first couple of months, but certainly within the first nine months, whereas at this stage the intervention is after 12 months of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  As to invalid pensions, for a long time we have known that the Government has disguised the real effect of unemployment throughout Australia by putting people on invalid pensions rather than having them recognised as unemployed. This has been done by downgrading the level at which the invalid pension has been provided. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said, I feel that a lot of these amendments that have come back from the Senate are the result of the Opposition's intervention and participation in the consultation process. I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) that there could be more consultation--and I say this in all fairness--even between the Opposition and the Government on some of these matters where we are dealing with people and real issues. It is best to get the right result rather than rush something through without consultation because, at times, that results in confrontation--and none of us would want that. </PARA>
<PARA>  The coalition agrees with 109 amendments. On behalf of the Opposition, I move:</PARA>
<PARA>(1)  That Senate amendment No. 17 be disagreed to, but that, in place thereof, the following amendment be made:</PARA>
<PARA>  "Clause 13, page 7, proposed subsection 94(5), definition of `work', paragraph (a), lines 35 to 38, omit the paragraph, substitute the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>    `(a)  that is for at least 30 hours per week; and'."; and</PARA>
<PARA>(2)  That Senate amendment No. 33 be disagreed to, but that, in place thereof, the following amendment be made:</PARA>
<PARA>  "Clause 17, page 51, proposed paragraph 666(3)(a), lines 8 to 11, omit the paragraph, substitute the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>    `(a)  for at least 8 hours per week; and'.". </PARA>
<PARA>We believe that the two original amendments were proposed without really looking at what the Bill and the other amendments were about. Certainly, the Bill in its original form refers to award wages or a rate considered reasonable for the work in the opinion of the Secretary. The Parliamentary Secretary made it clear at the Standing Committee hearing that retaining the reference just to award wages was to comply with trade union demands. </PARA>
<PARA>  On that point, could I mention something else that is happening in the disability area, and that is discrimination? The anti-discrimination legislation is now being looked at as far as disabilities are concerned. In a speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today, I heard that the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union was the one that was being selected to coordinate this type of anti-discrimination legislation. Just last week I said to the Parliamentary Secretary that there are other unions in the field associated with the trade union movement and affiliated with it that would probably have a greater and a more genuine interest in it than some of the main-line unions.</PARA>
<PARA>  I say this because it has been notorious that unions throughout this country have never really looked at those at the lower end of the scale and those who do suffer this discrimination, particularly if they have a disability. I mentioned to the Minister one that I ran into in Western Australia--I think it was the Disabled Workers Union--which works in this field and this field alone. I mentioned to the Parliamentary Secretary last week that surely they should be given some participation in the formulation of these new anti-discrimination measures. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition, of course, opposes the mention of trade union demands, and particularly of an award wage, because its already enunciated policy on industrial matters does not take award wages into consideration. We believe that wages would best be worked out under the system that we propose within the workplace itself. </PARA>
<PARA>  The coalition is committed to phasing out awards and putting in place rates set outside the jurisdiction of the IRC. For many jobs there are currently no awards, so a benchmark is irrelevant. This would become more so under the coalition's planned decentralised wages policy, under which award coverage of workers will decline. In any event, it is questionable whether awards ought to be the benchmark in the first place, given that there are almost one million people currently priced out of employment owing to the excessive price of labour as institutionalised under the centralised system of awards. We do not believe that this is the legislation that should enshrine awards in a place of primacy. The legislation is about helping people with disabilities; it is not industrial legislation. In this regard we have moved our two amendments to the Senate's amendments; otherwise they have our support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I understand what the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) is saying, but the position simply is that there have been a number of amendments, as correctly stated by the honourable member. There have been something like 110 or 111 amendments. That in itself proves that there has been a great deal of consultation with all the people involved in this, and the Government has been very sensitive in ensuring that what amounts to an extremely large change in the disability services area is being looked at and in many respects has been responded to in the light of concerns expressed by various bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government does not accept the amendments moved by the Opposition. The Opposition simply has this ideological difference from us in terms of the question of award wages. It keeps talking about enterprise bargaining, and I can understand that it is part of the Opposition's policies. Wherever the word `award' is mentioned in any Act, of course, because of its ideological differences, the Opposition needs to get rid of it. The Government does not accept that. It is more than just the trade union movement itself saying to us that it would like us to include that in----</PARA>

If we took out the word `award', it would simply mean that people with a disability who worked for 30 hours or more for an amount of money--in sheltered workshops it can be very small--would automatically be precluded from getting a disability support pension. I say to the shadow Minister for community services and aged care, the honourable member for Dawson, that if we allow the amendment to go through we would be doing the disabled people a disservice because we would be saying that if they worked for 30 hours or more in sheltered workshops they would, therefore, automatically not be eligible for the disability support pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There are many areas in sheltered workshops where the money that is paid to people with disabilities is very paltry indeed, and certainly it would not be anywhere near what the disability support pension is. As a government we are doing the right thing; we are making sure that people are not exploited in any way. We are making sure that they do not have to worry about such things as enterprise bargaining. We want to be sure they are looked after. For those reasons we cannot accede to the request for these amendments, and the Government does not accept the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --The Appropriation Bill (No. 1) allows members the opportunity to enter into a debate about the Budget for 1991-92. It is generally a very wide-ranging debate. I look forward to having the opportunity to discuss a number of aspects of the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  One hears all sorts of absurd propositions and premises which underline the debates that take place in this House about the economy, and I believe that from time to time it is necessary for us to think about some of the propositions that are put and to examine them for their internal consistency and logic. </PARA>
<PARA>  Politicians are lobbied by all sorts of groups in the community--conservationists, miners, manufacturers, financiers, bankers, unionists and all sorts of individuals who come to our offices with varied concerns and views put a variety of positions to us. Many of those positions and views are merited. Some of them are ideologically based. Indeed, Richard Farmer made the point in the Australian in respect of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and her discomfort during the week that zealots who believe they serve a higher cause will always breach confidences. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to be very careful of those who are perhaps overzealous in the way in which they define and arrive at their positions. Of course, many of those who come to lobbyists, particularly those who are in the mining, manufacturing and finance sector, have pecuniary interests in mind. There are others who are just driven by particular circumstances which may affect them. I suppose the role of the Government, and indeed all of us as politicians, is to establish what we believe are the merits of those cases, the priorities and the fairness and justice of each position. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TD4">Dr CHARLESWORTH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is not an easy task, as the honourable member opposite suggests. Indeed, it is one which is becoming increasingly complex. It has been said--and I think I have said it before in this place--that for every complex problem there is a simple solution, although it is usually wrong. Time and time again we find in this place simple, glib, simplistic assertions being made, particularly on economic matters, which just do not hold up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In dealing with the economy--and the shadow Minister at the table opposite, the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale),  made this comment to me in the corridor just the other day--the Government can set up the framework and get the fundamentals in position, but it really does not have much say in those hundreds of thousands of transactions and business dealings that are undertaken out there in the community. Our task is to try to get the settings right. </PARA>
<PARA>  John Maynard Keynes referred to animal spirits when he talked about the way in which the economy operates. He made the point that, even though we might have the very best scheme in the world, if everyone else is gloomy and does not want to buy the product, maybe it is not such a good idea to make the investment and go into that particular venture. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1983, when we came to office, the Government took the position that Australia desperately needed to internationalise its view of economic dealings. We needed a more competitive structure and the Government undertook a number of brave and difficult positions. We deregulated financial markets. We deregulated our currency. In the area of taxation, significant changes were undertaken to make the tax system broader and fairer. Of course, the pressing problem of unemployment, as it was in 1983, was another issue in which the Government undertook to bring about change. </PARA>
<PARA>  We set a target for growth. It could be said that over three or four years we successfully attained some of our goals. The stock market crash of 1987 was something that I think in hindsight will be seen as the watershed event in economic thinking. I remember at the end of 1987 confidently predicting that we would be facing a recession. Indeed, I was proven to be wrong but perhaps only in timing, because the liquidity, the softening of the Government's position in respect to the availability of money and the making available of funds at that time, probably led to the very unsustainable asset prices. The subsequent untangling of debt that is occurring now in 1991 represents the fallout of the effects of that crash. </PARA>
<PARA>  What tends to happen is that in this place one indicator or one index--whether it be inflation, GDP, interest rates, the current account deficit, foreign debt or unemployment--is often used as the reason for taking a position in any particular issue. What we tend to deny is the dynamic nature of all of these things and the interactions that occur. Foreign debt is the result of hundreds of thousands of transactions. Any one of those transactions is not typical of the end gross figure. It helps us quantify what is happening, but it does not tell us too much about the cause and effect of those individual transactions. In fact, it does not tell us a great deal about why and what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA>  The recession that we are now climbing out of had a number of causes. We all believe that prolonged interest rates has been one of the factors. It is pertinent to note that most other countries in the OECD have faced similar circumstances. Australia is not unique; therefore, global factors must be operating. The downturn in other countries is something that has possibly increased the depth of the circumstances we find ourselves in now. There is no doubt that the post-crash effects on confidence, the asset price deflation, the unwinding of those unsustainable asset prices and the financial effects of all of that played a part. There is no doubt that the fall in the terms of trade greater than we could have anticipated played a part. There is no doubt that circumstances in the rural sector played a part and that the fragility of some of our financial institutions also played a part. </PARA>
<PARA>  Today in Question Time the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) answered a question concerning economic forecasting. It is interesting to look back at last year's Budget and some of the forecasts that were made. If one were to plot them on a graph, one would find some exceeded our expectation and some fell short of our expectation. That is to be expected because it is a particularly difficult task. If one looks at the growth last year of our major trading partners, the forecast in last year's Budget was 3 1/2 per cent and the outcome was actually 3 per cent. In fact, there was less growth amongst our major trading partners than we anticipated. Obviously this affected Australia. If one looks at the terms of trade, it was anticipated that it would decline by 3 1/2 per cent. In fact the outcome was a decline of 5.2 per cent. Again there was an international effect beyond that which we anticipated in this country. The forecast average price for oil was US$23 per barrel. In fact, it turned out to be US$23.51, which is not bad considering the Gulf crisis and all of the other events which occurred during 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>  The predictions for investment in dwellings and non-dwelling constructions were a 9 per cent decrease and a 13 1/2 per cent decrease, and there was an 11 per cent and a 14 per cent decrease, which was very close to the predictions. In respect of exports of goods and services, the prediction was for an increase of 7 1/2 per cent and the outcome was 13 per cent, which was much better than expected. We anticipated a fall of 3 per cent in imports and in fact the fall was greater than that, being 3.6 per cent. So the net result for exports was much better than expected. The anticipated figure for the consumer price index was 6 1/2 per cent, and we came up with 5.3. Indeed, it is well below that figure at the moment and heading below that again this year. In respect of the current account balance, the anticipated figure was $18 billion and we came in at $15.7 billion. It is still too much, but better than was anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reason I make this point is to indicate the perils of economic forecasting and the danger of misusing economic statistics and, perhaps in a misguided way, suggesting that we know all the answers. It is much more complicated than any cause and effect relationship which we may draw between any particular set of figures. The issue that is most often raised in this place is the issue of foreign debt. The suggestion is made that the Government should do something about foreign debt. I support the view that our foreign debt does represent a great deal of concern. Probably the biggest contribution to it was the devaluation of the dollar in 1983, but I do not find members on the other side suggesting for a moment that that policy position should have been reversed at the time or even now. </PARA>
<PARA>  We must set in place a structure whereby we can assure ourselves that we can service this foreign debt. Many people make the suggestion that, as long as foreigners will lend to us at a time when we have this foreign debt, everything is okay. But why would someone consider lending money to us? Why would someone consider lending money to anybody in any circumstance? The reason is that generally investors believe there are good prospects for the investment and that it will make a return. They believe the risks are manageable. In respect of a foreign transaction, there is an exchange rate risk and the risk of the actual venture. They believe, relatively, that their return will be better than the return they can get somewhere else. That is the reason why foreigners continue to underwrite our level of debt, and it should be our hope that this continues. </PARA>
<PARA>  With a gross foreign debt of $130 billion and a GDP at about $400 billion, we can draw the analogy of someone on average weekly earnings, with an income of $26,000 to $28,000, with a mortgage of $10,000. That is not a bad analogy. If we look at it in those terms, most honourable members in this House would, I suggest, have much greater mortgages than that and yet see their debt position as being manageable. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TD4">Dr CHARLESWORTH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The shadow Minister for privatisation does not have a mortgage; he has millions. He is very fortunate, but we do not all fit into that category. The problem is that most of the income of that person on average weekly earnings with the $10,000 mortgage is already committed. In Australia's circumstances, effectively, that person is borrowing a bit more money to make the interest payments. In a sense, that debt is growing. That is why it is necessary for us to stabilise our foreign debt position. But we need to be concerned about it; we need to make sure that we are vigilant in watching it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  At present, the numbers are heading in the right direction. We should not be overly concerned about the foreign debt. We certainly should not come into this place, as happens day after day, saying `Foreign debt is a terrible, monstrous thing; therefore. . . '. As I said earlier, it is made up of hundreds of thousands of transactions, and to draw a cause and effect relationship between it and them is to make a mistake. </PARA>
<PARA>  We owe it to ourselves and to our constituents to be consistent, logical and thoughtful about these issues. It does not do to do as the Opposition does: come here and bemoan the lack of savings in the community when investment is at a record level. Surely, that is the reason why savings levels are low; money is going into investment. It does not do to come in here and moan about high interest rates if people are concerned about foreign debt, because those high interest rates represent part of the solution. If people believe that we need to increase taxation or take some other position, they should say so, but they should be consistent about what they say. </PARA>
<PARA>  It does not do for the Opposition to bemoan lack of investment, while complaining, as it did last week, that interest rates should not fall further, because it is being internally inconsistent. It does not do for the Opposition to come here and bemoan unemployment when it has a set of policies which can only make unemployment greater. Last, but not least, it does not do to come here to bemoan the plight of the unemployed when the Opposition would cut off the unemployed and make their circumstances worse. </PARA>
<PARA>  I support the proposition, as members of the Opposition would put it, that there are people receiving unemployment benefits who are undeserving. If the Opposition suggests that those undeserving people should not receive benefits for various reasons, that would have my support. However, if the Opposition tells me that their dependants and children are undeserving, I am afraid that they will lose me because I do not think that one can draw that conclusion. Cutting off unemployment benefits will not solve the problem. If it is the case that the Opposition wants to, in some way, determine desserts, then it should put forward the prescription. However, in that regard, the Opposition's record is not very good. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1982, it was the coalition that removed the work test and it was the Labor Government that reintroduced it. It was also left to the Labor Government to introduce the requirement of an employer to state why someone had changed or lost his or her job, and we introduced teams to investigate the circumstances of people who were unemployed. If I am correct in stating the Opposition's position, I ask it to put it before this Parliament in clear terms. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have endeavoured to outline some of the logical inconsistencies in the economic debate, and I could go further. Today, we heard a classic example when the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) was asked about foreign media ownership. The complaint was that the 20 per cent rule would be relaxed, which would in some way help Labor's mates. The bid made by a group of Melbourne establishment people was clearly the bid that members of the Opposition felt should be successful, but the implication was that the 20 per cent rule is good. The Opposition adopts a policy of open slather, yet when the Labor Party in some way adopts what is suggested by the Opposition's policy, the Labor Party does so to derive some pecuniary interest, gain or advantage. </PARA>
<PARA>  If time permits, I will refer briefly to health care. A large number of canards are being circulated suggesting how terrible health care is, that it is at a very poor standard, and that it is shocking that people should have to wait for treatment. However, nobody has asked the question: why are Australians in hospital twice as much as other people in the world whose living standards are comparable? That is the question that we should be trying to answer. </PARA>
<PARA>  While it is the case that this country could have a Rolls Royce health system, to have it would require the expenditure of a great deal more money. To achieve that standard, the Government would have to increase taxes, increase the levy or increase the contributions for private insurance. The Opposition member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) put forward a health care system that he thought would work, but it was not acceptable to the Opposition because it was based on people who were well and wealthy having to pay more. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would have appreciated the opportunity to continue my speech in support of the proposed changes to Medicare suggested by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), but I will not have sufficient time. I simply say that the Budget has been framed in difficult times. However, if one has regard to statistics on motor vehicle registrations, housing approvals and retail trading figures, the indications are that an economic change is occurring, so perhaps it is the right time for this Budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Despite what has been said by the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), one thing is clear about Treasurer Kerin's first Budget. It has been the subject of universal criticism, not just on party political lines but equally as forcefully from vocal elements on the Government benches right across the Government's factional spectrum. In his previous portfolio, the Treasurer was content not to involve himself in the broader issues of scrutiny and control of budgetary planning, not to become too deeply involved in judgments on wider policies that would optimise the economy's momentum, and not to involve himself comprehensively in explaining unhappy truths to an increasingly unhappy electorate. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin may have been able to get away with his relatively superficial approach to the wider issues. However, as Treasurer, he will need to move up a cog or two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This is a fact that has not gone unnoticed by many in the press gallery. His `your guess is as good as mine' approach is clearly no longer acceptable. The editorial published in the Australian on 23 August states:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kerin has been a sceptic, but his task now is to provide better leadership for the economic debate and that requires a more careful and consistent enunciation of policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  I suspect that many of us feel a measure of sympathy for the Treasurer's personal position. Demonstrably, his is a Budget of inheritance, but not the sort of inheritance that many of us would canvass. Indeed, he spent much of his Budget Speech apologising for the past mistakes of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), which have drawn our nation into its worst recession in 60 years and which have added nearly one million people to the lengthening unemployment queues. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has put it, the Treasurer should be renamed `Mr Sorry'--sorry we did not expect to have a recession; sorry we did not expect the recession to go that far; sorry that so many people are unemployed; and sorry that this Budget does not address the fundamental problems that need to be addressed. It is not surprising, therefore, that this sorrow, coupled with the transparent pleas for fairness and compassion by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), add up to a big zero when it comes to media and public response. </PARA>
<PARA>  I doubt whether any Budget in the last decade has been so universally condemned. Clearly, it is not a Budget with a central economic thrust. It is more about party politics; it is more about the Prime Minister's continuing and persistent leadership hassles; and it is more about the general parliamentary dominance of the Government's left wing faction in general and the Deputy Prime Minister's ideologically bound stance on social engineering in particular. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many commentators have reported reactions then and since. I refer to just three extracts from 21 August as representative of a general public perception. Firstly, an editorial in the Australian on that date headed `Honesty outstrips capacity' said in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kerin's first Budget reflects the man and the condition of the Hawke Government. Like Mr Kerin, it is responsible and dour; like the Hawke Government, it is bereft of options. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It offers no hope, no new ideas, no fresh policy approaches. It is uninspired and uninspiring. In this context, the most important point is that it has no sense of urgency about the need to tackle fundamental issues of reform of the structures of the economy and of industry. </PARA>
<PARA>It finishes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The Budget reeks of weariness. </PARA>
<PARA>In the same edition, an article by Paddy McGuinness says:</PARA>
<PARA>Paul Keating always had a belief in magic puddings and it seems that the legacy he left to John Kerin in yesterday's Budget was one of these. . . . But magic puddings are treacherous; and the superannuation deal which is supposed to take Australia into a new area of high savings and employment stability is full of traps. </PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, an article by Michelle Grattan in the Melbourne Age states:</PARA>
<PARA>John Kerin has delivered a hang-on-and-hope budget. Economically, it is soft, but without falling into the temptation for pump-priming. Politically, it is shaping up as a negative for the Government because it is flat, contains what will be seen as</PARA>
<PARA>some "nasties", and does not specifically address the mounting dole queue. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Budget was more about what has not been done rather than what has been or needs to be done to get us out of this economic whirlpool. It simply tinkers at the edges of substantive remedial reform and panders to sectional interests and undisguised populism. To put it simply in the Australian vernacular, it lacks guts. </PARA>
<PARA>  But Treasurer Kerin has added another dimension to his ability to sell the Budget's thrust. That dimension is a heavy dose of confusion in two critical areas of economic policy formulation--namely, wages and interest rates. On 21 August, he was adamant that the keystone of the accord with the ACTU--the wage-tax trade-offs--could be afforded no longer. Any more such deals were ruled out during the rest of the term of this Government, although the offer of tax cuts during the next election campaign remain possible. One day later he was not so sure. Wage-tax deals remained difficult, particularly as low inflation implied a smaller automatic rise in the tax take and therefore less ability to hand taxes back to the people. He specifically ruled out a wage-tax deal only for this year, and to this he added confusion on interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  Before and after the Budget, the Prime Minister nudged and winked about the prospect of interest rates falling. The Treasurer, who was studiously correct before the Budget, on 22 August touched off a flap in financial markets by appearing to reject cuts for some time to come. It was arguably a semantic error but, indeed, it was a policy mistake--and a blunder. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Treasurer might find this irritating but he has to accept the fact that in political and financial life they respond to the signals the Treasurer emits. What then did we find only two weeks later on 3 September? Surprise, surprise--a cut in official interest rates by a full percentage point to 9.5 per cent. In so doing, the Treasurer said that policy decisions were made on the basis of accumulated evidence, not on one month's or one quarter's figures. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We are convinced a 1% drop now will have a positive effect on investor confidence and will not induce inflationary expectations nine to 12 months out. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that this sits oddly with the previous week's caution, particularly his warnings that a premature rate cut could mean interest rates rising again next year. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not surprisingly, what do we see in the printed media headlines on 4 September? In the Canberra Times we saw, `Stunned economists to see politics behind Kerin's rate cuts'. In the Australian Financial Review we saw, `Too much, too late on interest rates'. In the Melbourne Age we saw, `Rates cut welcome but second best'. Finally, in a very interesting article in the Australian headed, `Reserves vote of no confidence on economy', the economics editor, Alan Ward, says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>  John Kerin was telling no more than the literal truth when he said the decision to drop rates was made by the board of the Reserve Bank yesterday morning, and that it was the board's view the drop should be one percentage point. </PARA>
<PARA>  Naturally neither Kerin nor Hawke needed any persuading to accept this advice. </PARA>
<PARA>  But the important question is why the Bank thought it important to cut rates. The answer is hardly reassuring for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is clear that only two weeks after the Budget the bank believes the economic outlook is worse than forecast in the Budget, and the economy is in need of additional monetary stimulus. </PARA>
<PARA>  Kerin sought to deny any change in the Government's assessment of the economy, but he gave the game away at his press conference when he said that the decision (to cut rates) will underpin the recovery underway and give more certainty and confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>  Real interest rates are firm but the economy is slacker than was thought by authorities through June and July. </PARA>
<PARA>In summary, the Budget does nothing to address Australia's serious economic problems and very little indeed for the 1.3 million unemployed and/or underemployed. It offers little, though, to the unemployed and is unlikely to lead to a sustainable fall in real interest rates. It does nothing to address economic reform, nothing to improve our competitiveness nor to boost business activity. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has given up on fiscal responsibility where it has presided over the largest deterioration since the early 1950s. The PSBR has moved from a surplus of 1.6 per cent of GDP in the financial year 1988-89 to a prospective deficit of 4.3 per cent in this Budget by his own admission.   At a time when Australia needs real leadership as never before, the Treasurer has failed in his first real test and produced a Budget of no real substance. It is a Budget aimed at shoring up the Prime Minister's leadership. However, it ignores the chronic problems of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Turning to a specific element of this Budget which is close to the heart of rural and provincial Australia, particularly in electorates like mine of Groom--and I am delighted to have two of my constituents in the gallery this evening--it is apparent from earlier remarks by some of my colleagues, particularly my country cousin, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), that large question marks persist for farm families with very low incomes--in fact, many have negative incomes--about this Government's commitment either to our rural sector generally or those in dire financial straits and for whom it is almost impossible to obtain unemployment benefits or household support. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have listened to platitudes from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) over recent weeks about their Government's superficial solutions. I repeat what I have said many times in this place: farmers do not want welfare which, it seems to me, is endemic to this Budget; they simply want a level playing field which recognises reasonable financial return for a fair day's work. While the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, to his credit, may have honoured my pleas a couple of weeks ago to meet a representative group of Queensland vegetable growers briefly at Brisbane Airport to hear their predicament first hand without any party political input on my part, I ask him three basic questions in this place this evening. </PARA>
<PARA>  Firstly, will there be any policy changes of substance as a result of that meeting either in terms of those growers or the rural sector generally? Secondly, is he prepared to put his weight behind a call for a broad rural summit with the same fervour as he did in his ACTU incarnation? Thirdly, is such a summit only the province of taxation, big business and his union cronies?</PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to issue such a challenge to both the Treasurer, in his present and past ministerial capacity, and to the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy--a challenge reflected in an editorial in the Toowoomba Chronicle of 2 September headed `It's Time for a Rural Accord', from which I quote again in part:</PARA>
<PARA>  In October a series of rural outlook conferences is to be held around Australia, with the first in Toowoomba on October 4. </PARA>
<PARA>  The conferences--one in each State--are being organised by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, which says delegates will hear its latest outlook for farm incomes and market prospects and have the opportunity to discuss current issues with industry and government leaders. </PARA>
<PARA>  The bureau could well come out of the conferences with a blunt message to take back to its Minister, Mr Simon Crean, who has responsibility for primary industries--a sector under siege, even more so than the rest of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA>. . .           . . .          . . . </PARA>
<PARA>  Last week The Chronicle suggested a summit  was needed to look at all issues facing rural industry and its future. The same call has been made by local Federal Member for Groom, Mr Bill Taylor. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Taylor rightly pointed out that the Federal Government has held tax and business summits in an attempt to get broad policy input from a wide body of individuals and organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>  It needs to do the same in respect of rural Australia--for producers and their families as well as for the businesses and communities that depend on them for survival. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Taylor has referred to issues such as high interest rates, overseas subsidies and cartels, increasing food imports, financial and managerial deficiencies, high production costs, the industrial relations "club" and transport inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA>. . .       . . .       . . . </PARA>
<PARA>  Organisations and individuals who are part of  rural Australia--or who depend on it--need to call on Canberra to address their crisis through a summit that will produce some sort of "Rural Accord" and hope for the future. </PARA>
<PARA>Does either Minister have the internal fortitude to push this in Cabinet, or is the rural sector, which generates 40 per cent of our export income, so insignificant as to be ignored?</PARA>
<PARA>  Irrespective of whether the Ministers take up the challenge, I agree with the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) in his contribution to this debate earlier today that this Government is now clutching at economic straws, not the least of which is a blind, indecent, unsubstantiated and scaremongering attack on the Opposition's tax reform package to be announced during this parliamentary session. Today's Question Time was no exception by the Government to this misguided strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those opposite have the point made, and made with perhaps more force than any other member can muster in this place, by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) in today's matter of public importance debate that the Australian people cannot be distracted from today's most pressing problem. The Government may win a few points in the short term on its continuing goods and services tax diatribe. However, it should never lose sight of one thing. One in 10 out there are unemployed; one in three of those aged 15 to 19 are in that category. Those statistics fall squarely at the feet of this seemingly insensitive Government. The public at large knows that this divided bunch opposite, as much as it would deny it, has run out of steam and has not the nerve for the hard economic decisions. On the other hand, this Opposition has the wherewithal to do just that and to do it best. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- The honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) spent a fair bit of time attacking the Treasurer (Mr Kerin). Certainly when I stand on this side of the House with my colleagues during Question Time, I am really pleased that we are not represented by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). I am pleased that we have our policies, and are not hamstrung by some of the policies proposed by those opposite, such as the goods and services tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Since the handing down of the Federal Budget last month, all we have heard from those opposite have been howls of protest;  that is where it has all come from. It is what we have come to expect from them. They have failed to give any credit at all for many of the Budget's positive aspects. In all, it is really a well-balanced and well-considered Budget. I am particularly heartened by the many positive measures in the Budget for rural people, which the honourable member for Groom does not recognise. I commend the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), in particular, for his efforts in this regard. He has shown that he has been quick to grasp the problems facing the rural sector, and I recognise that there are particular problems for people living in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  My electorate of Page is essentially rural in nature and these problems are well known to me. For the people in rural areas, as this Government knows, the economic downturn has been particularly strong. This has been due largely to commodity prices, to drought and to the practices of some of our overseas trading partners. The senseless and artificial price wars from major trading blocs have forced our producers to accept lower prices for their commodities or to turn to other agricultural pursuits. Our farmers and the rural communities have been caught in a cross-fire, and they are hurting. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government is taking many positive steps to alleviate the problems of the bush. The priority is to convince the Europeans and the Americans that their trading programs have little foundation in economic rationalism and that their allies, including Australia, are being penalised. It must be brought to the notice of the consumers in those countries that they are paying the price for the subsidies being paid in their countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  The budgetary measures also play their part in easing the strain in the bush. This year's Budget contains wide ranging social and economic measures specifically designed to help people living in rural areas. I am pleased to say that the National Farmers Federation also is offering its support to some of these endeavours. Because of the rural downturn, many of our farmers are asset rich and income poor. They have valuable farms and equipment, but because of our low commodity prices, drought and seasonal conditions, they have been making little profit from their land. </PARA>
<PARA>  The changes to the family allowance supplement mean that these farmers will be eligible for the entitlements. It is estimated that these changes will result in an extra 28,000 families becoming entitled to the family allowance supplement. Another 81,000 families which are currently getting part rate family allowance supplement will receive additional assistance of about $12 a week. The Government has also provided the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics with $450,000, and the National Farmers Federation will provide an additional $100,000 towards a survey to identify specific regions affected by the rural downturn. The information gained from this study will be of great assistance to the Government for use in formulating strategies to help those in greatest need. The worth of this program is recognised by the National Farmers Federation, but of course, and typically, it is not recognised by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  The education of children in rural areas is also a high priority of this Government. For too long rural areas have been disadvantaged because of lack of access to the highest quality education. All Australians--especially those in the bush--deserve a quality education, regardless of their geographical location or any other disadvantage. By changing the eligibility criteria for the payment of benefits through Austudy and the assistance for isolated children scheme, we have created vastly better educational opportunities for children from rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  Funding for the rural access counselling program, Countrylink, and the innovative agricultural marketing program has also been extended. We have provided $2m for the rural industries business extension service, $1.8m for the business advisers for rural areas scheme and an increase of half a million dollars annually to the local government development program. </PARA>
<PARA>  A $22.5m grant has been provided to the wool industry to help with its financing, we have underwritten the Australian dairy industry with an allocation of $22.5m for the 1990-91 season and we have introduced a range of other measures specifically designed to help those in rural Australia. These are all positive measures. They are all worthy of support from both sides of this House. As I said earlier, these measures are well considered and they are appropriate. I would have thought that the National Party, in particular, would have seen the sense in the Government's approach to addressing the problems of the bush, but such is the intangible nature of its representation that support for the Government's positive measures has not been forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA>  In commending this Budget and its programs for rural Australia, it is important to consider them against the alternatives, particularly against the alternatives suggested by the Opposition--or at least that part of Opposition policy that we know about, which is very little. It is significant that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in his reply to the Budget failed to provide any detail on Opposition policy. We do not know the Opposition policy on health. We do not know the Opposition policy on education. We do not know the Opposition policy on social security, apart from its intention to throw 90,000 unemployed onto the scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA>  We know that the Opposition intends to introduce its consumption tax. That policy alone will probably have one of the most disastrous effects on rural Australia in our history.The rank and file of the National Party is showing signs that it is becoming increasingly jittery about the consumption tax. I can understand why. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition understands that, too. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think the story the Leader of the Opposition put out a few weeks ago that there was going to be an early election was designed to draw the troops together. He believed at that time that there were problems with the leadership, that there may be a challenge to his leadership. He thought that by saying we were going to have an early election he would draw his troops together behind him and that they would not overthrow him on this consumption tax. Nevertheless, with the numbers increasing as time goes by, both Liberal and National Party backbenchers become more jittery over this tax. Its impact on rural areas would be most severe. It is generally agreed that the tax would leave the poor with less money in their pockets. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0U4">Mr HARRY WOODS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Australian Taxpayers Association, for one. Currently, the low income earners are paying little or no taxation. Under this alternative Budget option, they would be paying tax on everything they buy. Its effects could be devastating. Where do we find the majority of people on low incomes? In rural areas--the areas that the National Party claims to represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If we look at a scale, we see that all National Party electorates are in the top third of electorates with the highest percentage of people on low incomes. That is not a new phenomenon. Country electorates have traditionally had lower incomes. The simple fact is that National Party electorates have the highest number of people on low incomes and the lowest number of people on high incomes. Yet the National Party wants to support a tax which hurts the poor and benefits the rich. It really does not make sense. </PARA>
<PARA>  The National Farmers Federation in a discussion paper released this week accurately showed how the poor would be disadvantaged by a goods and services tax. It said that pensioners, low income earners and people with large families would be the big losers. I ask the National Party members opposite: what is the basis for its support of the consumption tax? Why is it that those opposite are supporting a tax which is clearly not in the interests of its constituents? The 1986 census figures showed that 11 of the 14 electorates with the highest number of people on incomes of less than $12,000 were National Party electorates. Those are the people who would be hardest hit by the National Party's consumption tax plan. It will not hurt the Liberal Party electorates, where up to 55 per cent of the people are on incomes of $60,000 and more. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is also important to look at how such a tax would work in practical terms. I have had some experience in newsagencies, I have driven a taxi and I have been a publican. I believe that a tax of this kind would be very hurtful to similar businesses and businessmen. The story we are getting at present is that the price of goods will increase by the value of the tax: if there is a 15 per cent tax, the price increases by 15 per cent. I do not believe that that is a factual interpretation. Business imports of all sorts would be subject to tax-- accountancy, fuel, electricity, gas and telephones. That increases the cost to those businesses. </PARA>
<PARA>  If a business is going to make the same margin--any business wants to retain its margin--the 15 per cent tax also becomes a cost. If a newsagent is going to retain his 30 per cent gross profit, then the price of the goods he sells has to increase by more than that 15 per cent tax. If it were a 10 per cent tax, it would have to increase by more than that. If it were a 22 1/2 per cent tax, it would have to increase by more than that. A $1.50 middy of beer will cost over $2. The Sydney Morning Herald will cost $1. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me tell honourable members about bookmaking. The Opposition is going to put bookmakers and the tote out of business. Those businesses work on a profit margin of around one or 2, or maybe a little more, per cent. If the Opposition slugs them with a 15 per cent tax they will not exist. Who will take their place? The illegal operators will take their place--the SP bookmakers. What will we have then? Will the Opposition have a team of tax inspectors running around catching the SP bookmakers who are eluding the 15 per cent consumption tax?</PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is determined to maximise the job prospects of Australians as this country emerges from the recession. No long term victory can be claimed by the Government over the problems that befell this country in the late 1980s until the employment growth created by this Government, which has resulted in 1.6 million new jobs-- still a net 1.3 million new jobs--undergoes a resurgence. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is determined to put a new optimism into industry in Australia; we are determined to create the conditions under which industry in Australia can prosper; and we are determined to provide the training for the people in Australia which will result in a work force that matches those growing industries. We are emerging from this recession as a vastly different country from the one that emerged from the Liberal Party recession of the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>  We do not have the double digit inflation that the last Liberal Government enforced on this country. We have a historically low inflation level now. We do not have the wages explosion created by the coalition Government, which was unable to deal with the workers of Australia. We are emerging from this recession, led by the manufacturing industry for the first time. We are emerging from this recession without much of the great weight of the tariff protection and subsidy policy created by the Liberal-National Party over a couple of decades to the great cost of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  It will be largely as a result of those policy changes that we have put in place--changes that the Opposition would never have had the gumption to put in--that the job prospects of all Australians will be enhanced in the long term. It is one thing in opposition to say that things should happen; it is quite another to do it when one is going to offend some of one's friends. The Liberals and Nationals would not do that. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has become patently obvious in debate in the House in the past week or so that the Opposition would effectively withdraw the safety net for tens of thousands of unemployed people by throwing them off unemployment benefits after nine months. It would also drastically slash funding on structural support measures, leaving the unemployed to their own devices. It is a recipe for social devastation, division, despair and hopelessness. </PARA>
<PARA>  The recent Budget builds on initiatives flagged in the March economic statement: a 50 per cent increase in funding for low labour market programs; a total Budget increase from $400m to $600m; and boosting those assisted by 60,000 to 260,000. This is in contrast to the Opposition's policy that would slash spending in this area alone by $200m. That would be felt very hard in the rural areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  As it has been for the past 50 years, the Opposition is wrong on this occasion.  If by some mischance the Opposition was ever to fall into government, it would be the people of Australia, of course, who would be the victims of its social and economic irresponsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the programs that would be put at risk is the 10,000 new training places that have been created in TAFE at a cost of $40m. A significant slice of these funds will go into Newstart to help those most at risk and hardest to assist, although some of them would be the people whom honourable members opposite are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another program that would be put at risk is the $38m expansion project for existing training and wage subsidy programs, that is, Jobtrain and Jobstart. There are many other programs that would be put at risk by the sort of Budget cuts that the Opposition says it would bring in. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is rumoured that on 25 September, the Leader of the Opposition will explain his consumption tax policy. Let us hope that, when that explanation is given, the people on the other side of this House--and National Party members, in particular--will see the error of their ways and mount an opposition to the Leader of the Opposition so that the Liberal Party will see that the consumption tax is not the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is clear from what I have said today that the Budget of this Government is fair and equitable, especially to the people of rural Australia. It is also clear that the alternative Budget proposals as suggested by the Liberal Party and supported unthinkingly by the parliamentary leaders of the National Party will impact very severely on the many low income earners in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I ask members of the National Party, when they are sitting around their camp fires at night, sipping their billy tea and nibbling their nails, to consider what hardship they would inflict on the ordinary people of their electorates. I commend those National Party members to abandon their support for this regressive form of taxation and support the Government's obvious and positive moves to help people in rural Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On 20 June this year in the House, I moved a private member's motion which read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That federal Parliament acknowledges the need in this country for the legal system to more fully recognise the plight of victims of crime instead of directing the focus of most attention towards protecting and creating rights and privileges for the perpetrators of crime. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to that motion, I illustrated the raw deal that the system in this country gives to victims of crime by speaking about the horrific experience that the Hughes family of Brewarrina have been suffering and will continue to suffer for the rest of their lives following the murder of their son and brother, Brendan. </PARA>
<PARA>  Tonight I wish to pursue that theme further by speaking about another case which occurred in 1989 and which has cruelly affected the lives of the Armstrong family of Griffith, New South Wales. I first became interested in this case following a visit to my office last year from Mrs Shirley Armstrong of Tharbogang near Griffith. In that interview Mrs Armstrong recounted to me some of the suffering she had experienced because of her dealings with the legal system in her futile attempts to obtain justice following the murder of her daughter. I refer to the youngest of her three daughters, 24-year-old Merrilyn May Armstrong--a lovely girl, judging by the photograph of her that Mrs Armstrong showed me. No doubt she was a girl of whom that family was very proud. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the night of 16 June 1989, that girl was allegedly beaten to death by her fiancee, Kenneth Lloyd Clarke. It is interesting to read the report made at the time by the doctor who examined the body. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>At 2.30 a.m. on the 17th of June, 1989 I was called by Detective Sergeant Moore to a farm house at 2380 Pavese Road, Yoogali. I examined a body of a young woman and pronounced her dead. </PARA>
<PARA>She had suffered extensive head injuries with multiple lacerations to the scalp and face. There were nail marks on her neck and a bite on the right nipple. She was blood bespattered and there were bruises to both knees. The wall adjacent to her head was sprayed with blood, as was the carpet where she lay at the foot of the bed. Rigor mortis had not set in. I thought she had probably been dead for two or three hours. </PARA>
<PARA>Following on that, the autopsy report goes into some detail. It is worth recording:</PARA>
<PARA>The body was that of a woman of stated age with multiple lacerations to the face and scalp with extensive bruising to the face, shoulders, neck, nail marks to neck and laceration to nipple of right breast, suggestive of bite. Laceration to scalp of right occipto-parietal area was 10 cm by 5 cm. Laceration to central occiput area of the scalp 2 cm. Laceration to the base of the occipital was 2 cms in length. There was facial laceration 4 cms long over right eye. There was bruising of both eyes. The tongue was lacerated on the right side. Haematoma to both hands, extensive. Fractures of proximal and middle phalanx right index finger. Dislocation of distal phalanx, third finger right hand. </PARA>
<PARA>Blood was taken for analysis. Hair under fingernail and nail removed for analysis. Stomach and contents were taken for analysis. </PARA>
<PARA>CRANIAL CAVITY: There was extensive haematomata under whole of cranial scalp. Laceration to periosteum over the temporal parietal region. There was a subdural haematoma Subarachnoid haemorrhage. Multiple haemorrhages to the left occipital parietal lobes of the brain. </PARA>
<PARA>He records the direct cause of death as extensive brain damage. In other words, Merrilyn suffered massive trauma from beating to the head, skull and brain, as well as her hands and fingers from trying to protect herself. God only knows how long that girl took to die and the suffering and terror she must have endured before lapsing into unconsciousness. </PARA>
<PARA>  According to Mrs Armstrong, Kenneth Clarke rang her at 1.30 that morning to tell her he had killed her daughter. Clarke later denied saying this. Mrs Armstrong felt she was the principal witness. She lived on her own in a remote house, her husband being away for much of the time. As the accused had a history of violence and alcohol abuse, Mrs Armstrong would lie awake at night fearing he may visit her in an attempt to silence her from giving testimony. </PARA>
<PARA>  She learnt he had been released on bail and was living in and moving around the district. On 17 June, on his first appearance, bail was refused. On 22 June at the court appearance bail was again refused but on appeal on 2 August bail was granted. The Armstrongs were not informed, let alone consulted, that this had happened; they were left to find out second hand that the person they believed killed their daughter was now out and roaming the streets of the country town where they shopped. One can imagine how they felt. I will quote from a letter Mrs Armstrong wrote to me following my meeting with her:</PARA>
<PARA>Clarke has a history of problem drinking (just previous to above offence, a D.U.I. brought a $1,000 fine and cancellation of licence for 3 years), also a history of violence when drinking (former girlfriend sought Hospital treatment at least twice and had to leave town to feel safe from him, plus well known other incidents.) Granted these facts were not put forward at the appeal hearing. Bail conditions included no alcohol, but with a problem drinker I felt the chances were only 50/50 as to abstinence and for 7 months I lived in fear. Every night was a "night of terror" as I am the key witness against him, until after discussion with a psychiatrist I succumbed to taking major tranquillers and sleeping pills, which I have become highly dependent upon. </PARA>
<PARA>Then, the inevitable happened. While shopping in a Supermarket, I came face to face with the brutal murderer of my daughter. My emotions at that instant are indescribable. Hate, anger, fear and a mental picture flashed before my eyes of him actually bashing Merrilyn horrifically to death. He spoke to me in a hostile, belligerent manner, and an out of character anger took over and I behaved like a woman possessed screaming at him. I have a heart condition, and chest pains began to increase, and for survival I had to leave the scene and seek medication for my heart condition. </PARA>
<PARA>That was written over a year ago. After Mrs Armstrong had left at the end of the meeting in my office, I remember I came out and marvelled to my staff how remarkable it was, given the enormous strain on this woman, that she was being so brave and calm under the circumstances. However, three weeks later, to my dismay, I learnt that she had dropped dead from the stress she was being made to suffer. Mrs Armstrong, in effect, had become the second victim. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me just recap what has happened so far. It is not just Merrilyn, the daughter, who suffered. She is now dead. It is not just Mrs Armstrong who suffered. She is now dead. Mr Armstrong, Merrilyn's father, naturally enough, is suffering too. The whole episode has been eating away at him for 27 months now, leaving mental scars that no-one in authority has cared, is caring or at any stage will care or, for that matter, will even know about. Those scars will continue to deepen and will remain with this person for the rest of his life--something which he is left to endure largely alone. </PARA>
<PARA>  Other family members are suffering too. The suffering of Merrilyn's two stepsisters stems from the needless murder, of course, but what really eats at them is the sheer neglect and indifference displayed by legal authorities towards the victim's relatives. This is best illustrated in Mrs Armstrong's letter to me in which she described an incident involving her daughter Dianne and grand-daughter Monique. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The following week my daughter and grand-daughter (Monique, aged 9) who was particularly close to Merrilyn met Clarke in a local shop and my grand-daughter screamed and ran. That night she had nightmares, and for two days would not attend school, as she imagined that Clarke would be waiting outside the school for her. She imagined she saw him in the Post Office and ran, but it turned out to be a similar type of man. I can understand this, as for months I imagined I saw Clarke everywhere I went, but it was always someone similar in build, colouring etc. Of course the outcome of these meetings (Merrilyn's closest friends have also had encounters with Clarke)  is that the family are in a state of anxiety when going to town as to how they will re-act if they see Clarke, and I find myself not frequenting town the days Clarke has been seen or the shops he has been seen in. </PARA>
<PARA>That indicates how that woman was suffering. Those feelings, so vividly described by the late Mrs Armstrong, were confirmed to me recently by Dianne Sutcliffe, one of the other daughters. Dianne related to me how she lives with the fear of running into Clarke when going shopping. That may seem an inconsequential matter to the authorities who made this possible. In fact, I would guess that the thought of this happening would not even have entered the mind of the person who granted the bail. To use Dianne's words, `It's just like you don't exist'. She is frustrated and disgusted that she has never had any official notification of what has been going on. Despite numerous telephone calls and questions from her, and sometimes promises given, it has been only silence from the authorities. She has been totally ignored when it comes to information about dates of hearings and other such matters. It seems that she is a non-person in effect who must have no feelings or interest in the case. Even journalists seem to have better access to information. </PARA>
<PARA>  Clarke is seen around town a lot, and this is usually reported back to the family by friends, keeping this worry constantly in their minds and keeping Dianne's two children in a perpetual state of anxiety. Dianne is particularly worried about the effect this is having on her 10-year-old and 11-year-old children-- innocent parties, as she puts it, to the event. Every time the court case looks like coming up the children become unsettled and school work falls off. Her son became aggressive, wrote a strange essay, and his work was affected. Her daughter was reluctant to go visiting certain places in case she ran into Clarke. Dianne expressed concern to me that both her children were rapidly losing confidence in and respect for the law. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is how it is affecting the Armstrong family. But what about Clarke himself? How did he fare? Again, I turn to Mrs Armstrong's letter to me of 12 months ago. She said that within 12 months of the incident:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . he has had two girlfriends, got engaged to the most recent and she is now pregnant, and he will most likely be a father by the time he goes to trial--</PARA>
<PARA>this was written 12 months ago--</PARA>
<PARA>which I feel his Defence Counsel will use as a lever for a lighter sentence when convicted. </PARA>
<PARA>He works, participates in the family business, plays golf and generally is planning a future without any regard to the enormity of the horrific crime he has committed. </PARA>
<PARA>They are her words. I have already recalled how he was given bail on 2 August after twice having it refused, on 17 June and 22 June 1989. But later the bail conditions were changed to accommodate his new arrangements with his girlfriend. It goes without saying that the Armstrongs, who have only ever been treated with contempt in such matters, were not told. Again, I quote from Mrs Armstrong's letter to me. On bail appeal she said:</PARA>
<PARA>The victim's family were not advised at any time regarding successful bail appeal by Defendant. The facts were found out by sheer accident from an independent source. Also progress of case is often gleaned not from authorities but from T.V. News and local newspaper. Once again, no regard for the victim's family. </PARA>
<PARA>It is instructive to look at the long list of deferred court hearings. Apart from what I have already spoken about, on 15 August 1989 the preliminary hearing was adjourned. On 9 October 1989 the preliminary hearing was adjourned again. On 11 April 1990 there was a committal hearing; he was committed to trial on 6 August. The trial date of 6 August rolled around and the case was not heard. It was put over to 28 September. On 28 September it was put over to the January hearings this year. When the January 1991 hearings came up, it was deferred to later in 1991 and it is to be deferred again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I appreciate that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will wind up on this point. I have been mindful of that too. All through this gut-wrenching legal rigmarole--on which I make no judgment as to what the courts finally decide; that is purely a matter for the courts--the Armstrongs were never informed, never consulted and never considered. To use Mrs Armstrong's words, `When is the victim's family going to be considered in this long, drawn-out and distressing matter?'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Having made that point, I will move on to another case that has been finalised. This is the case of Stacey-Ann Tracey of Roma, who was just nine years old when she was violently raped, strangled with twine and her own underpants, and stuffed into a garbage bag in May 1990. Barry Hadlow was convicted of the murder and gaoled for life in March of this year. So that case has been finalised. But it was not revealed until after the trial that Stacey-Ann was Hadlow's second child victim. </PARA>
<PARA>  This psychopathic 48-year-old unemployed packer of no fixed address had been released on parole in 1985 after being convicted in 1963 of the murder of five-year-old Sandra Bacon, who was also sexually brutalised, stabbed, stuffed into a corn sack, and left in the boot of a car. At the time of sentencing in 1963 the attending psychiatrist said of Hadlow:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no treatment for Hadlow's condition and further aggressive offences will occur if he is not detained in a place of safety. </PARA>
<PARA>How do we justify his release to Stacey-Ann's mother? Do we say, `Sorry, we made a mistake'? What of the family of Sandra Bacon who, if not for this fiend, would now be a woman of 33? If we consider the families and relatives, it appears that Hadlow has claimed more than these two little girls as his victims. One wonders how long it will be before some other academic authority recommends that he be released and perhaps given the chance to do it all over again. If that did happen, no doubt on previous form the Tracey and Bacon families would not be told what was going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA>  I particularly highlight that case because of the very real possibility that other brutal and vicious murderers could be released from our gaols. Everybody knows about the Anita Cobby murderers. When they were put away their papers were stamped `Never to be Released', but I am told that that is only a recommendation and that they will have a right of appeal in about seven years time. That will be subject to a judge's discretion: no doubt public outcry would prevent that happening. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have another instance in the brutal Virginia Morse murder of a couple of decades ago. Crump and Baker both got life with papers stamped `Never to be Released', but already I am told that they have a C classification, which is a very low security classification. It is an outrage that even that has happened. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Janine Balding murderers raped, gagged and held Janine's head under water until she drowned and, as a result, those three criminals were convicted. I am pleased to say that they were convicted under the truth and sentencing legislation in New South Wales and will not be released. That is one good thing that has come out of that truth and sentencing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, the point of this speech is to highlight the fact that the families of victims should be kept informed at all times as to what is happening with the accuseds' bail and, if they receive bail, whether they should be allowed to be released to walk around the towns where the victims' relatives could see them on a weekly or daily basis. That would cause them great distress. I believe that the families and relatives of victims should be informed about the times of court cases and so on. I do not think that is too much to ask. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, they should be informed if criminals are put away and are to be released at a later date so that they at least know that this has happened and where they have been released. In fact, I would go further and say that preferably the most vicious criminals that I have spoken about in this House who have been convicted should never be released. The lives of the innocent in society far outweigh the wealth of consideration that seems to be ever present and eager to side with the criminals in society to the total exclusion of everyone else. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have a couple of very unfortunate cases that relate to the expensive and inefficient services provided by AQIS that threaten fledgling export industries at a time when we should be encouraging them. In the short time available to me in this adjournment debate I will restrict myself to one instance which centres on an abattoir at Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  A company called the Overland Traders of Australia recently leased the then closed Tennant Creek abattoir and commenced operations in June of this year. Tenant Creek has an existing EC licence and a dual licence to process both beef cattle and horses, or cheval. Horses are to be processed for at least six months in any one year, if the project can go ahead, as seasonal availability of stock allows. There is a very strong demand for horsemeat, both chilled and frozen, in Europe and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA>  By way of preliminary background I inform the House that the company leases the abattoir, and Mr Tony Maslin, as the principal investor, has expended some $350,000 on restoring the previously defunct abattoir to meet EC and DPIE standards. An additional $50,000 has been expended on market development, specifically in Europe and South East Asia. Further finance is being expended on market development and product trials for value added products, such as smoked and reprocessed horsemeat. There are some 40 employees at Tennant Creek with a monthly wages bill of $50,000, or $600,000 per annum. Since June the company has developed a highly efficient abattoir and, after preliminary killing and processing trials with beef cattle for the domestic market, it has now embarked on its main product: horsemeat, both chilled and frozen, destined for Europe and Asia. </PARA>
<PARA>  All overseas buyers have expressed complete satisfaction with the quality of the product and, after exhaustive trading negotiations, the company has achieved competitive price levels with other processors from the USA, Argentina and Europe. But, needless to say, there is very little scope for increasing Australian prices in either market. This pegs the price that the company can obtain, thereby requiring very careful cross-structuring and minimisation of charges, especially those which are required by the Government and specifically DPIE. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will give honourable members an idea of the investment and costs involved on an ongoing basis. So far, capital investment has been $350,000, income from frozen and chilled horsemeat sales amounts to $815,000, outgoings have amounted to $800,000, and $50,000 has been spent on market development. The total monthly wages bill was $50,000--that is, $600,000 a year--for 40 employees, who are desperately needed in Tennant Creek. </PARA>
<PARA>  Now for the interesting part. Government charges--and this does not relate to the Commonwealth Government--are as follows:  power, $96,000 a year; water, $72,000 a year; one DPIE veterinary officer and two DPIE meat inspectors, $240,000 a year. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is $240,000 a year. The inspectors earn around $30,000 each and the veterinarian earns about $35,000 a year, but they are billed out at $240,000 a year. I have it on good advice that, in fact, they do not do very much for that money. I understand that 50 horses a day do not actually require much inspection. As a result of this, inspectors were commonly to be found wandering around the plant--not actually on the slaughter line--and much the same goes for the veterinarian. I also understand that one of the inspectors left under something of a cloud after he was busted for trafficking and being in possession of drugs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The reality is that in the early stages of the company's operations, and having outlaid very extensively in getting the plant up and running, it now finds that these charges and other outgoings are so high that, unless some sort of relief can be found, the company will be strangled at birth by excessive government charges. There will be an immediate lay-off of 40 employees. The potential for value added products from Australian primary production will be discontinued, with a considerable loss of export earnings. Valuable markets abroad will be lost. The spin-off environmental effects will also go as the option of disposing of unwanted brumbies in the Northern Territory for some reasonable financial return disappears. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is all an absolute nonsense. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his Government tell us that they are serious about encouraging Australia's export capacity. Their word cannot be taken if they continue to refuse to address this issue and other similar issues, which I will come back to when the House sits again. In the meantime, I simply say that it is time this Government stood up and let us see it attempt to defend the utterly indefensible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The ideologues within the Opposition would have us believe that the introduction of a consumption tax is harsh but necessary medicine: we might not like it, but it would be good for us. It is an attitude that exemplifies the Opposition's enormous arrogance and contempt for the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has committed the members of his reluctant Party to supporting the introduction of a consumption tax. They have been dragged, kicking and screaming, to support a tax that most of them believe will have a disastrous effect on the economy. Today, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) read extracts from a little red book. He was quoting not from the Communist manifesto but, rather, from the marketing strategy by which members of the Opposition intend to sell this offensive tax. What was remarkable about this little red book was not so much the language but the imagery and graphics. Members of the Opposition are now on a war footing as they attempt to sell their consumption tax to a disbelieving electorate. By their own admission, they are at war with the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>  If members of the Opposition should ever win government and introduce a consumption tax, we know for certain that they will take no prisoners. Senator Vanstone's little red book is obnoxious not only because of the language but also because of the graphics used, which include tanks, semi-automatic rifles, armed soldiers, missiles, jets and grenades as the Rambos in the Opposition wage war on the Australian people. This is the manifesto of the New Right in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  For an insight into the thuggery, brutality and the lengths to which they are prepared to go, we need only remember the Leader of the Opposition's willingness to use the armed forces to settle industrial disputes. The man who supports competition, free enterprise and democracy would send in the troops to deny people their right to strike. Australia's own General Franco!</PARA>
<PARA>  We have seen the hypocrites on the Opposition benches express their concern for the unemployed. This is the same crowd which, under Malcolm Fraser, presided over double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. Yet what is their only proposal to solve the problem of unemployment? A consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  One needs only to look to New Zealand to see the effects of a consumption tax on the economy--increased unemployment, increased inflation and greater social unrest. It would seem that the Opposition has done more than look at New Zealand; it has had Sir Roger Douglas, the man responsible for New Zealand's economic woes, advising them. His policies have proven to be a failure in New Zealand and would be a disaster for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  A consumption tax would lead automatically to an increase in inflation as the cost of goods and services increased, and spending levels would decrease as people could no longer afford to maintain current spending levels. Demand would drop, which would, in turn, lead to a drop in production. Employers would be forced to reduce their work force, thus creating more unemployment--the very thing that the Leader of the Opposition says he does not want to do. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the Leader of the Opposition's reply to the Budget, which was long on rhetoric and devoid of substance, he said he was concerned for the unemployed. His care and concern is so great that, under his policies, unemployment queues would lengthen. After nine months, he would take away unemployment benefits. So much for his care and concern!</PARA>
<PARA>  The people of Australia have a right to know what the Opposition has in store for them. They need to be aware of the iron fist hidden in the velvet glove; yet the Opposition will not reveal any policy details. One can only assume that either it has none or that it is afraid to expose its policies, thereby revealing the hidden agenda. Both scenarios are plausible. </PARA>
<PARA>  A party that believes in and advocates a consumption tax, along with a flat tax rate, the need for the armed forces to settle industrial disputes, balanced Budgets, and the abolition of unemployment benefits after nine months must surely believe in the tooth fairy, Santa Claus and a flat earth. More importantly, its members must also believe in miracles, because they are the only way they will ever achieve Government with the policies they espouse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) might listen to what I have to say because I will refer to unemployment generated by this Government. I rise this evening to speak on behalf of those citizens of the Commonwealth whose pleas for a fair go have gone unheard in this place. I refer, of course, to our struggling farmers, small business people and the growing army of unemployed--an army that is rapidly becoming the shame of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We have just been told officially that unemployment is 9.8 per cent, but we all know that these statistics are carefully manipulated to tell whatever fairytale this Government hopes the electorate will believe. The Government cannot be serious when it suggests that there has been an increase in employment in recent months, because not only does this increase include 11,000 of the so-called employed census collectors but also the figures neglect to show that Australia now has the largest number of unemployed males since records have been kept. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the real Australia of devastated industries, bankrupt businesses, foreclosures on farms, personal desperation and family breakdown, the victims of the recession we had to have  tell a rather different story. Theirs is a story of high interest rates, the impact of a trade war between the United States and Europe, ever increasing government imposts and a recession engineered by a government which claims to represent the interests of the underdog. These are not the people who spend their days in air-conditioned offices discussing wine tasting and policy initiatives and what to do on the next RDO. These are not the people who live in the security of the Canberra bunker, where it is fun to be a social engineer and make policies which will never threaten the policy makers but may well destroy the productive capacity of thousands of Australian farms and businesses. These are not the people who enjoy the privilege of secure employment and an indexed pension. No; these are--or in many instances were--the people who actually produce much of the wealth of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Wealth produces the foundation for our democratic way of life and the freedoms most of us take for granted. It is impossible to have any faith in the public figures. How can the Government claim Australia's GDP has risen when the figures clearly show that two of the major wealth producing sectors are in serious decline? There is no doubt that many farmers are facing the worst crisis in decades. Farm incomes are expected to drop 59 per cent this year and a further 30 per cent in 1992. Some woolgrowers are facing the distressing prospect of negative income.  In the manufacturing sector, the outlook is just as bleak. Production in manufacturing continued to fall in the June quarter of this year, a continuation of the decline evident in the last four quarters. </PARA>
<PARA>  The inadequacy of statistics is revealed when one takes a look at the consequences of the de-industrialisation of Australia and the sale of so many of our farms. The statistics can never convey the despair felt by the farming families forced off their properties or the desperation felt by the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  To halt this carnage in the wealth creating sector, a debt moratorium is imperative. Obviously, it would need some guidelines. Firstly, a farmer or business would need to have been operating successfully for approximately five years, otherwise all businesses would be underwritten. We know that 80 per cent of new businesses fail in the first two years, something organisations such as the Victorian Economic Development Corporation and Tricontinental should have realised long ago. Secondly, there would have to be asset backing and a likely future cash flow to enable a long term recovery. I would imagine that that would not be all that difficult. </PARA>
<PARA>  I hear speakers on both sides of this House claim repeatedly that new businesses will flourish in the place of those currently being destroyed. It is drivel, it is an excuse and it is a cop-out. In order to build up 100,000 replacement businesses in Australia, it would be necessary to start half a million in the expectation of the normal attrition rate of 80 per cent. It will not happen; it is physically impossible to start 500,000 businesses quickly. It would simply save existing ones, not to mention be cheaper. The cost of destroying 100,000 existing businesses and 400,000 through attrition would be astronomical. </PARA>
<PARA>  This matter is urgent. It must be dealt with immediately. The prevailing inertia makes me think that Guy Fawkes and the gunpowder plot might have had a point. Those Government members who could adopt such a proposal need a bomb under them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --Earlier tonight in the House, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said that he took no joy out of the high unemployment figures that exist in Australia today. I accept that from the honourable member for Bennelong because I believe he is a man of integrity. There are other people of integrity on the other side of the House who hold a similar view. Of course, on this side of the House we do not take any joy out of those unemployment figures, although there are others on that side of the House who do. I believe that they see a distinct connection between high unemployment figures and their chances of winning at the next election. That is simply the way they see it. They do not see unemployment figures as reflecting personal problems for the people of their constituencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  High on that list is the National Party of Australia.  The National Party has sold out and abandoned country people with its support of the consumption tax. There are plenty of figures which show National Party electorates and country electorates generally have the highest number of people on low incomes--and we do not need figures to see that. It has been that way for a long while. The last census figures for 1986 showed that to be the position. We can go to country areas now where it will be very apparent that there are many people, the vast majority, on low incomes. That will still be the position when the recession has gone and it has been the position for many years. It is a result of policies long gone. </PARA>
<PARA>  But it is the people on low incomes who are going to be hardest hit by this regressive form of taxation which members opposite would introduce. It is the people the National Party represents who are going to be hardest hit. It is not a new phenomenon. The simple fact is that the representatives of the National Party electorates--which contain the highest number of people on low incomes and the lowest number on high incomes--want to support a tax which hurts the poor and benefits the rich. That just does not make sense, because the representatives of those electorates should be supporting the poorer people, the people on lower incomes. It is obvious that they are not. </PARA>
<PARA>  Approximately 31 per cent of families on low incomes are in my electorate; there are some Liberal Party of Australia electorates which have only 6 per cent and that follows through for those other National Party electorates with similar figures. So, it is quite understandable that the Liberal Party would want a consumption tax that benefits the rich. But it is not understandable that the National Party would want it. National Party representatives are letting down their constituency by supporting it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Taxpayers Association has produced figures which show that families with an income of about $20,000 would need a 63 per cent tax cut to have the same purchasing power if a consumption tax was introduced. I ask those representatives of country electorates: how many families in those electorates have an income above $20,000? There is not a real lot. Most families are under that income level. But if we look at Liberal Party electorates, some have 55 per cent of their families on incomes above $60,000. So, it is quite understandable why the Liberal Party will support that tax, but it makes no sense for the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA>  The National Party representatives ought to go out to their electorates and start talking to the ordinary people. Then they would know that their future does not lie in supporting the Liberal Party, but in supporting and defending the interests of the ordinary people in their electorates. How do rural people feel about having to cop a drop in the value of their land if they want to sell it under this consumption tax, because the value of the land is not going to go up. The goods and services tax does not make things suddenly more desirable or more valuable. Primary producers will suffer a drop in sales when their goods become more expensive. Milk sales will drop. What about the little kindy kids living on farms in rural areas? They do not get a lot of pocket money, but the couple of bob they get will be taxed by members opposite. </PARA>
<PARA>  I come from a country area containing the towns of Grafton, Casino and Lismore, and I have never seen a Ferrari in any of those towns. But if one lives at Darling Point or Bellevue Hill, one will see a few of them. So, I suppose it is fair enough if one is in a Liberal Party area and one wants to make Ferraris cheaper. But is not fair enough if one lives in the bush. There is a story going around that prices only go up--(Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- The Sir Humphrey syndrome is universal and policy is always manipulated to suit the special interests of the bureaucrats. If there was a signpost, it would say, `This way to a bigger Budget, more projects and increased staff'. Bureaucracies also skew policy to favour their `clientele'. The `captured bureaucracy', which identifies completely with the interest group it is supposed to control, is a familiar sight. Forestry commissions manage forests to suit the logging interests; pollution commissions often facilitate the activities of polluters; building inspectors nearly always favour developers against the interests of those who pay their salaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Governments have resorted to `corporatising' bureaucracies supposedly to teach them the fiscal facts of life and make them behave like private companies operating in the real world. What is supposed to happen to the public interest is not explained and the performance of corporatised agencies has not inspired great expectations of better outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the Commonwealth level, the Federal Airports Corporation illustrates all these features. The FAC was set up a few years ago on corporate lines to run Australia's airports as an efficient, profitable business. The Government sold the airports to the FAC for a fraction of their real value. The FAC's behaviour has been and is that of a self-interested bureaucracy, promoting its own growth. It is a captured bureaucracy, slavishly promoting the interests of the major airlines. One has only to look at the third runway issue to confirm this. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sydney Airport currently has a north-south and an east-west runway. The FAC is fiercely advocating a third runway but, if one can believe its recent press release, it will not be a third runway at all. It will effectively replace the east-west runway, we are told. If so, it will be a poor addition to airport capacity. </PARA>
<PARA>  Given that the new runway will be restricted to landings only and given the restrictions of the curfew operating at the airport, the shoe-horning into an inadequate site, the additional construction costs of filling in part of Botany Bay, and the inherent increase of aircraft taxiing times because of the distance of the new runway from the terminals, the FAC's enthusiasm for the project obviously has little to do with the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>  Apart from these disadvantages, a decision to expand the airport means the continuing degradation of surrounding urban areas, driving people out of Sydney's inner suburbs to add to the western sprawl, contributing to an almost criminal waste of the existing infrastructure, and enormous costs in replacing it elsewhere. It is hard to imagine a worse investment than the FAC's third runway. </PARA>
<PARA>  If there were nowhere else to go it might be excusable, but there is. A comparable runway could be built at Badgerys Creek for less money and in a faster time. For $411m--not the $720m the FAC claimed in its EIS--Sydney could have a fully functioning second airport. But the FAC is fighting this commonsense approach. The third runway suits the major airlines because they have got a stranglehold on Sydney Airport and want to keep it. The FAC is a captured bureaucracy serving their interests. A proliferation of airport developments--the third runway now, Badgerys Creek later--also suits the FAC's bureaucratic interests. </PARA>
<PARA>  The FAC's senior management is going to considerable lengths to achieve these objectives. Distortions, half-truths, spreading of misconceptions, secrecy and dubious public relations campaigns are all being used. In a recent media release the FAC claimed that a public opinion survey showed that more people in the noise affected areas supported the proposed third runway than opposed it. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is an outrageous claim and is no doubt founded on a misleading definition of `noise affected areas' and is clearly an unrepresentative sample. The fact that the FAC refuses to make public the full survey confirms this charge. No details of the questions asked in this survey are available and, given the bias exhibited, the questions asked would also have been misleading. </PARA>
<PARA>  The FAC's claims that the north-south runways will be used 98 per cent of the time and that there will be no take-offs to the north are patently untrue--unless, of course, aircraft safety is to be hopelessly compromised. It is not acceptable that the General Manager, Mr Snelling, should issue such partisan and untrue information to the public. It can only fuel public speculation that he is acting in the private and not in the public interest. </PARA>

<PARA>  There is no doubt the banks have a lot to answer for. What we are seeing now in Australia is banks foreclosing on viable industries simply to balance their books. Some banks are worse than others; Citibank is about the worst I have come across. I am presently engaged in negotiations with a television company to do an expose of this organisation. But I believe the honourable member for Dunkley has an idea as revolutionary as the motor car of his namesake, Mr Ford. If we do not face up to this problem we are going to make a wasteland of Australia's industry and rural sectors, and there will be nothing to recover. It is something that has to be taken seriously and I say that this House and this nation ought to be grateful to the honourable member for Dunkley for raising this. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has been a lot of talk in this House about the future of Australia. It is my view that the future will hinge on industry policy. It is also true to say that there is not a shred of evidence from the Opposition that it has any idea of what sort of industry policy we ought to embrace. I might say there is little evidence that my own party has any more knowledge. It seems to me that both parties say that we cannot pick winners. This is nonsense. All the successful nations have picked winners. It is not a matter of picking individual winners; they are picked in categories. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are only two categories to consider in Australia, that is, industries where we have a natural advantage or an intellectual advantage, and industries where we have a strategic need. If we limit ourselves to those things, we can clearly see what sorts of industries and what sort of industry policy this country needs. Agriculture and mining are clearly industries where we have a natural advantage. Agriculture is presently under pressure. It is going to need 10 years to restructure. The Government and this nation must grasp that nettle. We must be prepared to restructure this industry even at the cost of a very large injection of capital. Failure to do so will be to throw our heritage to the winds and leave Australia a much impoverished nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Honourable members would be aware that over the past 18 months a major project has been under way to modernise and improve the operations of the Hansard division of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. A number of improvements, such as the electronic transfer of greens to members' offices, have been introduced and well received.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  A major component of the modernisation project is the introduction of in-house publishing of the daily and weekly Hansards. This involves Hansard taking the responsibility for the laying out, formatting and pagination of the entire daily Hansard, tasks previously carried out by the Australian Government Publishing Service. Hansard provides camera-ready fully prepared material to the Australian Government Publishing Service for printing only.</PARA>
<PARA>  The benefits of in-house publishing are twofold. Firstly, there are substantial reductions in costs. Secondly, the daily Hansard should be available earlier than normal.</PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members will be interested to know that for the last two sitting weeks the daily Hansard for the House of Representatives has been published in-house by Hansard. I am sure that honourable members would agree that this is a significant step by the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff as it will allow the Parliament to take advantage of future developments in publishing technology with a consistent objective of continuing to improve the services provided to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>  Aside from the significant reductions in printing costs which will now occur, it has been noticeable that the daily Hansard has been delivered every day of this sitting fortnight at or before 9 a.m.</PARA>
<PARA>  The changes which have occurred in Hansard would not have been possible without the commitment, professionalism and dedication of all staff of the division. Major improvements have been made to all facets of Hansard's operations. I congratulate Mr Bernie Harris, the head of that division in the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, who is here in the House. I congratulate him and all his staff on a job very well done.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) seems to have left the chamber. He was quoting from Gray's Elegy in a Country Churchyard. At the end of another poem, John Donne's Devotions, there is an appropriate piece which applies to the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) and some other honourable members opposite. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to respond to a number of interventions by members of the Government on the question of the proposal for a goods and services tax. For those of us who have been here a little longer than the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and the honourable member for Parramatta, it is quite remarkable to hear what happens in Question Time and in all the various debates. The Labor Party seems to have forgotten the draft White Paper of 1985 and the passionate speeches made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), in favour of the arguments put forward in the draft White Paper of 1985 in favour of a broad based consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer all members of the Government to the most persuasive arguments in that paper. They should also refer back to the proceedings of the National Taxation Summit and to a number of public interviews and speeches given by the Prime Minister and the then Treasurer arguing the very persuasive case in economic and other terms for a broad based consumption tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-If the honourable member for Parramatta wishes to continue to pursue the absolutely puerile example of the Ministers we have here performing each day in Question Time, there is no hope for a generation of Labor Ministers in the proper conduct of the business of this House. It is time that these matters were debated with some intellectual integrity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The real problem is that everybody has known in Australia for a very long time that the taxation system needs substantial reform. In 1985 the Government, to its credit, produced a very worthwhile document--the draft White Paper on taxation reform. I commend that document to members of the Government who were not around in 1985. They will find all the absolutely persuasive arguments for this economic reform. The reform was not introduced. It had the support of the then Leader of the Opposition and the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It would have gone through with bipartisan support but for the opposition of the ACTU against the advocacy of the Prime Minister and the then Treasurer. It would have gone through. It is widely acknowledged that that is a very necessary taxation reform. </PARA>
<PARA>  We in the Opposition are merely proposing something that people have been arguing for years. We were told at the last election that both the major parties had failed the electorate in not being honest about the depth and breadth of Australia's problems and not being honest about the kinds of solutions that had to be put forward. We have decided to accept that advice, to be absolutely honest about the problems and to be totally straightforward</PARA>
<PARA>about our solutions. If we are not honest before the election about what people have to enter into partnership with the Government to do, we will not be able to carry out the reforms that are essential for Australia's future. </PARA>
