<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I rise on a matter of privilege that is based on news reports concerning a Mr Bill Ludwig, the Queensland Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, and certain comments that he is reported to have made in relation to the unsuccessful challenge by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). I am raising this matter at the earliest possible opportunity in accordance with the practice that the House adopts with respect to questions of parliamentary privilege.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been reported in many places that Mr Ludwig has publicly said that, if certain parliamentary members of the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party voted for the honourable member for Blaxland, those members would lose their preselection. The matter has received extensive coverage in the written press, on radio and on television. I am producing for you, Sir, extracts of the following newspaper articles: an article in today's Australian Financial Review entitled `Hawke's key Queensland bloc begins to disintegrate'; an article in Saturday's edition of the Canberra Times entitled `Defender of Women fights also for the PM'; and an article from today's edition of the Australian entitled, `Hogg accused of blatant intervention for Keating-row puts Labor in dreadful position'. I am also producing full copies of the newspapers. I trust that the extracts will be authorised as true extracts so that I may return the newspapers to the Parliamentary Library. </PARA>

<PARA>AWU State Secretary Mr Bill Ludwig has said publicly that those who vote for Mr Keating will not be endorsed by party members. </PARA>
<PARA>It is my submission that the conduct of Mr Ludwig amounts to a contempt of Parliament in that compliance with his demands by the relevant parliamentary members of the Labor Party would result in those members being inhibited in the performance of their duties as members of parliament and as members of this House. In this respect, the comments made by Mr Ludwig amount to intimidation or, at the very least, improper interference. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister is interjecting, and clearly rejects this view, he being a comrade in arms recently of Mr Ludwig, but the mere gratitude displayed by the Prime Minister is not sufficient to let Mr Ludwig off this one. It would seem that, contrary to the Prime Minister's view, others share my view. For example, in today's edition of the Australian, Mr Bob Hogg, the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, is reported, in reference to Mr Ludwig's comments, to have said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The raising of it in my view reflected the concern that exists about possible intimidation under the current circumstances we have in terms of the federal parliamentary leadership. </PARA>
<PARA>In a similar vein, the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler) is reported in today's edition of the Canberra Times as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>``I'm . . . totally dissatisfied with the interference of the AWU, the union in Queensland'', he said on ABC radio. </PARA>
<PARA>``And I find it a little bit distasteful that the Queensland secretary of that union is now speaking on behalf of elected Members of Parliament in that State on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA>I totally disrespect the AWU and their part in politics in Queensland and in particular in the Australian Labor Party.''</PARA>
<PARA>Section 73 of the Crimes Act 1914 says that it is a criminal offence for a person who, in order to influence or affect a member in the exercise of his duty or authority as a member, gives or confers or promises or offers to give or confer any benefit of any kind to or on the member. That offence carries a penalty of imprisonment for two years. It is my submission that prima facie the conduct of Mr Ludwig falls within the ambit of this provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The question I put before you, Mr Speaker, relates to parliamentary privilege, and I have made reference to the Crimes Act in order to highlight the seriousness of the matter under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to consider briefly the question of parliamentary privilege. At page 706 of House of Representatives Practice, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>To attempt by any improper means to influence a Member in his or her conduct as Member is a contempt. So too is any conduct having a tendency to impair a Member's independence in the future performance of his or her duty. </PARA>
<PARA>At pages 707 and 708, reference is made to a number of precedents which give effect to the principle that I have mentioned. In particular, reference is made to a report in 1947 by the United Kingdom House of Commons Committee of Privileges. There the Committee went to the trouble of elaborating upon the nature of the relevant head of privilege and what conduct may constitute a breach of that head of privilege. The Committee says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is a breach of privilege to take or threaten action which is not merely calculated to affect the Member's course of action in Parliament, but is of a kind against which it is absolutely necessary that Members should be protected if they are to discharge their duties as such independently and without fear of punishment or hope of reward. </PARA>
<PARA>A restatement of this principle can be found in section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. Having regard to section 4, and in its terms, quite clearly Mr Ludwig's comments were designed or calculated to inhibit or interfere, or at the very least would have had the likely effect of inhibiting or interfering, with the performance of the parliamentary duties of the relevant members concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I note that on 13 September 1990 you, Mr Speaker, had cause to consider a similar case involving a letter from a Melbourne firm of solicitors directed to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). On 17 September, after considering the principles and the precedents to which I have referred, you decided to give precedence to a motion to refer that matter to the Standing Committee of Privileges. This case, under present circumstances, in my view, is far more serious than the case you were concerned with in September last year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my submission, having regard to the relevant law and the practice and the ruling you gave on 17 September last year, that the matter under present consideration involves an important question of privilege. As such, it should be referred to the Committee of Privileges so that the House may have the benefit of its advice. In accordance with standing order 96 I leave the matter with you to decide the question of whether the matter involves a prima facie case of breach of privilege. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me finish-and our relationship. It is inevitable in retailing these events that there will be hurt, and I simply say by way of preface that I want to go to this in the way which is as least hurtful as possible. The fact is that, during the previous term of government, the honourable member for Blaxland believed that he should have a turn as Prime Minister in that term.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He cannot have it in that term. That one has passed. We are into a new one, as we will be in a new one after 1993. That was his view; I understood it, and there was some pressure put upon me by the honourable member for Blaxland. He had the view that it was either impossible or extraordinarily difficult to win the 1990 election. I did not share that view. I believed that, under my leadership, we would win what would be a very difficult election, but I believed we would win it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I may say parenthetically that it was a view not shared by, I think, even the majority of my colleagues. It was nevertheless one which I held profoundly. I believed it was a very necessary election to win because I believed that it was in the interests of this country that it should continue to be governed by a Labor Government and not by a tory coalition of the Liberal and National parties.</PARA>
<PARA> It was my profound hope that the honourable member for Blaxland would remain with me as the Treasurer in the lead-up to and in the fighting of that election and in the winning of it. He had a view that perhaps he may not wish to stay, and it was in that context that discussions took place. Before the meeting at Kirribilli there had been discussions with him, he had had discussions with others and, out of those discussions, four mutual friends met at Kirribilli.</PARA>
<PARA> I have not attempted at any point to deny the fact of that meeting, nor have I attempted at any point to deny the fact that, in the situation that I desperately wanted the honourable member for Blaxland to stay as part of that team to maximise our chance of winning that tough election, I gave the undertaking to which reference has been made that I would stand aside for him during the next term if we won that election. I have not at any stage attempted to deny that fact.</PARA>

<PARA> As I have said, I was reluctant to give that undertaking to the honourable member for Blaxland. I was reluctant to do it because I had then the profound belief that I would continue to be the one best able to lead this Government to victory. When I gave the commitment I hoped that as time went on during the next term he may come to understand that. I am not in any sense saying that that commitment was not given but, importantly, it was intended. I do not resile from the fact that, unfortunately, that put me in a situation where in the 1990 election it was understood, including by those at the Kirribilli meeting, it would be fatal to go into the election saying that I would stand aside--</PARA>

The election was already being run in terms of `A vote for Hawke is a vote for Keating'. It was accepted as politically suicidal if that was the case. It was agreed at the meeting at Kirribilli that no reference would be made to this fact, and for that obvious reason.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WF4">Ms CRAWFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. Would the Minister please inform the House of the effect of cutting $200m from government expenditure on sole parent pensions?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4511" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question goes to the effect of a cut of $200m in social security expenditure, directed particularly to sole parents. That idea came from Bill Cole, a former senior public servant who now works for the Institute of Public Affairs, who suggested that sole parent pensions might be restricted to sole parents with children where the children are under the age of 13. That is where the estimate of $200m came from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition, through its spokesperson on social security, is considering at least as drastic a measure as that suggested by Bill Cole. The Opposition suggests that the area of sole parent pensions can be looked at in a similar way to that suggested by Bill Cole, and Senator Alston is on the record in that regard. Indeed, it is consistent with a commitment made by the Leader of the Opposition that the coalition represents some kind of hardline alternative to our Government. The Leader of the Opposition has talked about how the electorate will wear pain. Of course, when we talk about pain, the question is: who is to bear the pain?</PARA>
<PARA> The area of social security and pensions and the area of cutting expenditure represent, in my view, a very clear way in which we can draw a contrast between the approach of the Government and that of the Opposition. No area of incomes security policy-indeed, of social policy-has been given greater attention by this Government than the area of payments for families with children, including sole parents.</PARA>
<PARA> A sole parent pensioner with two children under the age of 13, renting privately, with no income other than the pension, is receiving $216 a fortnight in payments for child maintenance and rent assistance. This represents a major improvement during the period of our Government. In addition, we have instituted a child support scheme which enforces non-custodial parents' obligation to support their children.</PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of sole parent pensioners receiving maintenance has increased from 25 per cent to 38 per cent, I think, in the last two years. The number continues to rise by 1,000 a month. The average amount of maintenance has increased from $25 a week in January 1988 to $49 per child in 1990-91. Maintenance income, of course, is income tested against social security payments, so it is effectively a clawback in terms of the child support scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> The child support scheme is the kind of reform which is the hallmark of this Government. The scheme increases sole parents' income while reducing social security expenditure. It involves creative and cooperative administrative arrangements between the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Social Security and the Attorney-General's Department. Sole parents are typically on pension only for a period of three years and we have made it increasingly possible for that to change, in terms of reduced time, through introduction of schemes such as the jobs, education and training scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, in relation to that question, we have a clear statement in terms of the Institute of Public Affairs. It is entirely consistent with the policies pursued by the Opposition: it involves reduction in expenditure and it involves necessarily a punitive approach to particular recipients-that is, to cut back the age of the children at which payment of sole parent pension is likely to be available.</PARA>
<PARA> The savings to be achieved through punitive approaches, not in terms of any principles of equity or in terms of any principles of social justice, would denigrate and reduce the standard of living of those who are amongst the poorest in the Australian community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. He and the honourable member for Herbert have both shown a very strong interest in this issue. They at least do care about the frail elderly in their electorates, even if those opposite will not tell us what they think.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I answer the specifics, let us look at Australia's aged care system as it was five years ago. Mr Speaker, as you and others on your committee at the time would know, many tens of thousands of people in nursing homes paid thousands of dollars in excess of their income. That is why people worried so much about getting old and frail. Many of them lived their older, healthier years in poverty and fear in case they had to go into a nursing home and cover those extra thousands of dollars in fees.</PARA>
<PARA> This Hawke Labor Government has changed all that, and it has changed it in five years. More than 100,000 of Australia's frailest and oldest now have security of health care, security of accommodation and financial security. How has this been done? It has been done by an overwhelming commitment on social justice by this Government to people to bring in a fee system linked to the pension level, along with a Commonwealth subsidy, of about $22,000 per resident per year.</PARA>
<PARA> In a couple of weeks time, on 1 July 1991-in less than a month-no person living in a nursing home in Australia will need to pay more than seven-eighths of the pension, plus any rent assistance he or she may be entitled to, for good care and secure accommodation. That means total financial, health and accommodation security for Australia's frailest people. Gone will be the days when growing sick and frail was literally a frightening prospect. That is how people lived under those opposite, and that is clearly what the Opposition is intent upon reintroducing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not rubbish. The Opposition cannot deny that there were thousands of dollars of fees for many people, it cannot deny that there were not systems or choices, which are there now. From the small piece of paper that the Opposition has put out called its policy and ideology, it is clearly intent on bringing in a user pays system and a goods and services tax or consumption tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is what the real world for Australia's frail elderly will be like under the Opposition. Over 90 per cent of people living in nursing homes are pensioners. The Government pays about 75 per cent of their cost of care, or about $22,000 per person per year. So what is user pays? What will those people pay, if the Opposition were ever elected, on top of the seven-eighths of the pension? Will they pay $1,000, $5,000, $10,000 or $22,000 extra per year? We want to know how much they will have to pay-who will pay and how much. That is what the Opposition will have to tell people if it wants to be able to convince them that they will be better off. However, it will not tell them, firstly, because it probably has not made up its mind and, secondly, because it is afraid of the repercussions of what people would think of it.</PARA>
<PARA> Who will pay to build these nursing homes? Last financial year, $125m was spent by this Government on capital grants to build nursing homes and hostels. The Opposition's policy, or the options being canvassed, suggests that they will be gone and that we will go to low interest loans or all repayable loans. So, who will pay? What will they pay?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member has said, with the situation in the wool and wheat industries in particular, times are very tough in the bush. We also recognise that some of the downturn and recession has not uniformly spread through the rural sector. It is very important that because difficulties facing individuals are more a consequence of specific commodity downturns rather than a function of general factors, we need to ensure that at the national level it is important that short term difficulties that some farmers find themselves in do not contribute to a long term decline in sustainability and profitability. Therefore, the appropriate response is to focus on long term structural reform-that is what this Government has been doing-not on short term palliatives, as would be put up by the people opposite, while ensuring that those who are suffering have access to adequate support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite by accident, I have here a report on sustainable agriculture. Members of the House who have an interest in this-that is mainly on my side-would be aware of the Australian Agricultural Council, which is the prime forum for Commonwealth-State consultation. At its meeting in February 1990 the Australian Agricultural Council agreed to focus its work on the development of sustainable agriculture. The Council commissioned a standing committee to prepare a report on sustainable agriculture that would focus on the problems and solutions by identifying changes that may be required to ensure sustainability, examining research, analysis and extension activity needed to promote such changes, and recommending changes to government policies. This report has been well regarded. Now that it has been published, I certainly advise honourable members that it is well worth a read.</PARA>
<PARA> The Agricultural Council has provided initial direction and useful resource development for the working group on ecologically sustainable agriculture. As well, the information that is being assembled and the analysis and the expertise of the contributors to the report will be of great value in implementing the relevant sections of the ecologically sustainable development strategy. I emphasise that what we have here is an issue of substance, not gloss. It is an example of the Government getting on with the hard work during very hard times.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Dobell for that question, although I point out to honourable members that I am sure he meant Expo 92 in Seville. It is 11 months until the opening of Expo 92, and planning is very well advanced as far as the Australian Government is concerned. I am happy to report to the House that the project is both on time and, importantly, within budget. Construction of the Australian pavilion is scheduled for completion to fit-out stage by the end of this current year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Expo in Seville next year will be a significant one by world standards. It is certainly the largest this century; to give honourable members an indication of just how large it is, the site will be five times the size of the site of Expo 88 in Brisbane. The theme of Expo 92 is the Age of Discovery, which focuses upon the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's voyage of discovery to the Americas. Consistent with this approach, the theme for Australia's pavilion at Expo 92 will be `Australia: discover, explore and experience'. The Australian pavilion site is located in a very prominent position. It will be a very imposing building: five storeys high incorporating a series of exhibits, a 600-seat audio-visual theatre and a small rainforest atrium.</PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the pavilion will be about two-thirds the size of the Australian National Library, and it is expected to attract about 4 1/2 million visitors during Expo. During Expo 92 itself, the Spanish Government is expecting some 40 million visits during that six-month period. Importantly, many of those visitations will come from the northern European countries, those countries that do have very strong economies and-importantly from Australia's perspective, from a trade and tourism perspective-that have very high disposable incomes, particularly countries such as England, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Italy.</PARA>
<PARA> From a tourism perspective, the Australian pavilion will complement the marketing strategy that has already been put in place so successfully by the Australian Tourist Commission, and we expect that there will be continuing high growth of international visitors as a result of our participation in Seville next year. Importantly, of course, 1992 sees the emergence of the single European market, and it is important that Australia does seek to use its opportunities there, both in trade and tourism promotion terms, to make the best of that. I understand that the Australian Trade Commission is certainly cooperating in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA> Recently, I had the pleasure to announce a joint venture between the Australia Council and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's ABC Enterprises which was successful with its tender to operate a retail concession at our site at Expo 92. The joint venture partners-that is, the Australia Council and ABC Enterprises-will consult with a whole range of arts industry experts in selecting and commissioning works for sale and will represent the very best in Australian art and culture. So it is very much in keeping with our emphasis in promoting Australia as a centre for cultural tourism, because a large number of visitors who come to Australia, principally as tourists, also want to experience something about the Australian culture. Recent figures on visitations to museums and art galleries certainly bear testimony to that particular fact.</PARA>
<PARA> Further focus on Australia's people will be provided by some 45 pavilion attendants, who will form an integral part of our pavilion's communication strategy and certainly will serve as young ambassadors for this country. I am aware of an enormous amount of interest in those positions. Indeed, I have had several representations from members on both sides of this Parliament who have in fact sought more information about these pavilion attendant positions. My Department will be calling for applications for those positions in the national press on Saturday, 6 July of this year, and we are certainly expecting a very large number. Qantas Airways Ltd and Argyle Diamond will also join the Commonwealth as major corporate sponsors in the pavilion, and negotiations are already under way with several very significant Australian companies in regard to the pavilion's official supplier program.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I believe that the next 11 months will see an important culmination of the planning, the funding, the training and the preparation by this Government to achieve the most significant presence ever of Australia at an international exposition. All is in place for a very highly successful, highly regarded Australian presence in Seville in 1992.</PARA>

The situation is that this Government, through the whole of its period and through this term of office, has had a situation where the Cabinet as a whole has made a very significant contribution to the whole range of relevant Government policy for this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without being exhaustive about this, it was the Minister for Community Services and Health who revamped the social security system, directing resources to those in need, with particular emphasis on the family allowance supplement, who is comprehensively reviewing Medicare, and who was the original proponent of the better cities concept. He will see those proposals through from his new post as Deputy Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button has had responsibility for our successful steel industry plan and other industry policy initiatives, for truly historic tariff reform, and for initiatives to support research and development in this country. May I say that the cooperative research centres, the Ballarat speech in 1987 committing us as to a micro-economic reform agenda, the Special Premiers Conference process with its unique ability to create nationally consistent laws and overhaul Commonwealth State financial relations, the 1990 round of micro-economic reforms, including telecommunications and the role of the airlines, and the recent waterfront negotiations were all contributions in which I was able to be very significantly involved.</PARA>
<PARA> The deregulation of grain handling, the deregulation of oil marketing, the rescue of the wool industry, reforms to the sugar, tobacco, citrus and dried fruit industries, and the promotion of the interests of rural Australia are only part of the contribution that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has made. The list goes on: environment protection; foreign policy; education reforms boosting payments to students; numbers of places at university and retention rates; defence, with a succession of overhauls and equipment, manpower, and contracting out to ensure that we have an effective fighting force.</PARA>
<PARA> Those are simply some of the range of not merely ideas but of effective policy implementation which has been engaged in by a whole range of members of my Cabinet. There is still a lot more that will be done by this range of talent. The following initiatives, for instance, are in train and will be delivered over the next 12 months or so: the Medicare review--</PARA>

As far as the Special Premiers Conference is concerned, we will be having land transport reform; nationally consistent rules for a range of industries; the National Rail Freight Corporation; improvements to the States' capacities to both fund and deliver services in this country; and an ongoing social justice agenda through the better cities initiative and through the amelioration of locational disadvantage by addressing problems of access to employment. The initiator of that is the Minister for Community Services and Health, the Deputy Prime Minister. That will be going on and there will, as I say, be the amelioration under that program of locational disadvantage by addressing problems of access to employment, education and services faced by people living in particular areas, such as the outer fringes of major cities and rural and remote areas.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Burke for his question. I point out to the House that the Government has three objectives in its postwar Middle East trade strategy: first, to restore trade to the prewar levels in commodities, which of course were our main export to the Middle East; second, to endeavour to diversify our exports to countries in the region; and, third, to participate in the extensive reconstruction that is taking place in the Middle East.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On Wednesday last I launched an information booklet on the Middle East entitled Trade and Economic Overview, which was prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It was targeted at firms with Middle East commercial interests. The book forms one part of our post-Gulf war trade strategy in the Middle East, which could be said to have begun with my visit to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait immediately following the war in March, when I was accompanied by a delegation of senior businessmen and officials.</PARA>
<PARA> We followed up that mission in April with a series of briefings in major Australian capital cities, which informed the Australian business community of the trade mission and the perceptions of that market. These briefings were led by Mr Paul Barratt, who has been assigned as special trade representative to the Middle East, and Mr Charles Jamieson of Austrade.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian firms have already reported the effective resumption of trade to Kuwait and other regional economies in established products such as live sheep, grains, processed food, electronic motors and water purifiers. In addition, there have been examples of firms which have already gained new contracts in Kuwait, including the Lincoln Electric Co. (Aust) Pty Ltd for electrical supplies and equipment, Execom Pty Ltd for telephone sets, and Onga Pty Ltd for water and other pumps.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there are a number of other Australian proposals in new areas which are being evaluated by various Kuwaiti agencies. Some of the areas in which those proposals by Australian firms have been made include telecommunications, port reconstruction, palace renovation, museum repair, medical services, education, oil-fire control, ordnance work, machinery hire, hotel refurbishment and catering services. This is, of course, despite the fact that the amount of construction work needed to repair structural damage in Kuwait now appears less than originally envisaged.</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, there are new areas of possible commercial involvement for Australian firms which have been identified in other regional countries, including engineering, manufacturing and the supply of goods and services. I certainly will be seeking to consolidate further our successes and to promote Australian commercial activity in the region by planning a series of joint economic missions to the Gulf region which, subject to the agreement of the relevant governments, I will lead later this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Are you right now, fellows? It has been a long-held principle with respect to statutory marketing authorities that the levy payers-and that is, in this case, the woolgrowers-should have a role and a say in terms of who goes on the statutory marketing authority boards, particularly as they are the levy payers. Given the circumstances in the industry and that the Government and the taxpayers are also now well and truly very big stakeholders, I have changed that from a majority of Wool Council members to a 3 : 3 : 1 split with respect to the selection committee. But the honourable gentleman should also take into account that the way I have specified the very boards themselves, where it is up to a maximum of two growers, there is really no way that the Wool Council, particularly in the way that he describes it, can dominate or dictate who shall go on the relevant bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As well as that, the role and functions of the new Wool Corporation and the Wool Realisation Commission are fundamentally different.

<PARA> That this House has no confidence in the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, there are 148 members in this House and there are 76 senators. The majority of them no longer have confidence in the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The 103 people on our side of the two Houses certainly have no confidence in the Prime Minister, and now there are 44 on the other side of the Houses who have today voted `no confidence' in the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has lost the confidence of the Parliament and, what is worse, he has lost the confidence of the Australian people. They have been lied to-repeatedly lied to-and they have been betrayed by this Government. They have lost confidence in his personal integrity and they have lost confidence in the integrity of his Government. The people have lost confidence in the Prime Minister and his Government because they have shown a disregard for the truth, a disregard for honesty, a disregard for openness about themselves and about our economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now clear that during and after the 1990 election the Prime Minister lied to the Australian people about his future in the job and about recession. This Government has taken the Australian people for granted and, what is worse, in many cases it has simply treated them as irrelevant. The bottom line of all the infighting and all the secret deals within this Government is that they have undermined the basic principles of parliamentary democracy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go first to the issue of the Prime Minister's personal integrity. The Prime Minister claims to be a man who prides himself on his integrity. He claims that his word should always be taken seriously. He claims that he can be trusted. He claims that he has some special kind of relationship with the Australian people, a relationship he once described, in very romantic terms, as a love affair with the Australian people. All these pretensions by the Prime Minister have now been totally blown away. </PARA>
<PARA> I said last Thursday in this Parliament, in a debate about the advertising ban and disclosure, that this Prime Minister has no principles, no sincerity and, most importantly, has lost the sense of what is right. The only thing he thinks that is right is what has to be done to ensure his own political survival. Looking back on those words just four days ago, how prophetic they were. </PARA>
<PARA> We thought it was bad enough, for example, when he failed to act in relation to what he should have known to be right and proper in relation to Brian Burke. The evidence was overwhelming, the damage to our international reputation was significant, and yet he let Brian Burke continue as our Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See-simply because he was a mate. As I have said previously in this House, the tragedy of that is that even Brian Burke, in his moment of disgrace, had a better idea of what was right than the Prime Minister had. All the Prime Minister ever thought about was what was in his own best interests and what he thought was essential to his own political survival. </PARA>
<PARA> There is currently before this Parliament legislation in relation to the advertising ban and disclosure, which again shows just how low the Prime Minister will stoop in order to ensure his political survival-even to the point of sacrificing one of the basic principles of our democratic system, namely the right of free speech, just so that he can make our lives difficult going into the next election, just so that he can make it difficult for us to get our message across, to advertise, just because those opposite have not got the capacity any more, as a divided shambles of a government, to raise money in order to fund themselves through the next election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister does not care. He judges every issue by what is good for, or what is essential to, his personal survival, not what is in the best interests of the people of Australia, and that is why they hold him in contempt. The Prime Minister has betrayed the trust of the people of Australia because they know, out of this particular incident, how he was prepared to trade the prime ministership of this country like a sack of potatoes. They know that he did a deal with the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). They know that he mortgaged his high office and the future of this country as the essence of that deal. They know that he then went out and knowingly and deliberately perpetrated a fraud on them at the last election. They know that he welshed on that deal, as the ex-Treasurer has gone out of his way in recent days to draw to the attention of anybody who would listen. We know that, right through those circumstances in particular, he proved himself as a man who can no longer be trusted. By his own actions and by his own words, he has forfeited the right to respect by the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go back through the appalling and unforgettable episode of the Kirribilli House conspiracy. It is a classic case of deception and double-dealing, and it shows how deeply run the mistrust and suspicion that underlie that false mateship of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Indeed, as the Speaker himself recently said, there are no friends in Canberra, just permanent interests, and that applies among the Labor Party members. Honourable members can forget all the phoney talk in recent months about Labor mateship; when mateship is put to the test, at times it crumbles-as shown in the last few days when the Prime Minister demonstrated his capacity to welsh on a deal. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said in this Parliament for months that this Labor Government is built on deals. It is built on deals with union leaders, deals with faction leaders, deals with big business, deals with extreme greenies, deals with some ethnic groups and deals with the Australian Democrats. Deals, deals and more deals! I guess the ALP has produced a manual on how to do deals and when one should do deals. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government, everything has been reduced to a deal. If Government members have a problem, for example, they should do a deal. If they still have a problem, they should do another deal. If things still do not turn out right, they should do a secret deal. If something still goes wrong, they should go out and deny the deal ever happened or blame somebody else for what has happened. Deals are the essential elements of the basic approach of this Government to its survival. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we have the evidence, disturbingly, of the biggest, the most secret, the most undemocratic and the most unjustifiable deal of them all-a deal to deal the prime ministership of this Australia like some sack of potatoes, without reference to the party in government or the Caucus, without reference to the Parliament and, most importantly, without reference to the people of Australia. It was without equal as the ultimate deal of this Government and it will be the essence of the collapse of this Government. A government that lives by deals dies by deals, and the daddy of all deals will make sure that the Government dies on the basis of it alone. </PARA>
<PARA> That deal was to deliver to the honourable member for Blaxland what he could never win in his own right, the keys to the Lodge. Throughout the life of this deal, which was born in secrecy at Kirribilli House, the Prime Minister and his former Deputy, the honourable member for Blaxland, consistently deceived the Australian people and each other. They broke their promises to the people and they broke their promises to each other. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as we know, this matter started back about the time of the ex-Treasurer's statement about a `Bring home the bacon' Budget in August 1988, after which the Prime Minister, obviously embarrassed by the publicity that the Treasurer got at the time, made it known the Treasurer was not indispensable. About that time, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), in a direct frontal attack on the Prime Minister, told the Prime Minister that it was time to go. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Those opposite do not stab each other in the back; they do it at the front. The Prime Minister acknowledged that the honourable member for Blaxland should succeed him, but not yet. He did not want to go into the 1990 election looking like a lame duck leader, as he has admitted in the Parliament today. But the honourable member for Blaxland, suspicious of his Prime Minister, unable to trust his Prime Minister, wanted more than just a nod; he wanted a solemn pledge and he wanted witnesses. He did not trust the Prime Minister, and how right the honourable member for Blaxland was not to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is fascinating that the witnesses chosen on this occasion were Sir Peter Abeles for the Prime Minister and Bill Kelty for the honourable member for Blaxland. They represented big business and big unions, the natural partners of the Hawke Labor Government. Can honourable members imagine the scene at Kirribilli House, with the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland, Bill and Sir Peter all sitting around-the champions of the Australian workers-trading the prime ministership of this country? Trading the prime ministership were one of the richest businessmen in Australia and one of the most blatant and antagonistic union bosses-the one who has had all the veto power over most policy reform over the last few years. Can honourable members imagine having him there to make sure that this deal went through in the way that at the time they all thought it should? I bet people down in the pubs of Coburg and people in the factories and supermarkets are impressed by that deal and its grubbiness. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Prime Minister was prepared to do a deal on the prime ministership of this country, without reference to the people of Australia, his own Caucus or anybody else, in the presence of those two people is absolutely staggering-beyond the belief, I am sure, of most average Australians. It shows just how out of touch the Prime Minister has become when he feels that he can go out, look people straight in the eye and have no repercussions from having traded so lightly with the prime ministership of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Prime Minister is trying to defend his indefensible conduct, but he has only got himself into a bigger hole. In his press conference today he referred to the fact that it was as a result of Bill Kelty's initiative that the deal took place. If it was not bad enough as it was first described, it is much worse when one figures on the fact that it was Bill Kelty who dictated that there ought to be a deal and that there ought to be witnesses to the deal. Who runs this country-the Prime Minister or Bill Kelty?</PARA>
<PARA> Just look at all the deals that have been done; look at all the reform that has been blocked by Bill Kelty. There is an old statement, of course, that if Bob Hawke had really wanted to run the country he should have stayed as head of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. There is no doubt that Bill Kelty has had an unbelievable influence over this Government to the detriment of the Government, to the detriment of the Labor Party and to the detriment of all workers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The deal was done and nobody was to know about it. On no fewer than eight occasions after November 1988 until early 1991 the Prime Minister publicly stated that he would serve out his full three-year term to the next parliament, all the time knowing he had promised the former Treasurer that he did not intend to do so. Honourable members might remember that in February 1991 Senator Button thought they had a deal and he said so publicly. What did the Prime Minister say about Senator Button? He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite, and let me be quite clear about this, the gratuitous and incorrect observation of Senator Button, I will serve a full term. Senator Button doesn't know what he is talking about. It is as simple as that. I simply believe that the electorate will believe me-</PARA>
<PARA>honourable members should listen to this-</PARA>
<PARA>rather than some assumptions that a talkative senator has expressed. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for honesty and openness in government. In the election campaign in March 1990, the deception of the Australian people reached its peak. Do honourable members remember that 60 Minutes performance with the two bosom pals sitting there, the Prime Minister and the ex-Deputy Prime Minister, being interviewed by Richard Carleton? Richard Carleton asked the Prime Minister whether he would be Prime Minister for the next three years, and he answered:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, if they elect me on 24 March, which I hope they will, then the answer is an unequivocal yes. </PARA>
<PARA>If that was not enough, he went across and asked the ex-Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Keating, if he would be happy to sit around for another three years playing second fiddle, and Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am happy-</PARA>
<PARA>you can just imagine one of his grins-</PARA>
<PARA>to be led by the most successful Prime Minister in the post war years. It is a pleasure for me. It has been a matter of great sense of accomplishment for all of us who have been in this cabinet. We are a very happy ship. </PARA>
<PARA>He did not use the word `Titanic', but he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a very happy ship. I might just say-</PARA>
<PARA>and this is wonderful-</PARA>
<PARA>we are a very happy couple. </PARA>
<PARA>Both of them, on television, lying through their teeth to the people of Australia; they perpetrated the worst sort of fraud on the people of Australia. If Australians had known that by voting for Hawke they would be getting Keating, then this Government would never have been re-elected. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Prime Minister showed an acute sensitivity to the interjection of my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) today, he is dead right: Bob Hawke would not have been returned in 1990 if the truth had been known about a vote for Hawke actually being a vote for that charming, wonderful, elanish type-the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> What appals Australians today is not just how the deal over the leadership was done; they are particularly appalled that it should have been done at all. A Treasurer with a record of failure epitomised by engineering the worst recession in this country for 60 years, by the assessment of any Australian, should have been fired, not promoted. They cannot understand why that deal should have been done at all. How insecure is this bloke? How much influence was he subjected to by Bill Kelty that he would do a deal about something as sacred as that?</PARA>
<PARA> We now know that beyond that the duplicity continued. The Prime Minister started to annoy the Treasurer towards the end of 1990, and the Treasurer broke out in that famous National Press Club speech where he called himself the Placido Domingo, I think, of Australian politics, or whatever. Yesterday on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio I heard a wonderful version of a song by Placido Domingo. The Prime Minister ticked the former Treasurer off and then started talking about staying on until 1996, even though he knew that the deal was there. That is the best example of a doublecross we will ever see. </PARA>
<PARA> In another meeting between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in late January-remember Senator Richardson spying in on that one through the cameras?-the Prime Minister told the Treasurer that the deal is off. That is when the Treasurer decided, obviously, to make good his prophecy of 1980. As a result of that second meeting in January this year, the Treasurer decided to make good his prophecy of 1980, which was, `The first Labor leader I tear down will be the one I replace'. He started working on tearing down the leader while professing his loyalty everywhere. On Face the Press on 3 May the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think loyalty is the stuff of politics. Political parties are built on loyalty. It is loyalty. Loyalty is the common thread, I think, which runs through the political organisation, and loyalty matters. It matters to me. </PARA>
<PARA>We have seen his brand of loyalty in the last few days. We have also seen the Prime Minister's brand of loyalty in recent times. Despite all his protestations over subsequent days, in April and May of this year, the Prime Minister knowingly was at war with his Treasurer, and all the time they were consistently denying the truth to the Australian people. They were simply claiming that the Prime Minister would stay his full term and so would the Treasurer. Indeed, as recently as the middle of last week, the Treasurer said, `The Prime Minister will stay Prime Minister as long as he deigns it to be the case'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's credibility can never recover from that. His integrity has been fatally compromised. It begs the question: what other secret deals has this bloke done over the years? Two have been revealed in the last couple of weeks-the gold tax deal where he changed the policy for a campaign contribution in Perth, and now this deal that has been done. Why should the people of Australia ever believe anything this Prime Minister says? Not only has his integrity been totally compromised; he can no longer govern. The people of Australia have enormous doubt about the integrity of his Government.</PARA>
<PARA> How did he survive today? He did a deal with the left wing. A government that is ridden with deals does one more deal just to stay alive, this time with the left wing. We can imagine what will happen to policy in the course of the next 12 to 18 months. What will happen to Coronation Hill, Wesley Vale, the three mines uranium policy, a wealth tax, or maybe a dozen other harebrained schemes? The Left and the new Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) have been put into that position to ensure that the deal takes place, to ensure that the deal is honoured by this Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> This country is in the worst recession in 60 years. The last thing it needed was a political crisis. The last thing it needed was the dishonesty, deception and the lack of integrity of the Prime Minister and his Government. Millions of Australians around this country are crying out for leadership in what are the most difficult circumstances that this country has seen in 60 years. They now know that the only way to get that sort of leadership is to vote him out at the next election. They are aware that he has deep-seated divisions within his Party that will stop him from governing. If he could not govern this country when he did not have the deep-seated divisions, how on earth will he do it now, particularly when he has done a deal with the Left and has elevated the leader of the Left to the position of Deputy Prime Minister?</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian people know that the Prime Minister is a lame duck. They know he is a captive of the Left. We have seen how well the Left has managed the State of Victoria. That is what the rest of Australia has to look forward to in the next few days. The people want politicians to get on and do their job, to put their personal ambitions to one side and address the real problems. They want them to look after those people who have been thrown out of work, to restore the hope, which has been put beyond their reach, of buying a home in this country; to get a job and keep a job; and to raise their living standards. All these things have been compromised by a Prime Minister who could not care about anything but his own political survival. Only a coalition Government has the vision and sense of direction to deliver this country to where it has to go, to re-establish its standing in the world. </PARA>

It is serious in the sense that it deals with an important issue. I want to respond to everything that the Leader of the Opposition said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, let me make it clear that the fundamental premise of the argument put by the Leader of the Opposition is false. In his proposition he is arguing that I did a deal with a businessman and a trade union leader about who would be the next Prime Minister. The fact is that it was not in my provenance to determine who the next Prime Minister would be. What was in my provenance was to decide whether there would be a vacancy. But there was no capacity within Sir Peter Abeles or Bill Kelty to make the decision for the Australian Labor Party as to who would lead it. That would be solely a matter for the Labor Caucus. The proposition has been falsely put by the Leader of the Opposition because it suits the practice of those opposite to peddle these falsehoods. </PARA>
<PARA> The case was that I could never make the decision as to who would be the next Prime Minister of this country. All I could do was make an opportunity for my colleagues in the Caucus to make a decision on that matter. I was motivated in what I did at all points not for my own personal satisfaction--</PARA>

What I have been about since the time I left university, joined the trade union movement and came into this Parliament has been solely serving the people of this country. The circumstances of 1988 were at one with that position, because I profoundly believed-and the Leader of the Opposition conceded it in his speech-that only Bob Hawke could have won the 1990 election.

<PARA> First, I turn to the report of its own Costigan royal commission-the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union.

<PARA>I knew in 1988, because I had lived through all this, that that was the philosophy of those opposite. The one thing that can be said about the philosophy of the conservatives is that it is not very complicated. It is very simple and straightforward, and it is this: protect the privileged; protect the rich; impose a greater burden on the poor, the underprivileged, the low to middle income earners. I knew that that is what they did in their last period in government, and I knew, on the evidence, that that is what they were committed to do again. </PARA>

So that it has not just come out of my mouth, let it also come out of the mouth of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). We have a situation where they were building it up in 1988, they were building it up for the 1990 election and they are still going ahead with it now. They want to impose a broad-based consumption tax. They wanted to do it then-and I was going to do everything I possibly could to stop them having that opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The centrepiece of their attack, which would be the most disastrous attack on the poor and the underprivileged in this country's history, would be to impose an additional $12 billion with their consumption tax. Let me say that the honourable member for O'Connor got it right when he expressed the sort of concern that I had back then in 1988 and again in 1990. In August of last year, the honourable member for O'Connor said:</PARA>
<PARA> On the basic principle, as percentage of income, the poor would spend more on consumption than the rich. Rolls Royces will get cheaper . . . but bread and milk will be more expensive. </PARA>
<PARA>That is from the Opposition, from the honourable member for O'Connor. That is exactly what would happen. Those opposite would make the necessities of life more expensive and reduce the tax on luxuries-all as a part of putting billions of dollars back into the pockets of those who are already rich. That is what 1988 and 1990 were all about as far as I was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I knew, and those opposite have confirmed, that I was the only one who could keep them out of office. I had seen the disaster which they had inflicted upon this country-a disaster which flowed out of their philosophy of propping up the privileged and slugging the poor.

We will see how many are honest enough to vote with their hearts on this motion of want of confidence or whether they are going to vote with their feet and toe the party line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also very interesting that the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) failed to come into the House to support the Prime Minister on this critical speech. Where is the honourable member for Blaxland? Has he taken his bat home? It is time for this Government to admit that all this has been about big business, big unions, big government and big deals, forgetting about small business and the vast number of Australians whose standard of living has been devastated by the economic policies of this Government. In short, it is not only time for the honourable member for Blaxland to go-and he has gone-but it is time for the Prime Minister to go. It is time that the Government went to the people and went out of office as quickly as possible. Both the Prime Minister and the former Treasurer have lost every shred of credibility with the 1988 secret deal-the ultimate deal. As my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) correctly says, it was the ultimate lie. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the time has come to expose even more the ramifications arising from this deal and to build on remarks made so capably by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). Firstly, the Prime Minister should state very clearly exactly what he did say to the then Treasurer at Kirribilli because what has emerged is that the Prime Minister did not trust his then Treasurer and the then Treasurer did not trust the Prime Minister; they could not rely on their own handshake. We now know that they met here in Parliament House in October 1988 and had a discussion. They reached agreement in 1988, in that great bicentennial year now besmirched by this shabby lie, this shabby deal. But that was not good enough: both of them said, `I don't trust you as far as I can kick you'. </PARA>
<PARA> So for nearly three years we have had a Prime Minister and a Treasurer, to this day, who were not able to trust each other; and so they sought seconds to the big duel. They sought witnesses to come forward. Whom did they seek? They sought Sir Peter Abeles from big business and Bill Kelty from big unions. The then Treasurer suggested a member of Caucus to act as witness-we now know that from the press conference-but the Prime Minister said, `I don't trust any member of my Caucus. I don't trust or rely on any member of the Caucus in the House of Representatives or the Senate. I want outsiders. I want particular outsiders to act as seconds to this shabby deal'. So it was that we had the ultimate deal, bypassing all members of Caucus, all members of Cabinet, and reasonable people such as the former Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian Parliament. He could have acted as duel broker. He could have acted as witness to this secret agreement at Kirribilli, but the Prime Minister would not trust him. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister would not trust the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). Well might he not trust the honourable member for Shortland because it is a particular insult to the honourable member for Shortland that the Prime Minister went to Sir Peter Abeles. I remind the House of testimony given in a book elsewhere that the honourable member for Shortland, when he was Minister for Aviation, was astounded to be called around to the Prime Minister's office in the old Parliament House and to find sitting there Sir Peter Abeles, who went into a detailed discussion on forthcoming changes in the Government's aviation policy-another deal in the making. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing which must be said is that quite clearly the Prime Minister has absolutely misled the Australian public for over two years in his repeated declarations that he was `going to stay on'. In the last 12 months the Prime Minister upgraded that promise. Let us look at two particular quotes. On 28 November 1990 on Perth radio, Western Australia, yet again, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>What I have made quite clear now for quite a long period of time is that after we win the next election-</PARA>
<PARA>in 1993 or whenever-</PARA>
<PARA>I would think in that next period it would be time to think about making way for the successor then. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it was an absolute commitment by the Prime Minister to serve out this particular parliamentary term. That particular statement on Western Australia radio was made ahead of the famous speech by the then Treasurer to the Christmas dinner of the National Press Club, the date on which the Prime Minister, in retrospect, claims that the famous agreement was absolutely torn up. I say to the House that that statement was made, is a quote and is absolute. The Prime Minister made that statement in the full knowledge that he was lying in his teeth as a consequence of the secret agreement at Kirribilli House. Then on 12 December 1990 the Prime Minister gave another so-called absolute commitment:</PARA>
<PARA>I now make it clear that I will lead the party to the next election, and with the intention of going through that term while I retain the keenness towards the job and the fitness for it that I do now. </PARA>
<PARA>It's an absolute commitment . . . that I will lead the party into the next election with the intention of leading the party through the whole of that term. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, once again, he spoke in the knowledge of the secret agreement. He misled and lied to the Australian public and to the Parliament. I guess the quote to top it all off is a more recent one--</PARA>

<PARA>My Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister is not disloyal. </PARA>
<PARA>This was 9 May, just a few weeks ago. The Prime Minister said of the honourable member for Blaxland that the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister of that day was not disloyal:</PARA>
<PARA>I enjoy the full support and cooperation of the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Some support! Some cooperation! He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I have been proud to be shoulder to shoulder with him when our employment figures have been rising; when our unemployment figures have been coming down. I have been proud to stand beside him and to take the credit with him, when we should get that credit. I am equally prepared, and always will be, to stand next to him, shoulder to shoulder, when the figures are going the other way. That is the way it has been for eight years, and that is the way it will be for many, many years yet. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet here we are, less than a statutory 28 days later, with the then Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer far removed from the front bench-and amen to that. We will not complete this double until we see the Prime Minister far removed from the front bench. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take up a particular comment made by the Prime Minister when he said in his speech a moment ago: `It would have been bad for the country if I had stepped down prior to the 1990 elections'. Does he not realise the disaster he has already created for Australia in his own policies, in allowing the Treasurer the full rein that he has? The balance of payment figure is yet again today $1.6 billion. As our shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), will develop in this debate, that is up some 70 per cent. The net foreign debt is $133 billion. There is rocketing unemployment and, worse still, a rocketing down of the employment base-a tragedy for thousands of people in Albury-Wodonga, in Liverpool, in Lavington, in Lilydale, and in every suburb that one can mention around Australia. There is story after story of the heartburn created by the economic recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> Both Prime Minister Hawke and Treasurer Keating, as he was until 10 o'clock this morning, have a great deal to answer for in terms of their economic performance. Now they have a lot more to answer for in terms of the shabby, secret deal which has done so much to tear up every shred of credibility associated with this Government. This secret agreement, this compact, was a grubby exercise from go to whoa. This great man of consensus, who speaks of his special empathy with the people of Australia, can no longer claim that special relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Government is paralysed on these matters the recession rolls on. A number of key decisions are required from the Government, such as Coronation Hill and other vital issues, including the preparation of this year's Budget. What has happened to the Budget Cabinet meetings and the subcommittee meetings and the Expenditure Review Committee meetings? The Government has been absolutely paralysed for days. </PARA>
<PARA> We know it is a government of special deals. I sound a note of warning: it is time for an end to the special deals because the special deals have been exposed and no longer are going to cause this Government to survive. In fact, they will provide the basis for the defeat of this Government when the next election occurs. In the context of these special deals, how can the Government explain the three-mines uranium policy? What deals have been done with the conservation movement to preserve this illogical policy? How can the Government explain its telecommunications policy? What deals have been done with the Telecom unions to bring about this second-best solution? The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) knows that it is a second-best solution. The honourable member for Blaxland made it very clear that it is the second best. </PARA>
<PARA> The ultimate area of deals of this Government is with the trade union movement, the industry relations club and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. There was deal after deal until we got to accord mark VI, when even that got to be too much for the Government, which went out on a course on its own, leaving the Industrial Relations Commission out to dry. Yet another deal was the gold tax industry deal. We now know, from evidence in the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters, that the Prime Minister significantly upgraded the commitment that there would be no gold tax by saying at that time that there would be no gold tax for an additional parliamentary term. That meant a lot of dollars for a lot of people. What arose from that dinner-what donations were made to the Australian Labor Party-is now history. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian people will never again take a statement from this Government or this Prime Minister at face value, and neither should they. They have lost faith with this Government. From this point on, the Government will be seen-as it deserves to be-as nothing more than a discredited, shabby collection of desperate individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Some Government members, at least, had the courage to get off the fence. I give them credit for that. For example, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) got off the fence. He backed the former Treasurer. If he had any courage to comply with the parliamentary convention, he would resign today as Whip. I think it was Tony Staley who set that precedent. At that time he resigned as Whip because he had moved against the then leader of his Party. So it is that the honourable member for Canning is on thin ice indeed. This is one of many examples. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no longer a true government; it is no longer a cohesive government. In these critical economic times-be it world recession or deep Australian recession with many parts of Australia such as Geelong, Horsham and other areas in actual depression-people expect and want a government of cohesion and leadership. They are sick and tired of watching Caucus fiddle while the country burns. </PARA>
<PARA> It is high time that we got back to the proceedings of government and the determination of Cabinet under a firm leadership. In all that has happened over these extraordinary five days, what we have had is proof positive that this Government has lost the right to govern Australia, because this Prime Minister and the former Treasurer have misled the public of Australia and have totally misled the Parliament of Australia. There is no more honourable a choice for the Prime Minister in the circumstances now obtaining than for him to back the judgment of no fewer than 44 members of his Caucus and resign. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard two speeches from Opposition members on the want of confidence motion against the Government that is essentially about the relationship between individuals and is essentially about subjective issues. The reality, in terms of this Government, is that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made a commitment, which essentially will be sustained through this term of Parliament. The commitment that the Prime Minister made was clear and unequivocal: that he would serve the whole of this term as Prime Minister. That is a commitment he will meet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one fact about the Labor movement and the Australian Labor Party which ought to be abundantly clear to all honourable members of this House: we are a party committed to the principles of participation and democracy. For 100 years the Labor Party, and only the Labor Party, has rigorously pursued the right of every Australian to participate in the affairs of our community. That fact is reflected in the rules, structures, culture and policies of this great Party. So when people speak of private agreements about succession, we on this side of politics say, `Bunkum'. Succession is for royalty. The democratic choice of a leader and an executive by the parliamentary party is the hallmark of the Labor Party. This morning we have again confirmed Bob Hawke in the leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> It is one thing to talk-certainly on this side-about a significant change in personnel. However, if one looks at personalities and power within the conservative parties, one will see a succession of backstabbing incidents which resulted in musical chairs on leadership and represented no standards of integrity to hold up to anyone, let alone to the Australian people. So when people talk about succession in this Party we remind ourselves of our democratic traditions and we have made decisions this morning in the light of those traditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, we will continue to pursue policies that are based firmly on the right of all Australians to participate in the affairs of their community. As we develop policies to take Australia into the next century, that will be the stark difference between the Labor Party and the conservatives in this country. Again and again, we have seen the conservatives come into this Parliament and want to talk about some issue that has to do with personalities or some problem that might exist in the Government ranks but has nothing substantial to do with policy. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Labor stands for democracy and participation. The tories, the conservatives, represent sectional interest and privileges. The tories have no idea about the way we should live together in society, which they simply see as non-interference-no public action to ensure liberty. They would leave all social arrangements to agreements between individuals. The social reality is for them to talk about deals. The reality is that they have no public policy and no sense of direction that can be defended publicly. Essentially, when they do develop their thinking, it is about private arrangements and agreements between individuals, not about the role of government and public policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The conservatives insist that government should minimise its role on the basis that arrangements are much more effectively made between individuals. This position is evident in the proposals of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to privatise welfare, highlighted in the recent paper from the Centre for Independent Studies which proposed that prime responsibility for delivery of income supported community services be handed over to private welfare organisations-charities-funded directly by taxpayers, who would elect that a proportion of their taxes be given to particular charities. </PARA>
<PARA> This extreme argument is carried by the coalition into the field of employment. It is easy to see what might happen in a libertarian world when an impoverished person agrees on weak terms to an employment contract with the rich and powerful. The rich or powerful person may or may not impose extreme penalties or abuse the employment contract in other ways. But, if he did, there would be nothing to stop him. That is precisely what the tories argue should be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that fairness and justice are indispensable to achieving freedom. From this point of view, citizenship does not guarantee an ideal of total freedom. What it does aspire to is equal and assured freedom for everyone to the greatest extent possible. Because we live in a social world and we are not isolated individuals, citizenship requires certain kinds of work and effort on the part of individuals. It also requires work on the part of governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's view of society, and of what all Australians as citizens should be able to expect from our government, is based on what we need to be able to function as effective members of our society. It is a view which in no way attempts to determine how we function, what diverse values we may espouse in shaping our lives or, within broad limits, what we do; but it acknowledges that there are certain basic capabilities and resources that all in our society need to effectively realise about their civic freedoms. </PARA>
<PARA> Consider the way we think about poverty. We can think about people in poverty as being unable to provide for their material needs. If we look at individuals in isolation, we need only to declare some minimum provision of income and make sure that a level of income is provided to those who cannot meet their material needs. </PARA>
<PARA> However, if we think about people in poverty as those who lack the means to function effectively in our society, then we are looking at a much more complicated set of issues. For example, we need to work towards making sure that people in this situation have access to information, education, training, health care, and the services and transport they need to support themselves in work and to gain equitable access to employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor as a Government aims to achieve a set of objectives. Among them is social justice. We measure our success in implementing concrete programs in terms of our progress towards achieving these goals for all our citizens. It is clear to Labor that the relationship between where people live and work and the location of training they need to help them to improve their opportunities, the services they need to support them in their working lives and the transport links between these points is extremely important. So it is focusing on these kinds of issues-the locational disadvantages, the need to restructure services and improve physical infrastructure and take account of demographic change-that is close to the heart of Labor's approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that-honourable members should remember that, ultimately, behind the rhetoric in this kind of debate we have important differences in terms of political philosophy-we see that the conservatives will dismantle the income security safety net, abolish sole parent pensions for people when their children are three years old, while not worrying about the vulnerability of people in that situation, and abolish the unemployment benefit. This demonstrates how harsh a conservative government would be. On 11 October, Dr Hewson said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have painted ourselves as a harder-line alternative to the Government and as time goes on the electorate will come more and more behind us. They will vote for us in the end if we've got credibility, if they genuinely believe that we are going to do what we say we will. If that involves pain they will wear it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has no policy reason and no principles. It is just that the visiting professor needs to appear tough. He wants to make the tax system grossly less fair. The Opposition would abolish the capital gains tax, leaving the spivs of the 1970s and 1980s to re-emerge in all the glory of their tax avoidance. The conservatives are essentially a party of privilege and they specialise in making deals to protect the privileged. </PARA>
<PARA> All this rot about deals comes from members opposite. We just need to have a look at their proposal for a goods and services tax, the centrepiece of their tax policy, to know that. A goods and services tax will have a disastrous impact on inflation. A 10 per cent goods and services tax which replaced the existing wholesale tax system could increase inflation by almost 9 per cent. The burden of a goods and services tax would fall most heavily on low income earners and social security pensioners and beneficiaries. The burden would fall more heavily on those with children than those without children. It is, of its essence, a regressive tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition intends to introduce a comprehensive goods and services tax which would include all food. This will particularly disadvantage families with children, low income earners and social security beneficiaries, because they spend a high proportion of their income on food for themselves and their children. A goods and services tax will also impact heavily on the purchase of new homes. An attempt to compensate losers through the tax system will be untargeted and give those who already gain further windfall gains. It will be very costly in revenue forgone on some estimates-$600m or more. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear from work done by the Australian Tax Research Foundation that it is impossible to compensate all losers under a goods and services tax without substantial increased expenditure. Attempts to construct compensation packages have left out those who are unemployed. They would suffer substantial increases in the cost of essential goods and services without compensation, undermining their ability to get back into work and recover their position. The longer people are unemployed, the worse would be their position. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition can produce all the anecdotes it likes about the impact of indirect taxes. The facts, on which good policy should be based, are that its proposal would lead to low income earners paying more tax and high income earners paying less tax. That is obviously inherently unfair. </PARA>
<PARA> I have referred to these broader policy issues because we have heard a lot about integrity from members of the Opposition. We have heard something from them about the politics of so-called survival. They keep mentioning notions of deals. Essentially, over a period we have seen conservative governments in this country amass deals which are absolutely incredible in terms of their impact. We heard from the Prime Minister at the beginning of this debate about the impact of the taxation policy in the course of the last period of conservative government. During that period, the only industry that was growing was the tax industry. It was the greatest growth industry of all in the country, at a time of incredible economic attrition, rising unemployment and massive decline in the viability of Australian industry. It was unbelievable and massively unfair. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who is at the table, fails to develop any clarity in terms of his policy. In a minute he will talk about integrity. But what integrity does he bring to a policy debate? He makes broad assertions about who, amongst the poor, would be targeted for the $3 billion in Opposition cuts and who would be impacted with the goods and services tax. He says nothing about the detail of that which, inevitably in terms of its regressive impact, would add to those expenditure cuts and he says nothing about the privatisation of welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> In each case, he is elevating some sectional interest over and above the public good. He is essentially saying that, in the end, individuals need to be protected. The mass of people on low incomes, those who are vulnerable, do not deserve protection; rather, they are to face additional imposts in consumption taxes. Essentially, that is about government for a sectional interest; it is government for those who are the friends of the tories and those who would be the beneficiaries of a tory government, those in the most powerful sections of corporate capital in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In this debate, certain questions regarding relationships which have existed between people in our Government have been elevated into an issue far beyond its importance. The reality is that, at the beginning of this term, the Prime Minister made a very clear commitment that he would lead the Labor Party through to the next election. With a democratic party such as the Labor Party such a commitment is always provisional. In the end it is always dependent on the continuing support of the parliamentary Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, a decision has been made by the parliamentary Labor Party to reaffirm and re-elect the Prime Minister into office so that he can meet his contract, his commitment to the Australian people. Ultimately, if one is going to talk about ethics or morality, at the end of the day the Australian people will have the expectation met by the presence of the Prime Minister through this particular term. But, more importantly, they will have in place a set of policies that are based on Labor Party principles and on a commitment to social justice, which tends towards the creation of a fairer society and, ultimately, would enable people to live much more effectively in this country than they would in terms of Opposition policy. That is what is being obfuscated by members of the Opposition. They do not want to detail their policy. They always look for the sideshow, they are not interested in defending their philosophy and their purposes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will comment on the remarks made by the newly elected Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe). Politics in this country is principally about political debate on policy issues, but it is also about honesty. It is telling people straight what the issues are, instead of the lies and the deceptions that we had going into the last election. Was it not remarkable that this former Methodist lay preacher never went to the issue, which was the lies and the deception of his own Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the last election? That is because the lies of the Prime Minister were indefensible on any reasonable criterion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's problem is that the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) will be Prime Minister within 12 months. He has plunged the knife into the Prime Minister and will do so again and again until he brings him down for his own personal ambitions. Well might he lunge the knife into the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is guilty of a base breach of faith. He is guilty of a treacherous, faithless betrayal of the trust of the Australian people, a deceitful violation of a promise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister is a liar, who professed his loyalty to this country for his own personal ambitions so he could cling to the keys of the Lodge. This was a gross act of perfidy, and ought to be declared as such. This motion calls on Government members. Where will the 44 members who voted against the Prime Minister this morning vote, how will their conscience dictate the way in which they vote when this matter comes to be voted on very shortly?</PARA>
<PARA> This is an open and shut case. We have the Prime Minister's own words on the public record-on the radio, on the television, in print. Wherever that man went in the last election he made a clear promise as to his intentions, and that was that he would stay on for the fourth term of an incoming Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Listen to the quotes, and there are many of them. This one was repeated in the Weekend Australian last weekend concerning questions to the Prime Minister before the last election:</PARA>
<PARA>Q: Will you lead the Party into the next election or not?</PARA>
<PARA>A: I would expect to . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Q: Is this just an expectation or a definite . . .</PARA>
<PARA>A: An intention. I mean, I can't be sure of intervening circumstances . . . beyond my control. As far as those that are in my control are concerned, it would be my intention. </PARA>
<PARA>That is clear black and white. He swore blue murder that he would in fact be the Prime Minister for the full term of an incoming Labor Government. In doing so, he broke the standard he himself set. This was the man who, back in May 1989, said, whilst speaking during a censure debate:</PARA>
<PARA>It is a special responsibility of the leadership on both sides to protect those values by setting standards and by enforcing them. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . One of the greatest of Australia's resources is the strength and the stability of its political system; our great parliamentary democracy. Anything that detracts from that strength and stability damages Australia. One of the vital elements in that strength and stability is the standards and integrity, the stability and the quality of leadership . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear setting of the standards by the man himself. He went out and broke that standard for his own personal gain. He is the same man who said that members of parliament are all in a position of service, responsibility and duty to the nation, where there is a fundamental requirement for integrity, probity, the ordinary decency of public life and honourable conduct. He is the same man who, in the 1990 election, lied through his teeth to maintain himself in office. What was his answer today? He said the political realities drove him to lie and to cheat and to run a fraudulent campaign in the last election. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I say that the charges brought against the Prime Minister today in this want of confidence motion substantiate the motion without a shadow of doubt. He is the man who said that Government members are entitled as a political party to go into an election and deliberately mislead people on the basis of believing that the policies of the Opposition might be wrong for the country. That is the ultimate in moral bankruptcy, if ever I heard it. That is the equivalent of the ends justifying the means. No prevarication, no dissembling by the Prime Minister, will get him off the hook of his deception in 1990. I say that a Prime Minister who says he is entitled to lie when it suits his political ends is not entitled to remain as Prime Minister of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the first charge against the Prime Minister is that he lied to the Australian public in the 1990 election. The second is that he participated in the Kirribilli conspiracy. He put mateship for his mate Sir Peter Abeles and for his mate Bill Kelty before the interests of the nation. I suspect that there was more to that particular deal than what has already come out so far. He treated the democratic processes with contempt. How can the Minister for Transport and Communications and Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) stand here, as he is going to, and defend a Prime Minister who himself treated the Minister with the absolute contempt with which he treated the rest of the Caucus? He treated the prime ministership of this country as his own personal chattel, as part of his own fiefdom, as if it was his to play with, as if it was a personal chattel which he could control without consulting the Australian people. For that he deserves our absolute condemnation. How dare this man trade in the prime ministership of this country?</PARA>
<PARA> The third charge is that he failed to deal with his deputy after the `Placido Domingo' speech of last year. The Prime Minister himself has said today that that was treachery, absolute treachery. That is how he characterised the remarks of the former Deputy Prime Minister; yet old jelly back sat back and did absolutely nothing, let the matter continue to fester. </PARA>
<PARA> Talking about the Prime Minister's own political interests-even his own staff are reported as saying, effectively, that it was politically inept not to sack the Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, because it would have been very popular to do so, as obviously it would have been to sack the man who has been the principal architect within the Government in bringing on the recession that we `had to have'. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, fourthly, a critical element of the charge is that the Prime Minister reneged on his own deal. It is one thing to be a participant in the Kirribilli conspiracy, but the Prime Minister then proceeded to renege on his own deal. It is not just a question of his not being able to trust people in his own Caucus as to what he was up to in the Kirribilli conspiracy; he himself cannot be trusted as a result of his breaching and reneging on the deal that he did with the honourable member for Blaxland. </PARA>
<PARA> This charge is, I might say, not just a charge made by the Opposition; it is also a charge made out eloquently by the honourable member for Blaxland, who himself has said that the Prime Minister cannot be trusted-that, of course, being the basis upon which the witnesses were brought in and the basis upon which the honourable member for Blaxland has proceeded with his challenge in the last few days. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, as part of the charge against the Prime Minister-the buck stops there with the Prime Minister; ultimately he is the one responsible for the management, politically economically and otherwise, of this Government and he has allowed great damage to be done to the Australian democratic process and the standing of the political process-by continuing in the office of Prime Minister, this man demeans Australia's political process. He reveals the Australian Labor Party as being a party entirely without principles. It has been shown to reveal finally what it is. </PARA>
<PARA> A charge laid not just by the Opposition but also by the honourable member for Blaxland is that the Prime Minister leads a Government entirely bereft of ideas, devoid of vision, devoid of answers for an economy which has been plunged into the depths of recession-in fact, an economy that stares down the barrel of a depression, as a result of deliberate government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Do not forget that it was at the last election-and this is another great lie that was told to the Australian public-that the people were told, `Don't worry, it will be a soft landing'. The Prime Minister said in the week leading up to the election, `There won't be a recession'. The then Treasurer himself said-talk about Mr Arrogance-he would not let there be a recession; yet, as was revealed post that election, their policy all along was to bring on a recession, to wreak great damage, great hardship on the ordinary working person in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of this policy paralysis, as a result of the quest for the top job-for the keys to the Lodge-what do we have across the broad spectrum? The Government likes to talk about policy. Look at the policy paralysis on its own side: Coronation Hill, to take the immediate one; a decision again deferred. Look at the uranium policy. The Government talks about integrity on policy. These guys have been playing with the uranium policy for one reason only, and that is to shore up the votes of the Left for today's leadership challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there was the Premiers Conference. What a farce! At a critical time for this country, as we look toward the future and the need to maintain a tight fiscal policy, what a farce it was that we had the Prime Minister and ex-Treasurer dealing with the Premiers last week. What does that mean for the average person? It means people continue to pay high interest rates because this Government has not been prepared to take the hard decisions in relation to fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister says there will be no damage as a result of this. He just cancelled his trip to Europe-cancelled the further negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which are absolutely critical. Various Ministers were brought back from overseas. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) was called back from his proposed visit to South Africa and the Deputy Prime Minister himself, the Minister for Community Affairs and Health (Mr Howe), was called back from government business being transacted on our behalf last week. </PARA>
<PARA> Another consequence is the institutionalisation of a government in a state of instability. How will some Ministers look the Prime Minister in the face? There is the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). We know he was the ex-Treasurer's campaign manager back in 1988 and is still a strong supporter of his. We have the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett), the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). They will all sit in the Cabinet while owing their allegiance to one outside the Cabinet as he continues to deal more deals-double deals, triple deals, all designed to bring down this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As these people fight over the top job, what about the ordinary Australian? Those opposite profess much compassion for the ordinary Australian. What does the ordinary Australian say today about the rise in unemployment as a deliberate result of Government policy? Just last night the ANZ Bank's job figures were put out. What did we see? We saw another big drop in the number of advertisements. The figure has gone from over 40,000 just two years ago down to 13,000. That is an important leading indicator on where the job market is going. There was no discussion on that today; there was no policy response from those opposite except that I suppose they want to blow out on the fiscal side. </PARA>

<PARA> The truth of the matter is that those opposite have made no real structural changes to this economy. The sad thing for this economy and this country is that the ex-Treasurer waits in the wings for the top job. He was the Treasurer who said:</PARA>

<PARA> We finally got to a point where we had no choice but to make a choice. That was not something any of us wished or something that any of us wished on the country. As a result of that, inevitably, we have lost the services from the front bench of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who is the greatest Treasurer of this country since Ted Theodore. We do not rely for that view on the humbug merchants opposite, but on the people who have witnessed the way in which this country has operated. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get on to the results in a minute. The second area of sadness is that unquestionably, for a time, circumstances like these which we face advantage our opponents; our opponents have been seeking to take advantage of that here today with their usual hypocrisy and humbug, as reflected in the speeches that they have made here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those opposite came in here clothing themselves in the view that there is instability on this side which tortures the lives of the poor people in this country-but knowing what sits behind their policy. This, too, will pass. In my view, Harold Wilson did not make many contributions to politics, but he made one, and that was this: he said that a week is a long time in politics. A week is a long time in politics, and two years is an era. </PARA>
<PARA> But we know one good thing about those opposite, with all their cant and hypocrisy about what happens with big business. They will allow all the funny money merchants and spivs of the 1980s that still have a tipple worth of property left on their books to keep their ill-gotten gains, tax free, and they will make the poor ordinary people, for whom those opposite hypocritically bleed, pay for it at a rate of 15 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say one or two things about the issues here. We could go through all the ramifications those opposite like. But the first that is important as far as public commitments are concerned is this: at the last election, at which this Government submitted itself to the public for its approval, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) undertook to the people of this country that he would serve this term, and he honours that undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point about the cant and hypocrisy from the those opposite is that they do not come into this debate with clean hands. In less time back into history than we are away from the next election, we confronted those wonderful scenes in this place where the honourable, honest people opposite, who never do deals or tell lies behind anybody's backs, were disporting themselves in the old `Andrew and John and Fred and Alice' show. That is what we had from the mob opposite less time ago than the time to the next election, if we look forward into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Two years before that, those opposite went through the same dance and parade. They do not think of the lies that were told at that time, even though they now talk about bitter deception. Let me refer to an interview between Michael Carlton and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). Mike Carlton said:</PARA>
<PARA>Do you accept Andrew Peacock's denials, his claim that he knew nothing about this until the weekend; that he was simply drafted . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, drafted for the leadership. The honourable member for Bennelong answered:</PARA>
<PARA>I can't believe that in the face of what transpired on Monday night and what I know . . . I cannot believe in all my heart that he was not privy to the detail of that. </PARA>
<PARA>And so say all of us. Mike Carlton asked him:</PARA>
<PARA>So you believe he has lied?</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Bennelong replied:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, somebody is not telling the truth . . . You can't have gone into that kind of detail and then expect people to believe that suddenly people came along and tapped you on the shoulder and said, `Hey chum, we'd like you to be leader'. </PARA>
<PARA>Then there are the words of Senator Michael Baume, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a simple question. One has to decide who is lying-John Moore and Wilson Tuckey or Andrew Peacock. </PARA>
<PARA>Those opposite should not come into this place saying that they are believers in the high politics of total integrity. We on this side have had to explain a few things and the Prime Minister has been doing that in Question Time. But what we will not cop in this debate is the cant and hypocrisy from the other side of the House-the cant and hypocrisy when it comes to areas of deception. Of course, we have that in policy terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite have their own internecine struggles. Nobody expects every politician to walk out into a public place and expose his heart on what he intends his activities to be. Nobody in politics conducts a sort of mobile gestalt around the press gallery by saying, `Well, today I am feeling like being leader of the Liberal Party, but tomorrow I might feel like being the shadow Treasurer and it is entirely possible that in a week or so I will feel like being the shadow Minister for Defence'. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody in the media in this country-nobody in this country-expects politicians to come out and say absolutely everything that is in their hearts at every point of time. I will tell the House what they expect. They expect that honourable members opposite will at least have the honesty to stand up in public--</PARA>

<PARA> The Opposition has a record on policy of complete deceit. But I do congratulate the Opposition on one thing. There is one area where it is not being deceitful at the moment, at least not in totality but in terms of basic principle. It has not yet given us the figures as to what will be covered by the consumption tax, what level it is going to be, what the compensation arrangements will be. But we do know this: there will be one.

The Liberal Party in its entire 50-year history has operated as a total open book for all the public to see and write upon it whatever they wish to write upon it-those totally populist individuals who have no policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Cop the two-airline agreement, for starters. What was one of the Opposition's wonderful little deals that we managed to uncouple when we came into office? Honourable members opposite have been abusing the Prime Minister for his personal friendship with Peter Abeles. Who took off the two-airlines agreement, of which Peter Abeles-at least as far as the private sector was concerned-was the principal beneficiary? Little old us. Who put it on? Little old you. There is much being concealed behind the persiflage of this Opposition when it comes down to those secret deals issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has said here that as far as the Opposition is concerned the shoddiness of what the Government is proposing is reflected in its political disclosure legislation and advertising bans. My God, I would love to have had a bit of political disclosure legislation around the place for Liberal Party campaigns when those two-airlines agreements were being put in place in the 1950s and the 1960s and the 1970s and in the 1980s. I would have liked a bit of political campaign disclosure around the place when those deals were being put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition should not come in here wrapping itself in micro-economic reform flags, saying that it does not know a thing or two about political deals around the place. One of the most significant micro-economic reform proposals put in place by this Government was the abolition of that two-airlines agreement-and do we know it in Western Australia, where for the first time in our lives we finally have a decent amount of air communication with the eastern States. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry I have been ruled out from being able to use the word `liar'. On this side of the House we were going to let it go but the Speaker earlier today was too fastidious. One of the pieces of `misleading' we managed to get from the Leader of the Opposition was that absolute untruth, that statement he made that the gold tax policy was sold for contributions. In no way at all has that been established by any of the propositions put forward during the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in Western Australia. That was not an argument the Opposition was capable of sustaining when it raised it before in the House, but it now intends to mythologise it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition now intends to mythologise it by coming into this place and saying, `We can ramble that off in a taxonomy of our criticisms of the Government; we will run that down the list'. There was one outfit that was making life hard for us on the gold tax at the time, when we were rustling around as to whether or not we ought to introduce it, trying to take the policy issues and the political flak on it. I did not dispute at the time, and I do not dispute now, that there were people in our own ranks who disagreed, but our fundamental political problem was not divisions amongst ourselves on that issue, not calculations about the economic consequences, although those had to be thought through, but that the Opposition, the great moralists on the subject of a gold tax, had decided it would exempt it for all time. In the end, that is why we came to the decision we did. The Opposition then made it an issue in the replacement ultimately of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) with the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) as Leader of the Parliamentary Liberal Party. In so far as the gold tax represented anything in political arrangements in this place, it represented front and centre chicanery in the Parliamentary Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition then has a description of the way in which the Government undertakes a consultancy process with the public as a deal. Its conception of democracy in this country is that we have elections and, after those elections, a government is put in place. The government receives revealed truth upon itself according to its ideology. The government stands back from the public and introduces policy on the basis of that revealed truth which has come through to it, and it never talks to anybody in the community. That is the Liberal Party theory according to honourable members opposite. It is not its practice, but that is the Liberal Party theory of how one should conduct oneself in politics. </PARA>
<PARA> If, on the other hand, one believes that democracy is a condition of mind and operation in public policy in the community as a whole, and that merely winning office does not end the consultative process with people who are concerned in the community about decisions that one might take, somehow or other that is transformed not into a democratic process but into a political deal. That is the Liberal Party theory as expounded in the sorts of words put forward here today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition criticises us for being prepared to talk to manufacturers in the timber industry, loggers in the timber industry, the people who object to logging, the people who object to uranium mining. There is all this nonsense about the uranium mining policy in this country giving us a problem with development when we cannot sell the uranium we have at the moment. But the fact that we are prepared to talk to conservationists or a few people who are a bit serious about the issue of nuclear weapons or whatever is regarded as deals. The Opposition says in that context that what we are talking about is deals. Above all, there is the criticism that the Opposition makes of arrangements we put in place for the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the evening television news last Friday, both Channel 9 in Sydney and Channel 3 in Newcastle falsely and maliciously defamed my character as well as the characters of my sons and the Director of Public Prosecutions in New South Wales. The most painful burden parliamentarians have to endure is when sections of the media indulge in the cowardly process of attempting to damage their reputation by attacking members of their family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I will not stretch your patience or the rules governing personal explanations by seeking to canvass the facts that led to the Director of Public Prosecutions dismissing certain charges laid by the police against my sons. I propose to raise those matters on another occasion. However, it is relevant to explain the manner in which I have been misrepresented. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1990 one of my sons was assailed by two security guards and a rottweiler guard dog in a caravan park adjoining my home after he had endeavoured to exercise his undoubted right of way to access our home. He was falsely arrested by the security guards and both my sons were subsequently assaulted, arrested and imprisoned by the security guards and then the police.</PARA>
<PARA> The nature of the misrepresentation and the television news items that impugns my character is: firstly, in a totally one-sided distortion of the facts, the false impression is given that my sons were guilty of the charges laid against them; and, secondly, the powerful inference was then made that I used my influence to corrupt the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Indeed, on the program Mr Tony Day, spokesman for the Police Association of New South Wales, called for the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions to be investigated by the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. Given that the Independent Commission Against Corruption only investigates questions of corruption by holders of public office, the only conclusion that can be drawn from the statement is that the Director of Public Prosecutions has been corruptly influenced in his decision.</PARA>
<PARA> The presentation of the item, which strongly emphasised my name and film footage of my previous campaign and my role as the first law officer of New South Wales, leads to the strong inference that it was my influence that should be investigated by the Independent Commission Against Corruption. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to inform the House that I left the defence of the undoubted and demonstrable innocence of my sons in the very capable hands of one of this country's most eminent and respected Queen's Counsel. I made no personal contact directly or indirectly with the police or the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in New South Wales. The only point of contact was the senior counsel who acted on my sons' behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> I should add here that it was the senior police prosecutor involved in the case who first expressed the view to senior counsel that having read the brief he was going to recommend that the charges be withdrawn. The matter was then taken out of the hands of the Police Prosecutor's office by the Greiner Administration and given to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Senior counsel, in accordance with the proper and accepted processes of law, drafted a submission to the Director of Public Prosecutions which was engrossed and forwarded by the highly reputable legal firm of Taylor &amp;Scott who were the instructing solicitors. The Director of Public Prosecutions duly considered the matter, agreed with the senior police prosecutor and then advised the parties that the charges were to be withdrawn because in the view of the Director of Public Prosecutions the police were not acting properly in the execution of their duty. </PARA>
<PARA> For the television item to suggest, as it did, that I could have improperly influenced either the New South Wales police force or the Greiner Administration is an insult to the intelligence of the viewing public who were perfectly aware of the recent political history in New South Wales and the true nature of my relationship with those administrations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion just moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) covers more than the suspension of the 11 o'clock rule. There is a second part to it and that is what I want to focus on. The Government is now proposing to apply the guillotine to 33 Bills. All of those Bills must be dealt with by dinner time on Thursday evening; I think the precise time is 6.10 p.m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is again rushing legislation through the House in the dying stages of the session and severely restricting debate on important and complex issues. If I can invoke the word that I have used on a previous occasion in relation to this particular matter, it is outrageous. It emphasises once again the utter contempt that the Government has for this Parliament. It uses it as a rubber stamp and as merely a means of getting its legislation through as quickly as possible and getting back to the Cabinet room and the Caucus room to actually govern the country. </PARA>
<PARA> This House has been sitting since 12 February this year. It has met every month, most months for only two weeks. On one other occasion in May, it met for three weeks. The House is due to get up at the end of this week and, as the Leader of the House has indicated, we could well come back during the week commencing 17 June and also the first week in July. So there is adequate time to deal with the legislation in a reasonable and rational way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government introduced six Bills last Wednesday night. Between midnight last Thursday and 3.30 a.m. on Friday, it introduced another 27 Bills. All of these 33 Bills, plus four others introduced earlier, a total of 37, are now being put under the guillotine. The volume of new legislation has made it impossible for the Opposition to adequately consider the Bills and for the shadow Ministry to meet and decide its approach, apart from putting its recommendations to the coalition parties in an appropriate way. No real time has been given for proper scrutiny and analysis of the legislation and far less for debate. I suspect that that applies to members of the Government, just as it applies to members of the Opposition. I wonder how many honourable members sitting opposite me, for example, have actually scrutinised the Bills that are currently before the Parliament? I suspect that very few have done so. By denying us the time, the Government is abrogating its responsibilities to the electors. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier last week, the Government also used the guillotine when it introduced its package of seven Bills dealing with the general, regulatory framework covering telecommunications in Australia. Only 4 hours and 20 minutes was allowed for debate on those Bills and consequent amendments. Yet these were crucial matters affecting the future of the vital telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA> We also had to debate the highly controversial Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, which, apart from being a blatant attack on free speech, in the opinion of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, clearly constitutes a breach of Australia's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. For all stages of that Bill, members had only 4 1/2 hours for debate in this chamber-and precious little time to consider the Bills outside of the Parliament in the shadow Ministry and in the joint party room. </PARA>
<PARA> This week, the House is going to have to deal with 37 Bills in four days and these will all be subject to the guillotine. At most, we will get only 40 minutes on each Bill, apart from one, the Proceeds of Crime Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, for which a mere 15 minutes has been allocated. This use of the guillotine has become a recognised practice of this Government. As has been mentioned on previous occasions, and despite the protests of the Leader of the House, I reiterate that the repeated use of the guillotine can be put down to only two things: firstly, that insufficient time has been set aside to deal with the legislation; and, secondly, that the legislation that the Government wishes to deal with has been introduced too late. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back, Mr Speaker, and remind you and the House that we have been sitting here since 12 February, yet it was only last week that this package of Bills was introduced in the early hours of the morning. There were very few members in the House because of the hour of the day, and there was very little time in which to consider the legislation. It is scandalous and it is indicative of the attitude of this Government-an attitude of a Government that rules by deals and deception, and now a Government that is turning its back on the Parliament, the main forum that is available in a democracy. This recurring bunching of legislation at the end of the sitting period suggests a breakdown in the Government's management process, as well as its attitude to the Parliament and the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government had a regard for Parliament, and if it could manage its own affairs, this legislation would have been introduced in February, March or April, and it could have been on the table of the House and have been dealt with in a civilised manner. It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that legislation is processed through the Cabinet procedures and brought into the House to allow proper debate. This, of course, must also mean that sufficient time is given for the Opposition to be able to adequately consider such legislation before it comes up for debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that all honourable members on both sides of the House have accepted over the years that democracy is a system whereby the majority view prevails and the minority view is heard. This Government is moving in such a way that, in future, the minority view is going to be heard less and less. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of the measures being dealt with under the guillotine during the current sittings, as well as previous ones, are most contentious and complex. It is therefore essential that a proper allotment of time be provided to allow serious scrutiny of them. I am sure that members of the public, Mr Speaker, and indeed you and all members of the House, will be interested to know of the important legislation that is being brought into the House at this time. We have, for example, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill, a very important piece of legislation, and I am sure that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is very interested in that piece of legislation. That is the first to be dealt with, and that piece of legislation has to be completed through this House by 5.50 this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the Service and Execution of Process Amendment Bill. We have the Migration Amendment Bill. We have three Bills dealing with social security matters. We have the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill. We have three Bills dealing with the very important and highly contentious problems within the wool industry. We have the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill. We have the Primary Industries (Industry Councils) Bill. We have the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no fewer than seven Bills dealing with the fishing industry. There is the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill, the Courts (Mediation and Arbitration) Bill, the Proceeds of Crime Legislation Amendment Bill, the Quarantine Amendment Bill, the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill and the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. There are two health Bills: the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill. There are two Bills that deal with the road transport industry-the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill-and finally the Foreign Judgments Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, this is a matter that should be of great interest and indeed great concern to you as the custodian of the rights and privileges of members of this House. Mr Speaker, although it is not a matter that you have a direct responsibility for, I ask you to listen to what I am saying and to take this matter up-immediately if you like, but certainly at a subsequent hour-with the Leader of the House, and say to him what you ought to say as the Speaker of this House: that enough is enough, that we have gone far enough with this kind of legislation and this way of dealing with legislation. It is my hope that we would get an assurance from the Leader of the House, at this late stage in the life of the Hawke Government, that the guillotine will not be used again in this way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point about our sitting patterns now is that we do sit for the vast proportion of this year-probably more than has been the situation of any other parliament. Our breaks between major sittings are narrower and narrower. That is because of a large number of factors. The question of preparing legislation is one thing, but our Government is no different to others. We operate under a slightly higher handicap in that it is harder and harder to employ parliamentary counsel these days as a result of the direction in which legal fees have gone.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for O'Connor heckled, suggesting we should put it out to the private sector. The fact of the matter is we do, but it is a highly specialised task; it cannot be done by just anybody. So we can take it to only a certain level. There is that area of problem, and I do not dispute that that is a problem. There is also a problem from time to time in drafting instructions, but again there has been no difference in our situation as opposed to that of previous governments. Perhaps it ought to be better, but it is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second thing is the amount of private members' time, which is unprecedented and desirable. The third is the decisions to alter the sitting patterns. On our side at least, it was invented by the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) with a concern for the health of all members of the Parliament that we should sit like this. So blame him. The situation is that we do sit at least the hours we have always sat. There are more than a few members who have come to me expressing a grievance that they have to sit in July. The situation is that this is an extraordinarily hardworking parliament, but also a parliament that receives legislation from a government that legislates very heavily. There is no escaping the consequences of that. The consequences of that are guillotine motions like this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But I just want to respond very briefly to a couple of things that the Leader of the House said a few minutes ago when he was responding to me. He tried to hide behind the fact that it is difficult to get parliamentary counsel. I say to the Minister, with all the sincerity that I can muster, that that is not the problem. The problem is the Government. The Government is tardy in getting the instructions to parliamentary counsel. Earlier, I reminded honourable members that this House has been sitting since 12 February 1991, and the Government has had ample time to get instructions to parliamentary counsel and have the legislation prepared so that it could be introduced in time to give honourable members an opportunity to consider it thoroughly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not take up the time of the House further, and I know that you, Mr Speaker, will cheer at that. But the point that I want to make again is that the Government is treating this House and, through it, the people that we represent with contempt, and the Government stands condemned for this kind of action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is debating the Service and Execution of Process Amendment Bill 1991. The coalition will not be opposing the passage of the Bill. Indeed, the coalition supports the Bill, although we take the view that it does not go far enough. In this respect, during the committee stage, time permitting, I will be moving comprehensive amendments which are designed to supplement the provisions found in the Bill. However, looking at the clock and the guillotine having been put down, I get the feeling-the debate on this Bill expires at 6.30 p.m., as I recall-that the Executive imposed guillotine on the Parliament will prevent me moving those amendments. Therefore, I hope that, in accordance with convention, the amendments will be incorporated in Hansard and it will fall upon my colleagues in the Senate to pursue the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The origins of the Bill under present consideration lie in a report produced by the Australian Law Reform Commission in 1987 entitled Service and Execution of Process. The Commission produced its report in June 1987 and the report was presented to Parliament in December of that year. The report came about because of a reference given to the Commission in November 1982 by the then Acting Attorney-General, the Hon. Neil Brown. The Commission was asked to inquire into a report upon the adequacy of the law relating to the service and execution throughout the Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process and the judgments of the courts of the States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> In many respects the reference came about largely at the behest of some State judges who were concerned to see that the procedures for the service and execution of interstate process be streamlined. Accordingly, the Commission was asked to examine the adequacy of the provisions of the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901, the Act that the Bill which we presently have before the House seeks to amend. </PARA>
<PARA> Among other things, the Commission was specifically asked to consider whether it would be desirable for the provisions of the Act to be extended to cover tribunals which carry out adjudicative or investigative functions. By section 51 (xxiv) of the Constitution, the Commonwealth Parliament has power to legislate with respect to:</PARA>
<PARA>The service and execution throughout the Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process and the judgements of the courts of the States:</PARA>
<PARA>It was necessary to confer that power upon the Commonwealth Parliament, having regard to the inability of colonial legislatures to enact legislation with any extraterritorial effect beyond their respective boundaries. For example, at the time of Federation, John Quick and Robert Garran wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>With reference to the service, beyond the limits of a colony, of civil process issued within a colony, the constitutionality of laws passed by colonial legislatures authorising this to be done has often been questioned. </PARA>
<PARA>Prior to Federation, if one were to enforce a judgment obtained, say, in Victoria against a person domiciled in, say, Tasmania-out of respect for the honourable member who is following me-it was necessary to commence a further action at common law. That requirement flowed from the principle also mentioned by Quick and Garran which states:</PARA>
<PARA>No man can be legally bound by a judgment given behind his back and without his having had an opportunity of being heard. </PARA>
<PARA>By conferring upon the Commonwealth Parliament power to legislate with respect to the service and execution of interstate process, those jurisdictional doubts were settled. Therefore, in 1901 the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901. That Act was the eleventh Act of the first Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1901 Act, among other things, provides for: the service of initiating process for civil and criminal proceedings in State and Territory courts outside the State or Territory concerned; the service of other process in proceedings, including the process to procure witnesses throughout Australia; the execution of warrants for the apprehension of persons throughout Australia-in other words, the interstate extradition of persons; and the recognition and enforcement of judgments given by a court of one State or Territory in another State or Territory. The 1901 Act applies only to courts and, in the Law Reform Commission's view, this was a shortcoming which needed to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning now to the Bill, we see that a new part 3a will be inserted into the 1901 Act. The provisions found in new part 3a will govern the service and execution of process by investigative tribunals, such process relating to the service of subpoenas and to the execution of warrants. </PARA>
<PARA> The new measures contained within the Bill will be available for current inquiries, such as the royal commissions in Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria, and for use by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in New South Wales and the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland. The Attorney-General would not want me to discuss any of those royal commissions, would he? He is remaining mute on this matter. I will go on. </PARA>

In this respect, the Bill defines an `investigative tribunal' to mean a body established under the law of the State for the purpose of inquiring into and reporting on any matter and, in doing so, a body that is authorised to take evidence on oath or affirmation. The definition of `investigative tribunal' excludes courts or persons exercising judicial functions. </PARA>
<PARA> By press release dated 24 August 1990, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) announced that the Government intended to repeal and replace the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901 following consideration of the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same press release, the Attorney-General indicated that the Government would let the Bill lie on the table of the House so that further community consultation could take place. The Bill before the House at the moment is, as the Attorney-General acknowledged during his second reading speech, an interim measure, as it seeks to implement only one part of the Commission's recommendations. Were we to reach the committee stage and not be guillotined, I would hope to move amendments which seek to implement the entirety of the Commission's recommendations. Under the amendments that I hope to be move, those remaining parts will be subject to a deferred commencement clause so that an appropriate community consultation may take place and, if need be, the provisions can be fine tuned prior to their commencement. </PARA>
<PARA> In effect, I wish to place a clear obligation on the Government to take action to implement the entirety of the Commission's recommendations within a fixed time frame-namely, one year-in order to fulfil the promise given by the Attorney-General in August of late last year. The amendments, if carried, would ensure that the Government's Bill remains intact so that it will represent a self-contained part of the Act dealing with investigative tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate at this stage that I give a brief outline of the whole of the Commission's recommendations. The coalition accepts the Commission's recommendations. The major recommendations were: that the 1901 Act be updated in light of the development of an Australia-wide commercial community and advances in the techniques of travel and communications; that the need for a plaintiff to obtain leave to proceed with an interstate service of initiating process be modified; that challenges to jurisdiction or the question of the appropriate venue not be determined solely on the basis of the traditional nexus conditions, but on an assessment of all relevant considerations; and that the reach of the 1901 Act be extended so that its provisions could be available for the service and execution of process and orders of tribunals-both tribunals exercising adjudicative functions and tribunals exercising investigative functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's recommendations have been well received. If implemented, the Commission's recommendations would represent a useful and meaningful revision of the Act and of the procedures used for the service and execution of process interstate. Perhaps the only controversial aspect of the Commission's recommendations relates to the extension of the Federal Act to the service and execution of process and orders of tribunals. It is perhaps ironic that it is this aspect which we find the Government responding to today in the form of the provisions set out in the Bill under present consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Having touched upon the broader policy questions, I turn now to consider some constitutional issues that are relevant to the Bill and to the Commission's recommendations. At the conclusion of his second reading speech, the Attorney-General acknowledged that there is a question whether it is within the legislative competence of the Commonwealth to provide for the service and execution of process of State tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate that I elaborate on some of the issues involved therein. The question is whether the legislative power referred to in section 51(xxiv) of the Constitution is limited to the service and process of State courts as opposed to State tribunals. The issues were canvassed in some detail in the Commission's report. Having regard to the words of section 51(xxiv), it is necessary to consider whether the term `courts' places a restriction upon the meaning of the word `process'. A similar consideration arises in relation to the possible meaning of the words `civil and criminal' process in the sense of whether those words are restricted to final and conclusive orders made by the courts. In this respect, most orders made by quasi-judicial tribunals are not enforceable unless and until they have been registered with the court. Subject to appropriate safeguards, once that registration process is completed, such an order may then be enforceable as a judgment of the court. </PARA>
<PARA> The leading case in the area is the 1972 decision of the High Court of Australia in Amman v. Wegener, a report of which can be found in volume 129 of the Commonwealth Law Reports at page 415. In that case Mr Justice Gibbs, as he then was, said:</PARA>
<PARA>In section 51(xxiv), which empowers the Parliament to make laws with respect to `the service and execution throughout the Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process and the judgments of the Courts of the States', the word `process' is not governed by the words `of the Courts'; those words refer only to `judgments'. In other words, section 51(xxiv) enables laws to be made with respect to the service and execution of (1) the civil and criminal process of the State, and (2) the judgments of the Courts of the States. </PARA>
<PARA>In that passage, Sir Harry Gibbs would seem to be reaffirming the broad interpretation placed on section 51(xxiv) by the earlier 1955 decision of the High Court in Aston v. Irvine, a report of which can be found in volume 92 of the Commonwealth Law Reports at page 353. In a unanimous judgment of the full bench it was said in Aston's case:</PARA>
<PARA>The nature of this power-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, section 51(xxiv)-</PARA>
<PARA>as well as the prior history of the subject to which it relates, provides strong ground for interpreting it as enabling the Federal legislature to regulate the manner in which officers of the law in one State should act with reference to the execution of the process of another State. It is a legislative power given to the central legislature for the very purpose of securing the enforcement of the civil and criminal process of each State in every other State. </PARA>
<PARA>However, returning to Amman's case, Mr Justice Mason, as he then was, expressed some reservations about `whether or not the power'-as set out in section 51(xxiv)-`extends to the process of Royal Commissions and Tribunals which are not Courts in the strict sense'. The words of Sir Anthony Mason bring into play the very question of whether the Government's Bill, in seeking to insert a new part into the 1901 Act to deal with investigative tribunals, may in the event of a High Court challenge be found to be unconstitutional. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the reservations expressed in Amman's case by the present Chief Justice, I am somewhat optimistic that at the end of the day the provisions would be upheld-as, I am sure, is the Attorney-General. Perhaps I am influenced by the approach advocated by that great jurist Sir Owen Dixon that certain aspects of our Constitution should be given a liberal interpretation so that those provisions can adapt to the ever changing circumstances of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case, it would be a brave man at this time who would deny the power to the royal commissioner who asked the Attorney-General to give him the power. Quite apart from the courage that would need to be shown, I think it would show a lack of sagacity. For those reasons as well as the sorts of interpretations that I have put --</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Duffy" NAMEID="6G4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or just wrong? That is a helpful contribution after all I am doing here on behalf of the Attorney-General. He should wait until the next Bill comes along. In regard to Sir Owen Dixon's more liberal interpretation of words so that we can have a living being, a growing Constitution, the words of section 51(xxiv) reflect the concerns that our founding fathers had at the time of Federation. At the time of Federation, of course, there did not exist the multiplicity and variety of investigative, administrative and quasi-judicial tribunals that we have today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know a little bit about this because I have an ancestor who was involved in the debates of that time; he stayed on in the colonial parliament, allegedly because the talent came here. He stayed on in the new State Parliament of Victoria. Our founding fathers did not have to turn their minds to the question of whether the words of section 51(xxiv), and in particular the reference to `courts', should be extended to cover other bodies, as they simply did not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also heartened by the approach that the High Court has taken in relation to the application of the Act to arbitration proceedings. In this respect I refer the House to a 1983 decision of the High Court in Alliance Petroleum Australia (NL) v. Australian Gas Light Co., a report of which can be found in volume 48 of the Australian Law Reports at page 69. In that case it was decided that the Act, in so far as it enables service of subpoenas issued in relation to arbitration proceedings, was valid on the basis that arbitration proceedings are civil proceedings within the meaning of section 16 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> It would seem that analogous reasoning could be adopted with respect to the relationship between investigative tribunals and the concept of criminal process. For example, there is no doubt that committal proceedings come within the traditional concept of the phrase `criminal process', and it is arguable that investigative tribunals are on a similar footing. There will remain doubts about whether the provisions contained in the Bill can survive constitutional challenge. Ultimately, if the question arises in any formal way, it will be a matter for the High Court to determine. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my comments on the Bill by saying that the coalition welcomes the reform contained within it, and would welcome further reform by the Government at the earliest possible time by its implementing the Law Reform Commission's remaining recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> Perchance that my proposed amendments have been circulated in my name, I would trust that if I am unable to move them at the committee stage because of the guillotine they will at the very least be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Service and Execution of Process Amendment Bill 1991, I certainly would not wish to assign to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) any lack of sagacity. He is a most sagacious Attorney, and in this regard the sagacious Attorney has very properly adopted a course in relation to the request of the royal commissioners conducting the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in Western Australia to enact legislation which will facilitate the service, in other parts of Australia, of process emanating from that Royal Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we direct our minds to the broader issue, it is useful to see this as a further step in the consolidation of a national legal system. It has always been puzzling for those who are not constitutional experts or versed in State laws that we have disparate legal systems with complexities of enforcement between the States and with gaps between the capacity to enforce the rulings of a tribunal or a process that emanates from them. </PARA>
<PARA> As the shadow Attorney, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), has correctly said, this whole area has been the subject of a report by the Law Reform Commission. The Government has that report before it and no doubt will be making more extensive legislative amendments in due course. But that is no reason for not proceeding in the urgency of this matter upon the request of the commissioners, who want to make sure that no witnesses resident interstate can avoid coming before a commission of inquiry duly constituted. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, now there is not simply one royal commission in existence, as this House is very much aware. There are royal commissions now established in Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria, and there are commissions of inquiry on permanent investigative duties in New South Wales and Queensland. So the sense in which it might once have been thought to restrict the ambit or power of tribunals to their own local jurisdiction really has become quite irrelevant as we move towards full nationhood. </PARA>
<PARA> I think most members of this House would welcome a Federal initiative to make sure that in one further area we treat our legal system on a national basis. Increasingly we do so by various mechanisms such as the cross-vesting of jurisdiction between State and Federal tribunals and courts. We look to make sure that there are avenues for the enforcement of State orders of courts so that they can be most effectively proceeded with and enforced. We have legislation which facilitates those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> We turn now to the amendments which are before us. These are very sensible and commonsense amendments. They build in many safeguards which are designed to ensure that no witness who is subject to compulsion to come before a commission of inquiry or an investigative tribunal will be put to any unnecessary difficulty. For example, if a witness is required simply for the production of documents, there are provisions in the legislation which facilitate the witness's providing that information without the need for personal attendance. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, there are procedures which require, on the service of a subpoena for attendance, the proper tender of sufficient money to make sure that that witness can travel appropriately and be accommodated in the other State. Failure to comply with those obligations means that the subpoena is invalid. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also provisions for the setting aside of subpoenas in certain circumstances which will allow a person upon whom a subpoena is served, who would urge in the particular circumstances that he or she ought not to be required to attend, to contest the issue of the subpoena. </PARA>
<PARA> One important safeguard is that subpoenas have to be issued by a judge of the supreme court of the State in which the tribunal is proceeding. Obviously that will not occur without a considerable degree of scrutiny, and will not be a matter of course. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, this is a sensible and a modest response to the request made by the Royal Commission in Western Australia. It shows that this Government is willing to move promptly to respond to what was a request made of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning briefly to the constitutional issues which have been raised, it would be apparent to most constitutional lawyers that, although from time to time some modest doubts have been expressed as to the ambit of placitum (xxiv) of section 51 of the Australian Constitution, the better view would be that the word `process' is not to be read as limited in any way by the further words `judgments of the courts of the States'. </PARA>
<PARA> As the former Chief Justice Sir Harry Gibbs indicated in Amman's case, the issue appears to be clear with respect to the power to enforce process of investigative tribunals. Certainly it would require the upsetting of what is regarded as the established authority in this area for a challenge to succeed.</PARA>
<PARA> To conclude my remarks, and because I do not believe this is a contentious matter, I indicate that this Government does not lack courage. The reason we are introducing this legislation is not that the Attorney is in some way reluctant to confront a royal commission; it is simply that the Government believes it is appropriate to act to extend a nationwide system for the recognition and enforcement of process from tribunals of inquiry and royal commissions, and that it is seen as timely to do so upon the request of the Royal Commission. I am pleased, of course, that the honourable member for Kooyong regards the Attorney as sagacious in that regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-First, I thank the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) for taking part in the debate, because of the short time we have, and for dealing with matters as quickly as he did. He dealt with them in some detail but in a very short time. I also thank the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) for his support for this Bill. It would be very difficult not to support it, but on many occasions in this place things are opposed for the sake of opposing them. However, that is not the case in this instance. It is worth touching on, because the shadow Attorney has indicated that, if this debate had proceeded in a normal way and there had been a reasonable time for the committee stage, he would have been moving some amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to touch on the reasons for the Bill and its relationship with the Law Reform Commission report. It is known from what the shadow Attorney said what would be affected by this amendment. It arose out of the request by the Chairman of the Western Australian Royal Commission into the Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters to amend urgently the Service and Execution of Process Act so as to provide for the interstate service of subpoenas to enable evidence to be given before investigative tribunals such as royal commissions, as outlined. At present that Bill applies only to the process of courts and not tribunals. Both the honourable member for Denison and the shadow Attorney touched on the constitutional issues, which were raised in the second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated, an opinion was obtained from the Solicitor-General, and it was on that basis that the Government acted. However, it does give one a great deal of confidence to know that the honourable member for Denison supports that, and also that the shadow Attorney supports it, because he did touch on the fact that he has a long contact with the Constitutional Conventions through, I think, Sir Alexander Peacock, who had a distinguished career. He is not a very close relation, but I would not dispute the fact that he is a relation of the shadow Attorney. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Peacock" NAMEID="MI4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr DUFFY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, that is fair enough too. There is a bust of Sir Alexander Peacock in Parliament House, Melbourne, and on one occasion a couple of young ladies were looking at it. They had a certain attachment to the honourable member for Kooyong, which I find difficult to understand, but one said to the other, `But doesn't he look a lot younger on television!' One must say that it is a pity that longevity is not what it could be, because although he died without children and there was a relationship in another way which I have forgotten, it would be no doubt a great pleasure to see that his relation, whatever it is, is able to be here today carrying on from that second convention on the Constitution in which Sir Alexander played a role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most important matter with which I wanted to deal is the reason we are not dealing with more than this at this stage. The honourable member for Denison dealt with that matter sufficiently but, for the record, I will repeat that the Australian Law Reform Commission report on the Service and Execution of Process Act had a Bill annexed, but there are problems with that Bill which require further consultation. In relation to the draft replacement Bill, it will be necessary, for example, to make major amendments to the following parts of the Law Reform Commission's replacement Bill: first, the replacement of the code for personal service of process with rules picking up the mode of service intrastate; also, it will be necessary to deal with the replacement of the procedures for transfer of proceedings between State and Territory courts generally, with statutory power for lower courts to stay proceedings and the specific provisions relating to service of subpoenas on prisoners and the various other forms of lawful restraint including bail, parole and probation preventing travel interstate. </PARA>
<PARA> In our view, and on close examination the Opposition would agree, I am sure, the Law Reform Commission's recommendations are really unworkable. If we adopted those recommendations, it would make a court a custodian of some people on bail. The problems with that are obvious, and in fact the court would have interstate custody of the person. When one looks at the drafting of specific provisions relating to tribunals, the Law Reform Commission included provisions picking up court procedures by reference and the inclusion of revised provisions in suppression orders, including additional grounds, applications for each ground and for revocation of orders. </PARA>
<PARA> In August 1990 we announced our decision to repeal and replace the Service and Execution of Process Act following consideration of those recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its report. It has been made absolutely clear that, in the circumstances, the Government-and I do not think it is disputed by the support we have received this evening but, nevertheless I think there is some misunderstanding as to why it cannot all be done now-had no choice other than to proceed with the amendments with which we have now proceeded, rather than attempting to adopt that report of the Law Reform Commission which, I have indicated, in our view is flawed and a good deal more work will have to be done on it. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Attorney touched on the various tribunals that are affected by this, and it is obvious-not that I would suggest any government would be silly enough to do it-that when an urgent request is received from the Royal Commission into the Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in Western Australia, one would have been brave to the point of absolute stupidity to suggest, `We could not do that for you now but we will do it when we have had the opportunity to consider more fully the Law Reform Commission's report. We do not want to make these amendments at this stage because we would rather wait until we are able to deal with the whole Bill'. As I say, to have done that would have been just absurd. Therefore, based on the request made by the Chairman, we decided to proceed with this Bill at this stage. It does affect quite a few other inquiries in addition to the Western Australian Royal Commission. It is for those reasons that we have decided to go ahead at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Touching very briefly on one other matter, there has been some confusion as to exactly what the Bill does and what are its powers. While it provides that the interstate service of subpoenas will enable evidence to be given before State and Territory persons and bodies appointed or established for the purpose of inquiring into and reporting on matters, and which have the power to take evidence on oath or affirmation, nevertheless restrictions are placed on it. It will not be one of those pieces of legislation that can be used in a way which can be too flamboyant in that sense, because it requires leave of the Supreme Court of the State in which the tribunal is established for a subpoena to be served interstate, and I refer to section 19m (1). Before giving leave, the court must be satisfied that the evidence sought is relevant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was hoping that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) might be here tonight to listen to this debate. I am glad in a sense-although I understand these matters are still under deliberation-that he is the Minister on duty tonight. I see that he has brought plenty of advisers along to at least listen and prepare comments for him. The Bill that we are dealing with is the Migration Amendment Bill 1991. The explanatory memorandum mentions the detailed issues that are covered in this particular Bill. We are told that it is designed to improve and streamline immigration procedures in three main areas: immigration processing of undocumented arrivals-that is, essentially those people who are commonly referred to as boat people-the merits review system; and the operation of the Migration Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been anticipating an amendment Bill to the Act. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) foreshadowed almost 12 months ago that he would be seeking to introduce an amending Bill, following on from some of the criticisms that had been mounted in relation to the Act and regulations. In the main, the amendments tonight will prove to be largely unexceptional, dealing with technical and grammatical amendments among others. However, there are some significant matters and also some matters which have been the subject of some discussion between the Minister and myself and which may bring forward further amendments that he has outlined in correspondence that has passed between us. I will highlight those as I discuss the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The first matter that I mention relates to an amendment dealing with section 4-`Interpretation'-of the principal Act. The principal Act dealt with the issue of who might be an authorised officer. The matter that was of concern to me and on which I sought clarification was the extent to which the Minister might be given power under the amendments to authorise any other person to be an authorised officer of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. This matter was of concern to me. I understood it was to deal with staff who might be engaged to deal with data processing arrangements. The Minister has foreshadowed that he will clarify that further by amendment to prescribe that such authorisations may only proceed by notice in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. I thank him for that. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter that is dealt with is the period of grace, particularly provisions relating to the operation of the period of grace in this legislation which have been proposed to be clarified. The period of grace would recommence in the event that an applicant for an entry permit withdraws his or her application or a person withdraws certain review requests. It allows for recognition of the withdrawal of such an application or request. That amendment seemed particularly reasonable to the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter that was dealt with was the concept of an entry visa being broadened to give the document dual quality. An entry visa can act either as an entry permit or a visa when it is first issued, depending on where it was in the circumstances of the application. This is to enable it to operate vice versa. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a provision introduced to protect returning permanent residents from innocently becoming illegal. Without detailing further the changes that are intended there, let me say that that matter also has the Opposition's agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions were made to remove certain redundant provisions under section 47 and to reinforce the existing powers to grant visas and entry permits under sections 24 and 34. It was also supplemented by the Minister's special powers under sections 115 and 137. The existing provision to grant a permanent entry permit to Australia only to the holder of a valid entry permit was retained. Those provisions met with our agreement, as did the provisions dealing with increases in penalties, remuneration-so far as it affects the Remuneration Tribunal-and also amendments dealing with the technical problems that were occasioned by the difficulty that the Government was experiencing in dealing with rendering carriers liable to certain costs associated with the Commonwealth's ability to remove persons who are not permitted to enter Australia and to keep those people in custody. </PARA>
<PARA> Those matters were covered extensively in this legislation and, as I say, met with our approval. There are, however, some other matters which this legislation deals with which were the subject of discussion between the Minister and myself. One of them relates to the question of character checking. The explanatory memorandum explains that with the insertion of new section 107a there would have been provisions to allow, under prescribed circumstances, an immigration officer to assess the character or conduct, or both, of an individual on the basis of a declaration made by the individual. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst provisions were still to exist under sections 20 and 14 of the Act to provide for deportation of that person if he was found to have made a false declaration, we in the Opposition were concerned that this particular provision could open a new area for abuse and possible confusion which can arise in relation to this important question of character checking. We were concerned that rather than leaving the matter open for this matter to be dealt with by way of prescribed circumstances-that is, by the regulatory procedure-the Act itself ought to make more explicit the way in which this question is to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in his letter to me says that this clause has the potential to cause confusion about departmental practice in relation to character checking and may lead some people to believe that character checking will not be attempted in particular situations. He therefore agreed that all applicants who were not Australian citizens will be required to make declarations and that he would move amendments during this debate to require all visa and entry permit application forms to contain a declaration about character to be made on behalf of the applicant. The legislation and the explanatory memorandum, which the Minister has shown me, will spell out in greater detail the way in which that matter will be addressed. I welcome his cooperation in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter that was dealt with concerned certain custody arrangements. We were concerned about custody arrangements under sections 88 and 89 of the Act and the processing area amendments contained in this Bill. We raised the point, as well as it being raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, that the Government, in endeavouring to put in place, as I understand it, revised but essentially the same arrangements for dealing with those people described as unprocessed people who enter Australia illegally-usually we are speaking about boat people-and in wanting to be able to deal with them in a more humane way than it is often able to deal with the landing of such people, needed to put in place new arrangements for dealing with such applications. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the issues was the extent to which such people might be kept in an unprocessed state, essentially in detention, over a long period. In his letter to me the Minister has assisted in explaining the way in which this matter would work. It may be important, from the point of view of this debate and to people looking at this particular question, to understand 84the basis upon which the Opposition has accepted the Bill in the form in which it now proceeds. The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Scrutiny of Bills Committee was concerned about the absence of a specific mechanism in the Act to allow a person to challenge being designated an unprocessed person. However, a decision to designate a person an unprocessed person would be a decision which could be challenged under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 on the basis that an error of law had been made in arriving at that designation. That Act would allow for a declaration to be made as to whether a person is an unprocessed person. Proceedings under that Act are relatively easy to initiate and conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> However, apart from relief of a declaratory kind from the Federal Court, it is not intended that there be a mechanism in the Migration Act which would provide for the release of a person from a processing centre other than in compelling circumstances such as the need for medical treatment. It must be borne in mind that unprocessed persons will be persons who have arrived in Australia without permission, seeking to enter Australia in circumstances in which they would become illegal entrants and in which proper immigration, health, customs and quarantine clearance procedures have not been carried out. For the purposes of the Act, these persons have not entered Australia and are potentially prohibited persons. While clearance procedures are being conducted after the persons' arrival, the policy to be expressed in the legislation is that they be restrained from entering the broader Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention that because the Opposition has a very strong view about the need to maintain the integrity of Australia's immigration program and borders. In my discussion I will return to the ways in which I think the Government has been less than scrupulous in addressing these matters in the past, which are leading to a breakdown in immigration control. For that reason, the Opposition was not mindful to press any amendments in this area which might send a signal or might suggest in any way that by seeking to accord specific rights to unprocessed persons, it was relaxing Australia's ability to be able to ensure that those who seek to circumvent our immigration requirements will not be rewarded by being allowed to remain here by use of our legal procedures or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to address two other questions dealt with in the Bill. The first is the amendment to reduce the processing days available for people who might want to apply for review of decisions taken under the Immigration Act. The Minister made it clear that the Government was moving amendments to the review provisions to give more generous periods in which a review of certain decisions might be taken at the first tier and before the second tier review; that is, the review by the Immigration Review Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> I should explain the background, in part, to the basis upon which the review provisions were enacted. When the Immigration Act was the subject of substantial amendments by the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), he and I were involved in certain decisions about the form in which the Bill then before us might be amended. One matter I raised with him was the question of the extent to which it might be more difficult for people outside Australia to access review. Under the old review arrangements there were periods of between, I think, one month if people were in Australia, or 90 days if they were outside Australia. Senator Ray said, `Let's compromise on this', and he proposed a compromise of 28 days for people within Australia, and 70 days for people outside Australia, to access review. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray put in place provisions for people to exercise their review rights for both stages within those specific time limits. The Government is now seeking to provide separate times for undertaking applications for each process. I do not regard it as unreasonable, nor does the Opposition, to separate them out, but it is clear that by doing so the Minister is doubling the times in which people can access review through both stages. In effect the Government is taking it from a period of 28 days to 56 days and from 70 days to 140 days for which applicants can seek to have applications dealt with through both stages of review. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that the Opposition sees those as unduly long periods of time. They compromise the immigration review process in an unreasonable way and do not require people to be expeditious in pursuing their rights. The Opposition intends to move amendments at the appropriate stage to reduce each of those periods-that is, 28 days to 21 days, and 70 days to 50 days. In effect, that would prescribe 41 days in lieu of 28 days, as it was before, and 100 days in lieu of 70 days, as it was before. In other words, it would still be more generous than the Minister's provisions, but it would attempt to ensure that people are still required to press their claims expeditiously. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention the matter of reviewable decisions. The present Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has made it clear, again in correspondence to me, that where there were some doubts in our minds because the Government was providing that classes of decisions under section 120, under which the Minister may exercise powers under sections 115 and 137 of the Act, might be expanded by way of regulation. In his note to me, the Minister indicated clearly the areas in which that prescription will be made. I think it is appropriate to put it on the record for clarity. The Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA>You have asked which decisions will be prescribed. As I indicated in my Second Reading Speech, the decisions prescribed will concern applicants who are unable to sustain a claim for refugee status but who are to be assessed on humanitarian grounds, and those longstanding illegal entrants who came forward as a result of the Government concessions that took effect in December 1990 but in respect of whom the current law prohibits the making of further applications. To be more precise, the particular decisions that will be identified in the draft instructions for regulations are:</PARA>
<PARA>* refusal of a domestic protection temporary entry permit-regulation 117a</PARA>
<PARA>* refusal of a December 1989 [temporary] or [permanent] entry permit-regulations 131a and 142c</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members can see in relation to those matters that in our discussions the Minister and I have reached a large measure of agreement in relation to this particular legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time left to me I want to deal with the question of control of the immigration program, because that is a matter of concern to the Opposition. In our view, the Government seems to have failed to control and maintain the integrity of Australia's borders. In order to understand what has been happening, one need only look at the area of change of status application to permanent residency for people who have entered Australia on visas obtained for other purposes, either as visitors or as temporary entrants. Notwithstanding all the protestations of the Government, there has been a significant increase in the number of people seeking to stay in Australia as permanent residents who have applied to do so onshore. </PARA>
<PARA> This is notwithstanding the fact that we have ruled out amnesties; it is notwithstanding the fact that the Minister went on and said time and time again that the Government was going to be tough in relation to illegal entrants. In 1989-90, 14,355 persons were approved for permanent residency. As at 10 June 1990, there was a backlog of more than 35,000 cases, some of them under the new arrangements, some of them under the old arrangements, for grant of residency status. The indications are that the great bulk of those who applied under the old rules or the old regime are likely to be granted entry to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This sends out a signal to those people who are seeking to come to Australia, and who would not meet the immigration standards set down for entry from overseas, that if they can simply get to Australia and apply, they will be rewarded. We forget the statement that the Deputy Secretary to the Department made, which I think in clarity states the position, which ought to be the Government's bible in relation to these things. Mr Gibbons said:</PARA>
<PARA> All States have the sovereign right to determine who may enter and remain within their territory . . . Immigration rules are essentially about control of the borders; about filtering those who would seek to enter. </PARA>
<PARA>What we are seeing is that the Government is losing that control, and it is particularly evident in relation to the large and growing number of onshore change of status applications that we have seen in various forms that have been coming forward. </PARA>
<PARA> When it is known that we have numbers, which the Government itself admits approach 90,000, and which I believe are probably nearer 150,000, of people who are here illegally, the enormous size of the problem that we are facing is appreciated. The Government tries to adduce evidence through deportations, raids and a great deal of judicious press that it is very active in relation to these matters. But the fact is that, when we should be dealing with tens of thousands, we are merely dealing with hundreds of people-or maybe at times thousands, but not the tens of thousands that we know are here in Australia illegally now. </PARA>
<PARA> We have, of course, certain other problems that have emerged as a result of the way in which this Government has dealt with the issue, particularly of refugee status. On the whole question of these provisions in this legislation that deal with unprocessed persons, we in the Opposition have given the Government every support to put in place a proper legislative base to deal with these issues. These areas of concern are leading to a situation in which our ability to control our borders is being lost to us here in Australia right now, and it is through the numbers of people who are claiming refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA> We used to receive applications that might approach 500 in one year from people who were seeking protection within Australia because of their claim of being in need of protection because of their genuine fear of having to return to their home country where they might well have suffered persecution, and which they had left as a result of that persecution. The principles here are well understood. They are applied internationally. But the fact is that, because Australia has relaxed the way in which it deals with these matters, because of the way in which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) dealt with decisions in relation to Chinese students who were in Australia at the time of Tiananmen Square, when it refused to undertake proper bona fides checking, when it put in place provisions to treat all arrivals on the same basis, regardless of the bona fides of their claim, Australia lost its ability to deal with refugee claims in a proper and sensible way. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an enormous amount of evidence on the record right now that that one decision, taken by the Prime Minister of his own volition-and I do not believe with the support of his Department or the responsible Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs-has led to a situation where we now have about 14,000 applicants for protection, for refugee status. Those figures, according to departmental evidence given to the Senate Estimates Committee, are rising at the rate of 1,000 a month. They are expected to peak at about 20,000. The Department is faced with the enormous cost of putting in place new administrative arrangements to cope with that inordinately large number of people. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the Government allowed some 20,000 people from the People's Republic of China to enter Australia after the Tiananmen Square massacre as students, many of whom came here, I believe, with the expectation that they would be able to make claims to stay permanently. I made that point in debates at earlier points in time and we know that, of the 14,000 people making applications now for refugee status in Australia, over 8,000 are from the People's Republic of China. In other words, of those 20,000 students who entered Australia, a very significant proportion are now claiming to be refugees and are swamping our system of evaluation. In fact, our ability to entertain claims from those people, who are often seen to have some justification for consideration on refugee grounds, is being lost to us. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just mention, because it has been a matter of some controversy recently, the claims in relation to boat people. The fact is that the great bulk of people who enter Australia seeking to access refugee status do not come by boat at all; they come by plane. In fact, one of my Chinese friends refers to them as `jumbo people' to make the distinction between boat people. It could be said that we have 150,000 jumbo people as against 300 boat people to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the Cambodians are making claims for refugee status. The fact is that their claims, notwithstanding the fact that many of them have been here for very long periods of time, have not been able to be entertained. The Minister might be able to give us all sorts of reasons, as we have seen in the past, for the way in which those applications have been dealt with, but the fact is that the reason-more substantial than anything else-that they have not been able to be dealt with is the misapplication of resources. </PARA>

But the fact is that we now have institutional paralysis. That is what we have got: institutional paralysis. We saw the very shoddy way in which the Cambodian people were recently treated. I do not complain that Cambodians, Khmers, may have been shifted around in the dead of night by the Department, because I did not complain when they were shifted from Darwin to Sydney or from Darwin to Melbourne-and I would not have complained if they were shifted from Sydney to Darwin. But the fact is that there are some very reputable people, some that I know, who attended meetings with the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. I am told that the Minister gave the assurance to the Khmer people in Sydney that no Khmer would be shifted without being properly advised of what the Government's intentions were in relation to that person. I am told that at a meeting on three occasions he promised that such notice would be given. I regard that as a very serious matter. It is a matter which the Minister needs to clarify and it is a matter that I think undermines his credibility in dealing with this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put out a statement some weeks ago in which I said that the Minister needed to be strong in the way in which he dealt with these matters. If the Khmer cannot substantiate proper claims, they have no more right to remain here than the Chinese students. Claims should be dealt with consistently on a case by case basis. Those without bona fide claims should be sent back to where they came from. It is the only consistent and proper way in which the border controls about which this legislation speaks can be administered properly without being brought into disrepute and without being undermined in the way in which we have seen. Unless the Government gets this under control quickly, we face a problem of very significant proportions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Amendment Bill involves a number of important amendments to the Migration Amendment Act which have already been signalled in a number of important decisions of the Government over the last few months. These amendments have also been extensively debated and discussed. Many of them have come, as the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) knows, through the deliberations and recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, of which he is the Deputy Chairman. Others came after extensive discussion at the Caucus immigration committee. I want to thank the members of both committees for the role they played in trying to get together an immigration system which works, which is fair and in which the crinkles which were left when we brought in all the regulations at once after the new administration came in can be ironed out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The interesting thing about the honourable member for Dundas is that, on the one hand, he supports the system for immigration regulations but then goes on to make such claims as the Government is losing control of the immigration program. I do not get that complaint at all. If anything, I get the opposite complaint-that the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs is generally too tough in its determinations rather than losing control of the program. So I do not know where he has been and what he is on about. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite often at the Joint Standing Committee we have to make amendments in order to ensure that justice is done to individual applicants and that the Department does not exercise its powers in too rough a fashion or in such a way as would deny natural justice to applicants. I know that the honourable member has also complained in this way about the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, so how can he say that the Government is losing control of the immigration program? I do not know where that sort of claim comes from. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there are a couple of honourable members around the place who do not like our immigration program and would like it to be reduced to nothing, but that is a different matter altogether. It certainly has nothing to do with the generally rather responsible fashion in which the Immigration Department has been handling a difficult transition from a process of non-regulation to one of regulation in the immigration area. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there continue to be problems to iron out. We have this legislation because, although many of the problems have been ironed out by changes to the regulations, there is also from time to time a need for important legislative changes. In saying this, I do not in any way run away from the fact that there are problems in the immigration area. But it does not follow that the Government is not handling them properly or has lost control of the program or--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will address that as one of the problems. Let me turn to that problem of the increase in applications under refugee status. The honourable member knows that, because of the desire to control the numbers and because of the toughening regime, we have had to control applications from people who want to change status when they arrive in Australia either as visitors or as students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have said that previously the matter was too lax. We have had to bring in regulations to make matters tougher so that most people will return overseas if they wish to apply to emigrate to Australia. They will have to apply in the proper queues and under the proper programs; that is what we have tried to do.</PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, one could expect that there may be some people who feel so desperately about the idea of going back to their own countries that they are prepared to use any loophole in the system or to use any way possible to apply. That is what has happened, and the honourable member knows very well that that is the reason for the increase in the refugee applications. The vast increase in the numbers of refugee applications has to do, as he mentioned, not only with the problem of the People's Republic of China-I will come back to that in a minute-but also with other countries to which people feel, either for economic or for humanitarian reasons, they just cannot return. </PARA>
<PARA> What would the honourable member for Dundas have us do? Would he have us say, `We will not have the refugee humanitarian category at all just because there has been an increase in numbers'? Should we get rid of people without consideration? That would be a nonsense and he knows that. There is no point in him pretending to be some kind of humanitarian on immigration law and then saying that these people should not be able to apply under the refugee humanitarian category. Of course, they should be allowed to apply. The question is: what can be done once the applications have increased to these numbers? I do not know why he is making such a fuss about the increased numbers. The fact is that the increased numbers have to do with contingencies which are out of our control. Because of that, we had a choice to make. We could have arbitrarily--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The program is not out of control. The contingencies are different. We did not create the problem with the People's Republic of China. That had to do with something over there. We had to deal with the problem in a humanitarian fashion. For the honourable member for Dundas to come in here and to say, `Because of the situation you have got a big increase in refugee applications; therefore, it is all your fault and therefore the fault of the program', is a nonsense. The fact is that this is a problem created overseas, having to do with the situation in the People's Republic of China.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me continue on this point. On the one hand, we have said that we cannot simply arbitrarily dismiss these applications as nothing; we have to deal with them in a reasonably humane way. On the other hand, we have to be ready to deal with them speedily because, if we are not, we will have years and years of queues in the system. So we have introduced the radical new system of dealing with refugee applications, which is a two-tiered process. First, they are considered on one level within the departmental structure. If they are rejected, they have the right immediately to appeal to the new Refugee Status Determination Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that situation, whereby they are able to go through the two processes, we will see many people accept the determination because they will realise that they do not have much of a case. Other people will go to the other body. Once that body has set criteria with respect to particular groups of people, people will see that it is useless merely to make an application for refugee status on flimsy grounds, because it will be defeated. Once the system is given a chance to operate in the future, I am confident that, even though we have had this increase in operations, it will deal with them in a speedier and fairer fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> If the honourable member has some suggestions as to how we can deal with these problems in a humane way, let him come forward with them at the Joint Standing Committee or within the Parliament. Let us hear them. But it is nonsense to say that because there has been such an increase in applications the whole system is falling apart. The Government has not created the increase in the applications; it has been created by the contingent factors in such places as the People's Republic of China. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that some people are trying to use the refugee situation as a last loophole, after they have been rejected for other immigration categories. I think that is a matter the Government ought to look into. If somebody arrives in Australia, whether as a visitor, a student or anything else, and claims refugee status, that is very different from a person arriving, claiming immigration status, being rejected under a whole number of immigration categories, and then trying to claim refugee status. That, it seems to me, is a matter that ought to be looked at. One way of cutting out the flimsy claims may be to look into the question of whether, if a person has applied for other kinds of immigration categories, he should at that point be entitled to apply for refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that a person knows whether or not he is a refugee when he arrives or shortly afterwards. For a person to be able to wait until after he is dealt with through other immigration categories and who fails before he applies for refugee status, it seems to me to be overgenerous on our part to allow for a loophole. That could be looked into by the Government and the committees. I suggest that this is one way we can go forward in solving these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wanted to speak on a number of other issues, including the question of the boat people, but time has virtually run out. Let me say a couple of things about the boat people situation. The Bill contains provision for the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to set a time limit whereby, when a person arrives unauthorised in this country, he has to make an application. That is something we found when we visited Darwin with a parliamentary committee, and it has been emphasised time and again by the Caucus committee. We should be setting a time limit within which processing must take place. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the biggest problems in the Sydney debacle was that for nearly 15 months the lawyers were playing games and did not put in the people's applications. That is a disgrace. Whether it is the fault of the rules, the Department or the lawyers is not the issue. </PARA>

Those people will get a fairer go because they will not be waiting for one whole year-as is happening in Darwin, for example-before their applications even go to the Department, never mind before they are considered. I believe that such a determination, which I understand is going to be made by regulation as a result of a clause in this Bill, ought to go forward as quickly as possible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot let this opportunity pass to express my disgust at the way the Government has handled the presentation of a number of Bills to the Parliament during this week. Tonight we deal with one of many important matters, yet the time limit for debate on these particularly important issues is severely restricted. In fact, we had the absolute farce earlier this afternoon where the time for the debate on an important environmental Bill actually expired before we got to deal with it. I want to say very clearly to the Government that I believe I am elected by the people in my electorate to do a job, and the Government's ineptitude in the way it has presented these Bills to Parliament has denied me the right to carry out my responsibilities correctly. I want to put that on record as strongly as I can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Listening to the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), if one were to take him seriously-and I am not sure whether or not everyone does-one would think that Australia has in some way reneged on its responsibilities in its immigration policies. I would have thought that he would know-I think most people do-that Australia has done far more than its share in accepting refugees to this country. We have accepted refugees from all over the world. It is probably correct to say that we have had a higher per capita intake of refugees to this country than any other country in the world. As far as I am concerned, it is ridiculous to suggest that we have in some way abrogated our responsibilities. We in Australia can hold our heads high in terms of our response to the needs of genuine-and I think that is the word that underlines this-refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> If people listened to the honourable member for Calwell, they could sometimes interpret him as saying that we ought to have some sort of laissez faire immigration policy-anything goes, Rafferty's rules, anyone can come. That is not the approach we on this side of the House would advocate at all. Yet when I listen to him sometimes I think that is really what he has in mind and what he would like to see happen. I find that absolutely unbelievable. As the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) said, and I think he is reflecting the view of by far the majority of Australians, we have a responsibility and a right to protect the integrity of our borders. We must do that in the interests of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion that we should in any way encourage people to come to Australia in the hope that once they arrive here they will somehow have an implied right to stay is dangerous, improper and certainly misleading. It is not the intention of the Government, and it is certainly not the intention of the Opposition, that people should be given the impression in any way, shape or form that once they come here they will be able to stay. Yet I think the honourable member for Calwell is leading us down the track where we give the wrong signals to people who want to come here from some of these countries which have-and there is no doubt they have-political and economic turmoil. We do not blame them for wanting to come here; we want them to understand that we will give them every consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> In humanitarian terms, I believe that we as a nation can hold our heads high for the way we have reacted, for the way we have responded to people who have cried out in their time of need. We have done that consistently, year after year, going back to the years immediately after the Second World War. But we must ensure that we set the rules and, having set the rules, apply them fairly and consistently so that people know what the rules are. People must know that there is no advantage to them to hop in a boat and float across the ocean, and, having arrived here, to be given the impression that somehow they will be able to stay. Notwithstanding what I have said, the Government is guilty, in my view, of giving the impression that that can happen. </PARA>
<PARA> We have alluded time after time in this place to the Government's handling of the Chinese students. Confronted with a difficult problem-obviously a difficult problem, and we had sympathy for the situation of some 20,000 Chinese students-the Government, and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in particular, almost overnight took a decision that they could all stay. The signals go out around the world to the people waiting in line to come here legitimately. The criticism, quite fairly and logically, is levelled at us that all these people have jumped the queue. We have recently taken further action to give them the impression that they will be able to stay. They are now able to attend citizenship programs, they are entitled to get jobs, and they are entitled to social security. By the end of their time here they will be very comfortable. I am sure it is going to be very difficult for us then to turn around and say `Time is up; it is time to go home', if they have not been given permission to stay at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Our concern in this whole debate, when it comes up from time to time, is to make sure that we have rules and that those rules are applied strictly, fairly and consistently. Any suggestion that is made that that situation has broken down I believe is very dangerous indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that this debate tonight on immigration should occur at a time when the whole immigration issue is high on the agenda for debate within Australia. An increasing number of people-and, I have noted, an increasingly significant number of economists-have begun to question the wisdom of Australia maintaining the levels of immigration it has sought in recent years. I think it is also significant that a number of ethnic people have also taken that stance. I do not know the answer to that question. I find it a very difficult area. But, certainly, it is at the moment a controversial subject and one which is being reviewed. It is a fact that the entrenched positions taken by people, for various reasons, are being questioned. An increasing number of Australians have begun to question the whole concept of multiculturalism because of the way that they see it has divided rather than united the Australian community, as its intention may well have been. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also a coincidence that this debate comes at a time when confidence in this Government and its Prime Minister is at an all-time low. I do not know whether the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) will come into the Parliament tonight to participate in this debate. He seems to still be the immigration Minister, and I assume he will retain that position, having apparently picked the right side today in supporting the Prime Minister. But I ask whether there is in fact any confidence in this Government. Has the Minister given the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) some advice?</PARA>

It will be interesting to see what sort of reactions are received to that program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the House that at present there is a huge number of illegal immigrants here in Australia. I do not know the figure, but the official estimates are in the order of 90,000 to 100,000. The information I have is that the number could be as high as 150,000-and that would vary, as I understand it, on any one day. But these are not people who have come in boats-at least not the sort of boats that we think about when we talk about the boat people, the sort of clapped-out boats that float across the ocean and find their way to Australia's northern shores. </PARA>
<PARA> These people who have overstayed, these 150,000 illegals or overstayers, if we like to use that word, are people who have come here on holidays-they have decided they like the place, so they have just stayed on-or they are people who have come here as students, decided that they did not like being students after all and have gone out and got themselves a job; or they are people who have come here as businessmen and they have abused the privilege that they have been given of coming here. There is an enormous number of people in that category. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Government is responsible in this particular area. In my view, the Government has shown itself to be incompetent in properly policing this particular situation. I would be interested to hear an argument that tells me that the Government is acting properly. I know that it has attempted to put a few inspectors out there to catch these overstayers, but I do not believe it is doing anything other than just plugging leaks as and when they arise. The Government, in fact, will be shown to have acted ineffectively in this particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern-and I have raised the matter with the Minister personally on one occasion and written to him on a number of occasions-is that these people, these illegals or overstayers, if we want to use that sort of euphemistic term, are taking jobs off Australians. Jobs are being taken off Australians at a time when we need to preserve jobs for Australians. If there has been no other time in the last 60 years that we have needed to preserve jobs, we need to do it now. They are taking jobs particularly in my electorate. This problem is rife in my electorate. The reason that I am so close to this particular issue is that I reckon a considerable proportion of these illegals are living and working in my electorate and taking jobs off young Australians. In my electorate, we have a youth unemployment rate of almost 30 per cent. In my electorate, we have a significant number-and my advice from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs is hundreds and perhaps thousands-of people taking jobs that ought to be going to young Australians who are leaving school. </PARA>
<PARA> These illegals-and I have also brought this matter to the Minister's attention and had some sort of perfunctory response-have obtained tax file numbers without any problem at all. There is no problem with providing the necessary identification. They get drivers' licences and credit cards and live very comfortably here. They take jobs and pay tax-or they take jobs and do not pay tax at all. At least we would think we would get some tax out of them, but we do not even get any tax out of half these people. The unfortunate side, I guess, from their point of view, is that they are probably not even being paid proper wages and they are living in substandard conditions. There are a number of unscrupulous employers-and I am even-handed about this and critical of the ones that employ them-who are prepared to take advantage of these illegal immigrants and to employ them at below award rates. I believe that in these times of record high unemployment every effort must be made to ensure that illegal immigrants do not work here. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this is a matter in which we all have a role to play. I have suggested to the Government that it should contemplate a public relations thrust to make all employers aware that they have a responsibility to their country-because that is what it really boils down to-to ensure that they employ only Australian citizens or those who are legally entitled to work here. It is really only a simple matter of employers being able to recognise what a visa looks like. If a person's visa says `No work' in big capital letters, of course he or she ought not to get a job because that person is not entitled to work here. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in my mind, as the honourable member for Dundas has said, that refugees are a legitimate cause for immigration. As I have said, we have taken more than our share and I believe we ought to continue to do that. In fact, it ought to be said that we as a country have had the highest immigration programs traditionally in the world. If we take 1988, we had a figure then of 8.7 per thousand compared to the United States with only 2.1 per thousand. So we have maintained at least in recent years the highest immigration program per capita in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> We support a sympathetic and humanitarian approach to the refugee issue. We certainly agree that it is not as simple as pushing the boats when they land in the north offshore and hoping they will go somewhere else. However, the point that I am making, and I think the point that the honourable member for Calwell fails to grasp, is that in the handling of this problem justice must be done and must be seen to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> We have talked tonight about the whole issue of the so-called unprocessed persons. In a sense, it is pathetic that we have this problem, but we do, and by and large we believe that these persons need to be approached sympathetically and humanely and given the opportunity to prove their bona fides at that time. We do not see it as an option in any sense to push them back. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If it is not clear to the Minister, I will try to make it a bit clearer. We believe that these people can be processed humanely, as long as we do not give the message that the Minister and his Government seem to want to give. We think that message is the wrong message; that is, that in some sense people are being encouraged to arrive here in the hope that we will give them some extra special treatment or some special privileges that the people over there, who are lining up and going through the proper procedures to get here, are not receiving. That is the difference. There is a great concern in the community as to whether there are continuing long term economic benefits for Australia in maintaining a high immigration program. As I have said, many people are questioning that, although I am not entirely convinced one way or the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, we need to make sure that the people who do the right thing and get on the end of the queue are the ones who are granted entry. That is why we cannot be sympathetic to illegal immigrants, no matter how worthy their cases or causes appear to be. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, an English woman in my electorate gave herself up as an illegal immigrant. In many ways, I suppose, she had been a fairly good citizen during the time she had been here. She had been in Australia for nine years, for the last six of which she had no visa. When she owned up to the fact-she had a guilty conscience-the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs terminated her bank job and ordered her deportation. Some people in the community came forward to defend her position. They pointed out what a good person she was and so on, but at that time, in my view, there could be no objective justification for allowing her to remain here. </PARA>
<PARA> As it turned out, the real argument boiled down to the fact that she was British. There were some interesting contrasts being made at the time with the handling of some other, non-British people. The suggestion was made that if she had been Vietnamese, Chinese or Cambodian-to put it in the current terminology-the treatment she received would have been different. I remind the Minister and the honourable member for Calwell that it is important that policy be applied fairly and consistently if it is to have any credibility. </PARA>
<PARA> In my last minute I will talk about a couple of other programs. I have raised these matters with the Minister. If he wants to take them up with me again, I would be happy to do so because I have written to him about them. The business migration program is shown to be deficient; it is being rorted. </PARA>
<PARA> In another recent case, once again in my electorate, a person came to Australia under the business migration program. It was subsequently found that he had been gaoled for seven years in Japan on criminal charges and that he had been refused entry to the United States. When he was found here, he left. He was going to be deported, but I think he decided to leave. He quit while he was ahead. In my view, this is just the tip of the iceberg of the problems with this particular program. I do not think the Minister can deny that there have been numerous rorts in association with that program. </PARA>
<PARA> I also have concerns about the working holiday program. The Minister is satisfied that it is working well. Let me tell him again that it is not. </PARA>

<PARA> There is no doubt that postwar immigrants have made an enormous contribution to the development of this country, but those were different times-they were times of economic growth and expansion. A high immigration policy now may not be as appropriate as it was in 1950. As I said, I am an agnostic in that particular area. We have attempted to be bipartisan--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On rising to speak on this Migration Amendment Bill, I can honestly say to the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) that, if he reads the Bill and the amendments that are going to be made, he might understand and appreciate that a lot of the tautology we have heard in the previous 20 minutes really has nothing to do with the amendments before the House. In the closing stages of his speech he commented on business migration without acknowledging the proposals the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) has already put forward for investigation and review, and without even acknowledging the very detailed investigation by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into what is happening in that field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is extraordinary for an honourable member to get up and speak on a Bill that is before the House without understanding or appreciating it and with very little knowledge of what it is about. He then had the audacity to criticise the previous speaker, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who was completely misrepresented by the honourable member when he remarked about refugees. I would have that corrected in the Hansard records. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Government for taking this action because it improves not only the efficiency of migration legislation but also the efficiency of the processing procedure for people who wish to travel to, enter or leave Australia. The Migration Amendment Bill will enable the Government to better handle the `boat people', to whom the previous speaker, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), and the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) referred, while their applications are being processed, in that these migrants will have a status. As the law now stands, boat people are legally deemed as not being present in Australia, yet the Government houses them, clothes them and feeds them. This Bill will give the boat people `legal status', during the proper processing of their applications. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is a small but important part of the overall reforms that the Government has made regarding immigration policy. These reforms have tightened up loopholes in the legislation and produced a fairer system of immigration for all. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been especially interested in the effects that this legislation will have on the processing of illegal and unexpected immigrants, such as our boat people. I believe it is of great importance to Australia for immigration officials to be able to process these illegal immigrants in an orderly, efficient and speedy manner. The honourable member for Dundas implied that the hold-up of the applications being processed was the Government's fault. We all know what has occurred since those people unfortunately arrived uninvited and illegally into this country almost 18 months ago, others as recently as three or four months ago. In fact, some of the applications have not even been presented to this day. Again, I say to the members of the Opposition that when they speak about those things they should have the facts and report them correctly. </PARA>
<PARA> I have the utmost sympathy for many immigrants who face lifestyles in countries much harder than ours. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that these people are illegally in Australia and may very well have been unable to migrate to this country if they had followed the correct procedure, like the vast majority of immigrants. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem that many legally processed would-be migrants face is that due to the sheer number of applications for immigration into Australia, coupled with the problems of processing illegal immigrants' applications, there is a very lengthy wait, often up to two years, for applications to be processed. Illegals, and boat people, do not help the situation. If anything, they hinder the opportunities of legal immigrants to come to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Sponsors of the migrant families see that many of the boat people are allowed to stay in Australia and begin to wonder whether the way to get their relatives out here is for them to jump aboard a boat. Clearly, this attitude does nothing to support any immigration debate. </PARA>
<PARA> We have become accustomed to people fleeing from one country or another, but what is of concern as far as the boat people are concerned is that this situation never seems to change. There will always be people trying illegally to enter a country seeking a better life. </PARA>
<PARA> Refugees throughout the centuries have been an unfortunate result of most wars, political upheavals, persecution, floods and famine. But no century can equal the twentieth century for the huge wave of people displaced from their place of birth and forced to live in refugee environments. There are an estimated 14 million refugees all over the world, and millions more who are not strictly classified as refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees but who are in great need of humanitarian assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's main involvement with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has been as a country willing to accept refugees. Unfortunately, as the numbers and the diversity of refugees increase, the traditional immigrant receiving countries, such as America, Canada and Australia, are showing signs of compassionate fatigue-a term coined to explain the increasing reluctance of these countries to continue to take large numbers of refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the 40 years since the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was established, refugee situations have proliferated throughout the world. Australia has responded to this by accepting more than 420,000 refugees during that time. Australia's official refugee policy is that it accepts refugees because of an humanitarian commitment to assist in relieving the plight of the people who have no country to which they may return in safety. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia now is under increasing pressure as the number of refugees continues to expand with the development of more crises internationally-crises such as the developments we have just experienced in eastern European and the Kurdish situation in the Middle East. One of this Government's more recent changes to the migration regulations has been that by which the grant of protection through refugee status or on humanitarian grounds does not now lead to a resident status under the Migration Act but leads to the grant of a four-year temporary entry permit subject to review. </PARA>
<PARA> Having one of the highest populations of people of ethnic backgrounds living in my electorate, more than 15 immigration cases a week come through my office, often after applications have been unsuccessful and often with heartbreaking stories of attempts to get families into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most heart wrenching legal cases came from Vietnam recently and involved a woman who has been trying to get her husband and two children out to Australia since 1986. The woman was separated from the rest of her family five years ago in a refugee camp and was brought to Australia, without her family, under an official refugee program. Since that time, much of her life in Australia has been spent in social isolation. She has experienced difficulties in learning a new language and has found the opportunities to find work and learn new skills very limited. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, her family's application has been rejected because she is unable to sponsor its members as she is now on unemployment benefits. Without the support of her family unit, she is cut off from family interaction and consequently does not have any person close to her who would undertake to sponsor her family for her. It is frustrating for this Vietnamese woman, who is trying to do the right thing by Australia; she has legally but unsuccessfully applied for her family to come to this country and yet now she sees other people from her own country arriving as boat people and endeavouring to obtain refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA> I must make it clear again that, although I am sensitive towards these refugees and their situations, in Australia we have rules and regulations which must be adhered to. Boat people leave their own countries illegally and arrive here illegally. This country has been built on migrants, but not on illegal migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> There are now well in excess of 90,000 illegal migrants within Australia. Australia itself cannot simply open its gates to all of those who wish to enter either temporarily or permanently. This Government is obliged to the Australian people to consider the domestic labour market, public health and safety and the economy's capacity to provide for the needs of the population. (Quorum formed) I appreciate very much the coalition, in opposition, calling continual quorums on me, as they do. At least I then have the advantage of my colleagues coming in here to listen to the remainder of my speech. I know full well that they are glued to the television sets in their own rooms, aware of what is going on. This is probably about the ninth quorum that has been called on me this year. If people consider that I am standing up in the House with a slight chip on the shoulder, they will not mind in future if I get up and look around me so that I can remove this chip. </PARA>
<PARA> The Migration Amendment Bill, which we are debating now in this House, is a most important piece of legislation. I would like to bring to the attention of the Opposition that, following the Second World War, Australia accepted 170,000 displaced persons from the refugee camps of Europe. This was a very quick and a very positive action. Throughout the 1960s and the 1970s refugees from all over the world were given asylum in this country-refugees from Hungary, from Czechoslovakia, from Chile and other parts of Central and South America, and Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> The immigration of the Indo-Chinese people who have settled in Australia since the end of the Vietnamese conflict has been controversial largely because of the way in which many of them arrived-that is, by boat-and also because they seem to have just kept coming. The arrival of the boat people has also been resented by many because of the cost to Australia in holding them here-whether it be the cost of feeding, clothing or housing them-while their applications for refugee status are processed. My previous example represents one occasion when people in my electorate have legally processed applications for this country and have endeavoured to have their families join them without success. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs took over the full cost responsibility for illegal migrant detention centres at the beginning of 1989-90. Some interesting figures have come out of that. Nationwide, in 1990 1,497 people were admitted to those centres and their average length of stay was 15.5 days. The Villawood centre, on the periphery of my electorate, admitted 801 persons, whose average stay was some 16 days. Maribyrnong admitted 489, with an average stay of 19.6 days and the Perth centre admitted 207 persons, with an average stay of 4.1 days. The average cost is $320 per person per day. Those are 1990 figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Illegal immigrants are certainly an expensive burden for Australia to carry. The legislation within this Bill will speed up the processing of refugee applications for those who are being held in illegal immigrant detention centres and therefore decrease the financial burden illegal immigrants place on Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1991-92 immigration program will serve Australia well and will continue to meet the Government's objective of achieving a balanced intake of settlers from the family, skilled, refugee, humanitarian and special assistance streams. The balance achieved over the past two years will be maintained, with some increased emphasis on our humanitarian response and the new special assistance category, which I believe will greatly increase the flexibility of our overseas resettlement programs. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs are certainly on the right track with their immigration policies and legislation. I believe this Bill continues in the direction that this Government has followed. I commend it to the House, and I hope that other speakers in supporting it will acknowledge the work that is being done to assist not only those people who at the moment have a right to legally enter this country but also those who have certainly been given every opportunity to have their applications processed in a most humane and sensitive manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The media, in carrying on about what happened to the Khmer-Cambodian people, conveyed a lot of misinformation. I appeal to those people who are aware of the situation, and particularly to our media which broadcast that story throughout Australia, to at least have factual information before them. If they do not have the factual information, they should at least take the time to speak to the people concerned. Most of those people who demonstrated recently reside within the boundaries of my electorate. I can assure this House that I am well aware of the circumstances that arose. Certainly what we have read is quite different from the facts that were presented at the particular time. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in an interjection on the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), a lot of the process and certainly a lot of the loss of time has been to do with the lawyers and the processing of the applications of these people in their assessment for refugee status. Today a lot of them have still not had an opportunity to put their applications forward because their legal people have prevented it. </PARA>
<PARA> We must have laws that regulate or certainly control the entry of people into this country. Most particularly, those laws must be enforced in a humane way and with compassion and integrity. I have full confidence in the people in the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs who will apply the provisions of this Bill. I commend the Minister for the highly skilled departmental staff that he has. I certainly commend them for the way in which they carry out what must be a very trying exercise when they have to reject or say to a person, `You may have the right to a review'. It is not an easy task, but it is a task for which they have been well trained. I commend them, and I commend the Bill before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) in speaking to this Migration Amendment Bill has canvassed the coalition position. I will speak to one part of the Bill, namely, that which concerns unprocessed persons and the processing areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia has a proud record of compassion in accepting refugees. I remind the House that people such as boat people, who come to Australia without the correct documentation, are granted temporary entry permits and may apply for recognition as refugees and on that basis seek permanent residence. Refugee status is determined in accordance with the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> A refugee is defined by international law as a person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to return to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Refugee status is considered by the Committee for the Determination of Refugee Status, which makes recommendations to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), who has the final responsibility for the grant of refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA> Since World War II more than 430,000 refugees and displaced people have settled in Australia from Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Central and South America and Africa. Among them have been 170,000 people from Europe, including 63,000 from Poland, 34,000 from Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, 23,000 from Yugoslavia, 14,000 Hungarians, 5,000-plus Czechoslovakians, 13,000 White Russians, over 100,000 Indo-Chinese and 22,000 east Europeans. Other groups accepted included 18,000 Lebanese, 2,000 others from the Middle East, 6,000 Timorese, 4,800 Soviet Jews, 2,800 Latin Americans and 250 Africans. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989-90 refugees and special humanitarian program arrivals-which is the special humanitarian program that covers persons whether in their own country or outside of it who are ineligible for refugee status but who are suffering or have a well-founded fear of persecution-totalled nearly 12,000 people, compared with 10,000 arrivals in 1988-89. The principal source countries for refugee and special humanitarian program arrivals in 1989-90 were Vietnam, 5,600; El Salvador, 1,800; the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 1,000; and the Lebanon, nearly 500. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the Minister that it is important that boat people and similar people are treated with sensitivity. We are told by the explanatory memorandum to this Bill that the Bill introduces a new regime for the immigration processing of persons who arrive in Australia who it is not practicable or convenient to process for immigration purposes at the point of arrival because of difficulties associated with the place or timing of their arrival. This new regime enables their orderly processing, including the capacity for the speedy assessment of and reaction to any medical conditions which they may have. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told it is a response to the increasing frequency of undocumented and `unexpected' arrivals and brings more convenience and practicality to the processing of such arrivals both at busy airports and at remote locations. It also enables processing outside the strict custodial situation of sections 88 and 89 of the Migration Act 1958 and, to this end, persons who are held in section 88 or 89 custody may also be taken from that custody and brought within the scope of the new processing scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> As an active member of Amnesty International, I am concerned for the well-being of refugees. I recognise the need for time in the processing of unexpected arrivals, for the orderly process and for the practicality of holding and investigating such arrivals. However, I must say, as a migrant myself-who, I might add, waited his turn to come into this country-that I am concerned at the lack of detail in the Bill. I am concerned at the apparent intent to ease up on controls for those who seek to come here illegally. The Bill itself merely defines a processing area in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>54a. The Minister may, by notice published in the Gazette, nominate areas to which unprocessed persons may be taken for the purposes of section 54b. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister: where are they to be located? How many people are we talking about? What conditions of restraint will apply? How long will people be held there? Why is no time limit being stated on the decision making process?</PARA>
<PARA> My concerns are really whether we hold people for lengthy periods, whether there are births in camps, whether they are near cities when perhaps there is the likelihood of escape, and, given the current Government's inability to deal with the 90,000-odd illegals who are loose in Australia, whether there is sufficient control. I see this whole process as loosening the strings and increasing the general problem we have. Queue jumpers will be tempted to try this method of entry. Genuine people who go through the proper process will be disadvantaged both by the people queue-jumping and by the fact that the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs will divert its resources into this area rather than handling the normal processing. I must admit I also have a bad dream about mass refugee pens, which very much conjure up visions of Hong Kong. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that the Bill is well motivated but I regret that it lacks the detail to allay my fears. It has the potential for encouraging many illegals who cannot gain entry by fair means. It could disadvantage genuine migrants who play the game. It will devour resources from the Department of Immigration. It could lead to the Hong Kong type of refugee camp nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill really sends the wrong message to the rest of the world. The Government should be deciding on these cases expeditiously but firmly. It should be sending a message of discouragement, if you like, and genuine migrants should be getting much more attention. I fear that all this Bill will do is introduce a new class of arrival on our shores-not unprocessed persons, but pseudo refugees using this legislation when they cannot get here legally by other means. </PARA>

In fact, quite a contrary position has been achieved. I pay credit to the officers in this section of the Department, who have applied themselves in an excellent way to what is a very difficult and delicate area of activity, that is, finding and processing illegals, and having to be quite careful about how that process is carried out. I place on record my congratulations to them for the way in which they have gone about their duties. So tomorrow honourable members will hear some good news about illegals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Government announced the staffing increase in the compliance section of the Department, people such as the honourable member hoo-ha'd the Government and made all sorts of predictions about how the numbers would continue to grow. They have not, and that is because of the illegals campaign we have waged in the past six months. I am sure that the shadow Minister will at least nod his head in agreement, because that is about all he could do at this stage. We have constantly raised this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not a very popular issue sometimes because every illegal who wants to stay here thinks he ought to be entitled to. I am saying that they all ought to pack up. In fact, if they liked, from time to time I could arrange someone to help them pack so they could leave and come back the right way. That is just one point about which honourable members opposite rambled on concerning our lax procedures, et cetera. We have applied resources and an announcement is due which will show that the score is on the board. We will maintain our efforts and continue to see that number fall. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other points were made, one with respect to the Cambodians. A long bow was drawn about the Cambodians and those from the People's Republic of China (PRC) who were allowed to stay here as a result of their being in Australia on 20 June-Tiananmen Square time. We have been through this debate concerning the PRC nationals about three times. I will not go over old ground, apart from saying that that announcement was made and it will be honoured. What I do find mystifying is that the shadow Minister continues to create uncertainty in the minds of these people and, I think unintentionally, adds to the confusion that has been generated amongst those PRC nationals who arrived here after 20 June. That is a bit of a problem, but I do not say that it is done intentionally. The commitment made by the Government will be honoured, and we will deal with anyone else who puts forward an application for refugee status, change of status or whatever in the proper way. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite cannot have it both ways. One minute they are asking us to be tough, then they suggest that we are too tough, and the next minute they criticise the way in which we handled the Cambodian vote. There is a whole series of contradictions. If they read the three speeches from the Opposition side, if they have nothing else to do tomorrow, they will see a fair degree of contradiction between the three speeches and even within them. I stand by the decision to move the Cambodians from Sydney to Darwin. About a week ago I went out to a meeting which a large number of the Cambodian community attended and I also met with the leadership of the Cambodian community in that area and the support groups and I spelt out the processes to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it extraordinary that people who have been in the process for, I think, 15 or 18 months, as I remember, are claiming that they did not understand the process. That is extraordinary when towards the latter half of last year I was approached by the support group, the Jesuit refugee group and the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales, who asked me whether the cases of these people could be re-examined by the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales just to make sure they were all in order. In a sense of fair play, if there was this degree of doubt by the Jesuit refugee organisation and the support groups, I thought it proper to agree to the request. That took another seven months. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very difficult and delicate matter. First, I want to be sure that every person claiming to be a refugee is given a fair shake. If a person goes through the process and is not proven to be a refugee in terms of the criteria laid down, certain things will flow from that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And they will. The point is that we are playing around here with human lives, as if it were some sort of game. It is not a game. Our task is to ensure that everybody gets fair treatment. So when we received this request from the Cambodians, we agreed to that degree of re-examination by the Legal Aid Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think anybody can be critical of that decision. I did not like how long it took and I am sure the Cambodians did not like how long it took, but that is the time it took. There was nothing I could do about it, other than to interfere in the process. For me to interfere in the process would have meant some form of challenge by somebody-presumably a lawyer-suggesting that I had interfered and therefore had jeopardised their rights. The shadow Minister's point that some time should be allowed for these processes to be put in place is a valid point and is being looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that a lot of comments were made by people about the status of these folk. Honourable members will recall a lot of comments coming out of Darwin when I attempted to move people into a central position-all together in the one centre. Port Hedland was mentioned. I was threatened with Federal Court action. I was accused of moving all these people against their will. Suggestions were made that it would be dreadful to deny them the offers of legal help that were being made by people in Darwin. In Darwin, I agreed to allow the 26 or 27 lawyers to handle the cases there. I said, `All right, I will not move these people because I do not want to go the Federal Court; I want to get on with the job of processing'. Twelve months later I had to move eight of them to Sydney because the good old lawyers had yet to interview eight or nine of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member can shake his head and laugh and say that it is a tough job. It is damned tough for these people. We have the Chief Minister, church leaders, land councils, local government people and all these other support organisations saying, `Don't you dare move these people or we'll lie in front of the buses'. What did I do? I agreed to their requests, yet 12 months later eight or nine Cambodians are still to be even interviewed by a lawyer. I agree that something has to be done about the length of time this processing takes. I hope to be able to negotiate that with the Opposition and with the interested parties-that is, the Refugee Council of Australia and other respected bodies that I am sure the shadow Minister also respects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the people I moved from Sydney to Darwin the other day, as I said in the House, I have an obligation when these people are given a decision-bearing in mind they have not legally entered the country-to ensure that they do not move into the broader community at this point. The only secure facility available to us at that time was in Darwin. I talked to the people. I suggest that some of the people who have been stirring this up-I repeat, stirring this up-ought to do the right thing by the Cambodian people. If there were a lot less stirring and a lot more honesty, there would be a lot less heartbreak and worry by people connected with the Cambodian community. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody has been deported. The Cambodian people are entering into a period where they are able to seek a review of the decision. They have 28 days. I resent some of the more outrageous things that have been said about myself, departmental officers and the system that has been applied here. Nowhere else in the world would we get a fairer, more detailed system than that which we have operating here. Some of these more outrageous statements by people who, in some cases, live a long way away from the centre in Sydney where the people were moved from-and therefore, I suggest, have little knowledge of the background-would do well to be less emotive and sensational and stick basically to the facts. I think they would do the Cambodians a lot more good. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cambodian community, which speakers on the other side talked about, will be given a fair go. I will see that they get a fair go. The system will be maintained. The system is fair; everybody will get a fair go. I will not be bullied by people stirring up communities and turning up at demonstrations. I have told the community that I will not defer from the laid-down process. I repeat: some people have done a great injustice to the Cambodian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank those members of the Government and the Opposition who took part in the drafting of the Bill. We are attempting to do a range of things to make things easier and better and to improve the system. I note the comments of the shadow Minister in relation to the consultations that he and I had. I would hope to be able to continue that sort of cooperation with the shadow Minister in regard to legislation that I bring in here. We will not always be able to agree; I think that is understood. Briefings by the Department to keep him abreast of what we do is a proper way to proceed. I would like to see that continue. I look forward to him continuing to cooperate in the way in which he has. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of benefit to me, as I have said before, to have in place the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations, of which members of the Opposition, including the shadow Minister, are members. From a point of view of policy that comes into the Parliament, that is proving to be an excellent process. Sometimes it is somewhat frustrating for me-I am sure the shadow Minister knows what I am referring to-and for the Committee. The workload that it has is immense and covers a number of issues. Sometimes I might get a bit frustrated over the speed with which things get to me, but it is conducting public inquiries and hearings. From time to time it is confronted with more submissions and information than it thought it would have to handle when it began to look into some particular issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) as Chairman and the honourable member for Dundas as Deputy Chairman, the Committee has been a great help to me. I repeat: I will continue to cooperate with the shadow Minister whenever I can. Like him, I reserve the right to disagree with the Committee, as I reserve the right to disagree with the Opposition. I will conclude on that point because we need to move to the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA>(7) Clause 19, page 12, omit the clause. </PARA>
<PARA>I address my remarks to the additional amendments to the original proposal, circulated in my name. I repeat my thanks to the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), for the cooperation and dialogue that we have had in regard to these amendments. He will address two amendments that he has circulated in his name, to which, unfortunately, I cannot agree at this point. I understand that the Opposition is embracing amendments (1) to (7). </PARA>
<PARA> It is important for the Committee to take on board the fact that there was some dialogue among the shadow Minister, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and myself on this issue. It is very important that immigration, where possible-because it concerns people-is dealt with in a bipartisan way. Whilst there are two amendments coming forward from the Opposition, I have explained by way of letter to the shadow spokesman that we cannot agree to those proposals at this point. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments, which are explained in the explanatory memorandum, are quite procedural in nature and are agreed to by the Opposition. I gather they are also agreed to by honourable members on this side of the chamber because they have not rushed in here to disagree with them. I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that this Bill and the amendments to it will come into effect by proclamation rather than by royal assent. That is important because it allows the Department time to address machinery matters within the running of government. Because of time constraints and the degree of urgency for the shadow Minister to have some of the five minutes allowed him, I will sit down and let him formally move his two amendments and talk to them briefly. However, as he knows at this point, the Opposition amendments are not agreed to by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA>(1) Clause 20, page 12, lines 14 and 15, omit ``28 days'', substitute ``21 days''. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) Clause 20, page 12, line 17, omit ``70 days'', substitute ``50 days''. </PARA>
<PARA>(3) Clause 21, page 12, line 38, omit ``28 days'', substitute ``21 days''. </PARA>
<PARA>(4) Clause 21, page 12, line 39, omit ``70 days'', substitute ``50 days''. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking briefly to these amendments, I will reiterate what I said when I spoke during the second reading debate. These amendments are to substitute 28 days, where that appears, with 21 days, and 70 days, where it appears, with 50 days. </PARA>
<PARA> It may seem somewhat obscure, but the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there are two stages for the appeal process-a first tier review and a second tier review. Under the regulations as they previously applied, the Government had periods of 70 days and 28 days for both stages of that process in which people could lodge their appeals-28 days if they were in Australia or 70 days if they were outside Australia-and they had review rights. Effectively the Government has now extended that period to both stages of the process. That will increase the periods from 28 days to 56 days and 70 days to 140 days. The Opposition's view is that those periods ought to be reduced. The effect of the amendments is to reduce them to 100 days, if people are overseas, and 42 days if they are onshore. Those periods, in keeping with the original scheme put forward by Senator Ray, seem very reasonable to the Opposition. That is why I press the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to matters canvassed by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), I appreciate him giving me information about legislation and briefing me on it. I undertake to ensure that the Minister is advised of matters which the Opposition is looking to amend to see where agreement can be reached. If we are going to talk about nationals of the People's Republic of China (PRC), it is important that the Minister lets me know where any of my comments might mislead people into believing they are able to stay. </PARA>

<PARA> That regulations 17, 19, 28 and 31 of the Migration Regulations (Amendment), contained in Statutory Rules 1991, No. 60, made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the disallowance motion is not to disallow the whole of the regulations made on 10 April 1991-in effect, most of those were of a technical character and give effect to changes foreshadowed by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) in recent statements, including the tightening of procedures for the entry of spouses and de facto spouses of Australian residents and the validation and use of profiles for assessing bona fides of entrants, particularly visitors, the use of which had been challenged by immigration tribunals-but rather to disallow those provisions which will allow for entry of homosexual partners of Australian citizens or permanent residents. It was somewhat difficult to discover these provisions in the regulations. The provisions that we are looking at were described, I think somewhat euphemistically, in the explanatory memorandum in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>To provide for the grant of permanent residence to a person (and the dependent children of such a person) who has established a genuine and continuing non-familial interdependent relationship with an Australian citizen or permanent resident. </PARA>
<PARA>Those regulations, which have been made and which we are seeking to disallow, give effect to provisions for entry for people who are described as being in a continuing, non-familial, interdependent relationship and essentially deal with non-family members who are in an association, in an interdependent relationship, with an Australian citizen or permanent resident. </PARA>
<PARA> One can only assume that it is on the basis outlined in the regulations themselves that people will be allowed to obtain entry: that is, the person must be sponsored by an Australian citizen or permanent resident; the person cannot be a member of a family unit or another relative of the applicant; and the person must indicate that, with a person of the same sex, they are in fact residing together, closely interdependent, and having a continuing commitment to mutual, emotional and financial support. They must satisfy the Minister that the relationship is genuine, that it has existed for a period of at least six months and that it will continue. Essentially, those are the criteria that have to be satisfied. It in fact involves very new principles on which the Government of this country has now embarked. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make clear on behalf of the Opposition a number of points at first. This issue deals with the migration of homosexual partners, and the Opposition's approach to homosexual migration has been, and remains, that no applicant for immigration under any of the available categories for entry now in place should be discriminated against because of his or her sexual preference. Our concern is, rather, that there should not be specific provisions in which people are advantaged and able to access migrant entry purely on the basis of their homosexuality. That is in fact what is being sought. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Opposition have recognised in the past that there has been consideration given to a limited number of homosexual partners being granted entry on the basis of strong and compassionate grounds where ministerial discretion has been exercised. The best explanation of the basis upon which rules have previously been administered in the past was in answer to a question by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) to the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). It is recorded in the Hansard of the House of Representatives on 11 May 1989. There, the then Minister spelt out, I think, the principles which I have asserted here tonight and which I believe ought to be maintained. If Government members believe they ought to be maintained, they would support our motion for disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> The then Minister, when dealing with that matter, was asked this question:</PARA>
<PARA>What procedures must be followed before homosexuals may enter Australia as immigrants and become Australian citizens?</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA>People are not prevented from migrating, nor from obtaining citizenship, because they are homosexual. The procedures applying to homosexuals are identical to those applying to any other applicants: that is, for migrant entry they must satisfy policy requirements for the category under which they are applying and they must meet health and character requirements; for citizenship they must meet residential and other requirements, including a good character requirement. </PARA>
<PARA>Homosexual relationships are not equated with marriages or heterosexual de facto relationships for migration purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>An Australian citizen or resident cannot sponsor a homosexual partner under the criteria relating to spouses and heterosexual de facto partners. Nor is the homosexual partner of a principal applicant eligible as the ``spouse'' of that person. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to a second question he said:</PARA>
<PARA>An individual's sexual orientation is not a relevant factor in considering an application for migrant entry and hence may not be known to my department, and is not recorded. </PARA>
<PARA>He also added:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no special program through which homosexuals may enter Australia and become citizens. However, once in Australia the homosexual partners of Australian citizens or residents may apply for a grant of resident status. </PARA>
<PARA>In answer to some specific points in relation to that, the then Minister recorded the basis on which strong and compassionate grounds under section 6a (1) (e) of the Migration Act could proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to homosexual partners who were lodging applications, he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Applications . . . lodged in Australia by homosexual partners of Australian residents and citizens who have entered Australia as visitors or temporary residents . . . Where an application for entry as a temporary resident on the basis of a relationship is lodged overseas, it is submitted to the Minister for personal consideration, compassionate entry may be accorded. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Applications for GORS on strong compassionate grounds based on a homosexual relationship have been considered personally by successive Ministers . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He also indicated that the Opposition was acquainted with the fact that such matters had been dealt with in that way. In answer to that question, he also outlined that some 265 applications had been considered and approved on that basis between September 1985 and January 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of some knowledge of members of this Parliament and the public generally that discretionary entry, on the basis of strong and compelling compassionate grounds having been established, has been used as a basis for considering cases in the past where claims have been made by homosexual partners that they might be allowed entry. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been claims put forward from time to time that the framework of law ought to be changed and there ought to be a much more rigid legal regime in place and that homosexual partners ought to be considered on such a basis. The former Minister for Local Government, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Ray, looked at this question when he brought in the new migration regulations. He sought to put in place a regulation which prescribed a visa class for homosexual entry. </PARA>
<PARA> When that particular visa class was brought forward, the matter was considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. The Joint Committee, like the present Committee, was a bipartisan one made up of members on both sides of this Parliament. I think those of us who were members of it at that time were the honourable member for Parkes and myself, but the Committee comprised six Government members, I believe, a lesser number of members of the Opposition and an Australian Democrat. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's view was reported in paragraph 3.21, where it said:</PARA>
<PARA>It's the Committee's view that the provision of specific category of visa for homosexuals does not reflect current policy or practice. The Committee argues that, although homosexuals should not be discriminated against for migrant entry, neither should they be specifically advantaged. In the past in exceptional cases where an application is based on a relationship with a strong and compelling compassionate ground, or like grounds which apply to all relationships, entry has been allowed. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Section 64u, if amended in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, would give the Minister an adequate discretion to admit those applicants who would have applied under this category. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee therefore recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA> - the homosexual visa category and the consequential definition be deleted from the draft regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Former Minister Ray took the Committee's view and took that particular regulation out. For the sake of completeness, I add that the Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . some members of the Committee are of the view that a general ``companionship'' category should be provided where a sexual relationship is not necessarily involved. The exclusivity and duration of the relationship, its closeness and mutual dependency would be relevant considerations. </PARA>
<PARA>Members who put that forward had in mind that it might apply to the proverbial two maiden aunts who had strong emotional ties. If the Government was going to put in place a broader category, their case might be one which would justify such a broader category. If that is what the Minister had in mind, he did not adopt it, because what he put in place are provisions which exclude familial relationships, so the case of the two maiden aunts, which is one that the Committee had in mind-I might say a minority of the Committee-would not have been accommodated under these new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a number of the Opposition's positions clear in relation to this matter. I have made the point a number of times now that the Opposition's view is that there should not be discrimination against people on the basis of their sexual preference, but that there should not be specific advantage for people based upon that factor, either. </PARA>
<PARA> We are aware that ministerial discretion has been exercised in the past to admit a limited number of homosexual partners on compassionate grounds. We are of the view that those arrangements should remain in place; in other words, we are not demurring in relation to the fact that that discretion has been exercised in the past. We believe it is appropriate that such claims should still be possible and, I might say, if the review regulations are drawn in such a way to deny the Minister the opportunity to exercise such discretion, it would be our view, as the Committee put forward, that an amendment should be made to ensure that section 64u is able to operate to give the Minister that discretion. When I refer to section 64u, I mean the new provisions of section 115 of the Act, which embodies that section when it was first dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Opposition does not believe that the issue of a visa on the basis of a homosexual relationship alone ought to be possible. We take the view that to treat the relationship of homosexual partners on exactly the same basis as the relationship between a husband and wife creates a precedent of considerable significance. The fact is that the new arrangement moves to do exactly that. De facto partners have to prove a mere six-month relationship in order to seek entry on the basis of that relationship. The new regulations for homosexual partners, as I read them, require a relationship of that duration. It used to be a duration of four years. The Minister reduced it to two years, and now it has to be a relationship of only six months. This is a precedent. Homosexual partners are not treated as spouses for tax purposes. They are not treated as spouses for the payment of social security benefits or other family based benefits; but if they are to be permitted migrant entry on the basis that their relationship is the equivalent of a family relationship-that is, a relationship of husband and wife-it is a precedent of very considerable moment. </PARA>
<PARA> It disadvantages numbers of other people who seek migrant entry. I do not know how many people will apply on this ground. I do not know that the Minister will be in a position to control, as he might have in the past, how many people might apply under this ground. I mentioned that there were some 265 applicants in the space of several years, but it could run into thousands over time, particularly as we have seen the propensity of people to seek to apply on fraudulent grounds as spouses or de facto partners. People might seek to establish sham homosexual relationships. That is a distinct possibility under the provisions that are now being put in place. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think it does at all; it specifically denies it. The point I am making is that if the Minister puts in place provisions that take it essentially out of his control, unless he is intending that in relation to the granting of these visas he will not delegate his responsibility to other officers, it will be essentially out of his hands; it will be in the hands of whoever exercises that delegation throughout Australia. That is a matter the Minister may care to clarify, if he is going to respond to this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make the point, finally, because time is running out, that this visa class comes into the visa class for family members. That means that every homosexual partner who will be accommodated has the potential for displacing one other family member under the concessional family migration scheme. The fact, essentially, is that we have three streams. The first relates to family migration, the second to skilled migration, and the third to refugees. They each have a number of places allocated to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The homosexual partners will fall into the family stream-60,000 this year. People who come into the preferential arrangements get their place as of right. But at the end of the day, if the total number of people for family places is going to exceed the total number allocated within the program, the program is capped. That means that every homosexual partner who obtains a place in the program, and particularly if it is demand driven, as it has the potential to be, displaces other family members who might be able to come within the concessional family reunion arrangements. They are the family members who have to be points tested. They are the brothers and sisters of Australian citizens and residents. They are the nephews and nieces of Australian citizens who can apply under the concessional family reunion arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> So what we are saying to large numbers of people who seek to access family reunion and are excluded is that the relationship involving homosexual partners is one of greater value than the familial relationships we have all known and understood. The Opposition does not seek to discriminate against homosexuals. We seek to have these provisions disallowed and to put in place the arrangements that would enable the Minister to look individually at each case and exercise discretion on the basis of his judgment, as he has in the past, as to those cases that demand, because there is a compassionate and compelling element, that entry be granted, but only on that basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Allow me, on behalf of the Government, to oppose the proposal that has been put forward by the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). Firstly, I welcome this debate because I think there is already a misinformation campaign under way. That is unfortunate, and I will attempt, by way of my comments, to allay some of the fears the shadow Minister outlined. Secondly, I hear that some Opposition members were betting that we would not proceed with this. We are proceeding with it, on the basis that we are trying to establish a fair system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to go to one particular point that deals with decisions made by the Minister, to which I think the shadow Minister was referring in his comments. The regulations do not specify that the Minister personally makes decisions as to whether or not an interdependency visa or entry permit may be granted. However, I will not delegate this power. I will therefore personally be making decisions under the interdependency category, and I will undertake to inform the Parliament if in the future such power is proposed to be delegated. I make that commitment on behalf of the Government. I hope that that allays some of the fears the shadow Minister has. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Ruddock" NAMEID="0J4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5H4">Mr HAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear the interjection and I will respond to him directly as to the practicality of that request. It should also be noted that as primary decision-maker I am bound by the rules in the regulations. It is only after the applicant has sought a review of the primary decision that I as Minister have a broader discretionary power under sections 115 and 137 of the Migration Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the health area, I want to make a couple of points that I think need to be put on record. All applicants for an interdependency visa or entry permit must be assessed under the health criteria. The safeguard that now exists in the regulation applies not only to the conditional two-year or permanent entry permit but also to those who are overseas and wish to enter Australia on a temporary basis under the interdependency visa category. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that the regulations allow for the waiver of the health criteria in certain limited situations. The waiver of the health criteria provisions, under regulation 144, however, is subject to the following conditions: that the applicant is free of tuberculosis and other communicable diseases which are a threat to public health; is free of other diseases that are a danger to members of the Australian community; and is unlikely to prejudice the access to health care of any Australian citizen or resident. Further, as Minister I am not able to exercise discretion under regulation 144 unless I am satisfied that undue harm or undue cost would be unlikely to result to the Australian community if the visa entry permit is granted. </PARA>
<PARA> I make those two points because they really go to the hub of what the shadow spokesman said and what other people have been indicating by their comments outside of this place. As the shadow spokesman has addressed the question of homosexual relationships, we need to put some facts in this area before the House. Firstly, on 25 July 1990, I wrote to the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), advising him of my intention to reinstate arrangements for the grant of permanent residence to homosexual partners on the grounds of non-familial relationship of emotional inter-dependency. No formal reply was received and the Secretary to the Committee indicated that the Committee did not wish to comment. This issue has now been placed fairly and squarely before the Parliament. Regulations, which are fair, have been put in place. We now have a proper process in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The contradiction in the shadow Minister's comments are that we oppose a process being put in place that may disadvantage others and we want to leave in place a flawed system. The presumption he makes is that the previous system that my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) put in place will continue. That previous system ceased on 19 December 1989. There is currently no process. I am putting regulations in place, retaining ministerial control over the area, as requested by the shadow spokesman, and applying a proper process. </PARA>
<PARA> I am amazed at the line being run by the Opposition. It wants me to continue the late night candle burning exercise of signing agreements for people to enter the country and to pretend it is not happening. That is the basis of the claims or requests of the shadow spokesman when he says, `We would like to return to the old way, the old system, the old flawed system'. It is flawed because it is not out in the public where it ought to be. As the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, I am not prepared to have a system which we on this side of the House pretend does not exist and somehow are ashamed of. I am not ashamed of it. I will not be party to some late night signing racket. It has to be out where people can see it and people can judge it, and where the decisions can be properly made in a proper process. </PARA>

We have this extraordinary proposition put by the shadow spokesman in which he suggests that people apply under some other section, such as that of a business migrant or an employer-nominated person, where they obviously do not meet the criteria; zingo, it goes through to the Migration Internal Review Office; and the Minister then has the power to use discretion and not be subject to the regulations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because the shadow spokesman will not accept a proper process, he, in fact, is encouraging, if we are going to go down this route, a bodgie process. Not only does he want the old bodgie system in place but he also wants to suggest, `Well, there's another way we can do it; we can do it by a bodgie process'. It is not on. The Opposition can come into this place and into the Senate and oppose this, but I will never return to the previous system. I know whose hearts on the other side are in this issue and whose are not. I know that some people on the other side agree with me, because they have told me, and I know some others do not. But I fail to see how those opposite, in all fairness to themselves and to the constituents about whom a number of honourable members opposite write to me, can want a return to the old flawed system. So this regulation is now clearly before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I address myself also to the previous Minister, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. He grappled with this issue. I note he is to speak in this debate. I was present and heard his comments in this place on the occasion of his answers to the honourable member for Parkes. In fact, I was very supportive of what the honourable member was attempting to put before the House on those occasions and of what was in the press release that he put out on 24 May 1988. But members opposite really are trying to return to something that is not possible. It is just not possible to go back to that system; nor is it right. These regulations will go forward to the Senate after tonight, because the Opposition's proposal, to put it bluntly, will be bowled over. </PARA>
<PARA> I anticipate and hope that the Bill will be passed, because this is an honourable proposal. It is an honourable proposal in the sense that it puts before the public a proper process; it gives proper access to the system; and it is not a dreadfully flawed system which both sides of the House accept but is really not accepted publicly. I think the shadow Minister interjected when I referred to that before. There are some people who just pretend that this never existed, and he knows that. I think that is wrong. It covers a much broader range of situations than the narrow emphasis that both he and, I am sure, other speakers on the other side have given it. </PARA>
<PARA> We all have had before us situations-to use his words-of a homosexual nature, which can be adequately addressed in this particular set of regulations. I regret that this matter has come before the House, although I do not run away from it. In fact, I think that probably it is time for an issue like this to be addressed in this way. But it was withdrawn on the last occasion when it was put before the Parliament. I believe that was not because the former Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, did not want to proceed with it. I think it was a matter of timing. There was a whole range of problems at that time in getting things before the Parliament, and he let it slide but knew full well-and I must add that the Department advised me very early on-that this matter had to be addressed. That was the understanding on which Senator Robert Ray did not proceed with it. </PARA>
<PARA> I did hear comments from people, `I think he'll be like Senator Robert Ray; he'll not proceed. Our notice to oppose this will frighten the Government off'. It has not frightened us off; it is going to proceed. I suspect that members on the other side will welcome this proposal when it does finally go through the Senate because, as I said, I do know that some people really support the thrust of what the Government is trying to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that we cannot go backwards to an old system or request that we go back to an old system, which I think was a dishonest system. It would be dishonest now to go back to that system with the new structure that is in place. That is something we just cannot do. Therefore, I am quite happy to have this debate; I am quite happy to see members on both sides of the chamber discussing the issue. But I suspect, like every other time, the issue will get very narrow. I find it unfortunate that the emphasis will be on one particular aspect of the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> However, if it is designed to try to frighten the Government, it will not. We will continue with it right through to the Senate. I have no difficulty with this proposal. I hope that people take notice of what we are trying to do here: that is, to bring increased integrity into this area. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment it must be remembered that from 19 December 1989 there is not an adequate way to address a range of people who would come forward unless we introduce these regulations, and that is very unfair. I have listened to what the shadow spokesman has had to say on this matter. I cannot agree with his comments. In fact, I gave him an undertaking that I would come back to him on one point, and I will. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House now has before it 45 proposed amendments to the Migration Regulations (Amendment) and, generally, the Opposition is supportive of the various changes involved. Both the Government and the Opposition obviously believe that clear guidelines need to exist in the operation of Australia's migration policy and that areas of potential abuse need to be most directly addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is no exaggeration to say that the integrity of our immigration policy is a vital element in safeguarding our national sovereignty. However, the Opposition finds it impossible to accept the proposed regulations Nos 17, 19, 28 and 31. Accordingly, my colleague, the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), has submitted a notice of motion, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> That regulations 17, 19, 28 and 31 of the Migration Regulations (Amendment) contained in Statutory Rules 1991, No. 60, made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>It is my pleasure to second the motion moved by my colleague, which I now formally do. On 30 April this year, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) announced a reduction of 15,000 persons in the overall annual migrant intake to Australia for 1991-92. This was supported by the Opposition, especially in view of Australia's current circumstances and acute recession. It is a move that I believe is also supported by public opinion throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulations which the Opposition rejects-namely, Nos 17, 19, 28 and 31-provide for the granting of permanent residence to a person who has established a continuing non-family independent relationship with an Australian citizen or a permanent resident of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> May I say, firstly, it seems curious when most areas of immigration have been cut that an exception should be made to facilitate easier migratory rules for a category of people generally regarded as outside the mainstream of traditional values espoused by the Australian electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I and, I believe, most of my colleagues value the status of marriage as superior to that of a de facto relationship, a greater concern is that the entry into Australia of homosexual partners should formally be made easier, particularly-I repeat-shortly after the ministerial statement outlining cuts to the immigration program. </PARA>
<PARA> Newspaper headlines at that time were consistent in their thrust. The Australian Financial Review had the headline on 30 April this year, `Cabinet set to trim immigration'. In the Herald-Sun of 1 May, `ACTU wins big cuts in migration' was the headline. The Melbourne Age of the same day had the headline, `Labor to cut immigration by 12,500'. Another article in the Age, this time on 9 May, had a headline, `Migrant category rejected for sake of economy'. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KD4">Mr ALDRED</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That will be forthcoming shortly. Why do we have a relaxation of rules for this special new category of migrants? The implication of the implementation of proposed regulations Nos 17, 19, 28 and 31 is to formalise a new category of migrant. Previously, where strong and compelling compassionate reasons were shown, admission was allowed at the discretion of the Minister. The Opposition reaffirms that arrangement and totally rejects a classification by which a visa entry for Australia is based on a homosexual relationship. It is the Opposition's belief that to treat a homosexual partnership on exactly the same basis as a husband-wife relationship would create a dangerous precedent, as well as run completely contrary to all prevailing community values.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As well as this, currently, while so many families are excluded entry to Australia under the family reunion scheme, a relaxed criterion involving six months or even less of cohabitation for homosexual partners cannot be justified on grounds of fairness, reasonableness and equity. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there are other dangers involved in the short term liaison period required of partners should this category of migrant become officially established. Here I refer to the disturbing numbers of scam marriages between Australian nationals and partners from other countries. One of these recent scams involved a company which operated for a number of years in Victoria, where fees up to $16,000 were being paid for marriages of convenience to enable Fijians and Indians to migrate to Australia. The sum of $4,000 went to the Australian partners, some of whom were mentally handicapped, and the rest to the Melbourne principals of this particular marriage-fixing racket. Millions of dollars were made over this period from customers applying through the company in Fiji. </PARA>
<PARA> Imagine the implications if regulations Nos 17, 19, 28 and 31 are passed by the Government-the homosexual liaison business might well be thriving in a very short time. Thrive it will, if the sham marriage racket already referred to is any guide. Not only is there the very worrying Victorian example referred to, but New South Wales has been blighted by a similarly disturbing problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that during 1990 the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs conducted a random survey of 848 marriage applications in New South Wales. Various criteria were used to measure which marriages were of a dubious nature, including the type of visa used, the spouse's background, clear and obvious differences between the couple, the gap between when they met and the marriage date, plus what was known about the marriage celebrant and, of course, that well known species, the migration agents involved. Subsequent analysis, using this criteria on the sample group, determined that 516, or 61 per cent, of the 848 selected cases were suspect. </PARA>
<PARA> One then has to wonder why Australia should welcome, or even encourage, the type of migrant covered by regulations Nos 17, 19, 28 and 31, when decent people from countries with traditional values are finding it very difficult to enter Australia as migrants. It would appear that the Hawke Labor Government cares little for tradition or sound community values. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is regrettable that the last speaker for and on behalf of the Opposition, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred), has really blurred and muddied the waters on an issue which is comparatively straightforward and simple. We are not dealing with a concept that is outside traditional values; what we are talking about is a regulation which initially involved the consideration of an applicant on the basis of their not being a member of a family unit but being a person who had a relationship with an applicant which was acknowledged by both and that involved residing together, being closely interdependent and having continuing commitment to mutual emotional and financial support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That concept can include a great variety of relationships. I dealt with a number of situations when I was Minister for immigration and I know of a number of situations currently. For example, there is an elderly woman who is blind and who has been cared for for many years by a non-Australian citizen; that relationship is not only mutually dependent but is basically a situation which would fall within the category we are discussing. </PARA>
<PARA> I share with the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock)-and, as long as I have known the honourable member, I would not say that he is unaware of traditional values-the view that people who are in homosexual relationships should have no more rights than the average citizen-but they should have no fewer rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the honourable member for Dundas, who confirms that that is his position. I had the experience of being Minister when the method used was basically that of determining the rights of people applying where there was a homosexual relationship. That did not emerge just as a matter of a Minister waking up in the middle of the night and saying, `We have to do something about homosexual relationships'; it arose on the basis of legal advice that the existence of a homosexual relationship could be a relevant factor for consideration under what was old section 6a (1) (e) of the Migration Act-that is to say, that this category of applicant had a legal right that had to be considered under the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1985 then Minister Hurford met with representatives of the gay immigration task force. He spoke to the then relevant shadow Ministers and a system was put in place where cases could be dealt with on the basis of ministerial discretion. What has occurred since then, of course, is virtually the abolition of ministerial discretion on the basis of a series of regulations which would determine the rights of all applicants for immigration. The Government has attempted, painstakingly, to produce a code, which can be subject to independent legal assessment, which confers rights upon applicants and provides a method of determining those rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The question that we are being asked to determine is simply, as the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) says, whether applicants who are basing their application on the basis of a mutually interdependent relationship do so under the old system or whether they are brought into the broad stream category of regulation, where their rights are defined, their applications can be dealt with according to law and where they have no more and no fewer rights than any other citizen. </PARA>

Unlike the honourable gentleman, as Minister for immigration I had the experience of making the decisions in these cases-and it is not a happy experience. The Minister is asked to go back to his office late at night or early in the morning and be confronted with a pile of files which can be quite substantial in which people are asked to expose the full detail of their relationships and how the situation arose, going into very great detail. One accepts some and one rejects others, but the problem is, as the honourable Minister says, that is done in secret.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would hope and pray that the decisions that I made were just and proper decisions, but sometimes at 11.30 at night one may be tired and may make a legitimate error in judgment. That may favour the applicant or it may not. But in any event, if we are a mature society, it seems to me that we should support the attempt by the Minister to say that there ought to be a regulation which governs this process, that we have to get away from the system where, in order not to offend the fantasies and the vivid imagination of some of the honourable gentlemen opposite, we go back to a system which will say, `We are pretty liberated people in the coalition; we do not have any basic problem about people applying on the basis of homosexual relationships'. Let me say quite frankly that, as Minister, I received as many applications-there may even have been a few more-forwarded by members on the other side of the House as on this side, so, whatever one says, there is certainly within the coalition people who do not share the prejudices of some of those that have spoken. </PARA>
<PARA> What is important is that those who are applicants are dealt with within the framework of due process of the law. What is the problem? If in fact, as the honourable shadow Minister says, there is not any real problem about there being a category of homosexual relationships, what is the problem about saying that there will be regulations, that those regulations will have to be complied with and that they are subject to objective public scrutiny, with all the relevant provisions that deal with that?</PARA>
<PARA> That is preferable to saying to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, who is at the table, `We do not really want to go down that track; we would really prefer you to go back to your office at 11.30 tonight'-and in the case of the present Minister perhaps open a packet of cigarettes-`sit down, wade through a pile of files and make a determination'.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr Howe</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Caries severity has traditionally been measured by the Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth (DMFT) Index. Observations for this measure are collected as part of the care of children by the School Dental Services of each State or Territory in Australia. When DMFT measures are being calculated for an age group, say 12 year olds, within a State or Territory, no weightings are required to estimate the mean score for children in the State or Territory under the care of the School Dental Service. However, when scores from all States and Territories are combined to calculate a national or Australian estimate, the scores from each State and Territory are weighted.</PARA>
<PARA> The weights are numeric in nature and reflect the proportion of the Australian child population (aged 4-13 years) resident in each State or Territory. In the preliminary estimates of caries severity presented in the answer to question (2), the same weight has been used for each of the years 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989. These weights were: NSW 0.343; VIC 0.271; QLD 0.152; SA 0.086; WA 0.090; TAS 0.030; NT 0.010 and ACT 0.018. For 1990, the nature of the weighting will be similar, however, no national weighted estimates have been compiled for 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No national figure of caries severity rates for 12 year old children has been published for the years 1986 (not for full year), 1987, 1988, 1989 or 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> The Dental Statistics and Research Unit assumed responsibility for the Child Dental Health Survey data in March 1989. It has since obtained, from the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health, the necessary data for 1986, 1987 and 1988 to calculate the national figure for the DMFT of 12 year olds. The sampling, data processing, analysis and reporting of caries severity was redesigned when the Dental Statistics and Research Unit assumed responsibility for the data collection. One State, Western Australia, delayed introduction of the new data collection methods. Data have recently become available from all States and Territories allowing calculation of the national figure for 1989. The processing and analysis of data for 1990 will not be completed until mid 1991. The figures for those years where they are available are presented below:</PARA>

<PARA> (4) Professor John Spencer is a nationally and internationally recognised oral epidemiologist and dental health services researcher. Professor Spencer has qualifications in Children's and Preventive Dentistry, Public Health and Research. It was as part of Professor Spencer's research for a Doctor of Philosophy degree that work was undertaken on prediction of rates of dental decay.</PARA>
<PARA> This work was completed in 1984, although some scientific papers arising from it appeared in 1986 and 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> Professor Spencer established a data set comprising all findings of mean caries severity of samples of Australian adolescents over the period 1965 to 1978; these included 21 studies involving surveys, clinical trials and analysis of service records of dental programs. Professor Spencer hypothesised that the age-specific DMFT scores, and in some cases scores for socio-economic groups at an individual age, could be explained by a number of predictor variables related to fluoride exposure such as proportion of lifetime exposure to water fluoridation, regular use of fluoride supplements and use of fluoride containing toothpaste. Hence, each mean DMFT score was linked in the data set to mean estimates of these fluoride predictor variables.</PARA>
<PARA> The resultant cross-sectional time series data were analysed by multiple regression procedures and the results of how predictors had behaved in the past were used to extrapolate into the future.</PARA>
<PARA> In order to estimate the caries severity in future years, Professor Spencer attempted to track patterns of exposure to the fluoride predictor variables, extrapolate their trends and apply estimates of their likely magnitude within the multiple regression model. In this way, estimates of future caries severity of Australian adolescents up to 1990 were calculated.</PARA>

<PARA> These data commence at 1979 because the last year of data used in the research was 1978.</PARA>
<PARA> The results can be seen to initially be lower, then gradually higher than caries severity obtained in the Child Dental Health Survey.</PARA>
<PARA> In Professor Spencer's report on this work in 1984, he pointed out that his predictions were built on data reflecting all children, while the Child Dental Health Survey captures data only on children under the care of the School Dental Services. Hence, although the comparison is convenient, it is not necessarily an apt comparison. Biases may exist in terms of the children who are included in the dental care program of the School Dental Services. As the School Dental Services in most States and Territories were expanding, the nature of the social mix of the children whose caries severity was captured in the Child Dental Health Survey also changed across these years.</PARA>
<PARA> In an article in the Australian Dental Journal in 1986, Professor Spencer reported that the steeper decline in the Child Dental Health Survey data between 1979 and 1983 than predicted for all Australian 12 year old children may have indicated that factors other than fluoride, not included in the predictive model, may be associated with the greater decrease observed in the Child Dental Health Survey data. It was, therefore, well recognised by Professor Spencer that ``the future national predictions presented in this study are conservative'' (Spencer Australian Dental Journal 1986; 31(4)262-7). Other factors which may have been operating across that time (and on through the intervening period) to reduce caries severity include</PARA>
<PARA> * use of professionally applied fluorides (not modelled)</PARA>
<PARA> * an increase in the use of fissure sealants in School Dental Services to prevent caries on occlusal (biting) surfaces</PARA>
<PARA> * greater targeting of School Dental Services to higher risk children, maximising the potential to effectively prevent caries, and</PARA>
<PARA> * a change in Dentistry toward a philosophy of minimum intervention, ie., when faced by uncertainty about disease presence, not intervening with restorative services.</PARA>
<PARA> In the spirit of a statement made by Professor Spencer in 1984 that ``this study will be kept under review to further validate its findings and also identify areas within the research that may be improved'' Slade, Spencer and Dooland conducted in 1989 further research on changing patterns of caries severity in South Australia. Dr Slade is the Consultant Oral Epidemiologist to the Dental Statistics and Research Unit, while Dr Dooland is Director, Statewide Dental Services, South Australian Dental Service.</PARA>
<PARA> This research is different from Professor Spencer's earlier work in three fundamental ways:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. As it was conducted in 1989, it used more recent data in order to understand changes in caries severity and predict future caries severity;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. It used only data from the School Dental Service in South Australia. It is, therefore, entirely appropriate in this case to compare the research predictions with the subsequent data available from the South Australian School Dental Service which has, in the late 1980s, provided care for a relatively constant percentage of the child population at 12 years old.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Whereas Professor Spencer's earlier work was on understanding and tracking changes in fluoride exposure which in turn determined future caries severity, this more recent research uses changes between ages and across time to predict future caries severity. Hence, it does not seek to explain why caries severity is changing; it seeks only to understand how caries severity is changing.</PARA>
<PARA> The data assembled for Slade, Spencer and Dooland's work were again a sequential time series of cross-sectional surveys covering children aged six to 12 years cared for by the South Australian School Dental Service between 1976 to 1988. Multiple regression analysis was used to estimate age, cohort and period effects within Adelaide and non-Adelaide parts of South Australia. The outcome was again a formula that could be used to predict future caries severity in each part of the State. The following table presents the comparison of Slade, Spencer and Dooland's prediction of caries severity against the results of the Child Dental Health Survey for all South Australian 12 year old children.</PARA>

<PARA> These predictions appear to be tracking closely the actual caries severity of South Australian 12 year old children. However, it should be noted that although this approach captures past changes in caries severity associated with age, cohort and period effects, it cannot anticipate fundamental changes in the antecedents of caries, or the manner in which it is observed and treated in the School Dental Services. Such changes would be bound to reduce the accuracy of the predictions.</PARA>
<PARA> A further note of caution is necessary when interpreting estimates which are based on extrapolated data. It is always the case that a single estimate for any year represents a point within a range of figures, and any other figure within that range would constitute a statistically valid prediction. In many instances, the true range of any single predicted estimate (cited above) encompasses the actual observed caries severity, or the range within which another predicted estimate would fall.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) (a) The Australian Institute of Health's Dental Statistics and Research Unit was set up in 1987 and began operating in 1988. The Dental Statistics and Research Unit is an external unit of the Australian Institute of Health, being located within the Department of Dentistry at the University of Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Its core funding comes from the Australian Institute of Health. Additional funding is obtained through competitive application for research funds and contracted research.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The role of the Dental Statistics and Research Unit is to improve the range and quality of information available on the dental workforce, oral health, use of services and dental practice in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The aims of the Dental Statistics and Research Unit are:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. To establish a national minimum data set on dental personnel and provide descriptive statistics on labourforce activity;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. To establish and maintain the national child dental health survey;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To provide information on all data available in Australia on the dental labourforce, dental practice, use of dental services and dental health status, facilitating reviews from time to time; and</PARA>
<PARA> 4. To conduct supplementary research as deemed necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> The priorities for the Unit reflect the aims. The areas of data collection, preparation, analysis and reporting on the dental labourforce and oral health status equally have highest priority, followed by supplementary research and the broader `clearing house' role on dental statistics.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The ready availability of basic planning information on the potential requirement for services is a major factor needed to improve the delivery of dental care and the dental health of Australian children. Monitoring the caries severity of Australian children and predicting future caries severity is an integral aspect of preparing information for such planning. This has become a major feature of the School Dental Services in Australia, through their evaluation and planning systems which draw upon the Child Dental Health Survey data.</PARA>
<PARA> The School Dental Services seem to have overcome three common deficiencies in the use of caries severity data for service planning. First, there is a general awareness of how such data might be used to improve the delivery of dental services within the School Dental Services. Second, the data which are collected are made accessible to the potential users, in an appropriate form, and without undue delay. Third, the skills necessary to manipulate and interpret such data are usually available within the service environment.</PARA>
<PARA> Data on dental caries severity are used to provide new insights and descriptions of what is known and what is predicted about the potential requirement for dental care for use in the planning of dental services. Improved data sources, methodology, and techniques of analysis and prediction provide a basis for better elucidation of the service delivery issues. The data also identify issues that require further study to gain a better understanding of problems, encouraging others to dispute and discuss findings. This process not only improves the information generated, but improves decision-making on the delivery of dental services.</PARA>
<PARA> Effective planning is possible only if the circumstances under which decisions on the future are made can be predicted with reasonable accuracy. This is always difficult in the long term planning of dental health services. Estimates of the size and the structure of populations may be in error, while new understanding and developments in dental care may change patterns of disease and service requirements in fundamental ways. On the other hand, the provision of key resources in the delivery of dental health care, i.e. facilities and a trained dental labourforce, are subject to substantial lead times. This paradox can only be resolved if the preparation of plans incorporates a wide range of assumptions about the future, and is an activity which is kept under continuous review as more recent information becomes available.</PARA>
